prefatory note in the metropolitan magazine where this novel originally appeared sep jan marryat prepared his readers for its reception in the following words and having now completed jacob faithful we trust to the satisfaction of our readers we will make a few remarks we commenced writing on our own profession and having completed four tales novels or whatever you may please to call them viz frank mildmay the kings own newton forster peter simple in jacob faithful we quitted the salt water for the fresh from the wherry we shall now step on shore and in our next number we shall introduce to our readers the adventures of japhet in search of his father the promise was faithfully kept and japhet with all his varied experience never went to sea there were indeed few companies on land to which he did not penetrate reared in a foundling hospital and apprenticed to a smithfield apothecary his good looks impulsive selfconfidence and unbounded talent for lying carried him with eclat through the professions of quack doctor juggler and mountebank gentleman about town tramp and quaker to emerge triumphantly at last as the only son of a wealthy angloindian general or bengal tiger as his friends preferred to call him japhets adventures of course are shared by a faithful friend and ally timothy oldmixon the sancho to his quixote originally an orphan pauper like himself composed of two qualitiesfun and affection he encounters villains lawyers kindhearted peers rooks and pigeons gipsies leaders of fashion fair maidensenough and to spare in a word marryat here makes use of wellworn material and uses it well he has constructed a tale of private adventure on the old familiar lines in which the local colouracquired from other booksis admirably laid on and the interest sustained to the end the story is well told enlivened by humour and very respectably constructed the reader will find japhet thoroughly exciting and will have no difficulty in believing that while it was running in the pages of the metropolitan an american vessel meeting an english one in the broad atlantic instead of a demand for water or supplies ran up the question to her masthead has japhet found his father yet japhet in search of a father is here reprinted with a few corrections from the first edition in vols saunders otley on page a few words enclosed in square brackets have been inserted from the magazine version as the abbreviated sentence always hitherto reproduced from the first edition is unintelligible rbj japhet in search of a father chapter i like most other children who should be my godfather is decided by mammonso precocious as to make some noise in the world and be hung a few days after i was borncut down in time and produce a scene of bloodshedmy early propensities fully developed by the choice of my profession those who may be pleased to honour these pages with a perusal will not be detained with a long introductory history of my birth parentage and education the very title implies that at this period of my memoirs i was ignorant of the two first and it will be necessary for the due development of my narrative that i allow them to remain in the same state of bliss for in the perusal of a tale as well as in the pilgrimage of life ignorance of the future may truly be considered as the greatest source of happiness the little that was known of me at this time i will however narrate as concisely and as correctly as i am able it was on thei really forget the date and must rise from my chair look for a key open a closet and then open an iron safe to hunt over a pile of papersit will detain you too longit will be sufficient to say that it was on a nightbut whether the night was dark or moonlit or rainy or foggy or cloudy or fine or starlight i really cannot tell but it is of no very great consequence well it was on a night about the hourthere again im puzzled it might have been ten or eleven or twelve or between any of these hours nay it might have been past midnight and far advancing to the morning for what i know to the contrary the reader must excuse an infant ofthere again i am at a nonplus but we will assume of some days oldif when wrapped up in flannel and in a covered basket and moreover fast asleep at the time he does not exactly observe the state of the weather and the time by the church clock i never before was aware of the great importance of dates in telling a story but it is now too late to recover these facts which have been swept away into oblivion by the broad wing of time i must therefore just tell the little i do know trusting to the readers good nature and to blanks it is as followsthat at the hourof the nightthe state of the weather being alsoi an infant of a certain agewas suspended by somebody or somebodiesat the knocker of the foundling hospital having made me fast the said somebody or somebodies rang a peal upon the bell which made the old porter start up in so great a hurry that with the back of his hand he hit his better half a blow on the nose occasioning a great suffusion of blood from that organ and a still greater pouring forth of invectives from the organ immediately below it all this having been effected by the said peal on the bell the said somebody or somebodies did incontinently take to their heels and disappear long before the old porter could pull his legs through his nether garments and obey the rude summons at last the old man swung open the gate and the basket swung across his nose he went in again for a knife and cut me down for it was cruel to hang a baby of a few days old carried me into the lodge lighted a candle and opened the basket thus did i metaphorically first come to light when he opened the basket i opened my eyes and although i did not observe it the old woman was standing at the table in very light attire sponging her nose over a basin verily a pretty babe with black eyes exclaimed the old man in a tremulous voice black eyes indeed muttered the old woman i shall have two tomorrow beautiful black eyes indeed continued the old man terrible black eyes for sartain continued the old woman as she sponged away poor thing it must be cold murmured the old porter warrant i catch my death acold muttered the wife but dear me heres a paper exclaimed the old man vinegar and brown paper echoed the old woman addressed to the governors of the hospital continued the porter apply to the dispenser of the hospital continued his wife and sealed said he get it healed said she the linen is good it must be the child of no poor people who knowssoliloquised the old man my poor nose exclaimed the old woman i must take it to the nurses and the letter i will give tomorrow said the old porter winding up his portion of this double soliloquy and tottering away with the basket and your humble servant across the courtyard there it will do now said the old wife wiping her face on a towel and regaining her bed in which she was soon joined by her husband and they finished their nap without any further interruption during that night the next morning i was reported and examined and the letter addressed to the governors was opened and read it was laconic but still as most things laconic are very much to the point this child was born in wedlockhe is to be named japhet when circumstances permit he will be reclaimed but there was a postscript by abraham newlands esq promising to pay the bearer on demand the sum of fifty pounds in plainer terms there was a bank note to that amount inclosed in the letter as in general the parties who suspend children in baskets have long before suspended cash payments or at all events forget to suspend them with the baskets my arrival created no little noise to which i added my share until i obtained a share of the breast of a young woman who like charity suckled two or three babies at one time we have preparatory schools all over the kingdom for young gentlemen from three to five years of age under ladies and from four to seven under either or both sexes as it may happen but the most preparatory of all preparatory schools is certainly the foundling hospital which takes in its pupils if they are sent from one to three days old or even hours if the parents are in such extreme anxiety about their education here it commences with their weaning when they are instructed in the mystery of devouring pap next they are taught to walkand as soon as they can walkto sit still to talkand as soon as they can talkto hold their tongues thus are they instructed and passed on from one part of the establishment to another until they finally are passed out of its gates to get on in the world with the advantages of some education and the still further advantage of having no father or mother to provide for or relatives to pester them with their necessities it was so with me i arrived at the age of fourteen and notwithstanding the promise contained in the letter it appeared that circumstances did not permit of my being reclaimed but i had a great advantage over the other inmates of the hospital the fifty pounds sent with me were not added to the funds of the establishment but generously employed for my benefit by the governors who were pleased with my conduct and thought highly of my abilities instead of being bound prentice to a cordwainer or some other mechanic by the influence of the governors added to the fifty pounds and interest as a premium i was taken by an apothecary who engaged to bring me up to the profession and now that i am out of the foundling we must not travel quite so fast the practitioner who thus took me by the hand was a mr phineas cophagus whose house was most conveniently situated for business one side of the shop looking upon smithfield market the other presenting a surface of glass to the principal street leading out of the same market it was a corner house but not in a corner on each side of the shop were two gin establishments and next to them were two publichouses and then two eatinghouses frequented by graziers butchers and drovers did the men drink so much as to quarrel in their cups who was so handy to plaister up the broken heads as mr cophagus did a fat grazier eat himself into an apoplexy how very convenient was the ready lancet of mr cophagus did a bull gore a man mr cophagus appeared with his diachylon and lint did an ox frighten a lady it was in the back parlour of mr cophagus that she was recovered from her syncope market days were a sure market to my master and if an overdriven beast knocked down others it only helped to set him on his legs our windows suffered occasionally but whether it were broken heads or broken limbs or broken windows they were well paid for every one suffered but mr phineas cophagus who never suffered a patient to escape him the shop had the usual allowance of green yellow and blue bottles and in hot weather from our vicinity we were visited by no small proportion of bluebottle flies we had a white horse in one window and a brown horse in the other to announce to the drovers that we supplied horsemedicines and we had all the patent medicines in the known world even to the allsufficient medicine for mankind of mr enouy having which i wondered on my first arrival why we troubled ourselves about any others the shop was large and at the back part there was a most capacious iron mortar with a pestle to correspond the first floor was tenanted by mr cophagus who was a bachelor the second floor was let the others were appropriated to the housekeeper and to those who formed the establishment in this wellsituated tenement mr cophagus got on swimmingly i will therefore for the present sink the shop that my master may rise in the estimation of the reader when i describe his person and his qualifications mr phineas cophagus might have been about fortyfive years of age when i first had the honour of an introduction to him in the receiving room of the foundling hospital he was of the middle height his face was thin his nose very much hooked his eyes small and peering with a goodhumoured twinkle in them his mouth large and drawn down at one corner he was stout in his body and carried a considerable protuberance before him which he was in the habit of patting with his left hand very complacently but although stout in his body his legs were mere spindles so that in his appearance he reminded you of some bird of the crane genus indeed i may say that his whole figure gave you just such an impression as an orange might do had it taken to itself a couple of pieces of tobacco pipes as vehicles of locomotion he was dressed in a black coat and waistcoat white cravat and high collar to his shirt blue cotton net pantaloons and hessian boots both fitting so tight that it appeared as if he was proud of his spindle shanks his hat was broadbrimmed and low and he carried a stout black cane with a gold top in his right hand almost always raising the gold top to his nose when he spoke just as we see doctors represented at a consultation in the caricature prints but if his figure was strange his language and manners were still more so he spoke as some birds fly in jerks intermixing his words for he never completed a whole sentence with umumand ending it with so on leaving his hearers to supply the context from the heads of his discourse almost always in motion he generally changed his position as soon as he had finished speaking walking to any other part of the room with his cane to his nose and his head cocked on one side with a selfsufficient tiptoe gait when i was ushered into his presence he was standing with two of the governors this is the lad said one of them his name is japhet japhet replied mr cophagus um scripturalshem ham umand so on boy reads very well and writes a very good hand he is a very good boy mr cophagus readwritespellgood and so on bring him uprudimentsspatulawrite labelsummd one of these daysmake a man of himand so on said this strange personage walking round and round me with his cane to his nose and scrutinising my person with his twinkling eyes i was dismissed after this examination and approval and the next day dressed in a plain suit of clothes was delivered by the porter at the shop of mr phineas cophagus who was not at home when i arrived chapter ii like all tyros i find the rudiments of learning extremely difficult and laborious but advance so rapidly than i can do without my master a tall freshcoloured but hectic looking young man stood behind the counter making up prescriptions and a dirty lad about thirteen years old was standing near with his basket to deliver the medicines to the several addresses as soon as they were ready the young man behind the counter whose name was brookes was within eighteen months of serving his time when his friends intended to establish him on his own account and this was the reason which induced mr cophagus to take me that i might learn the business and supply his place when he left mr brookes was a very quiet amiable person kind to me and the other boy who carried out the medicines and who had been taken by mr cophagus for his food and raiment the porter told mr brookes who i was and left me do you think that you will like to be an apothecary said mr brookes to me with a benevolent smile yes i do not see why i should not replied i stop a moment said the lad who was waiting with the basket lookly archly at me you havnt got through your rudimans yet hold your tongue timothy said mr brookes that you are not very fond of the rudiments as mr cophagus calls them is very clear now walk off as fast as you can with these medicines sir spring street cleaver street as before and then to john street mrs smiths do you understand to be sure i docant i read i reads all the directions and all your latin stuff into the bargainall your summen dusses horez diez cockly hairy i mean to set up for myself one of these days ill knock you down one of these days mr timothy if you stay so long as you do looking at the print shops that you may depend upon i keep up all my learning that way replied timothy walking off with his load turning his head round and laughing at me as he quitted the shop mr brookes smiled but said nothing as timothy went out in came mr cophagus heh japheti see said he putting up his cane nothing to dobadmust workumand so on mr brookesboy learn rudimentsgoodand so on hereupon mr cophagus took his cane from his nose pointed to the large iron mortar and then walked away into the back parlour mr brookes understood his master if i did not he wiped out the mortar threw in some drugs and showing me how to use the pestle left me to my work in half an hour i discovered why it was that timothy had such an objection to what mr cophagus facetiously termed the rudiments of the profession it was dreadful hard work for a boy the perspiration ran down me in streams and i could hardly lift my arms when mr cophagus passed through the shop and looked at me as i continued to thump away with the heavy iron pestle goodsaid he byandbyemdand so on i thought it was a very rough road to such preferment and i stopped to take a little breath bythebyjaphetchristian nameand so onsirnameheh mr cophagus wishes to know your other name said mr brookes interpreting i have omitted to acquaint the reader that sirnames as well as christian names are always given to the children at the foundling and in consequence of the bank note found in my basket i had been named after the celebrated personage whose signature it bore newland is my other name sir replied i newlandhehvery good nameevery body likes to see that nameand have plenty of them in his pockets tooumvery comfortableand so on replied mr cophagus leaving the shop i resumed my thumping occupation when timothy returned with his empty basket he laughed when he saw me at work well how do you like the rudimansand so onheh said he mimicking mr cophagus not overmuch replied i wiping my face that was my job before you came i have been more than a year and never have got out of those rudimans yet and i suppose i never shall mr brookes perceiving that i was tired desired me to leave off an order which i gladly obeyed and i took my seat in a corner of the shop there said timothy laying down his basket no more work for me hanty prandium is there mr brookes no tim but post prandium youll post off again dinner being ready and mr cophagus having returned he and mr brookes went into the back parlour leaving timothy and me in the shop to announce customers and i shall take this opportunity of introducing mr timothy more particularly as he will play a very conspicuous part in this narrative timothy was short in stature for his age but very strongly built he had an oval face with a very dark complexion grey eyes flashing from under their long eyelashes and eyebrows nearly meeting each other he was marked with the smallpox not so much as to disfigure him but still it was very perceptible when near to him his countenance was always lighted up with merriment there was such a happy devilmaycare expression in his face that you liked him the first minute that you were in his company and i was intimate with him immediately i say japhet said he where did you come from the foundling replied i then you have no friends or relations if i have i do not know where to find them replied i very gravely pooh dont be grave upon it i havent any either i was brought up by the parish in the workhouse i was found at the door of a gentlemans house who sent me to the overseersi was about a year old then they call me a foundling but i dont care what they call me so long as they dont call me too late for dinner father and mother whoever they were when they ran away from me didnt run away with my appetite i wonder how long master means to play with his knife and fork as for mr brookes what he eats wouldnt physic a snipe whats your other name japhet newland newlandnow you shall have mine in exchange timothy oldmixon at your service they christened me after the workhouse pump which had timothy oldmixon fecit on it and the overseers thought it as good a name to give me as any other so i was christened after the pumpmaker with some of the pump water as soon as i was big enough they employed me to pump all the water for the use of the workhouse i worked at my papa as i called the pump all day long few sons worked their father more or disliked him so much and now japhet you see from habit im pumping you youll soon pump dry then for ive very little to tell you replied i but tell me what sort of a person is our master hes just what you see him never alters hardly ever out of humour and when he is he is just as odd as ever he very often threatens me but i have never had a blow yet although mr brookes has complained once or twice but surely mr brookes is not cross no he is a very good gentleman but sometimes i carry on my rigs a little too far i must say that for as mr brookes says people may die for want of the medicines because i put down my basket to play its very true but i cant give up peg in the ring on that account but then i only get a box of the ear from mr brookes and that goes for nothing mr cophagus shakes his stick and says bad boybig stickumwont forgetnext timeand so on continued timothy laughing and it is so on to the end of the chapter by this time mr cophagus and his assistant had finished their dinner and came into the shop the former looked at me put his stick to his nose little boysalways hungryumlike good dinnerroast beefyorkshire puddingand so on and he pointed with the stick to the back parlour timothy and i understood him very well this time we went into the parlour when the housekeeper sat down with us and helped us she was a terribly cross little old woman but as honest as she was cross which is all that i shall say in her favour timothy was no favourite because he had such a good appetite and it appeared that i was not very likely to stand well in her good opinion for i also ate a great deal and every extra mouthful i took i sank in her estimation till i was nearly at the zero where timothy had long been for the same offence but mr cophagus would not allow her to stint him saying little boys must eator wont growand so on i soon found out that we were not only well fed but in every other point well treated and i was very comfortable and happy mr brookes instructed me in the art of labelling and tying up and in a very short time i was very expert and as timothy predicted the rudiments were once more handed over to him mr cophagus supplied me with good clothes but never gave me any pocketmoney and timothy and i often lamented that we had not even a halfpenny to spend before i had been many months in the shop mr brookes was able to leave when any exigence required his immediate attendance i made up the pills but he weighed out the quantities in the prescriptions if therefore any one came in for medicines i desired them to wait the return of mr brookes who would be in very soon one day when mr brookes was out and i was sitting behind the counter timothy sitting on it and swinging his legs to and fro both lamenting that we had no pocketmoney timothy said japhet ive been puzzling my brains how we can get some money and ive hit it at last let you and i turn doctors we wont send all the people away who come when mr brookes is out but well physic them ourselves i jumped at the idea and he had hardly proposed it when an old woman came in and addressing timothy said that she wanted something for her poor grandchilds sore throat i dont mix up the medicines maam replied timothy you must apply to that gentleman mr newland who is behind the counterhe understands what is good for every bodys complaints bless his handsome faceand so young too why be you a doctor sir i should hope so replied i what is it you requirea lotion or an embrocation i dont understand those hard words but i want some doctors stuff very well my good woman i know what is proper replied i assuming an important air here timothy wash out this vial very clean yes sir replied timothy very respectfully i took one of the measures and putting in a little green a little blue and a little white liquid from the medicine bottles generally used by mr brookes filled it up with water poured the mixture into the vial corked and labelled it haustus statim sumendus and handed it over the counter to the old woman is the poor child to take it or is it to rub outside inquired the old woman the directions are on the labelbut you dont read latin deary me no latin and do you understand latin what a nice clever boy i should not be a good doctor if i did not replied i on second thoughts i considered it advisable and safer that the application should be external so i translated the label to herhaustus rub it instatim on the throatsumendus with the palm of the hand deary me and does it mean all that how much have i to pay sir embrocation is a very dear medicine my good woman it ought to be eighteenpence but as you are a poor woman i shall only charge you ninepence im sure i thank you kindly replied the old woman putting down the money and wishing me a good morning as she left the shop bravo cried timothy rubbing his hands its halves japhet is it not yes i replied but first we must be honest and not cheat mr cophagus the vial is sold you know for one penny and i suppose the stuff i have taken is not worth a penny more now if we put aside twopence for mr cophagus we dont cheat him or steal his property the other sevenpence is of course our ownbeing the profits of the profession but how shall we account for receiving the twopence said timothy selling two vials instead of one they are never reckoned you know that will do capitally cried timothy and now for halves but this could not be managed until timothy had run out and changed the sixpence we then each had our threepence halfpenny and for once in our lives could say that we had money in our pockets chapter iii i perform a wonderful cure upon st john longs principle having little or no principle of my owni begin to puzzle my head with a problem of all others most difficult to solve the success of our first attempt encouraged us to proceed but afraid that i might do some mischief i asked of mr brookes the nature and qualities of the various medicines as he was mixing the prescriptions that i might avoid taking any of those which were poisonous mr brookes pleased with my continual inquiries gave me all the information i could desire and thus i gained not only a great deal of information but also a great deal of credit with mr cophagus to whom mr brookes had made known my diligence and thirst for knowledge goodvery good said mr cophagus fine boylearns his businessmd one of these daysride in his coachum and so on nevertheless at my second attempt i made an awkward mistake which very nearly led to detection an irish labourer more than half tipsy came in one evening and asked whether we had such a thing as was called a poor mans plaister by the powers it will be a poor mans plaister when it belongs to me but they tell me that it is a sure and sartain cure for the thumbago as they call it which ive at the small of my back and which is a hinder to my mounting up the ladder so as its saturday night and ive just got the money ill buy the plaister first and then try what a little whiskey inside will do the devils in it if it wont be driven out of me between the two we had not that plaister in the shop but we had blister plaister and timothy handing one to me i proffered it to him and what may you be after asking for this same inquired he the blister plaisters were sold at a shilling each when spread on paper so i asked him eighteenpence that we might pocket the extra sixpence by the powers one would think that you had made a mistake and handed me the rich mans plaister instead of the poor ones its less whiskey ill have to drink anyhow but heres the money and the top of the morning to ye seeing as how its jist getting late timothy and i laughed as we divided the sixpence it appeared that after taking his allowance of whiskey the poor fellow fixed the plaister on his back when he went to bed and the next morning found himself in a condition not be envied it was a week before we saw him again and much to the horror of timothy and myself he walked into the shop when mr brookes was employed behind the counter timothy perceived him before he saw us and pulling me behind the large mortar we contrived to make our escape into the back parlour the door of which we held ajar to hear what would take place murder and turf cried the man but that was the devils own plaister that you gave me here for my back and it left me as raw as a turnip taking every bit of my skin off me entirely foreby my lying in bed for a whole week and losing my days work i really do not recollect supplying you with a plaister my good man replied mr brookes then by the piper that played before moses if you dont recollect it ive an idea that i shall never forget it sure enough it cured me but wasnt i quite kilt before i was cured it must have been some other shop observed mr brookes you have made a mistake devil a bit of a mistake except in selling me the plaister didnt i get it of a lad in this same shop nobody sells things out of this shop without my knowledge the irishman was puzzledhe looked round the shop well then if this ant the shop it was own sister to it timothy called mr brookes and sure enough there was a timothy in the other shop for i heard the boy call the other by the name however its no matter if it took off the skin it also took away the thumbago so the morning to you mr pottykarry when the irishman departed we made our appearance japhet did you sell a plaister to an irishman yesdont you recollect last saturday and i gave you the shilling very true but what did he ask for he asked for a plaister but he was very tipsy i showed him a blister and he took it and then i looked at timothy and laughed you must not play such tricks said mr brookes i see what you have been aboutit was a joke to you but not to him mr brookes who imagined we had sold it to the irishman out of fun then gave us a very severe lecture and threatened to acquaint mr cophagus if ever we played such tricks again thus the affair blew over and it made me very careful and as every day i knew more about medicines i was soon able to mix them so as to be of service to those who applied and before eighteen months had expired i was trusted with the mixing up all the prescriptions at the end of that period mr brookes left us and i took the whole of his department upon myself giving great satisfaction to mr cophagus and now that i have announced my promotion it will perhaps be as well that i give the reader some idea of my personal appearance upon which i have hitherto been silent i was thin between fifteen and sixteen years old very tall for my age and of my figure i had no reason to be ashamed a large beaming eye with a slightly aquiline nose a high forehead fair in complexion but with very dark hair i was always what may be termed a remarkably cleanlooking boy from the peculiarity of my skin and complexion my teeth were small but were transparent and i had a very deep dimple in my chin like all embryo apothecaries i carried in my appearance if not the look of wisdom most certainly that of selfsufficiency which does equally well with the world in general my forehead was smooth and very white and my dark locks were combed back systematically and with a regularity that said as plainly as hair could do the owner of this does everything by prescription measurement and rule with my long fingers i folded up the little packets with an air as thoughtful and imposing as that of a minister who has just presented a protocol as interminable as unintelligible and the look of solemn sagacity with which i poured out the contents of one vial into the other would have well become the kings physician when he watched the lords anointed in articulo mortis as i followed up my saturnine avocation i generally had an open book on the counter beside me not a marblecovered dirty volume from the minerva press or a halfbound halfguineas worth of fashionable trash but a good honest heavylooking wisdomimplying book horribly stuffed with epithet of drug a book in which latin words were redundant and here and there were to be observed the crabbed characters of greek altogether with my book and my look i cut such a truly medical appearance that even the most guarded would not have hesitated to allow me the sole conduct of a whitlow from inflammation to suppuration and from suppuration to cure or have refused to have confided to me the entire suppression of a gumboil such were my personal qualifications at the time that i was raised to the important office of dispenser of i may say life and death it will not surprise the reader when i tell him that i was much noticed by those who came to consult or talk with mr cophagus a very fine looking lad that mr cophagus an acquaintance would say where did you get himwho is his father father mr cophagus would reply when they had gained the back parlour but i could overhear him father umcant tellloveconcealmentchild bornfoundling hospitalput outand so on this was constantly occurring and the constant occurrence made me often reflect upon my condition which otherwise i might from the happy and even tenor of my life have forgotten when i retired to my bed i would revolve in my mind all that i had gained from the governors of the hospital relative to myselfthe paper found in the basket had been given to me i was born in wedlockat least so said that paper the sum left with me also proved that my parents could not at my birth have been paupers the very peculiar circumstances attending my case only made me more anxious to know my parentage i was now old enough to be aware of the value of birth and i was also just entering the age of romance and many were the strange and absurd reveries in which i indulged at one time i would cherish the idea that i was of a noble if not princely birth and frame reasons for concealment at othersbut it is useless to repeat the absurdities and castle buildings which were generated in my brain from mystery my airy fabrics would at last disappear and leave me in all the misery of doubt and abandoned hope mr cophagus when the question was sometimes put to him would say good boyvery good boydont want a father but he was wrong i did want a father and every day the want became more pressing and i found myself continually repeating the question who is my father chapter iv very much puzzled with a new patient nevertheless take my degree at fifteen as an md and what is still more acceptable i pocket the fees the departure of mr brookes of course rendered me more able to follow up with timothy my little professional attempts to procure pocketmoney but independent of these pillages by the aid of pills and making drafts upon our masters legitimate profits by the assistance of draughts from his shop accident shortly enabled me to raise the ways and means in a more rapid manner but of this directly in the meantime i was fast gaining knowledge every evening i read surgical and medical books put into my hands by mr cophagus who explained whenever i applied to him and i soon obtained a very fair smattering of my profession he also taught me how to bleed by making me in the first instance puncture very scientifically all the larger veins of a cabbageleaf until well satisfied with the delicacy of my hand and the precision of my eye he wound up his instructions by permitting me to breathe a vein in his own arm well said timothy when he first saw me practising i have often heard it said theres no getting blood out of a turnip but it seems there is more chance with a cabbage i tell you what japhet you may try your hand upon me as much as you please for twopence a go i consented to this arrangement and by dint of practising on timothy over and over again i became quite perfect i should here observe that my anxiety relative to my birth increased every day and that in one of the books lent me by mr cophagus there was a dissertation upon the human frame sympathies antipathies and also on those features and peculiarities most likely to descend from one generation to another it was there asserted that the nose was the facial feature most likely to be transmitted from father to son as i before have mentioned my nose was rather aquiline and after i had read this book it was surprising with what eagerness i examined the faces of those whom i met and if i saw a nose upon any mans face at all resembling my own i immediately would wonder and surmise whether that person could be my father the constant dwelling upon the subject at last created a species of monomania and a hundred times a day i would mutter to myself who is my father indeed the very bells when they rung a peal seemed as in the case of whittington to chime the question and at last i talked so much on the subject to timothy who was my fidus achates and bosom friend that i really believe partial as he was to me he wished my father at the devil our shop was well appointed with all that glare and glitter with which we decorate the house of call of disease and death being situated in such a thoroughfare passengers would stop to look in and raggedvested and in other garments still more ragged little boys would stand to stare at the variety of colours and the pottecary gentleman your humble servant who presided over so many labelledingold phalanxes which decorated the sides of the shop among those who always stopped and gazed as she passed by which was generally three or four times a day was a welldressed female apparently about forty years of age straight as an arrow with an elasticity of step and a decision in her manner of walking which was almost masculine although her form notwithstanding that it was tall and thin was extremely feminine and graceful sometimes she would fix her eyes upon me and there was a wildness in her looks which certainly gave a painful impression and at the same time so fascinated me that when i met her gaze the paper which contained the powder remained unfolded and the arm which was pouring out the liquid suspended she was often remarked by timothy as well as me and we further observed that her step was not equal throughout the day in her latter peregrinations towards the evening her gait was more vigorous but unequal at the same time that her gaze was more stedfast she usually passed the shop for the last time each day about five oclock in the afternoon one evening after we had watched her past as we supposed to return no more till the ensuing morning for this peeping in on her part had become an expected occurrence and afforded much amusement to timothy who designated her as the mad woman to our great surprise and to the alarm of timothy who sprang over the counter and took a position by my side she walked into the shop her eye appeared wild as usual but i could not make out that it was insanity i recovered my selfpossession and desired timothy to hand the lady a chair begging to know in what way i could be useful timothy walked round by the end of the counter pushed a chair near to her and then made a hasty retreat to his former position she declined the chair with a motion of her hand in which there was much dignity as well as grace and placing upon the counter her hands which were small and beautifully white she bent forwards towards me and said in a sweet low voice which actually startled me by its depth of melody i am very ill my astonishment increased why i know not because the exceptions are certainly as many as the general rule we always form an estimate of the voice before we hear it from the outward appearance of the speaker and when i looked up in her face which was now exposed to the glare of the argand lamp and witnessed the cadaverous pale chalky expression on it and the crows feet near the eyes and wrinkles on her forehead i should have sooner expected to have heard a burst of heavenly symphony from a thundercloud than such music as issued from her parted lips good heavens madam said i eagerly and respectfully allow me to send for mr cophagus by no means replied she i come to you i am aware continued she in an undertone that you dispense medicines give advice and receive money yourself i felt very much agitated and the blush of detection mounted up to my forehead timothy who heard what she said showed his uneasiness in a variety of grotesque ways he drew up his legs alternately as if he were dancing on hot plates he slapped his pockets grinned clenched his fists ground his teeth and bit his lips till he made the blood come at last he sidled up to me she has been peeping and screwing those eyes of hers into this shop for something its all up with both of us unless you can buy her off i have madam said i at last ventured to prescribe in some trivial cases and as you say received money when my master is not here but i am entrusted with the till i knowi knowyou need not fear me you are too modest what i would request is that you would prescribe for me as i have no great opinion of your masters talents if you wish it madam said i bowing respectfully you have camphor julep ready made up have you not yes madam replied i then do me the favour to send the boy with a bottle to my house directly i handed down the bottle she paid for it and putting it into timothys hands desired him to take it to the direction which she gave him timothy put on his hat cocked his eye at me and left us alone what is your name said she in the same melodious voice japhet newland madam replied i japhetit is a good a scriptural name said the lady musirg in half soliloquy newlandthat sounds of mammon this mystery is unravelled thought i and i was right in my conjectures she is some fanatical methodist but i looked at her again and her dress disclaimed the idea for in it there was much taste displayed who gave you that name said she after a pause the question was simple enough but it stirred up a host of annoying recollections but not wishing to make a confidant of her i gently replied as i used to do in the foundling hospital on sunday morningmy godfathers and godmothers in my baptism maam my dear sir i am very ill said she after a pause will you feel my pulse i touched a wrist and looked at a hand that was worthy of being admired what a pity thought i that she should be old ugly and half crazy do you not think that this pulse of mine exhibits considerable nervous excitement i reckoned it this morning it was at a hundred and twenty it certainly beats quick replied i but perhaps the camphor julep may prove beneficial i thank you for your advice mr newland said she laying down a guinea and if i am not better i will call again or send for you goodnight she walked out of the shop leaving me in no small astonishment what could she mean i was lost in reverie when timothy returned the guinea remained on the counter i met her going home said he bless mea guineawhy japhet i recounted all that had passed well then it has turned out well for us instead of ill as i expected the us reminded me that we shared profits on these occasions and i offered timothy his half but tim with all his espieglerie was not selfish and he stoutly refused to take his share he dubbed me an md and said i had beat mr cophagus already for he had never taken a physicians fee i cannot understand it timothy said i after a few minutes thought i can replied timothy she has looked in at the window until she has fallen in love with your handsome face thats it depend upon it as i could find no other cause and tims opinion was backed by my own vanity i imagined that such must be the case yes tis so continued timothy as the saying is theres money bid for you i wish that it had not been by so illfavoured a person at all events tim replied i i cannot return her affection never mind that so long as you dont return the money the next evening she made her appearance bought as before a bottle of camphor julepsent timothy home with it and asking my advice paid me another guinea really madam said i putting it back towards her i am not entitled to it yes you are replied she i know you have no friends and i also know that you deserve them you must purchase books you must study or you never will be a great man she then sat down entered into conversation and i was struck with the fire and vigour of the remarks which were uttered in such a melodious tone her visits during a month were frequent and every time did she press upon me a fee although not in love with her person i certainly felt very grateful and moreover was charmed with the superiority of her mind we were now on the most friendly and confiding terms one evening she said to me japhet we have now been friends some time can i trust you with your life if it were necessary replied i i believe it said she then can you leave the shop and come to me tomorrow evening yes if you will send your maid for me saying that you are not well i will at eight oclock farewell then till tomorrow chapter v my vanity receives a desperate wound but my heart remains unscathedan anomaly in woman one who despises beauty the next evening i left timothy in charge and repaired to her house it was very respectable in outward appearance as well as its furniture i was not however shown up into the first floor but into the room below miss judd will come directly sir said a tall meagre puritanicallooking maid shutting the door upon me in a few minutes during which my pulse beat quick for i could not but expect some disclosure whether it was to be one of love or murder i hardly knew which miss aramathea judd for such was her christian name made her appearance and sitting down on the sofa requested me to take a seat by her mr newland said she i wish toand i think i can entrust you with a secret most important to me why i am obliged to do it you will perfectly comprehend when you have heard my story tell me are you attached to me this was a home question to a forward lad of sixteen i took her by the hand and when i looked down on it i felt as if i was i looked up into her face and felt that i was not and as i now was close to her i perceived that she must have some aromatic drug in her mouth as it smelt stronglythis gave me the supposition that the breath which drew such melodious tones was not equally sweet and i felt a certain increased degree of disgust i am very grateful miss judd replied i i hope i shall prove that i am attached when you confide in me swear then by all thats sacred you will not reveal what i do confide by all thats sacred i will not replied i kissing her hand with more fervour than i expected from myself do me then the favour to excuse me one minute she left the room and in a very short time there returned in the same dress and in every other point the same person but with a young and lively face of not more apparently than twentytwo or twentythree years old i started as if i had seen an apparation yes said she smiling you now see aramathea judd without disguise and you are the first who has seen that face for more than two years before i proceed further again i say may i trust youswear i do swear replied i and took her hand for the book which this time i kissed with pleasure over and over again like a young jackass as i was i still retained her hand throwing as much persuasion as i possibly could in my eyes in fact i did enough to have softened the hearts of three bonnetmakers i began to feel most dreadfully in love and thought of marriage and making my fortune and i dont know what but all this was put an end to by one simple short sentence delivered in a very decided but soft voice japhet dont be silly i was crushed and all my hopes crushed with me i dropped her hand and sat like a fool and now hear me i am as you must have already found out an impostor that is i am what is called a religious adventuressa new term i grant and perhaps only applicable to a very few my aunt was considered by a certain sect to be a great prophetess which i hardly need tell you was all nonsense nevertheless there are hundreds who believed in her and do so now brought up with my aunt i soon found out what fools and dupes may be made of mankind by taking advantage of their credulity she had her religious inspirations her trances and her convulsions and i was always behind the scenes she confided in me and i may say that i was her only confidant you cannot therefore wonder at my practising that deceit to which i have been brought up from almost my infancy in person i am the exact counterpart of what my aunt was at my age equally so in figure although my figure is now disguised to resemble that of a woman of her age i often had dressed myself in my aunts clothes put on her cap and front and then the resemblance was very striking my aunt fell sick and died but she promised the disciples that she would reappear to them and they believed her i did not she was buried and by many her return was anxiously expected it occurred to me about a week afterwards that i might contrive to deceive them i dressed in my aunts clothes i painted and disguised my face as you have seen and the deception was complete even to myself as i surveyed my countenance in the glass i boldly set off in the evening to the tabernacle which i knew they still frequentedcame into the midst of them and they fell down and worshipped me as a prophetess risen from the dead deceived indeed by my appearance but still more deceived by their own credulity for two years i have been omnipotent with them but there is one difficulty which shakes the faith of the new converts and new converts i must have japhet as the old ones die or i should not be able to fee my physician it is this by habit i can almost throw myself into a stupor or a convulsion but to do that effectually to be able to carry on the deception for so long a time and to undergo the severe fatigue attending such violent exertion it is necessary that i have recourse to stimulantsdo you understand i do replied i i have more than once thought you under the influence of them towards the evening im afraid that you take more than is good for your health not more than i require for what i have to undergo to keep up the faith of my disciples but there are many who waver some who doubt and i find that my movements are watched i cannot trust the woman in this house i think she is a spy set upon me but i cannot remove her as this house and all which it contains are not mine but belong to the disciples in general there is another woman not far off who is my rival she calls me an impostor and says that she is the true prophetess and that i am not one this will be rather difficult for her to prove continued she with a mocking smile beset as i am i require your assistance for you must be aware that it is rather discreditable to a prophetess who has risen from the dead to be seen all day at the ginshop yet without stimulants now i could not exist and how can i assist you by sending me as medicine that which i dare no longer procure in any other way and keeping the secret which i have imparted i will do both with pleasure but yet said i is it not a pity a thousand pities that one so youngand if you will allow me to add so lovely should give herself up to ardent spirits why continued i taking her small white hand why should you carry on the deception why sacrifice your health and i may say your happiness what more i might have said i know not probably it might have been an offer of marriage but she cut me short why does everybody sacrifice their health their happiness their all but for ambition and the love of power it is true as long as this little beauty lasts i might be courted as a woman but never should i be worshipped asi may saya godno no there is something too delightful in that adoration something too pleasant in witnessing a crowd of fools stare and men of three times my age falling down and kissing the hem of my garment this is indeed adoration the delight arising from it is so great that all other passions are crushed by itit absorbs all other feelings and has closed my heart even against love japhet i could not i would not debase myself sink so low in my own estimation as to allow so paltry a passion to have dominion over me and indeed now that i am so wedded to stimulants even if i were no longer a prophetess it never could but is not intoxication one of the most debasing of all habits i grant you in itself but with me and in my situation it is different i fall to rise again and higher i cannot be what i am without i simulatei cannot simulate without stimulants therefore it is but a means to a great and glorious ambition i had more conversation with her before i left but nothing appeared to move her resolution and i left her lamenting in the first place that she had abjured love because notwithstanding the orris root which she kept in her mouth to take away the smell of the spirits i found myself very much taken with such beauty of person combined with so much vigour of mind and in the second that one so young should carry on a system of deceit and selfdestruction when i rose to go away she put five guineas in my hand to enable me to purchase what she required add to this one small favour said i aramatheaallow me a kiss a kiss replied she with scorn no japhet look upon me for it is the last time you will behold my youth look upon me as a sepulchre fair without but unsavoury and rottenness within let me do you a greater kindness let me awaken your dormant energies and plant that ambition in your soul which may lead to all that is great and gooda better path and more worthy of a man than the one which i have partly chosen and partly destiny has decided for me look upon me as your friend although perhaps you truly say no friend unto myself farewellremember that tomorrow you will send the medicine which i require i left her and returned home it was late i went to bed and having disclosed as much to timothy as i could safely venture to do i fell fast asleep but her figure and her voice haunted me in my dreams at one time she appeared before me in her painted enamelled face and then the mask fell off and i fell at her feet to worship her extreme beauty then her beauty would vanish and she would appear an image of loathsomeness and deformity and i felt suffocated with the atmosphere impregnated with the smell of liquor i would wake and compose myself again glad to be rid of the horrid dream but again would she appear with a hydras tail like sin in miltons paradise lost wind herself round me her beautiful face gradually changing into that of a skeleton i cried out with terror and awoke to sleep no more and effectually cured by my dream of the penchant which i felt towards miss aramathea judd chapter vi my prescriptions very effective and palatable but i lose my patientthe feud equal to that of the montagues and the capuletsresults differentmercutio comes off unhurt the next day i sent timothy to purchase some highly rectified white brandy which i coloured with a blue tincture and added to it a small proportion of the essence of cinnamon to disguise the smell a dozen large vials carefully tied up and sealed were despatched to her abode she now seldom called unless it was early in the morning i made repeated visits to her house to receive money but no longer to make love one day i requested permission to be present at their meeting and to this she gave immediate consent indeed we were on the most intimate terms and when she perceived that i no longer attempted to play the fool i was permitted to remain for hours with her in conversation she had as she told me she intended reenamelled and painted her face but knowing what beauty was concealed underneath i no longer felt any disgust timothy was very much pleased at his share of this arrangement as he seldom brought her the medicine without pocketing halfacrown for two or three months every thing went on very satisfactorily but one evening timothy who had been sent with the basket of vials for miss judds assistance returned in great consternation informing me that the house was empty he had inquired of the neighbours and from the accounts given which were very contradictory it appeared that the rival prophetess had marched up at the head of her proselytes the evening before had obtained entrance and that a desperate contention had been the result that the police had been called in and all parties had been lodged in the watchhouse that the whole affair was being investigated by the magistrates and that it was said that miss judd and all her coadjutors would be sent to the penitentiary this was quite enough to frighten two boys like us for days afterwards we trembled when people came into the shop expecting to be summoned and imprisoned gradually however our fears were dismissed but i never from that time heard any thing more of miss aramathea judd after this affair i adhered steadily to my business and profiting by the advice given me by that young person improved rapidly in my profession as well as in general knowledge but my thoughts as usual were upon one subjectmy parentage and the mystery hanging over it my eternal reveries became at last so painful that i had recourse to reading to drive them away and subscribing to a good circulating library i was seldom without a book in my hand by this time i had been nearly two years and a half with mr cophagus when an adventure occurred which i must attempt to describe with all the dignity with which it ought to be invested this is a world of ambition competition and rivalry nation rivals nation and flies to arms cutting the throats of a few thousands on each side till one finds that it has the worst of it man rivals man and hence detraction duels and individual death woman rivals woman and hence loss of reputation and position in high and loss of hair and fighting with pattens in low life are we then to be surprised that this universal passion undeterred by the smell of drugs and poisonous compounds should enter into apothecaries shops but two streetstwo very short streets from our ownwas situated the singlefronted shop of mr ebenezer pleggit thank heaven it was only singlefronted there at least we had the ascendancy over them upon other points our advantages were more equally balanced mr pleggit had two large coloured bottles in his windows more than we had but then we had two horses and he had only one he tied over the corks of his bottles with redcoloured paper we covered up the lips of our vials with delicate blue it certainly was the casefor though an enemy ill do him justicethat after mr brookes had left us mr pleggit had two shopmen and mr cophagus only one but then that one was mr japhet newland besides one of his assistants had only one eye and the other squinted horribly so if we measured by eyes i think the advantage was actually on our side and as far as ornament went most decidedly for who would not prefer putting on his chimneypiece one handsome elegant vase than two damaged illlooking pieces of crockery mr pleggit had certainly a gilt mortar and pestle over his door which mr cophagus had omitted when he furnished his shop but then the mortar had a great crack down the middle and the pestle had lost its knob and let me ask those who have been accustomed to handle it what is a pestle without a knob on the whole i think with the advantage of having two fronts like janus we certainly had the best of the comparison but i shall leave the impartial to decide all i can say is that the feuds of the rival houses were most bitterthe hate intensethe mutual scorn unmeasurable did mr ebenezer pleggit meet mr phineas cophagus in the street the former immediately began to spit as if he had swallowed some of his own vile adulterated drugs and in rejoinder mr cophagus immediately raised the cane from his nose high above his forehead in so threatening an attitude as almost to warrant the other swearing the peace against him muttering ugly puppyknows nothingumpatients dieand so on it may be well supposed that this spirit of enmity extended through the lower branches of the rival housesthe assistants and i were at deadly feud and this feud was even more deadly between the boys who carried out the medicines and whose baskets might in some measure have been looked upon as the rival ensigns of the parties they themselves occupying the dangerous and honourable post of standard bearers timothy although the kindesthearted fellow in the world was as good a hater as dr johnson himself could have wished to meet with and when sometimes his basket was not so well filled as usual he would fill up with empty bottles below rather than that the credit of the house should be suspected and his deficiencies create a smile of scorn in the mouth of his redhaired antagonist when they happened to meet going their rounds as yet no actual collision had taken place between either the principals or the subordinates of the hostile factions but it was fated that this state of quiescence should no longer remain homer has sung the battles of gods demigods and heroes milton the strife of angels swift has been great in his battle of the books but i am not aware that the battle of the vials has as yet been sung and it requires a greater genius than was to be found in those who portrayed the conflicts of heroes demigods gods angels or books to do adequate justice to the mortal strife which took place between the lotions potions draughts pills and embrocations i must tell the story as well as i can leaving it as an outline for a future epic burning with all the hate which infuriated the breasts of the two houses of capulet and montague hate each day increasing from years of biting thumbs at each other and yet no excuse presenting itself for an affray timothy oldmixonfor on such an occasion it would be a sin to omit his whole designationtimothy oldmixon i say burning with hate and eager with haste turning a corner of the street with his basket well filled with medicines hanging on his left arm encountered equally eager in his haste and equally burning in his hate the redhaired mercury of mr ebenezer pleggit great was the concussion of the opposing baskets dire was the crash of many of the vials and dreadful was the mingled odour of the abominations which escaped and poured through the wicker interstices two ladies from billingsgate who were near indulging their rhetorical powers stopped short two tom cats who were on an adjacent roof just fixing their eyes of enmity and about to fix their claws turned their eyes to the scene below two political antagonists stopped their noisy arguments two dustmen ceased to ring their bells and two little urchins eating cherries from the crowns of their hats lost sight of their fruit and stood aghast with fear they met and met with such violence that they each rebounded many paces but like stalwart knights each kept his basket and his feet a few seconds to recover breath one withering fiery look from timothy returned by his antagonist one flash of the memory in each to tell them that they each had the la on their side and take that was roared by timothy planting a welldirected blow with his dexter and dexterous hand upon the sinister and sinisterous eye of his opponent take that continued he as his adversary reeled back take that and be dd to you for running against a gentleman he of the rubicund hair had retreated because so violent was the blow he could not help so doing and we all must yield to fate but it was not from fear seizing a vile potation that was labelled to be taken immediately and hurling it with demoniacal force right on the chops of the courageous timothy take that cried he with a rancorous yell this missile well directed as the spears of homers heroes came full upon the bridge of timothys nose and the fragile glass shivering inflicted divers wounds upon his physiognomy and at the same time poured forth a dark burntsienna coloured balsam to heal them giving pain unutterable timothy disdaining to lament the agony of his wounds followed the example of his antagonist and hastily seizing a similar bottle of much larger dimensions threw it with such force that it split between the eyes of his opponent thus with these dreadful weapons did they commence the mortal strife the lovers of good order or at least of fair play gathered round the combatants forming an almost impregnable ring yet of sufficient dimensions to avoid the missiles go it redhead bravo white apron resounded on every side draughts now met draughts in their passage through the circumambient air and exploded like shells over a besieged town bolusses were fired with the precision of cannon shot pillboxes were thrown with such force that they burst like grape and canister while acids and alkalies hissed as they neutralised each others power with all the venom of expiring snakes bravo white apron redhead for ever resounded on every side as the conflict continued with unabated vigour the ammunition was fast expending on both sides when mr ebenezer pleggit hearing the noise and perhaps smelling his own drugs was so unfortunately rash and so unwisely foolhardy as to break through the sacred ring advancing from behind with uplifted cane to fell the redoubtable timothy when a mixture of his own hurled by his own redhaired champion caught him in his open mouth breaking against his only two remaining front teeth extracting them as the discharged liquid ran down his throat and turning him as sick as a dog he fell was taken away on a shutter and it was some days before he was again to be seen in his shop dispensing those medicines which on this fatal occasion he would but too gladly have dispensed with reader have you not elsewhere read in the mortal fray between knights when the casque has been beaten off the shield lost and the sword shivered how they have resorted to closer and more deadly strife with their daggers raised on high thus it was with timothy his means had failed and disdaining any longer to wage a distant combat he closed vigorously with his panting enemy overthrew him in the first struggle seizing from his basket the only weapons which remained one single vial and one single box of pills as he sat upon his prostrate foe first he forced the box of pills into his gasping mouth and then with the lower end of the vial he drove it down his throat as a gunner rams home the wad and shot into a thirtytwo pound carronade choked with the box the fallen knight held up his hands for quarter but timothy continued until the end of the vial breaking out the top and bottom of the pasteboard receptacle fortyandeight of antibilious pills rolled in haste down redheads throat timothy then seized his basket and amid the shouts of triumph walked away his fallencrested adversary coughed up the remnants of the pasteboard once more breathed and was led disconsolate to the neighbouring pump while timothy regained our shop with his blushing honours thick upon him but i must drop the vein heroical mr cophagus who was at home when timothy returned was at first very much inclined to be wroth at the loss of so much medicine but when he heard the story and the finale he was so pleased at tims double victory over mr pleggit and his messenger that he actually put his hand in his pocket and pulled out halfacrown mr pleggit on the contrary was any thing but pleased he went to a lawyer and commenced an action for assault and battery and all the neighbourhood did nothing but talk about the affray which had taken place and the action at law which it was said would take place in the ensuing term but with the exception of this fracas which ended in the action not holding good whereby the animosity was increased i have little to recount during the remainder of the time i served under mr cophagus i had been more than three years with him when my confinement became insupportable i had but one idea which performed an everlasting cycle in my brainwho was my father and i should have abandoned the profession to search the world in the hope of finding my progenitor had it not been that i was without the means latterly i had hoarded up all i could collect but the sum was small much too small for the proposed expedition i became melancholy indifferent to the business and slovenly in my appearance when a circumstance occurred which put an end to my further dispensing medicines and left me a free agent chapter vii looking out for business not exactly minding your own businessthe loss of the scales occasions the loss of place to timothy and me who when weighed in other scales were found wantingwe bundle off with our bundles on it happened one marketday that there was an overdriven infuriated beast which was making sad havoc crowds of people were running past our shop in one direction and the cries of mad bull were reechoed in every quarter mr cophagus who was in the shop and to whom as i have before observed a mad bull was a source of great profit very naturally looked out of the shop to ascertain whether the animal was near to us in most other countries when people hear of any danger they generally avoid it by increasing their distance but in england it is too often the case that they are so fond of indulging their curiosity that they run to the danger mr cophagus who perceived the people running one way naturally supposed not being aware of the extreme proximity of the animal that the people were running to see what was the matter and turned his eyes in that direction walking out on the pavement that he might have a fairer view he was just observing cant sayfearumrascal pleggitclose to himget all the customwoundscontusionsandwhen the animal came suddenly round the corner upon mr cophagus who had his eyes the other way and before he could escape tossed him through his own shop windows and landed him on the counter not satisfied with this the beast followed him into the shop timothy and i pulled mr cophagus over towards us and he dropped inside the counter where we also crouched frightened out of our wits to our great horror the bull made one or two attempts to leap the counter but not succeeding and being now attacked by the dogs and butcher boys he charged at them through the door carrying away our best scales on his horns as a trophy as he galloped out of the shop in pursuit of his persecutors when the shouts and hallooes were at some little distance timothy and i raised our heads and looked round us and perceiving that all was safe we proceeded to help mr cophagus who remained on the floor bleeding and in a state of insensibility we carried him into the back parlour and laid him on the sofa i desired timothy to run for surgical aid as fast as he could while i opened a vein and in a few minutes he returned with our opponent mr ebenezer pleggit we stripped mr cophagus and proceeded to examine him bad case thisvery bad case indeed mr newlanddislocation of the os humerisevere contusion on the os frontisand im very much afraid there is some intercostal injury very sorry very sorry indeed for my brother cophagus but mr pleggit did not appear to be sorry on the contrary he appeared to perform his surgical duties with the greatest glee we reduced the dislocation and then carried mr cophagus up to his bed in an hour he was sensible and mr pleggit took his departure shaking hands with mr cophagus and wishing him joy of his providential escape bad job japhet said mr cophagus to me very bad indeed sir but it might have been worse worseumno nothing worsenot possible why sir you might have been killed poohdidnt mean thatmean pleggitrascalumkill me if he canshant thoughsoon get rid of himand so on you will not require his further attendance now that your shoulder is reduced i can very well attend upon you very true japhetbut wont gosure of thatdamned rascalquite pleasedi saw itumeyes twinkledsmile checkedand so on that evening mr pleggit called in as mr cophagus said that he would and the latter showed a great deal of impatience but mr pleggit repeated his visits over and over again and i observed that mr cophagus no longer made any objection on the contrary seemed anxious for his coming and still more so after he was convalescent and able to sit at his table but the mystery was soon divulged it appeared that mr cophagus although he was very glad that other people should suffer from mad bulls and come to be cured viewed the case in a very different light when the bull thought proper to toss him and having now realised a comfortable independence he had resolved to retire from business and from a site attended with so much danger a hint of this escaping him when mr pleggit was attending him on the third day after his accident the latter who knew the value of the locale also hinted that if mr cophagus was inclined so to do that he would be most happy to enter into an arrangement with him selfinterest will not only change friendship into enmity in this rascally world but also turn enmity into friendship all mr pleggits enormities and all mr cophagus shameful conduct were mutually forgotten in less than ten minutes it was my dear mr pleggit and so on and my dear brother cophagus in three weeks every thing had been arranged between them and the shop fixtures stock in trade and good will were all the property of our ancient antagonist but although mr pleggit could shake hands with mr cophagus for his fixtures and good will yet as timothy and i were not included in the good will neither were we included among the fixtures and mr cophagus could not of course interfere with mr pleggits private arrangements he did all he could do in the way of recommendation but mr pleggit had not forgotten my occasional impertinences or the battle of the bottles i really believe that his ill will against timothy was one reason for purchasing the good will of mr cophagus and we were very gently told by mr pleggit that he would have no occasion for our services mr cophagus offered to procure me another situation as soon as he could and at the same time presented me with twenty guineas as a proof of his regard and appreciation of my conductbut this sum put in my hand decided me i thanked him and told him i had other views at present but hoped he would let me know where i might find him hereafter as i should be glad to see him again he told me he would leave his address for me at the foundling hospital and shaking me heartily by the hand we parted timothy was then summoned mr cophagus gave him five guineas and wished him good fortune and now japhet what are you about to do said timothy as he descended into the shop to do replied i i am about to leave you which is the only thing i am sorry for i am going timothy in search of my father well replied timothy i feel as you do japhet that it will be hard to part and there is another thing on my mindwhich is i am very sorry that the bull did not break the rudimans pointing to the iron mortar and pestle had he had but half the spite i have against it he would not have left a piece as big as a thimble ive a great mind to have a smack at it before i go you will only injure mr cophagus for the mortar will not then be paid for very true and as he has just given me five guineas i will refrain from my just indignation but now japhet let me speak to you i dont know how you feel but i feel as if i could not part with you i do not want to go in search of my father particularly they say its a wise child that knows its own fatherbut as there can be no doubt of my other parentif i can only hit upon her i have a strong inclination to go in search of my mother and if you like my company why i will go with youalways my dear japhet continued tim keeping in my mind the great difference between a person who has been feed as an md and a lad who only carries out his prescriptions do you really mean to say tim that you will go with me yes to the end of the world japhet as your companion your friend and your servant if you require it i love you japhet and i will serve you faithfully my dear tim i am delighted now i am really happy we will have but one purse and but one interest if i find good fortune you shall share it and if you meet with ill luck i will share that tooso the affair is settledand as here come mr pleggits assistants with only one pair of eyes between them the sooner we pack up the better in half an hour all was ready a bundle each contained our wardrobes we descended from our attic walked proudly through the shop without making any observation or taking any notice of our successors all the notice taken was by timothy who turned round and shook his fist at his old enemies the iron mortar and pestle and there we were standing on the pavement with the wide world before us and quite undecided which way we should go is it to be east west north or south japhet said timothy the wise men came from the east replied i then they must have travelled west said tim let us show our wisdom by doing the same agreed passing by a small shop we purchased two good sticks as defenders as well as to hang our bundles onand off we set upon our pilgrimage chapter viii we take a coach but the driver does not like his fare and hits us foulwe change our mode of travelling upon the principle of slow and sure and fall in with a very learned man i believe it to be a very general custom when people set off upon a journey to reckon up their meansthat is to count the money which they may have in their pockets at all events this was done by timothy and me and i found that my stock amounted to twentytwo pounds eighteen shillings and timothys to the five guineas presented by mr cophagus and three halfpence which were in the corner of his waistcoat pocketsum total twentyeight pounds three shillings and three halfpence a very handsome sum as we thought with which to commence our peregrinations and as i observed to timothy sufficient to last us for a considerable time if husbanded with care yes replied he but we must husband our legs also japhet or we shall soon be tired and very soon wear out our shoes i vote we take a hackney coach take a hackney coach tim we mustnt think of it we cannot afford such a luxury you cant be tired yet we are now only just clear of hyde park corner still i think we had better take a coach japhet and here is one coming i always do take one when i carry out medicines to make up for the time i lose looking at the shops and playing peg in the ring i now understood what timothy meant which was to get behind and have a ride for nothing i consented to this arrangement and we got up behind one which was already well filled inside the only difference between an inside and outside passenger in a hackney coach is that one pays and the other does not said i to timothy as we rolled along at the act of parliament speed of four miles per hour that depends upon circumstances if we are found out in all probability we shall not only have our ride but be paid into the bargain with the coachmans whip i presume exactly and timothy had hardly time to get the word out of his mouth when flac flac came the whip across our eyesa little envious wretch with his shirt hanging out of his trousers having called out cut behind not wishing to have our faces or our behinds cut any more we hastily descended and reached the footpath after having gained about three miles on the road before we were discovered that wasnt a bad lift japhet and as for the whip i never mind that with corduroys and now japhet ill tell you something we must get into a wagon if we can find one going down the road as soon as it is dark but that will cost money tim its economy i tell you for a shilling if you bargain you may ride the whole night and if we stop at a publichouse to sleep we shall have to pay for our beds as well as be obliged to order something to eat and pay dearer for it than if we buy what we want at cooks shops there is sense in what you say timothy we will look out for a wagon oh its no use nowwagons are like black beetles not only in shape but in habits they only travel by nightat least most of them do we are now coming into long dirty brentford and i dont know how you feel japhet but i find that walking wonderfully increases the appetitethats another reason why you should not walk when you can ridefor nothing well im rather hungry myself and dear me how very good that piece of roast pork looks in that window i agree with youlets go in and make a bargain we bought a good allowance for a shilling and after sticking out for a greater proportion of mustard than the woman said we were entitled to and some salt we wrapped it up in a piece of paper and continued our course till we arrived at a bakers where we purchased our bread and then taking up a position on a bench outside a publichouse called for a pot of beer and putting our provisions down before us made a hearty and what made us more enjoy it an independent meal having finished our pork and our porter and refreshed ourselves we again started and walked till it was quite dark when we felt so tired that we agreed to sit down on our bundles and wait for the first wagon which passed we soon heard the jingling of bells and shortly afterwards its enormous towering bulk appeared between us and the sky we went up to the wagoner who was mounted on a little pony and asked him if he could give two poor lads a lift and how much he would charge us for the ride how much can you afford to give measters for there be others as poor as ye we replied that we could give a shilling well then get up in gods name and ride as long as you will get in behind are there many people in there already said i as i climbed up and timothy handed me the bundles noa replied the wagoner there be nobody but a mighty clever poticary or doctor i cant tell which but he wear an uncommon queer hat and he talk all sort of doctor stuffand there be his odd man and his odd boy that be all and there be plenty of room and plenty o clean stra after this intimation we climbed up and gained a situation in the rear of the wagon under the cloth as the wagoner said there was plenty of room and we nestled into the straw without coming into contact with the other travellers not feeling any inclination to sleep timothy and i entered into conversation sotto voce and had continued for more than half an hour supposing by their silence that the other occupants of the wagon were asleep when we were interrupted by a voice clear and sonorous as a bell it would appear that you are wanderers young men and journey you know not whither birds seek their nests when the night fallsbeasts hasten to their lairsman bolts his door propria quae maribus as herodotus hath it which when translated means that such is the nature of mankind tribuuntur mascula dicas tell me your troubles as homer says i was very much surprised at this addressmy knowledge of the language told me immediately that the quotations were out of the latin grammar and that all his learning was pretence still there was a novelty of style which amused me and at the same time gave me an idea that the speaker was an uncommon personage i gave timothy a nudge and then replied you have guessed right most learned sir we are as you say wanderers seeking our fortunes and trust yet to find themstill we have a weary journey before us haustus hora somni sumendum as aristotle hath it which i need not translate to so learned a person as yourself nay indeed there is no occasion yet am i pleased to meet with one who hath scholarship replied the other have you also a knowledge of the greek no i pretend not to greek it is a pity that thou hast it not for thou wouldst delight to commune with the ancients esculapius hath these wordsasholderoffmottonaccaponpastivenisonwhich i will translate for theewe often find what we seek when we least expect it may it be so with you my friend where have you been educated and what has been your profession i thought i risked little in telling so i replied that i had been brought up as a surgeon and apothecary and had been educated at a foundation school tis well replied he you have then commenced your studies in my glorious profession still have you much to learn years of toil under a great master can only enable you to benefit mankind as i have done and years of hardship and of danger must be added thereunto to afford you the means there are many hidden secrets ut sunt divorum mars bacchus apollo virorummany parts of the globe to traverse ut cato virgilius fluviorum ut tibris orontes all these have i visited and many more even now do i journey to obtain more of my invaluable medicine gathered on the highest andes when the moon is in her perigee there i shall remain for months among the clouds looking down upon the great plain of mexico which shall appear no larger than the head of a pin where the voice of man is heard not vocito vocitas vocitavi bending for months towards the earth as in presenti suffering with the coldfrico quod fricui dat as eusebius hath it soon shall i be borne away by the howling winds towards the new world where i can obtain more of the wonderful medicine which i may say never yet hath failed me and which nothing but love towards my race induces me to gather at such pains and risk indeed sir replied i amused with his imposition i should like to accompany youfor as josephus says most truly capiat pillulae duae post prandium travel is indeed a most delightful occupation and i would like to run over the whole world and i would like to follow you interrupted timothy i suspect we have commenced our grand tour alreadythree miles behind a hackneycoachten on foot and about two i should think in this wagon but as cophagus says cochlearija crash many summendush which means there are ups and downs in this world hah exclaimed our companion he also has the rudiments nay i hope ive done with the rudimans replied timothy is he your follower inquired the man that very much depends upon who walks first replied timothy but whether or nowe hunt in couples i understandyou are companions concordat cum nominativo numero et persona tell me can you roll pills can you use the pestle and the mortar handle the scapula and mix ingredients i replied that of course i knew my profession well then as we have still some hours of night let us now obtain some rest in the morning when the sun hath introduced us to each other i may then judge from your countenances whether it is likely that we may be better acquainted night is the time for repose as quintus curtius says custos bos fur atque sacerdos sleep was made for allmy friends goodnight chapter ix in which the adventures in the wagon are continued and we become more puzzled with our new companionswe leave off talking latin and enter into an engagement timothy and i took his advice and were soon fast asleep i was awakened the next morning by feeling a hand in my trousers pocket i seized it and held it fast now just let go my hand will you cried a lachrymal voice i jumped upit was broad daylight and looked at the human frame to which the hand was an appendix it was a very spare awkwardlybuilt form of a young man apparently about twenty years old but without the least sign of manhood on his chin his face was cadaverous with large goggling eyes high cheek bones hair long and ragged reminding me of a rats nest thin lips and ears large almost as an elephants a more woebegone wretch in appearance i never beheld and i continued to look at him with surprise he repeated his words with an idiotical expression just let go my hand cant you what business had your hand in my pocket replied i angrily i was feeling for my pockethandkerchief replied the young man i always keeps it in my breeches pocket but not in your neighbours i presume my neighbours replied he with a vacant stare well so it is i see nowi thought it was my own i released his hand he immediately put it into his own pocket and drew out his handkerchief if the rag deserved the appellation there said he i told you i put it in that pocketi always do and pray who are you said i as i looked at his dress which was a pair of loose white turkish trousers and an old spangled jacket me why im the fool more knave than fool i expect replied i still much puzzled with his strange appearance and dress nay there you mistake said the voice of last night he is not only a fool by profession but one by nature it is a halfwitted creature who serves me when i would attract the people strange in this world that wisdom may cry in the streets without being noticed yet folly will always command a crowd during this address i turned my eyes upon the speaker he was an elderlylooking person with white hair dressed in a suit of black ruffles and frill his eyes were brilliant but the remainder of his face it was difficult to decipher as it was evidently painted and the nights jumbling in the wagon had so smeared it that it appeared of almost every colour in the rainbow on one side of him lay a large threecornered cocked hat on the other a little lump of a boy rolled up in the straw like a marmot and still sound asleep timothy looked at me and when he caught my eye burst out into a laugh you laugh at my appearance i presume said the old man mildly i do in truth replied timothy i never saw one like you before and i dare say never shall again that is possible yet probably if you meet me again you would not know me among a hundred thousand replied timothy with increased mirth we shall see perhaps replied the quack doctor for such the reader must have already ascertained to be his profession but the wagon has stopped and the driver will bait his horses if inclined to eat now is your time come jumbo get up philotas waken him and follow me philotas for so was the fool styled by his master twisted up some straw and stuffed the end of it into jumbos mouth now jumbo will think he has got something to eat i always wake him that way observed the fool grinning at us it certainly as might be expected did waken jumbo who uncoiled himself rubbed his eyes stared at the tilt of the wagon then at us and without saying a word rolled himself out after the fool timothy and i followed we found the doctor bargaining for some bread and bacon his strange appearance exciting much amusement and inducing the people to let him have a better bargain than perhaps otherwise they would have done he gave a part of the refreshment to the boy and the fool and walked out of the taproom with his own share timothy and i went to the pump and had a good refreshing wash and then for a shilling were permitted to make a very hearty breakfast the wagon having remained about an hour the driver gave us notice of his departure but the doctor was no where to be found after a little delay the wagoner drove off cursing him for a bilk and vowing that hed never have any more to do with a lamed man in the mean time timothy and i had taken our seats in the wagon in company with the fool and master jumbo we commenced a conversation with the former and soon found out as the doctor had asserted that he really was an idiot so much so that it was painful to converse with him as for the latter he had coiled himself away to take a little more sleep i forgot to mention that the boy was dressed much in the same way as the fool in an old spangled jacket and dirty white trousers for about an hour timothy and i conversed remarking upon the strange disappearance of the doctor especially as he had given us hopes of employing us in accepting which offer if ever it should be made we had not made up our minds when we were interrupted with a voice crying out hillo my man can you give a chap a lift as far as reading for a shilling ay get up and welcome replied the wagoner the wagon did not stop but in a moment or two the new passenger climbed in he was dressed in a clean smock frock neatly worked up the front leather gaiters and stout shoes a bundle and a stick were in his hand he smiled as he looked round upon the company and showed a beautiful set of teeth his face was dark and sunburnt but very handsome and his eyes as black as coals and as brilliant as gas heh player folkive a notion said he as he sat down looking at the doctors attendants and laughing at us have you come far gentlemen continued he from london was my reply how do the crops look up above for down here the turnips seem to have failed altogether dry seasons wont do for turnips i replied that i really could not satisfy him on that point as it was dark when we passed very truei had forgotten that replied he however the barleys look well but perhaps you dont understand farming i replied in the negative and the conversation was kept up for two or three hours in the course of which i mentioned the quack doctor and his strange departure that is the fellow who cured so many people at replied he and the conversation then turned upon his profession and mode of life which timothy and i agreed must be very amusing we shall meet him again i dare say replied the man would you know him i think so indeed replied timothy laughing yes and so you would think that you would know a guinea from a halfpenny if i put it into your hands replied the man i do not wish to lay a bet and win your money but i tell you that i will put either the one or the other into each of your hands and if you hold it fast for one minute and shut your eyes during that time you will not be able to tell me which it is that you have in it that i am sure i would replied tim and i made the same assertion well i was taken in that way at a fair and lost ten shillings by the wager now well try whether you can tell or not he took out some money from his pocket which he selected without our seeing it put a coin into the hand of each of us closing our fists over it and now said he keep your eyes shut for a minute we did so and a second or two afterwards we heard a voice which we instantly recognised nay but it was wrong to leave me on the way side thus having agreed to pay the sum demanded at my age one walketh not without fatigue excipenda tamen quaedam sunt urbium as philostratus says meaning that old limbs lose their activity and seek the help of a crutch theres the doctor cried timothy with his eyes still shut now open your eyes said the man and tell me before you open your hand what there is in it a halfpenny in mine said tim a guinea in mine replied i we opened our hands and they were empty where the devil is it exclaimed i looking at tim and where the devils the doctor replied he looking round the money is in the doctors pocket replied the man smiling then where is the doctors pocket here replied he slapping his pocket and looking significantly at us i thought you were certain of knowing him again about as certain as you were of telling the money in your hand he then to our astonishment imitated the doctors voice and quoted prosody syntax and latin timothy and i were still in astonishment when he continued if i had not found out that you were in want of employ and further that your services would be useful to me i should not have made this discovery do you now think that you know enough to enter into my service it is light work and not bad pay and now you may choose i trust said i that there is no dishonesty none that you need practise if you are so scrupulous perhaps your scruples may some day be removed i make the most of my waresevery merchant does the same i practise upon the folly of mankindit is on that that wise men live timothy gave me a push and nodded his head for me to give my consent i reflected a few seconds and at last i extended my hand i consent replied i with the reservation i have made you will not repent said he and i will take your companion not that i want him particularly but i do want you the fact is i want a lad of gentlemanly address and handsome appearancewith the very knowledge you possessand now we will say no more for the present bythebye was that real latin of yours no replied i laughing you quoted the grammar and i replied with medical prescriptions one was as good as the other quitenay better for the schoolboys may find me out but not you but now observe when we come to the next cross road we must get downat least i expect so but we shall know in a minute in about the time he mentioned a dark gipsylooking man looked into the wagon and spoke to our acquaintance in an unknown language he replied in the same and the man disappeared we continued our route for about a quarter of an hour when he got out asked us to follow him and speaking a few words to the fool which i did not hear left him and the boy in the wagon we paid our fare took possession of our bundles and followed our new companion for a few minutes on the cross road when he stopped and said i must now leave you to prepare for your reception into our fraternity continue straight on this road until you arrive at a limekiln and wait there till i come he sprang over a stile and took a direction verging at an angle from the road forced his way through a hedge and disappeared from our sight upon my word timothy said i i hardly know what to say to this have we done right in trusting to this man who i am afraid is a great rogue i do not much like mixing with these gipsy people for such i am sure he belongs to i really do not see how we can do better replied timothy the world is all before us and we must force our own way through it as for his being a quack doctor i see no great harm in that people put their faith in nostrums more than they do in regular medicines and it is well known that quack medicines as they call them cure as often as others merely for that very reason very true timothy the mind once at ease the body soon recovers and faith even in quack medicines will often make people whole but do you think that he does no more than impose upon people in that way he may or he may not at all events we need do no more i suppose i am not sure of that however we shall see he says we may be useful to him and i suppose we shall be or he would not have engaged uswe shall soon find out chapter x in which the reader is introduced to several new acquaintances and all connected with them except birth and parentage which appears to be the one thing wanting throughout the whole of this work by this time we had arrived at the limekiln to which we had been directed and we sat down on our bundles chatting for about five minutes when our new acquaintance made his appearance with something in his hand tied up in a handkerchief you may as well put your coats into your bundles and put on these frocks said he you will appear better among us and be better received for there is a gathering now and some of them are queer customers however you have nothing to fear when once you are with my wife and me you are quite safe her little finger would protect you from five hundred your wife who then is she inquired i as i put my head through the smock frock she is a great personage among the gipsies she is by descent one of the heads of the tribe and none dare to disobey her and youare you a gipsy no and yes by birth i am not but by choice and marriage i am admitted but i was not born under a hedge i can assure you although i very often pass a night there nowthat is when i am domestic but do not think that you are to remain long here we shall leave in a few days and may not meet the tribe again for months although you may see my own family occasionally i did not ask you to join me to pass a gipsys lifeno no we must be stirring and active come we are now close to them do not speak as you pass the huts until you have entered mine then you may do as you please we turned short round passed through a gap in the hedge and found ourselves on a small retired piece of common which was studded with about twenty or thirty low gipsy huts the fires were alight and provisions apparently cooking we passed by nine or ten and obeyed our guides injunctions to keep silence at last we stopped and perceived ourselves to be standing by the fool who was dressed like us in a smock frock and mr jumbo who was very busy making the pot boil blowing at the sticks underneath till he was black in the face several of the men passed near us and examined us with no very pleasant expression of countenance and we were not sorry to see our conductor who had gone into the hut return followed by a woman to whom he was speaking in the language of the tribe nattee bids you welcome said he as she approached never in my life will the remembrance of the first appearance of nattee and the effect it had upon me be erased from my memory she was tall too tall had it not been for the perfect symmetry of her form her face of a clear olive and oval in shape her eyes jetty black nose straight and beautifully formed mouth small thin lips with a slight curl of disdain and pearly teeth i never beheld a woman of so commanding a presence her feet were bare but very small as well as her hands on her fingers she wore many rings of a curious old setting and a piece of gold hung on her forehead where the hair was parted she looked at us touched her high forehead with the ends of her fingers and waving her hand gracefully said in a soft voice you are welcome and then turned to her husband speaking to him in her own language until by degrees they separated from us in earnest conversation she returned to us after a short time without her husband and said in a voice the notes of which were indeed soft but the delivery of the words was most determined i have said that you are welcome sit down therefore and share with usfear nothing you have no cause to fear be faithful then while you serve him and when you would quit us say so and receive your leave to depart but if you attempt to desert us without permission then we shall suspect that you are our enemies and treat you accordingly there is your lodging while here continued she pointing to another hut there is but one child with you this boy pointing to jumbo who can lay at your feet and now join us as friends fleta where are you a soft voice answered from the tent of nattee and soon afterwards came out a little girl of about eleven years old the appearance of this child was a new source of interest she was a little fairy figure with a skin as white as the driven snowlight auburn hair and large blue eyes her dress was scanty and showed a large portion of her taper legs she hastened to nattee and folding her arms across her breast stood still saying meekly i am here know these as friends fleta send that lazy num this was philotas the fool for more wood and see that jumbo tends the fire nattee smiled and left us i observed she went to where forty or fifty of the tribe were assembled in earnest discourse she took her seat with them and marked deference was paid to her in the meantime jumbo had blown up a brisk fire we were employed by fleta in shredding vegetables which she threw into the boiling kettle num appeared with more fuel and at last there was nothing more to do fleta sat down by us and parting her long hair which had fallen over her eyes looked us both in the face who gave you that name fleta inquired i they gave it me replied she and who are they nattee and melchior her husband but you are not their daughter no i am notthat is i believe not the little girl stopped short as if assured that she had said too much cast her eyes down on the ground and folded her arms so that her hands rested on each opposite shoulder timothy whispered to me she must have been stolen depend upon it silence said i the little girl overheard him and looking at him put her finger across her mouth looking to where num and jumbo were sitting i felt an interest for this child before i had been an hour in her company she was so graceful so feminine so mournful in the expression of her countenance that she was under restraint was evident but still she did not appear to be actuated by fear nattee was very kind to her and the child did not seem to be more reserved towards her than to others her mournful pensive look was perhaps inherent to her nature it was not until long after our first acquaintance that i ever saw a smile upon her features shortly after this little conversation nattee returned walking with all the grace and dignity of a queen her husband or melchior as i shall in future call him soon joined us and we sat down to our repast which was excellent it was composed of almost every thing sometimes i found myself busy with the wing of a fowl at another the leg of a rabbitthen a piece of mutton or other flesh and fowl which i could hardly distinguish to these were added every sort of vegetable among which potatoes predominated forming a sort of stew which an epicure might have praised i had a long conversation with melchior in the evening and not to weary the reader i shall now proceed to state all that i then and subsequently gathered from him and others relative to the parties with whom we were associating melchior would not state who and what he was previous to his having joined the fraternity of gipsies that he was not of humble birth and that he had when young quitted his friends out of love for nattee or from some other causes not to be revealed he led me to surmise he had been many years in company with the tribe and although as one received into it he did not stand so high in rank and estimation as his wife still from his marriage with nattee and his own peculiar qualifications and dexterity he was almost as absolute as she was melchior and nattee were supposed to be the most wealthy of all the gipsies and at the same time they were the most liberal of their wealth melchior it appeared gained money in three different characters as a quack doctor the character in which we first saw him secondly as a juggler in which art he was most expert and thirdly as a fortuneteller and wise man nattee as i before mentioned was of very high rank or caste in her tribe at her first espousal of melchior she lost much of her influence as it was considered a degradation but she was then very young and must have been most beautiful the talents of melchior and her own spirit however soon enabled her to regain and even add still more to her power and consideration among the tribe and it was incredible to what extent with the means which she possessed this power was augmented melchior had no children by his marriage and as far as i could judge from the few words which would escape from the lips of nattee she did not wish for any as the race would not be considered pure the subdivision of the tribe which followed nattee consisted of about forty men women and children these were ruled by her during the absence of her husband who alternately assumed different characters as suited his purpose but in whatever town melchior might happen to be nattee and her tribe were never far off and always encamped within communication i ventured to question melchior about the little fleta and he stated that she was the child of a soldiers wife who had been brought to bed and died a few hours afterwards that at the time she was on her way to join her husband and had been taken ill on the roadhad been assisted by nattee and her companions as far as they were ablehad been buried by them and that the child had been reared in the camp in time the little girl became very intimate and very partial to me i questioned her as to her birth telling her what melchior had stated for a long while she would not answer the poor child had learned caution even at that early age but after we were more intimate she said that which melchior had stated was not true she could recollect very well living in a great house with everything very fine about her but still it appeared as if it were a dream she recollected two white poniesand a lady who was her mammaand a mulberrytree where she stained her frock sometimes other things came to her memory and then she forgot them again from this it was evident that she had been stolen and was probably of good parentage certainly if elegance and symmetry of person and form could prove blood it never was more marked than in this interesting child her abode with the gipsies and their peculiar mode of life and manners had rendered her astonishingly precocious in intellect but of education she had none except what was instilled into her by melchior whom she always accompanied when he assumed his character as a juggler she then danced on the slack wire at the same time performing several feats in balancing throwing of oranges c when melchior was under other disguises she remained in the camp with nattee of num or philotas as melchior thought proper to call him i have already spoken he was a halfwitted idiot picked up in one of melchiors excursions and as he stated to me so did it prove to be the fact that when on the stage and questioned as a fool his natural folly and idiotical vacancy of countenance were applauded by the spectators as admirably assumed even at the alehouses and taverns where we stopped every one imagined that all his folly was pretence and looked upon him as a very clever fellow there never was perhaps such a lachrymose countenance as this poor lads and this added still more to the mirth of others being also considered as put on for the occasion stephen kemble played falstaff without stuffingnum played the fool without any effort or preparation jumbo was also picked up this was not done by melchior who stated that any body might have him who claimed him he tumbled with the fool upon the stage and he also ate pudding to amuse the spectatorsthe only part of the performance which was suited to jumbos taste for he was a terrible little glutton and never lost any opportunity of eating as well as of sleeping and now having described all our new companions i must narrate what passed between melchior and me the day after our joining the camp he first ran through his various professions pointing out to me that as juggler he required a confederate in which capacity i might be very useful as he would soon instruct me in all his tricks as a quack doctor he wanted the services of both tim and myself in mixing up making pills c and also in assisting him in persuading the public of his great skill as a fortuneteller i should also be of great service as he would explain to me hereafter in short he wanted a person of good personal appearance and education in whom he might confide in every way as to tim he might be made useful if he chose in various ways amongst others he wished him to learn tumbling and playing the fool when at times the fool was required to give a shrewd answer on any point on which he would wish the public to be made acquainted i agreed to my own part of the performance and then had some conversation with timothy who immediately consented to do his best in what was allotted as his share thus was the matter quickly arranged melchior observing that he had said nothing about remuneration as i should find that trusting to him was far preferable to stipulated wages chapter xi whatever may be the opinion of the reader he cannot assert that we are no conjurerswe suit our wares to our customers and our profits are considerable we had been three days in the camp when the gathering was broken up each gang taking their own way what the meeting was about i could not exactly discover one occasion of it was to make arrangements relative to the different counties in which the subdivisions were to sojourn during the next year so that they might know where to communicate with each other and at the same time not interfere by being too near but there were many other points discussed of which as a stranger i was kept in ignorance melchior answered all my questions with apparent candour but his habitual deceit was such that whether he told the truth or not was impossible to be ascertained by his countenance when the gathering dispersed we packed up and located ourselves about two miles from the common on the borders of a forest of oak and ash our food was chiefly game for we had some excellent poachers among us and as for fish it appeared to be at their command there was not a pond nor a pit but they could tell in a moment if it were tenanted and if tenanted in half an hour every fish would be floating on the top of the water by the throwing in of some intoxicating sort of berry other articles of food occasionally were found in the caldron indeed it was impossible to fare better than we did or at less expense our tents were generally pitched not far from a pool of water and to avoid any unpleasant search which sometimes would take place everything liable to detection was sunk under the water until it was required for cooking once in the pot it was considered as safe but with the foraging timothy and i had nothing to do we participated in the eating without asking any questions as to how it was procured my time was chiefly spent in company with melchior who initiated me into all the mysteries of cups and ballsjuggling of every descriptionfeats with cards and made me acquainted with all his apparatus for prepared tricks for hours and hours was i employed by his directions in what is called making the pass with a pack of cards as almost all tricks on cards depend upon your dexterity in this manoeuvre in about a month i was considered as a very fair adept in the meantime timothy had to undergo his career of gymnastics and was to be seen all day tumbling and retumbling until he could tumble on his feet again light and active he soon became a very dexterous performer and could throw a somerset either backwards or forwards walk on his hands eat fire pull out ribbons and do fifty other tricks to amuse a gaping audience jumbo also was worked hard to bring down his fat and never was allowed his dinner until he had given satisfaction to melchior even little fleta had to practise occasionally as we were preparing for an expedition melchior who appeared determined to create an effect left us for three days and returned with not only dresses for timothy and me but also new dresses for the rest of the company and shortly afterwards bidding farewell to nattee and the rest of the gipsies we all set outthat is melchior i timothy fleta num and jumbo late in the evening we arrived at the little town of and took up our quarters at a publichouse with the landlord of which melchior had already made arrangements well timothy said i as soon as we were in bed how do you like our new life and prospects i like it better than mr cophaguss rudimans and carrying out physic at all events but how does your dignity like turning merry andrew japhet to tell you the truth i do not dislike it there is a wildness and a devilmaycare feeling connected with it which is grateful to me at present how long it may last i cannot tell but for a year or two it appears to me that we may be very happy at all events we shall see the world and have more than one profession to fall back upon that is true but there is one thing that annoys me japhet which is we may have difficulty in leaving these people when we wish besides you forget that you are losing sight of the principal object you had in view that is of finding out your father i certainly never expect to find him among the gipsies replied i for children are at a premium with them they steal from others and are not very likely therefore to leave them at the foundling but i do not know whether i have not as good a chance in our present employment as in any other i have often been thinking that as fortunetellers we may get hold of many strange secrets however we shall see melchior says that he intends to appear in that character as soon as he has made a harvest in his present one what do you think of melchior now that you have been so much with him i think him an unprincipled man but still with many good qualities he appears to have a pleasure in deceit and to have waged war with the world in general still he is generous and to a certain degree confiding kind in his disposition and apparently a very good husband there is something on his mind which weighs him down occasionally and checks him in the height of his mirth it comes over him like a dark cloud over a bright summer sun and he is all gloom for a few minutes i do not think that he would now commit any great crime but i have a suspicion that he has done something which is a constant cause of remorse you are a very good judge of character japhet but what a dear little child is that fleta she may exclaim with youwho is my father yes we are both in much the same predicament and that it is which i believe has so much increased my attachment to her we are brother and sister in misfortune and a sister she ever shall be to me if such is the will of heaven but we must rise early tomorrow tim so goodnight yes tomorrow it will be juggle and tumbleeat fireumand so on as mr cophagus would have said so goodnight japhet the next morning we arrayed ourselves in our new habiliments mine were silk stockings shoes and white kerseymere kneed breeches a blue silk waistcoat loaded with tinsel and a short jacket to correspond of blue velvet a sash round my waist a hat and a plume of feathers timothy declared i looked very handsome and as the glass said the same as plain as it could speak i believed him timothys dress was a pair of wide turkish trousers and red jacket with spangles the others were much the same fleta was attired in small white satin turkish trousers blue muslin and silver embroidered frock worked sandals and her hair braided and plaited in long tails behind and she looked like a little sylph melchiors dress was precisely the same as mine and a more respectable company was seldom seen some musicians had been hired and handbills were now circulated all over the town stating that signor eugenio velotti with his company would have the honour of performing before the nobility and gentry the bill contained the fare which was to be provided and intimated the hour of the performance and the prices to be paid for the seats the performance was to take place in a very large room attached to the inn which previous to the decadence of the town had been used as an assemblyroom a platform was erected on the outside on which were placed the musicians and where we all occasionally made our appearance in our splendid dresses to attract the wonder of the people there we strutted up and down all but poor little fleta who appeared to shrink at the display from intuitive modesty when the music ceased a smart parley between melchior and me and philotas and timothy as the two fools would take place and melchior declared after the performance was over that we conducted ourselves to admiration pray mr philotas do me the favour to tell me how many people you think are now present said melchior to num in an imperative voice i dont know said num looking up with his idiotical melancholy face ha ha ha roared the crowd at nums stupid answer the fellows a fool said melchior to the gaping audience well then if he cant tell perhaps you may mr dionysius said i addressing tim how many sir do you want to know exactly and directly yes sir immediately without counting sir yes sir without counting well then sir i will tell and make no mistake theres exactly as many again as half ha ha ha from the crowd that wont do sir how many may be the half how many may be the half do you know yourself sir yes sir to be sure i do then theres no occasion for me to tell you ha ha ha well then sir continued melchior to philotas perhaps youll tell how many ladies and gentlemen we may expect to honour us with their company tonight how many sir yes sir how many im sure i dont know said num after a pause positively you are the greatest fool i ever met with said melchior well he does act the fool as natural as life observed the crowd what a stupid face he does put on perhaps you will be able to answer that question mr dionysius said i to tim yes sir i know exactly well sir lets hear in the first place all the pretty women will come and all the ugly ones stay away and as for the men all those who have got any money will be certain to come those who havent poor devils must stay outside suppose sir you make a bow to the ladies a very low one sir yes very low indeed tim bent his body to the ground and threw a somerset forward there sir i bowed so low that i came up on the other side ha ha capital from the crowd ive got a round turn in my back sir continued tim rubbing himself hadnt i better take it out again by all means tim threw a somerset backwards there sir alls right now one good turn deserves another now ill be off where are you going to sir going sir why i left my lollipop in the tinderbox and im going to fetch it ha ha ha strike up music and master jumbo commenced tumbling such was the elegant wit with which we amused and attracted the audience perhaps had we been more refined we should not have been so successful that evening we had the room as full as it could hold signor velotti alias melchior astonished them the cards appeared to obey his commandsrings were discovered in ladys shoeswatches were beat to a powder and made wholecanary birds flew out of eggs the audience were delighted the entertainment closed with fletas performance on the slack wire and certainly never was there anything more beautiful and graceful balanced on the wire in a continual waving motion her eyes fixed upon a point to enable her to maintain her position she performed several feats such as the playing with five oranges balancing swords c her extreme beautyher very picturesque and becoming dressher mournful expression and downcast eyesher gentle manner appeared to win the hearts of the audience and when she was assisted off from her perilous situation by melchior and me and made her graceful courtesy the plaudits were unanimous when the company dispersed i went to her intending to praise her but i found her in tears what is the matter my dear fleta o nothing dont say i have been cryingbut i cannot bear itso many people looking at me dont say a word to melchiori wont cry any more chapter xii it is very easy to humbug those who are so eager to be humbugged as people are in this world of humbugwe show ourselves excessively disinterested which astonishes everybody i kissed and consoled her she threw her arm round my neck and remained there with her face hid for some time we then joined the others at supper melchior was much pleased with our success and highly praised the conduct of timothy and myself which he pronounced was for the first attempt far beyond his expectations we continued to astonish all the good people of for five days when we discovered the indubitable fact that there was no more money to be extracted from their pockets upon which we resumed our usual clothes and smock frocks and with our bundles in our hands set off for another market town about fifteen miles distant there we were equally successful and melchior was delighted with our having proved such a powerful acquisition to his troop but not to dwell too long upon one subject i shall inform the reader that after a trip of six weeks during which we were very well received we once more returned to the camp which had located within five miles of our last scene of action every one was contentwe were all glad to get back and rest from our labours melchior was pleased with his profits poor little fleta overjoyed to be once more in the seclusion of her tent and nattee very glad to hear of our good fortune and to see her husband timothy and i had already proved ourselves so useful that melchior treated us with the greatest friendship and confidenceand he made us a present out of the gains for our exertions to me he gave ten and to timothy five pounds there japhet had you hired yourself i should not have paid you more than seven shillings per week finding you in food but you must acknowledge that for six weeks that is not bad pay however your earnings will depend upon our success and i rather think that we shall make a much better thing of it when next we start which will be in about a fortnight but we have some arrangements to make has timothy a good memory i think he has that is well i told you before that we are to try the wise manbut first we must have nattee in play tomorrow we will start for mentioning a small quiet town about four miles off we did so early the next morning and arrived about noon pitching our tents on the common not far from the town but in this instance we left all the rest of our gang behind melchiors own party and his two tents were all that were brought by the donkeys melchior and i dressed as countrymen went into the town at dusk and entered a respectable sort of inn taking our seats at one of the tables in the taproom and as we had already planned after we had called for beer commenced a conversation in the hearing of the others who were sitting drinking and smoking well i never will believe itits all cheat and trickery said melchior and they only do it to pick your pocket tell your fortune indeed i suppose she promised you a rich wife and halfadozen children no she did not replied i for i am too young to marry but she told me what i know has happened well what was that why she told me that my mother had married again and turned me out of doors to work for my bread but she might have heard that how could she no thats not possible but she told me i had a mole on my knee which was a sign of luck now how could she know that well i grant that was oddand pray what else did she promise you why she said that i should meet with my dearest friend tonight now that does puzzle me for i have but one in the world and he is a long way off well if you do meet your friend then ill believe her but if not it has been all guesswork and pray what did you pay for all thiswas it a shilling or did she pick your pocket thats what puzzles meshe refused to take anything i offered it again and again and she saidno that she would have no moneythat her gift was not to be sold well that is odd do you hear what this young man says said melchior addressing the others who had swallowed every word yes replied one but who is this person the queen of the gipsies i am told i never saw such a wonderful woman in my lifeher eye goes right through you i met her on the common and as she passed she dropped a handkerchief i ran back to give it her and then she thanked me and said open your hand and let me see the palm here are great lines and you will be fortunate and then she told me a great deal more and bid god bless me then if she said that she cannot have dealings with the devil observed melchior very oddvery strangetake no moneyqueen of the gipsies was echoed from all sides the landlady and the barmaid listened with wonder when who should come in as previously agreed but timothy i pretended not to see him but he came up to me seizing me by the hand and shaking it with apparent delight and crying wilson have you forgot smith smith cried i looking earnestly in his face why so it is how came you here i left dublin three days ago replied he but how i came here into this house is one of the strangest things that ever occurred i was walking over the common when a tall handsome woman looked at me and said young man if you will go into the third publichouse you pass you will meet an old friend who expects you i thought she was laughing at me but as it mattered very little in which house i passed the night i thought for the fun of the thing i might as well take her advice how strange cried melchior and she told him the samethat is he would meet a friend strangevery strangewonderfulastonishing was echoed from all quarters and the fame of the gipsy was already established timothy and i sat down together conversing as old friends and melchior went about from one to the other narrating the wonderful occurrence till past midnight when we all three took beds at the inn as if we were travellers the report which we had circulated that evening induced many people to go out to see nattee who appeared to take no notice of them and when asked to tell fortunes waved them away with her hand but although this plan of melchiors was for the first two or three days very expedient yet as it was not intended to last timothy who remained with me at the inn became very intimate with the barmaid and obtained from her most of the particulars of her life i also from repeated conversations with the landlady received information very important relative to herself and many of the families in the town but as the employment of nattee was for an ulterior object we contented ourselves with gaining all the information we could before we proceeded further after we had been there a week and the fame of the gipsy woman had been marvellously increasedmany things having been asserted of her which were indeed truly improbablemelchior agreed that timothy should persuade the barmaid to try if the gipsy woman would tell her fortune the girl with some trepidation agreed but at the same time expecting to be refused consented to walk with him over the common timothy advised her to pretend to pick up a sixpence when near to nattee and ask her if it did not belong to her and the barmaid acted upon his suggestions having just before that quitted the arm of timothy who had conducted her did you drop a sixpence i have picked up one said the girl trembling with fear as she addressed nattee child replied nattee who was prepared i have neither dropped a sixpence nor have you found onebut never mind that i know that which you wish and i know who you are now what would you with me is it to inquire whether the landlord and landlady of the golden lion intend to keep you in their service no replied the girl frightened at what she heard not to inquire that but to ask what my fortune will be open your palm pretty maid and i will tell you hah i see that you were born in the westyour father is deadyour mother is in serviceand let me seeyou have a brother at seanow in the west indies at this intelligence all of which as may be supposed had been gathered by us the poor girl was so frightened that she fell down in a swoon and timothy carried her off when she was taken home to the inn she was so ill that she was put into bed and what she did say was so incoherent that added to timothys narrative the astonishment of the landlady and others was beyond all bounds i tried very hard to bring the landlady but she would not consent and now nattee was pestered by people of higher condition who wished to hear what she would say here nattees powers were brought into play she would not refuse to see them but would not give answers till she had asked questions and as from us she had gleaned much general information so by making this knowledge appear in her questions to them she made them believe she knew more if a young person came to her she would immediately ask the nameof that name she had all the references acquired from us as to family and connections bearing upon them she would ask a few more and then give them an abrupt dismissal this behaviour was put up with from one of her commanding presence who refused money and treated those who accosted her as if she was their superior many came again and again telling her all they knew and acquainting her with every transaction of their life to induce her to prophesy for such she informed them was the surest way to call the spirit upon her by these means we obtained the secret history of the major part that is the wealthier part of the town of and although the predictions of nattee were seldom given yet when given they were given with such perfect and apparent knowledge of the parties that when she left which she did about six weeks after her first appearance the whole town rang with accounts of her wonderful powers it will appear strange that melchior would not permit nattee to reap a harvest which might have been great but the fact was that he only allowed the seed to be sown that a greater harvest might be gathered hereafter nattee disappeared the gipsies tent was no longer on the common and the grass which had been beaten down into a road by the feet of the frequent applicants to her was again permitted to spring up we also took our departure and rejoined the camp with nattee where we remained for a fortnight to permit the remembrance of her to subside a littleknowing that the appetite was alive and would not be satisfied until it was appeased after that time melchior timothy and i again set off for the town of and stopping at a superior inn in another part of the town dressed as travellers that is people who go about the country for orders from the manufacturers ordered our beds and supper in the coffeeroom the conversation was soon turned upon the wonderful powers of nattee the gipsy nonsense said melchior she knows nothing i have heard of her but there is a man coming this way should he happen to pass through this town who will surprise and frighten you no one knows who he is he is named the great aristodemus he knows the past the present and the future he never looks at peoples handshe only looks you in the face and woe be to them who tell him a lie otherwise he is goodtempered and obliging and will tell what will come to pass and his predictions never have been known to fail they say that he is hundreds of years old and his hair is white as silver at this information many expressed their doubts and many others vaunted the powers of the gipsy melchior replied that all he knew was that for the sum of two guineas paid down he had told him of a legacy left him of six hundred pounds which otherwise he would never have known of or received all the town of being quite alive for fortunetelling this new report gained wind and after a weeks sojourn melchior thought that the attempt should be made chapter xiii the seed having been carefully sown we now reap a golden harvestwe tell every body what they knew before and we are looked upon as most marvellous by most marvellous fools we accordingly packed up and departed to another market town timothy dressed in a sombre suit of black very much like an undertaker was provided with a horse with the following directions to proceed leisurely until he was within half a mile of the town of and then to gallop in as fast as he could stop at the best inn in the place and order apartments for the great aristodemus who might be expected in half an hour every thing in this world depends upon appearances that is when you intend to gull it and as every one in the town had heard of the great aristodemus so every one was anxious to know something about him and timothy was pestered with all manner of questions but he declared that he was only his courier and could only tell what other people said but then what other people said by timothys account was very marvellous indeed timothy had hardly time to secure the best rooms in the hotel when melchior dressed in a long flowing silk gown with a wig of long white hair a square cap and two or three gold chains hanging from his neck certainly most admirably disguised and attended by me in the dress of a german student a wig of long brown locks hanging down my shoulders made our appearance in a postchaise and four and drove up to the door of the inn at a pace which shook every house in the street and occasioned every window to be tenanted with one or more heads to ascertain the cause of this unusual occurrence for it was not a very great town although once of importance but the manufactures had been removed and it was occupied by those who had become independent by their own exertions or by those of their forefathers the door of the chaise was opened by the obsequious timothy who pushed away the ostlers and waiters as if unworthy to approach his master and the great aristodemus made his appearance as he ascended the steps of the door his passage was for a moment barred by one whose profession melchior well knew stand aside exciseman said he in a commanding voice no one crosses my path with impunity astonished at hearing his profession thus mentioned the exciseman who was the greatest bully in the town slipped on one side with consternation and all those present lifted up their eyes and hands with astonishment the great aristodemus gained his room and shut his door and i went out to pay for the chaise and order supper while timothy and the porters were busy with our luggage which was very considerable my master will not see any one said i to the landlord he quits this town tomorrow if the letters arrive which he expects by the post therefore pray get rid of this crowd and let him be quiet for he is very tired having travelled one hundred and fifty miles since the dawn of day when tim and i had performed this duty we joined melchior in his room leaving the news to be circulated this promises well observed melchior up to the present we have expended much time and money now we must see if we cannot recover it tenfold japhet you must take an opportunity of going out again after supper and make inquiries of the landlord what poor people they have in the town as i am very generous and like to relieve them you may observe that all the money offered to me for practising my art i give away to the poor having no occasion for it this i did and we then sat down to supper and having unpacked our baggage went to bed after locking the door of the room and taking out the key the next morning we had every thing in readiness and as the letters as the reader may suppose did not arrive by the post we were obliged to remain and the landlord ventured to hint to me that several people were anxious to consult my master i replied that i would speak to him but it was necessary to caution those who came that they must either offer goldor nothing at all i brought his consent to see one or two but no more now although we had various apparatus to use when required it was thought that the effect would be greater if in the first instance every thing was simple melchior therefore remained sitting at the table which was covered with a black cloth worked with curious devices and a book of hieroglyphics before him and an ivory wand tipped with gold lying by the book timothy standing at the door with a short roman sword buckled round his belt and i in a respectful attitude behind the great aristodemus the first person who was admitted was the lady of the mayor of the town nothing could be more fortunate as we had every information relative to her and her spouse for people in high places are always talked of aristodemus waved his hand and i brought forward a chair in silence and motioned that she should be seated aristodemus looked her in her face and then turned over several leaves until he fixed upon a page which he considered attentively mayoress of what wouldst thou with me she started and turned pale i would ask i know thou wouldst ask many things perhaps had i time to listen amongst others thou wouldst ask if there is any chance of thy giving an heir to thy husband is it not so yes it is replied the lady fetching her breath so do i perceive by this book but let me put one question to thee wouldst thou have blessings showered on thee yet do no good thou art wealthyyet what dost thou and thy husband do with these riches are ye liberal no give and it shall be given i have said aristodemus waved his hand and the lady rose to withdraw a guinea was in her fingers and her purse in her hand she took out four more and added them to the other and laid them on the table tis well lady charity shall plead for thee artolphe let that money be distributed among the poor i bowed in silence and the lady retired who will say that i do no good observed melchior smiling as soon as she was gone her avarice and that of her husband are as notorious as their anxiety for children now if i persuade them to be liberal i do service but you have given her hopes i have and the very hope will do more to further their wishes than anything else it is despair which too often prevents those who have no children from having any how often do you see a couple who after years waiting for children have at last given up their hope and resigned themselves to the dispensations of providence and then when their anxiety has subsided have obtained a family japhet i am a shrewd observer of human nature that i believe replied i but i do not believe your last remark to be correctbut timothy raps at the door another lady entered the room and then started back as if she would retreat so surprised was she at the appearance of the great aristodemus but as timothy had turned the key her escape was impossible she was unknown to us which was rather awkward but melchior raised his eyes from his book and waved his hand as before that she should be seated with some trepidation she stated that she was a widow whose dependence was upon an only son now at sea that she had not heard of him for a long while and was afraid that some accident had happened that she was in the greatest distressand continued she i have nothing to offer but this ring can you tell me if he is yet alive cried she bursting into tears but if you have not the art you pretend to o do not rob a poor friendless creature but let me depart when did you receive your last letter from him said melchior it is now seven monthsdated from bahia replied she pulling it out of her reticule and covering her face with her handkerchief melchior caught the address and then turned the letter over on the other side as it lay on the table mrs watson said he heavens do you know my name cried the woman mrs watson i do not require to read your sons letteri know its contents he then turned over his book and studied for a few seconds your son is alive thank god cried she clasping her hands and dropping her reticule but you must not expect his return too soonhe is well employed oh i care nothe is alivehe is alive god bless yougod bless you melchior made a sign to me pointing to the five guineas and the reticule and i contrived to slip them into her reticule while she sobbed in her handkerchief enough madam you must go for others require my aid the poor woman rose and offered the ring nay nay i want not thy money i take from the rich that i may distribute to the poorbut not from the widow in affliction open thy bag the widow took up her bag and opened it melchior dropped in the ring taking his wand from the table waved it and touched the bag as thou art honest so may thy present wants be relieved seek and thou shalt find the widow left the room with tears of gratitude and i must say that i was affected with the same when she had gone i observed to melchior that up to the present he had toiled for nothing very true japhet but depend upon it if i assisted that poor woman from no other feelings than interested motives i did well but i tell thee candidly i did it from compassion we are odd mixtures of good and evil i wage war with fools and knaves but not with all the world i gave that money freelyshe required it and it may be put as a setoff against my usual system of fraud or it may notat all events i pleased myself but you told her that her son was alive very true and he may be dead but is it not well to comfort hereven for a short time to relieve that suspense which is worse than the actual knowledge of his death sufficient for the day is the evil thereof it would almost have appeared that this good action of melchior met with its reward for the astonishment of the widow at finding the gold in her reticuleher narrative of what passed and her assertion which she firmly believed to be true that she had never left her reticule out of her hand and that melchior had only touched it with his wand raised his reputation to that degree that nothing else was talked about throughout the town and to crown all the next days post brought her a letter and remittances from her son and the grateful woman returned and laid ten guineas on the black cloth showering a thousand blessings upon melchior and almost worshipped him as a supernatural being this was a most fortunate occurrence and as melchior prophesied the harvest did now commence in four days we had received upwards of l and we then thought it time that we should depart the letters arrived which were expected and when we set off in a chaise and four the crowd to see us was so great that it was with difficulty we could pass through it chapter xiv in which melchior talks very much like an astrologer and tim and i return to our old trade of making up innocent prescriptions we had taken our horses for the next town but as soon as we were fairly on the road i stopped the boys and told them that the great aristodemus intended to observe the planets and stars that night and that they were to proceed to a common which i mentioned the postboys who were well aware of his fame and as fully persuaded of it as everybody else drove to the common we descended took off the luggage and received directions from melchior in their presence about the instruments to which the boys listened with open mouths and wonderment i paid them well and told them they might return which they appeared very glad to do they reported what had occurred and this simple method of regaining our camp added to the astonishment of the good town of when they were out of sight we resumed our usual clothes packed all up carried away most of our effects and hid the others in the furze to be sent for the next night not being more than two miles from the camp we soon arrived and were joyfully received by fleta and nattee as we walked across the common i observed to melchior i wonder if these stars have any influence upon mortals as it was formerly supposed most assuredly they have rejoined melchior i cannot read them but i firmly believe in them i made the above remark as i had often thought that such was melchiors idea yes continued he every man has his destinysuch must be the case it is known beforehand what is to happen to us by an omniscient being and being known what is it but destiny which cannot be changed it is fate continued he surveying the stars with his hand raised up and that fate is as surely written there as the sun shines upon us but the great book is sealed because it would not add to our happiness if then all is destiny or fate what inducement is there to do well or ill replied i we may commit all acts of evil and say that as it was predestined we could not help it besides would it be just that the omniscient being should punish us for those crimes which we cannot prevent and which are allotted to us by destiny japhet you argue well but you are in error because like most of those of the christian church you understand not the sacred writings nor did i until i knew my wife her creed is i believe correct and what is more adds weight to the truths of the bible i thought that gipsies had no religion you are not the only one who supposes so it is true that the majority of the tribe are held by the higher castes as serfs and are not instructed but withif i may use the expressionthe aristocracy of them it is very different and their creed i have adopted i should wish to hear their creed replied i hear it then original sin commenced in heavenwhen the angels rebelled against their godnot on earth i will grant that sin originated first in heaven do you think that a great a good god ever created any being for its destruction and eternal misery much less an angel did he not foresee their rebellion i grant it this world was not peopled with the image of god until after the fall of the angels it had its living beings its monsters perhaps but not a race of men with eternal souls but it was peopled as we see it now is to enable the legions of angels who fell to return to their former happy stateas a pilgrimage by which they might obtain their pardons and resume their seats in heaven not a child is born but the soul of some fallen cherub enters into the body to work out its salvation many do many do not and then they have their task to recommence anew for the spirit once created is immortal and cannot be destroyed and the almighty is all goodness and would ever pardon then you suppose there is no such thing as eternal punishment eternalno punishment there is but not eternal when the legions of angels fell some were not so perverse as others they soon reobtained their seats even when as children having passed through the slight ordeal they have been summoned back to heaven but others who from their infancy show how bad were their natures have many pilgrimages to perform before they can be purified this is in itself a punishment what other punishment they incur between their pilgrimages we know not but this is certain that no one was created to be punished eternally but all this is but assertion replied i where are your proofs in the bible some day or other i will show them to you but now we are at the camp and i am anxious to embrace nattee i thought for some time upon this singular creed one in itself not militating against religion but at the same time i could not call to mind any passages by which it could be supported still the idea was beautiful and i dwelt upon it with pleasure i have before observed and indeed the reader must have gathered from my narative that melchior was no common personage every day did i become more partial to him and more pleased with our erratic life what scruples i had at first gradually wore away the time passed quickly and although i would occasionally call to mind the original object of my setting forth i would satisfy myself by the reflection that there was yet sufficient time little fleta was now my constant companion when in the camp and i amused myself with teaching her to write and read japhet said timothy to me one day as we were cutting hazel broach wood in the forest i dont see that you get on very fast in your search after your father no tim i do not but i am gaining a knowledge of the world which will be very useful to me when i recommence the search and what is more i am saving a great deal of money to enable me to prosecute it what did melchior give you after we left twenty guineas which with what i had before make more than fifty and he gave me ten which makes twenty with what i had before seventy pounds is a large sum yes but soon spent tim we must work a little longer besides i cannot leave that little girlshe was never intended for a ropedancer i am glad to hear you say that japhet for i feel as you doshe shall share our fortunes a glorious prospect truly replied i laughing but never mind it would be better than her remaining here but how are we to manage that aye thats the rub but there is time enough to think about it when we intend to quit our present occupation well i understand from melchior that we are to start in a few days what is it to be japhet oh we shall be at homewe are to cure all diseases under the sun tomorrow we commence making pills so we may think ourselves with mr cophagus again well i do think we shall have some fun but i hope melchior wont make me take my own pills to prove their good qualitiesthat will be no joke o no num is kept on purpose for that what else is the fool good for the next week was employed as we anticipated boxes of pills of every size neatly labelled bottles of various mixtures chiefly stimulants were corked and packed up powders of anything were put in papers but at all events there was nothing hurtful in them all was ready and accompanied by num jumbo and fleta being left at home we set off melchior assuming the dress in which we had first met him in the wagon and altering his appearance so completely that he would have been taken for at least sixty years old we now travelled on foot with our dresses in bundles each carrying his own except num who was loaded like a packhorse and made sore lamentations cant you carry some of this no replied i it is your own luggage every one must carry his own well i never felt my spangled dress so heavy before where are we going only a little way replied timothy and then you will have nothing more to do i dont know that when master puts on that dress i have to swallow little things till im sick its all good for your health num im very well i thanke replied the poor fellow but im very hot and very tired chapter xv in which timothy makes a grand speech quite as true as those delivered from the hustingsmelchior like the candidate states his pretentions for public favour and the public as usual swallow the bait fortunately for poor num we were not far from the market town at which we intended to open our campaign which we did the next morning by num and timothy sallying forth the former with a large trumpet in his hand and the latter riding on a donkey on their arrival at the marketplace num commenced blowing it with all his might while timothy in his spangled dress as soon as they had collected a crowd stood upon his saddle and harangued the people as follows gentlemen and ladiesi

that the wonderful doctor appallacheosmocommetico has vouchsafed to stop here and confer his blessings upon the inhabitants of this town hereupon num again blew the trumpet till he was black in the face and timothy dropping on his donkey rode away to other parts of the town where he repeated his grandiloquent announcement followed as may be supposed by a numerous cortege of little ragged boys about four oclock in the afternoon melchior made his appearance in the marketplace attended by me dressed as a german student timothy and num in their costumes a stage had been already prepared and the populace had crowded round it more with the intention of laughing than of making purchases the various packets were opened and arranged in front of the platform i standing on one side of melchior timothy on the other and num with his trumpet holding on by one of the scaffold poles at the corner sound the trumpet philotas said melchior taking off his threecornered hat and making a low bow to the audience at every blast pray mr fool do you know why you sound the trumpet im sure i dont know replied num opening his goggle eyes do you know mr dionysius yes sir i can guess explain then to the gentlemen and ladies who have honoured us with their presence because sir trumpets are always sounded before great conquerors very true sir but how am i a great conqueror you have conquered death sir and hes a very rum customer to have to deal with dionysius you have answered well and shall have some bullocks liver for your supperdont forget to remind me in case i forget it no that i wont sir replied timothy rubbing his stomach as if delighted with the idea ladies and gentlemen said melchior to the audience who were on the broad grin i see your mouths are all open and are waiting for the pills but be not too impatienti cannot part with my medicines unless you have diseases which require their aid and i should indeed be a sorry doctor if i prescribed without knowing your complaints est neutrale genus signans rem non animatam says herodotus which in english means what is one mans meat is another mans poison and further he adds ut jecur ut onus put ut occiput which is as much as to say that what agrees with one temperament will be injurious to another caution therefore becomes very necessary in the use of medicine and my reputation depends upon my not permitting any one to take what is not good for him and now my very dear friends i will first beg you to observe the peculiar qualities of the contents of this little phial you observe that there is not more than sixty drops in it yet will these sixty drops add ten years to a mans lifefor it will cure him of almost as many diseases in the first place are any of you troubled with the ascites or dropsy which as the celebrated galen hath declared may be divided into three parts the ascites the anasarca and the tympanites the diagnostics of this disease are swelling of the abdomen or stomach difficulty of breathing want of appetite and a teasing cough i say have any of you this disease none then i thank heaven that you are not so afflicted the next disease it is good for is the peripneumonia or inflammation on the lungsthe diagnostics or symptoms of which are a small pulse swelling of the eyes and redness of the face say have any of you these symptomsif so you have the disease no one i thank heaven that you are none of you so afflicted it is also a sovereign remedy for the diarrhoea the diagnostics of which are faintness frequent gripings rumbling in the bowels cold sweats and spasm here one man came forward and complained of frequent gripingsanother of rumbling in the bowels and two or three more of cold sweats it is well o i thank heaven that i am here to administer to you myself for what says hippocrates relativum cum antecedente concordat which means that remedies quickly applied kill the disease in its birth here my friends take ittake itpay me only one shilling and be thankful when you go to rest fail not to offer up your prayers it is also a sovereign remedy for the dreadful chiragra or gout i cured the whole corporation of city aldermen last week by their taking three bottles each and they presented me with the freedom of the city of london in a gold box which i am sorry that i have forgotten to bring with me now the chiragra may be divided into several varieties gonagra when it attacks the kneeschiragra if in the handsonagra if in the elbowomagra if in the shoulder and lumbago if in the back all these are varieties of gout and for all these the contents of this little bottle is a sovereign remedy and observe it will keep for ever twenty years hence when afflicted in your old ageand the time will come my good peopleyou may take down this little phial from the shelf and bless the hour in which you spent your shilling for as eusebius declares verbum personale concordat cum nominativo which is as much as to say the active will grow old and suffer from pains in their limbs who then has pains in his limbs or lumbago who indeed can say that he will not have them after this appeal the number of those who had pains in their limbs or who wished to provide against such a disease proved so great that all our phials were disposed of and the doctor was obliged to promise that in a few days he would have some more of this invaluable medicine ready ladies and gentlemen i shall now offer to your notice a valuable plaister the effects of which are miraculous dionysius come hither you have felt the benefit of this plaister tell your case to those who are present and mind you tell the truth hereupon timothy stepped forward ladies and gentlemen upon my honour about three weeks back i fell off the scaffold broke my back bone into three pieces and was carried off to a surgeon who looked at me and told the people to take measure for my coffin the great doctor was not there at the time having been sent for to consult with the kings physicians upon the queens case of cophagus or intermitting mortification of the great toe but fortunately just as they were putting me into a shell my master came back and immediately applying his sovereign plaister to my back in five days i was able to sit up and in ten days i returned to my duty are you quite well now dionysius quite well sir and my back is like whalebone try it hereupon dionysius threw two somersets forward two backward walked across the stage on his hands and tumbled in every direction you see gentlemen im quite well now and what i have said i assure you on my honour to be a fact i hope youll allow that to be a very pretty cure said the doctor appealing to the audience and i hardly need say that for sprains bruises contusions wrenches and dislocations this plaister is infallible and i will surprise you more by telling you that i can sell it for eightpence a sheet the plaister went off rapidly and was soon expended the doctor went on describing his other valuable articles and when he came to his cosmetics c for women we could not hand them out fast enough and now said the doctor i must bid you farewell for this evening im glad of that said timothy for now i mean to sell my own medicine your medicine mr dionysius what do you mean by that mean sir i mean to say that ive got a powder of my own contriving which is a sovereign remedy remedy sir for what why its a powder to kill fleas and whats more its just as infallible as your own have you indeed and pray sir how did you hit upon the invention sir i discovered it in my sleep by accident but i have proved it and i will say if properly administered it is quite as infallible as any of yours ladies and gentlemen i pledge you my honour that it will have the effect desired and all i ask is sixpence a powder but how is it to be used sir usedwhy like all other powders but i wont give the directions till i have sold some promising however if my method does not succeed to return the money well that is fair mr dionysius and i will take care that you keep your bargain will anybody purchase the fools powder for killing fleas yes i will replied a man on the broad grin heres sixpence now then fool how am i to use it use it said timothy putting the sixpence in his pocket ill explain to you you must first catch the flea hold him so tight between the forefinger and thumb as to force him to open his mouth when his mouth is open you must put a very little of this powder into it and it will kill him directly why when i have the flea as tight as you state i may as well kill him myself very true so you may if you prefer it but if you do not you may use this powder which upon my honour is infallible this occasioned a great deal of mirth among the bystanders timothy kept his sixpence and our exhibition for this day ended very much to the satisfaction of melchior who declared he had taken more than ever he had done before in a whole week indeed the whole sum amounted to l s all taken in shillings and sixpences for articles hardly worth the odd shillings in the account so we sat down to supper with anticipations of a good harvest and so it proved we stayed four days at this town and then proceeded onwards when the like success attended us timothy and i being obliged to sit up nearly the whole night to label and roll up pills and mix medicines which we did in a very scientific manner nor was it always that melchior presided he would very often tell his audience that business required his attendance elsewhere to visit the sick and that he left the explanation of his medicines and their properties to his pupil who was far advanced in knowledge with my prepossessing appearance i made a great effect more especially among the ladies and timothy exerted himself so much when with me that we never failed to bring home to melchior a great addition to his earningsso much so that at last he only showed himself pretended that he was so importuned to visit sick persons that he could stay no longer and then left us after the first half hour to carry on the business for him after six weeks of uninterrupted success we returned to the camp which as usual was not very far off chapter xvi important news but not communicateda dissolution of partnership takes place melchiors profits had been much more than he anticipated and he was very liberal to timothy and myself indeed he looked upon me as his right hand and became more intimate and attached every day we were of course delighted to return to the camp after our excursion there was so much continued bustle and excitement in our peculiar profession that a little quiet was delightful and i never felt more happy than when fleta threw herself into my arms and nattee came forward with her usual dignity and grace but with more than usual condescendence and kindness bidding me welcome home homealas it was never meant for my home or poor fletasand that i felt it was our sojourn for a time and no more we had been more than a year exercising our talents in this lucrative manner when one day as i was sitting at the entrance to the tent with a book in my hand out of which fleta was reading to me a gipsy not belonging to our gang made his appearance he was covered with dust and the dew drops hanging on his dark forehead proved that he had travelled fast he addressed nattee who was standing by in their own language which i did not understand but i perceived that he asked for melchior after an exchange of a few sentences nattee expressed astonishment and alarm put her hands over her face and removed them as quickly as if derogatory in her to show emotion and then remained in deep thought perceiving melchior approaching the gipsy hastened to him and they were soon in animated conversation in ten minutes it was over the gipsy went to the running brook washed his face took a large draught of water and then hastened away and was soon out of sight melchior who had watched the departure of the gipsy slowly approached us i observed him and nattee as they met as i was certain that something important had taken place melchior fixed his eyes upon natteeshe looked at him mournfullyfolded her arms and made a slight bow as if in submission and in a low voice quoted from the scriptures whither thou goest i will gothy people shall be my people and thy god my god he then walked away with her they sat down apart and were in earnest conversation for more than an hour japhet said melchior to me after he had quitted his wife what i am about to tell you will surprise you i have trusted you with all i dare trust any one but there are some secrets in every mans life which had better be reserved for himself and her who is bound to him by solemn ties we must now part in a few days this camp will be broken up and these people will join some other division of the tribe for me you will see me no more ask me not to explain for i cannot and nattee said i will follow my fortunes whatever they may beyou will see her no more for myself i care not melchior the world is before me and remain with the gipsies without you i will not but answer me one questionwhat is to become of little fleta is she to remain with the tribe to which she does not belong or does she go with you melchior hesitated i hardly can answer but what consequence can the welfare of a soldiers brat be to you allowing her to be what you assert melchior i am devotedly attached to that child and could not bear that she should remain here i am sure that you deceived me in what you stated for the child remembers and has told me anecdotes of her infancy which proves that she is of no mean family and that she has been stolen from her friends indeed is her memory so good replied melchior firmly closing his teeth to nattee or to me she has never hinted so much that is very probable but a stolen child she is melchior and she must not remain here must not yes must not melchior when you quit the tribe you will no longer have any power nor can you have any interest about her she shall then chooseif she will come with me i will take her and nothing shall prevent me and in so doing i do you no injustice nor do i swerve in my fidelity how do you know that i may have my secret reasons against it surely you can have no interest in a soldiers brat melchior melchior appeared confused and annoyed she is no soldiers brat i acknowledge japhet that the child was stolen but you must not therefore imply that the child was stolen by me or by my wife i never accused you or thought you capable of it and that is the reason why i am now surprised at the interest you take in her if she prefers to go with you i have no more to say but if not i claim her and if she consents will resist your interference japhet replied melchior after a pause we must not quarrel now that we are about to part i will give you an answer in half an hour melchior returned to nattee and recommenced a conversation with her while i hastened to fleta fleta do you know that the camp is to be broken up and melchior and nattee leave it together indeed replied she with surprise then what is to become of you and timothy we must of course seek our fortunes where we can and of me continued she looking me earnestly in the face with her large blue eyes am i to stay here continued she with alarm in her countenance not if you do not wish it fleta as long as i can support you i willthat is if you would like to live with me in preference to melchior if i would like japhet you must know i would likewho has been so kind to me as you dont leave me japhet i will not fleta but on condition that you promise to be guided by me and to do all i wish to do what you wish is the greatest pleasure that i have japhetso i may safely promise that what has happened that i do not know more than yourself but melchior tells me that he and nattee quit the gipsy tents for ever fleta looked round to ascertain if any one was near us and then in a low tone said i understand their language japhet that is a great deal of it although they do not think so and i overheard what the gipsy said in part although he was at some distance he asked for melchior and when nattee wanted to know what he wanted he answered that he was dead then nattee covered up her face i could not hear all the rest but there was something about a horse he was dead had then melchior committed murder and was obliged to fly the country this appeared to me to be the most probable when i collected the facts in my possession and yet i could not believe it for except that system of deceit necessary to carry on his various professions i never found anything in melchiors conduct which could be considered as criminal on the contrary he was kind generous and upright in his private dealings and in many points proved that he had a good heart he was a riddle of inconsistency it was certain professionally he would cheat anybody and disregard all truth and honesty but in his private character he was scrupulously honest and with the exception of the assertion relative to fletas birth and parentage he had never told me a lie that i could discover i was summing up all these reflections in my mind when melchior again came up to me and desiring the little girl to go away he said japhet i have resolved to grant your request with respect to fleta but it must be on conditions let me hear them first then japhet as you always have been honest and confiding with me tell me now what are your intentions do you mean to follow up the profession which you learnt under me or what do you intend to do honestly then melchior i do not intend to follow up that profession unless driven to it by necessity i intend to seek my father and if driven to it by necessity do you intend that fleta shall aid you by her acquirements in short do you mean to take her with you as a speculation to make the most of her to let her sink when she arrives at the age of woman into vice and misery i wonder at your asking me that question melchior it is the first act of injustice i have received at your hands no if obliged to follow up the profession i will not allow fleta so to do i would sooner that she were in her grave it is to rescue her from that very vice and misery to take her out of a society in which she never ought to have been placed that i take her with me and this upon your honour yes upon my honour i love her as my sister and cannot help indulging in the hope that in seeking my father i may chance to stumble upon hers melchior bit his lips there is another promise i must exact from you japhet which is that to a direction which i will give you every six months you will inclose an address where you may be heard of and also intelligence as to fletas welfare and health to that i gave my cheerful promise but melchior you appear to have taken all at once a strange interest in this little girl i wish you now to think that i do take an interest in her provided you seek not to inquire the why and the wherefore will you accept of funds for her maintenance not without necessity compels me and then i should be glad to find when i can no longer help her that you are still her friend recollect that you will always find what is requisite by writing to the address which i shall give you before we part that point is now settled and on the whole i think the arrangement is good timothy had been absent during the events of the morningwhen he returned i communicated to him what had passed and was about to take place well japhet i dont knowi do not dislike our present life yet i am not sorry to change it but what are we to do that remains to be considered we have a good stock of money fortunately and we must husband it till we find what can be done we took our suppers all together for the last time melchior telling us that he had determined to set off the next day nattee looked very melancholy but resigned on the contrary little fleta was so overjoyed that her face generally so mournful was illuminated with smiles whenever our eyes met it was delightful to see her so happy the whole of the people in the camp had retired and melchior was busy making his arrangements in the tent i did not feel inclined to sleep i was thinking and revolving in my mind my prospects for the future sitting or rather lying down for i was leaning on my elbow at a short distance from the tents the night was dark but clear and the stars were brilliant i had been watching them and i thought upon melchiors ideas of destiny and dwelling on the futile wish that i could read mine when i perceived the approach of nattee japhet said she you are to take the little girl with you i findwill you be careful of her for it would be on my conscience if she were left to the mercy of the world she departs rejoicing let not her joy end in tears i depart sorrowing i leave my people my kin my habits and customs my influence allbut it must be so it is my destiny she is a good child japhetpromise me that you will be a friend to herand give her this to wear in remembrance of me butnot yetnot till we are gone she hesitated japhet do not let melchior see it in your possession he may not like me having given it away i took the piece of paper containing the present and having promised all she required this is the lastyesthe very last time that i may behold this scene continued nattee surveying the common the tents and the animals browsing be it so japhet goodnight may you prosper she then turned away and entered her tent and soon afterwards i followed her example the next day melchior was all ready what he had packed up was contained in two small bundles he addressed the people belonging to the gang in their own language nattee did the same and the whole of them kissed her hand the tents furniture and the greatest part of his other property were distributed among them jumbo and num were made over to two of the principal men timothy fleta and i were also ready and intended to quit at the same time as melchior and his wife japhet said melchior there is yet some money due to you for our last excursionthis was truehere it is you and timothy keep but one purse i am aware goodbye and may you prosper we shook hands with nattee and melchior fleta went up to the former and crossing her arms bent her head nattee kissed the child and led her to melchior he stooped down kissed her on the forehead and i perceived a sign of strongly suppressed emotion as he did so our intended routes lay in a different direction and when both parties had arrived to either verge of the common we waved our hands as a last farewell and resumed our paths again fleta burst into tears as she turned away from her former guardians chapter xvii a cabinet councili resolve to set up as a gentleman having as legitimate pretensions to the rank of one as many others i led the little sobbing girl by the hand and we proceeded for some time in silence it was not until we gained the high road that timothy interrupted my reverie by observing japhet have you at all made up your mind what you shall do i have been reflecting timothy we have lost a great deal of time the original intention with which i left london has been almost forgotten but it must be so no longer i now have resolved that as soon as i have placed this poor little girl in safety that i will prosecute my search and never be diverted from it i cannot agree with you that we have lost time japhet we had very little money when we started upon our expedition and now we have sufficient to enable you to prosecute your plans for a long time the question is in what direction we quitted london and travelled west in imitation as we thought of the wise men with all deference in my opinion it was like two fools i have been thinking upon that point also tim and i agree with you i expect from several causes which you know as well as i do to find my father among the higher classes of society and the path we took when we started has led us into the very lowest it appears to me that we cannot do better than retrace our steps we have the means now to appear as gentlemen and to mix in good company and london is the very best place for us to repair to that is precisely my opinion japhet with one single exception which i will mention to you but first tell me have you calculated what our joint purses may amount to it must be a very considerable sum i had not examined the packet in which was the money which melchior had given me at parting i now opened it and found to my surprise that there were bank notes to the amount of one hundred pounds i felt that he had given me this large sum that it might assist me in fletas expenses with this sum said i i cannot have much less than two hundred and fifty pounds and i have more than sixty said timothy really the profession was not unprofitable no replied i laughing but recollect tim that we had no outlay the public provided us with food our lodging cost us nothing we have had no taxes to pay and at the same time have taxed folly and credulity to a great extent thats true japhet and although i am glad to have the money i am not sorry that we have abandoned the profession nor am i tim if you please we will forget it altogether but tell me what was the exception you were about to make simply this although upwards of three hundred pounds may be a great deal of money yet if we are to support the character and appearance of gentlemen it will not last for ever for instance we must have our valets what an expense that will be our clothes toowe shall soon lose our rank and station in society without we obtain a situation under government we must make it last as long as we can timothy and trust to good fortune to assist us thats all very well japhet but i had rather trust to our own prudence now hear what i have to say you will be as much assisted by a trusty valet as by any other means i shall as a gentleman be only an expense and an incumbrance but as a valet i shall be able to play into your hands at the same time more than one half the expense will be avoided with your leave therefore i will take my proper situation put on your livery and thereby make myself of the greatest use i could not help acknowledging the advantages to be derived from this proposal of timothys but i did not like to accept it it is very kind of you timothy replied i but i can only look upon you as a friend and an equal there you are right and are wrong in the same breath you are right in looking upon me as a friend japhet and you would be still more right in allowing me to prove my friendship as i propose but you are wrong in looking upon me as an equal for i am not so either in personal appearance education or anything else we are both foundlings it is true but you were christened after abraham newland and i after the workhouse pump you were a gentleman foundling presenting yourself with a fifty pound note and good clothes i made my appearance in rags and misery if you find your parents you will rise in the world if i find mine i shall in all probability have no reason to be proud of them i therefore must insist upon having my own choice in the part i am to play in the drama and i will prove to you that it is my right to choose you forget that when we started your object was to search after your father and i told you mine should be to look after my mother you have selected high life as the expected sphere in which he is to be found and i select low life as that in which i am most likely to discover the object of my search so you perceive continued tim laughing that we must arrange so as to suit the views of both without parting company do you hunt among bagwigs amberheaded canes silks and satinsi will burrow among tags and tassels dimity and mob caps and probably we shall both succeed in the object of our search i leave you to hunt in the drawingrooms while i ferret in the kitchen you may throw yourself on a sofa and exclaimwho is my father while i will sit in the cooks lap and ask her if she may happen to be my mother this sally of timothys made even fleta laugh and after a little more remonstrance i consented that he should perform the part of my valet indeed the more i reflected upon it the greater appeared the advantages which might accrue from the arrangement by the time that this point had been settled we had arrived at the town to which we directed our steps and took up our quarters at an inn of moderate pretensions but of very great external cleanliness my first object was to find out some fitting asylum for little fleta the landlady was a buxom goodtempered young woman and i gave the little girl into her charge while timothy and i went out on a survey i had made up my mind to put her to some good but not very expensive school if such were to be found in the vicinity i should have preferred taking her with me to london but i was aware how much more expensive it would be to provide for her there and as the distance from the metropolis was but twenty miles i could easily run down to see her occasionally i desired the little girl to call me her brother as such i intended to be to her in future and not to answer every question they might put to her there was however little occasion for this caution for fleta was as i before observed very unlike children in general i then went out with timothy to look for a tailor that i might order our clothes as what we had on were not either of the very best taste or in the very best condition we walked up the main street and soon fell in with a tailors shop over which was written in large lettersfeodor shneider tailor to his royal highness the prince of darmstadt will that do japhet said timothy pointing to the announcement why yes replied i but how the deuce the prince of darmstadt should have employed a man in a small country town as his tailor is to me rather a puzzle perhaps he made his clothes when he was in germany replied tim perhaps he did but however he shall have the honour of making mine we entered the shop and i ordered a suit of the most fashionable clothes choosing my colours and being very minute in my directions to the foreman who measured me but as i was leaving the shop the master judging by my appearance which was certainly not exactly that of a gentleman ventured to observe that it was customary with gentlemen whom they had not the honour of knowing to leave a deposit although the very proposal was an attack upon my gentility i made no reply but pulling out a handful of guineas laid down two on the counter and walked away that i might find another shop at which we might order the livery of timothy but this was only as a reconnoitre as i did not intend to order his liveries until i could appear in my own clothes which were promised on the afternoon of the next day there were however several other articles to be purchased such as a trunk portmanteau hat gloves c all which we procured and then went back to the inn on my return i ordered dinner fleta was certainly clad in her best frock but bad was the best and the landlady who could extract little from the child could not imagine who we could be i had however allowed her to see more than sufficient money to warrant our expenses and so far her scruples were although her curiosity was not removed that evening i had a long conversation with fleta i told her that we were to part that she must go to school and that i would very often come down to see her at first she was inconsolable at the idea but i reasoned with her and the gentle intelligent creature acknowledged that it was right the next day my clothes came home and i dressed myself without flattery japhet said timothy you do look very much like a gentleman fleta smiled and said the same i thought so too but said nothing putting on my hat and gloves and accompanied by timothy i descended to go out and order tims liveries as well as a fitout for fleta after i was out in the street i discovered that i had left my handkerchief and returned to fetch it the landlady seeing a gentleman about to enter the inn made a very low courtesy and it was not until i looked hard at her that she recognised me then i was satisfied it was an involuntary tribute to my appearance worth all the flattering assertions in the world we now proceeded to the other tailors in the main street i entered the shop with a flourishing important air and was received with many bows i wish said i to have a suit of livery made for this young man who is about to enter into my service i cannot take him up to town this figure the livery was chosen and as i expressed my wish to be off the next evening it was promised to be ready by an hour appointed i then went to a milliners and desired that she would call at the inn to fit out a little girl for school whose wardrobe had been left behind by mistake on the fourth day all was ready i had made inquiries and found out a very respectable school kept by a widow lady i asked for references which were given and i was satisfied the terms were lowtwenty pounds per annum i paid the first half year in advance and lodged fifty guineas more in the hands of a banker taking a receipt for it and giving directions that it was to be paid to the schoolmistress as it became due i took this precaution that should i be in poverty myself at all events fleta might be provided in clothes and schooling for three years at least the poor child wept bitterly at the separation and i could with difficulty detach her little arms from my neck and i felt when i left her as if i had parted with the only valuable object to me on earth all was now ready but timothy did not as yet assume his new clothes it would have appeared strange that one who sat at my table should afterwards put on my livery and as in a small town there is always plenty of scandal for fletas sake if for no other reason it was deferred until our arrival in london wishing the landlady goodbye who i really believed would have given up her bill to have known who we could possibly be we got on the outside of the stagecoach and in the evening arrived in the metropolis i have been particular in describing all these little circumstances as it proves how very awkward it is to jump without observation from one station in society to another chapter xviii i receive a letter from my uncle by which i naturally expect to find out who is my fatherlike other outcasts i am warned by a dream but i have omitted to mention a circumstance of great importance which occurred at the inn the night before i placed fleta at the boardingschool in looking over my portmanteau i perceived the present of nattee to fleta which i had quite forgotten i took it to fleta and told her from whom it came on opening the paper it proved to contain a long chain of round coral and gold beads strung alternately the gold beads were not so large as the coral but still the number of them and the purity of the metal made them of considerable value fleta passed the beads through her fingers and then threw it round her neck and sat in deep thought for some minutes japhet said she at last i have seen thisi have worn this beforei recollect that i have it rushes into my memory as an old friend and i think that before morning it will bring to my mind something that i shall recollect about it try all you can fleta and let me know tomorrow its no use trying if i try i never can recollect anything i must wear it tonight and then i shall have something come into my mind all of a sudden or perhaps i may dream something goodnight it immediately occurred to me that it was most probable that the chain had been on fletas neck at the time that she was stolen from her parents and might prove the means of her being identified it was no common chainapparently had been wrought by people in a state of semirefinement there was too little show for its valuetoo much sterling gold for the simple effect produced and i very much doubted whether another like it could be found the next morning fleta was too much affected at parting with me to enter into much conversation i asked whether she had recollected anything and she replied no that she had cried all night at the thoughts of our separation i cautioned her to be very careful of the chain and i gave the same caution to the schoolmistress and after i had left the town i regretted that i had not taken it away and deposited it in some place of security i resolved to do so when i next saw fleta in the meantime she would be able perhaps by association to call up some passage of her infancy connected with it i had inquired of a gentleman who sat near me on the coach which was the best hotel for a young man of fashion he recommended the piazza in covent garden and to that we accordingly repaired i selected handsome apartments and ordered a light supper when the table was laid timothy made his appearance in his livery and cut a very smart dashing figure i dismissed the waiter and as soon as we were alone i burst into a fit of laughter really timothy this is a good farce come sit down and help me to finish this bottle of wine no sir replied timothy with your permission i prefer doing as the rest of my fraternity you only leave the bottle on the sideboard and i will steal as much as i want but as for sitting down that will be making too free and if we were seen would be moreover very dangerous we must both keep up our characters they have been plying me with all manner of questions below as to who you wereyour name c i resolved that i would give you a lift in the world and i stated that you had just arrived from making a grand tourwhich is not a fib after alland as for your name i said that you were at present incog but why did you make me incog because it may suit you so to be and it certainly is the truth for you dont know your real name we were here interrupted by the waiter bringing in a letter upon a salver here is a letter addressed to i or jn on his return from his tour sir said he i presume it is for you you may leave it said i with nonchalance the waiter laid the letter on the table and retired how very odd timothythis letter cannot be for me and yet they are my initials it is as much like a j as an i depend upon it it is some fellow who has just gained this intelligence below and has written to ask for a subscription to his charity list imagining that i am flush of money and liberal i suppose so replied tim however you may just as well see what he says but if i open it he will expect something i had better refuse it o no leave that to me i know how to put people off after all it is a fine thing to be a gentleman and be petitioned i broke open the seal and found that the letter contained an inclosure addressed to another person the letter was as follows my dear nephewbravo sir said timothy youve found an uncle alreadyyoull soon find a father from the great uncertainty of the post i have not ventured to do more than hint at what has come to light during this last year but as it is necessary that you should be acquainted with the whole transaction and as you had not decided when you last wrote whether you would prosecute your intended three months trip to sicily or return from milan you may probably arrive when i am out of town i therefore enclose you a letter to mr masterton directing him to surrender to you a sealed packet lodged in his hands containing all the particulars the letters which bear upon them and what has been proposed to avoid exposure which you may peruse at your leisure should you arrive before my return to town there is no doubt but that the affair may be hushed up and we trust that you will see the prudence of the measure as once known it will be very discreditable to the family escutcheon i always had an idea you were of good family interrupted tim i wish you had followed my advice and had not returned but as you were positive on that point i beg you will now consider the propriety of remaining incognito as reports are already abroad and your sudden return will cause a great deal of surmise your long absence at the gottingen university and your subsequent completion of your grand tour will have effaced all remembrance of your person and you can easily be passed off as a particular friend of mine and i can introduce you everywhere as such take then any name you may please provided it be not smith or brown or such vulgarisms and on the receipt of this letter write a note and send it to my house in portman square just saying so and so is arrived this will prevent the servants from obtaining any information by their prying curiosity and as i have directed all my letters to be forwarded to my seat in worcestershire i shall come up immediately that i receive it and by your putting the name which you mean to assume i shall know whom to ask for when i call at the hotel your affectionate uncle windermear one thing is very clear timothy said i laying the letter on the table that it cannot be intended for me how do you know sir that this lord is not your uncle at all events you must do as he bids you whatgo for the papers most certainly i shall not then how in the name of fortune do you expect to find your father when you will not take advantage of such an opportunity of getting into society it is by getting possession of other peoples secrets that you will worm out your own but it is dishonest timothy a letter is addressed to you in which you have certain directions you break the seal with confidence and you read what you find is possibly not for you but depend upon it japhet that a secret obtained is one of the surest roads to promotion recollect your position cut off from the world you have to reunite yourself with it to recover your footing and create an interest you have not those who love you to help youyou must not scruple to obtain your object by fear that is a melancholy truth tim replied i and i believe i must put my strict morality in my pocket do sir pray until you can afford to be moral its a very expensive virtue that a deficiency of it made you an outcast from the world you must not scruple at a slight deficiency on your own part to regain your position there was so much shrewdness so much of the wisdom of the serpent in the remarks of timothy that added to my ardent desire to discover my father which since my quitting the gipsy camp had returned upon me with twofold force my scruples were overcome and i resolved that i would not lose such an opportunity still i hesitated and went up into my room that i might reflect upon what i should do i went to bed revolving the matter in my mind and turning over from one position to the other at one time deciding that i would not take advantage of the mistake at another quite as resolved that i would not throw away such an opening for the prosecution of my search at last i fell into an uneasy slumber and had a strange dream i thought that i was standing upon an isolated rock with the waters raging around me the tide was rising and at last the waves were roaring at my feet i was in a state of agony and expected that in a short time i should be swallowed up the main land was not far off and i perceived welldressed people in crowds who were enjoying themselves feasting dancing and laughing in merry peals i held out my handsi shouted to themthey saw and heard me but heeded me not my horror at being swept away by the tide was dreadful i shrieked as the water rose at last i perceived something unroll itself from the main land and gradually advancing to the inland form a bridge by which i could walk over and be saved i was about to hasten over when private and no thoroughfare appeared at the end nearest me in large letters of fire i started back with amazement and would not dared not pass them when all of a sudden a figure in white appeared by my side and said to me pointing to the bridge selfpreservation is the first law of nature i looked at the person who addressed me gradually the figure became darker and darker until it changed to mr cophagus with his stick up to his nose japhet all nonsensevery good bridgeumwalk overfind fatherand so on i dashed over the bridge which appeared to float on the water and to be composed of paper gained the other side and was received with shouts of congratulation and the embraces of the crowd i perceived an elderly gentleman come forward i knew it was my father and i threw myself into his arms i awoke and found myself rolling on the floor embracing the bolster with all my might such was the vivid impression of this dream that i could not turn my thoughts away from it and at last i considered that it was a divine interposition all my scruples vanished and before the day had dawned i determined that i would follow the advice of timothy an enthusiast is easily led to believe what he wishes and he mistakes his own feelings for warnings the dreams arising from his daily contemplations for the interference of heaven he thinks himself armed by supernatural assistance and warranted by the almighty to pursue his course even if that course should be contrary to the almightys precepts thus was i led away by my own imaginings and thus was my monomania increased to an impetus which forced before it all consideration of what was right or wrong chapter xix an important chapteri make some important acquaintances obtain some important papers which i am importunate to read through the next morning i told my dream to timothy who laughed very heartily at my idea of the finger of providence at last perceiving that i was angry with him he pretended to be convinced when i had finished my breakfast i sent to inquire the number in the square of lord windermears town house and wrote the following simple note to his lordship japhet newland has arrived from his tour at the piazza covent garden this was confided to timothy and i then set off with the other letter to mr masterton which was addressed to lincolns inn by reading the addresses of the several legal gentlemen i found out that mr masterton was located on the first floor i rang the bell which had the effect of open sesame as the door appeared to swing to admit me without any assistance i entered an anteroom and from thence found myself in the presence of mr mastertona little old man with spectacles on his nose sitting at a table covered with papers he offered me a chair and i presented the letter i see that i am addressing mr neville said he after he had perused the letter i congratulate you on your return you may not perhaps remember me indeed sir i cannot say that i do exactly i could not expect it my dear sir you have been so long away you have very much improved in person i must say yet still i recollect your features as a mere boy without compliment i had no idea that you would ever have made so handsome a man i bowed to the compliment have you heard from your uncle i had a few lines from lord windermear enclosing your letter he is well i hope quite well i believe mr masterton then rose went to an iron safe and brought out a packet of papers which he put into my hands you will read these with interest mr neville i am a party to the whole transaction and must venture to advise you not to appear in england under your own name until all is settled your uncle i perceive has begged the same and i have assented sir i have taken a name instead of my real one may i ask what it is i call myself mr japhet newland well it is singular but perhaps as good as any other i will take it down in case i have to write to you your address is piazzacovent garden mr masterton took my name and address i took the papers and then we both took leave of one another with many expressions of pleasure and goodwill i returned to the hotel where i found timothy waiting for me with impatience japhet said he lord windermear has not yet left town i have seen him for i was called back after i left the house by the footman who ran after mehe will be here immediately indeed replied i pray what sort of person is he and what did he say to you he sent for me in the diningparlour where he was at breakfast asked when you arrived whether you were well and how long i had been in your service i replied that i had not been more than two days and had just put on my liveries he then desired me to tell mr newland that he would call upon him in about two hours then my lord replied i i had better go and tell him to get out of bed the lazy dog said he nearly one oclock and not out of bed well go then and get him dressed as fast as you can shortly afterwards a handsome carriage with greys drew up to the door his lordship sent in his footman to ask whether mr newland was at home the reply of the waiter was that there was a young gentleman who had been there two or three days who had come from making a tour and his name did begin with an n that will do james let down the steps his lordship alighted was ushered up stairs and into my room there we stood staring at each other lord windermear i believe said i extending my hand you have recognised me first john said he taking my hand and looking earnestly in my face good heavens is it possible that an awkward boy should have grown up into so handsome a fellow i shall be proud of my nephew did you remember me when i entered the room to tell the truth my lord i did not but expecting you i took it for granted that it must be you nine years make a great difference johnbut i forget i must now call you japhet have you been reading the bible lately that you fixed upon that strange name no my lord but this hotel is such a noahs ark that its no wonder i thought of it youre an undutiful dog not to ask after your mother sir i was about i seei see interrupted his lordship but recollect john that she still is your mother bytheby have you read the papers yet no sir replied i there they are pointing to them on the side table i really do not like to break the seals that they will not contain pleasant intelligence i admit replied his lordship but until you have read them i do not wish to converse with you on the subject therefore said he taking up the packet and breaking the seals i must now insist that you employ this forenoon in reading them through you will dine with me at seven and then we will talk the matter over certainly sir if you wish it i will read them i must insist upon it john and am rather surprised at your objecting when they concern you so particularly i shall obey your orders sir well then my boy i shall wish you good morning that you may complete your task before you come to dinner tomorrow if you wish itbut recollect i never press young men on these points as i am aware that they sometimes feel it a restraintif you wish it i say you may bring your portmanteaus and take up your quarters with me bythebye continued his lordship taking hold of my coat who made this the tailor to his serene highness the prince of darmsradt had that honour my lord replied i humph i thought they fitted better in germany its not quite the thingwe must consult stulz for with that figure and face the coat ought to be quite correct adieu my dear fellow till seven his lordship shook hands with me and i was left alone timothy came in as soon as his lordships carriage had driven off well sir said he was your uncle glad to see you yes replied i and look he has broken open the seals and has insisted upon my reading the papers it would be very undutiful in you to refuse so i had better leave you to your task said timothy smiling as he quitted the room chapter xx i open an account with my bankers draw largely upon credulity and am prosperous without a check i sat down and took up the papers i was immediately and strangely interested in all that i read a secretit was indeed a secret involving the honour and reputation of the most distinguished families one that if known the trumpet of scandal would have blazoned forth to the disgrace of the aristocracy it would have occasioned bitter tears to some gratified the petty malice of many satisfied the revenge of the vindictive and bowed with shame the innocent as well as the guilty it is not necessary nor indeed would i on any account state any more i finished the last paper and then fell into a reverie this is indeed a secret thought i one that i would i never had possessed in a despotic country my life would be sacrificed to the fatal knowledgehere thank god my life as well as my liberty are safe the contents of the papers told me all that was necessary to enable me to support the character which i had assumed the reason why the party whom i was supposed to be was intrusted with it was that he was in a direct line eventually heir and the question was whether he would waive his claim with the others and allow death to bury crime in oblivion i felt that were i in his position i should so doand therefore was prepared to give an answer to his lordship i sealed up the papers dressed myself and went to dinner and after the cloth was removed lord windermear first rising and turning the key in the door said to me in a low voice you have read the papers and what those nearly as much interested as you are in this lamentable business have decided upon tell me what is your opinion my opinion my lord is that i wish i had never known what has come to light this daythat it will be most advisable never to recur to the subject and that the proposals made are in my opinion most judicious and should be acted upon that is well replied his lordship then all are agreed and i am proud to find you possessed of such honour and good feeling we now drop the subject for ever are you inclined to leave town with me or what do you intend to do i prefer remaining in town if your lordship will introduce me to some of the families of your acquaintance of course i know no one now very true i will introduce you as agreed as mr newland it may be as well that you do not know any of our relations whom i have made to suppose that you are still abroadand it would be awkward when you take your right name byandbye do you mean to see your mother impossible my lord at present byandbye i hope to be able perhaps its all for the best i will now write one note to major carbonnell introducing you as my particular friend and requesting that he will make london agreeable he knows everybody and will take you everywhere when does your lordship start for the country tomorrow so we may as well part tonight bytheby you have credit at drummonds in the name of newland for a thousand pounds the longer you make it last you the better his lordship gave me the letter of introduction i returned to him the sealed packet shook hands with him and took my departure well sir said timothy rubbing his hands as he stood before me what is the news for i am dying to hear itand what is this secret with regard to the secret tim a secret it must remain i dare not tell it even to you timothy looked rather grave at this reply no timothy as a man of honour i cannot my conscience smote me when i made use of the term for as a man of honour i had no business to be in possession of it my dear timothy i have done wrong already do not ask me to do worse i will not japhet but only tell me what has passed and what you intend to do that i will timothy with pleasure and i then stated all that had passed between his lordship and me and now you observe timothy i have gained what i desired an introduction into the best society and the means of keeping up your appearance echoed timothy rubbing his hands a thousand pounds will last a long while it will last a very long while tim for i never will touch it it would be swindling so it would replied tim his countenance falling well i never thought of that i have thought of much more tim recollect i must in a very short time be exposed to lord windermear for the real mr neville will soon come home good heavens what will become of us replied timothy with alarm in his countenance nothing can hurt you tim the anger will be all upon me but i am prepared to face it and i would face twice as much for the distant hope of finding my father whatever lord windermear may feel inclined to do he can do nothing and my possession of the secret will ensure even more than my safety it will afford me his protection if i demand it i hope it may prove so replied timothy but i feel a little frightened i do not tomorrow i shall give my letter of introduction and then i will prosecute my search so now my dear tim goodnight the next morning i lost no time in presenting my letter of introduction to major carbonnell he lived in apartments on the first floor in st jamess street and i found him at breakfast in a silk dressing gown i had made up my mind that a little independence always carries with it an air of fashion when i entered therefore i looked at him with a knowing air and dropping the letter down on the table before him said theres something for you to read major and in the meantime ill refresh myself on this chair suiting the action to the word i threw myself on a chair amusing myself with tapping the sides of my boots with a small cane which i carried in my hand major carbonnell upon whom i cast a furtive eye more than once during the time that he was reading the letter was a person of about thirtyfive years of age welllooking but disfigured by the size of his whiskers which advanced to the corners of his mouth and met under his throat he was tall and well made and with an air of fashion about him that was undeniable his linen was beautifully clean and carefully arranged and he had as many rings on his fingers and when he was dressed chains and trinkets as ever were put on by a lady my dear sir allow me the honour of making at once your most intimate acquaintance said he rising from his chair and offering his hand as soon as he had perused the letter any friend of lord windermears would be welcome but when he brings such an extra recommendation in his own appearance he becomes doubly so major carbonnell replied i i have seen you but two minutes and i have taken a particular fancy to you in which i no doubt have proved my discrimination of course you know that i have just returned from making a tour so i understand from his lordships letter mr newland my time is at your service where are you staying at the piazza very good i will dine with you today order some mulligatawny they are famous for it after dinner we will go to the theatre i was rather surprised at his cool manner of asking himself to dine with me and ordering my dinner but a moments reflection made me feel what sort of person i had to deal with major i take that as almost an affront you will dine with me today i beg to state that you must dine with me every day that we are not invited elsewhere and whats more sir i shall be most seriously displeased if you do not order the dinner every time that you do dine with me and ask whoever you may think worthy of putting their legs under our table lets have no doing things by halves major i know you now as well as if we had been intimate for ten years the major seized me by the hand my dear newland i only wish we had known one another ten years as you saythe loss has been mine but nowyou have breakfasted i presume yes having nothing to do and not knowing a soul after my long absence i advanced my breakfast about two hours that i might find you at home and now im at your service say rather i am at yours i presume you will walk in ten minutes i shall be ready either take up the paper or whistle an air or two or anything else you like just to kill ten minutesand i shall be at your command chapter xxi i come out under a firstrate chaperon and at once am established into the regions of fashionprove that i am deserving of my promotion i beg your pardon newland said the major returning from his dressingroom resplendent with chains and bijouterie but i must have your christian name its rather a strange one replied i it is japhet japhet by the immortal powers id bring an action against my godfathers and godmothers you ought to recover heavy damages then i presume you would not have the name replied i with a knowing look for a clear ten thousand a year whew that alters the caseits astonishing how well any name looks in large gold letters well as the old gentleman whoever he might have been made you compensation you must forgive and forget now where shall we go with your permission as i came to town in these clothes made by a german tailordarmstadts tailor bythebyebut still if tailor to a prince not the prince of tailorsi would wish you to take me to your own your dress appears very correct you show your judgment newland it is correct stulz will be delighted to have your name on his books and to do justice to that figure allons donc we sauntered up st jamess street and before i had arrived at stulzs i had been introduced to at least twenty of the young men about town the major was most particular in his directions about the clothes all of which he ordered and as i knew that he was well acquainted with the fashion i gave him carte blanche when we left the shop he said now my dear newland i have given you a proof of friendship which no other man in england has had your dress will be the ne plus ultra there are little secrets only known to the initiated and stulz is aware that this time i am in earnest i am often asked to do the same for others and i pretend so to do but a wink from me is sufficient and stulz dares not dress them dont you want some bijouterie or have you any at home i may as well have a few trifles replied i we entered a celebrated jewellers and he selected for me to the amount of about forty pounds that will donever buy much for it is necessary to change every three months at least what is the price of this chain it is only fifteen guineas major well i shall take it but recollect continued the major i tell you honestly i never shall pay you the jeweller smiled bowed and laughed the major threw the chain round his neck and we quitted the shop at all events major they appear not to believe your word in that shop my dear fellow thats their own fault not mine i tell them honestly i never will pay them and you may depend upon it i intend most sacredly to keep my word i never do pay anybody for the best of all possible reasons i have no money but then i do them a servicei make them fashionable and they know it what debts do you pay then major let me thinkthat requires consideration oh i pay my washerwoman dont you pay your debts of honour debts of honour why ill tell you the truth for i know that we shall hunt in couples if i win i take the money but if i losewhy then i forget to pay and i always tell them so before i set down to the table if they wont believe me its not my fault but whats the hour come i must make a few calls and will introduce you we sauntered on to grosvenor square knocked and were admitted into a large elegantlyfurnished mansion the footman announced usmy dear lady maelstrom allow me the honour of introducing to you my very particular friend mr newland consigned to my charge by my lord windermear during his absence he has just arrived from the continent where he has been making the grand tour her ladyship honoured me with a smile bythebye major that reminds medo me the favour to come to the window excuse us one moment mr newland the major and lady maelstrom walked to the window and exchanged a few sentences and then returned her ladyship holding up her finger and saying to him as they came towards me promise me now that you wont forget your ladyships slightest wishes are to me imperative commands replied the major with a graceful bow in a quarter of an hour during which the conversation was animated we rose to take our leave when her ladyship came up to me and offering her hand said mr newland the friendship of lord windermear and the introduction of major carbonnell are more than sufficient to induce me to put your name down on my visiting list i trust i shall see a great deal of you and that we shall be great friends i bowed to this handsome announcement and we retired as soon as we were out in the square the major observed you saw her take me on one sideit was to pump she has no daughters but about fifty nieces and matchmaking is her delight i told her that i would stake my honour upon your possessing ten thousand a year how much more i could not say i was not far wrong was i i laughed what i may be worth major i really cannot say but i trust that the event will prove that you are not far wrong say no more my dear fellow i understandyou are not yet of ageof course have not yet come into possession of your fortune that is exactly the case major i am now but little more than nineteen you look older but there is no getting over baptismal registries with the executors newland you must content yourself for the two next years in playing moses and only peep at the promised land we made two or three more calls and then returned to st jamess street where shall we go now bythebye dont you want to go to your bankers i will just stroll down with you and see if they have paid any money in replied i carelessly we called at drummonds and i asked them if there was any money paid in to the credit of mr newland yes sir replied one of the clerks there is one thousand pounds paid in yesterday very good replied i how much do you wish to draw for inquired the major i dont want any replied i i have more money than i ought to have in my desk at this moment well then let us go and order dinner or perhaps you would like to stroll about a little more if so i will go and order the dinner heres harcourt thats lucky harcourt my dear fellow know mr newland my very particular friend i must leave you now take his arm harcourt for half an hour and then join us at dinner at the piazza mr harcourt was an elegant young man of about fiveandtwenty equally pleased with each others externals we were soon familiar he was witty sarcastic and wellbred after half an hours conversation he asked me what i thought of the major i looked him in the face and smiled that look tells me that you will not be his dupe otherwise i had warned you he is a strange character but if you have money enough to afford to keep him you cannot do better as he is acquainted with and received by everybody his connections are good and he once had a very handsome fortune but it was soon run out and he was obliged to sell his commission in the guards now he lives upon the world which as shakespeare says is his oyster and he has wit and sharpness enough to open it moreover he has some chance of falling into a peerage that prospect and his amusing qualities added to his being the most fashionable man about town keeps his head above water i believe lord windermear who is his cousin very often helps him it was lord windermear who introduced me to him observed i then he will not venture to play any tricks upon you further than eating your dinners borrowing your money and forgetting to pay it you must acknowledge said i he always tells you beforehand that he never will pay you and that is the only point in which he adheres to his word replied harcourt laughing but tell me am i to be your guest today if you will do me that honour i assure you i am delighted to come as i shall have a further opportunity of cultivating your acquaintance then we had better bend our steps towards the hotel for it is late replied i and we did so accordingly chapter xxii the real simon pure proves the worse of the twoi am found guilty but not condemned convicted yet convince and after having behaved the very contrary to prove that i am a gentleman on our arrival we found the table spread champagne in ice under the sideboard and apparently everything prepared for a sumptuous dinner the major on the sofa giving directions to the waiter and timothy looking all astonishment major said i i cannot tell you how much i am obliged to you for your kindness in taking all this trouble off my hands that i might follow up the agreeable introduction you have given me to mr harcourt my dear newland say no more you will i dare say do the same for me if i require it when i give a dinner harcourt caught my eye as if to say you may safely promise that but newland do you know that the nephew of lord windermear has just arrived did you meet abroad no replied i somewhat confused but i soon recovered myself as for tim he bolted out of the room what sort of a person is he that you may judge for yourself my dear fellow for i asked him to join us i must say more out of compliment to lord windermear than anything else for i am afraid that even i could never make a gentleman of him but take harcourt with you to your room and by the time you have washed your hands i will have dinner on the table i took the liberty of desiring your valet to show me in about ten minutes ago hes a shrewd fellow that of yourswhere did you pick him up by mere accident replied i come mr harcourt on our return we found the real simon pure mr estcourt sitting with the major who introduced us and dinner being served we sat down to table mr estcourt was a young man about my own age but not so tall by two or three inches his features were prominent but harsh and when i saw him i was not at all surprised at lord windermears expressions of satisfaction when he suppossd that i was his nephew his countenance was dogged and sullen and he spoke little he appeared to place an immense value upon birth and hardly deigned to listen except the aristocracy were the subject of discourse i treated him with marked deference that i might form an acquaintance and found before we parted that night that i had succeeded our dinner was excellent and we were all except mr estcourt in high good humour we sat latetoo late to go to the theatre and promising to meet the next day at noon harcourt and the major took their leave mr estcourt had indulged rather too much and after their departure became communicative i plied the bottle and we sat up for more than an hour he talked of nothing but his family and his expectations i took this opportunity of discovering what his feelings were likely to be when he was made acquainted with the important secret which was in my possession i put a case somewhat similar and asked him whether in such circumstances he would waive his right for a time to save the honour of his family no by gd replied he i never would what give up even for a day my rightconceal my true rank for the sake of relatives nevernothing would induce me i was satisfied and then casually asked him if he had written to lord windermear to inform him of his arrival no replied he i shall write tomorrow he soon after retired to his own apartment and i rang for timothy good heavens sir cried timothy what is all thisand what are you about i am frightened out of my wits why sir our money will not last two months i do not expect it will last much longer tim but it cannot be helped into society i must getand to do so must pay for it but sir putting the expense aside what are we to do about this mr estcourt all must be found out i intend that it shall be found out tim replied i but not yet he will write to his uncle tomorrow you must obtain the letter for it must not go i must first have time to establish myself and then lord windermear may find out his error as soon as he pleases upon my honour japhet you appear to be afraid of nothing i fear nothing tim when i am following up the object of my wishes i will allow no obstacles to stand in my way in my search after my father really you seem to be quite mad on that point japhet perhaps i may be tim replied i thoughtfully at all events let us go to bed now and i will tell you tomorrow morning all the events of this day mr estcourt wrote his letter which tim very officiously offered to put into the post instead of which we put it between the bars of the grate i must now pass over about three weeks during which i became very intimate with the major and mr harcourt and was introduced by them to the clubs and almost every person of fashion the idea of my wealth and my very handsome person and figure ensured me a warm reception and i soon became one of the stars of the day during this time i also gained the entire confidence of mr estcourt who put letter after letter into the hands of timothy who of course put them into the usual place i pacified him as long as i could by expressing my opinion that his lordship was on a visit to some friends in the neighbourhood of his seat but at last he would remain in town no longer you may go now thought i i feel quite safe it was about five days after his departure as i was sauntering arm in arm with the major who generally dined with me about five days in the week that i perceived the carriage of lord windermear with his lordship in it he saw us and pulling his checkstring alighted and coming up to us with the colour mounting to his forehead with emotion returned the salute of the major and me major said he you will excuse me but i am anxious to have some conversation with mr newland perhaps continued his lordship addressing me you will do me the favour to take a seat in my carriage fully prepared i lost none of my selfpossession but thanking his lordship i bowed to him and stepped in his lordship followed and saying to the footman homedrive fast fell back in the carriage and never uttered one word until we had arrived and had entered the diningparlour he then took a few steps up and down before he said mr newland or whatever your name may be i perceive that you consider the possession of an important secret to be your safeguard to state my opinion of your conduct is needless who you are and what you are i know not but continued he no longer controlling his anger you certainly can have no pretensions to the character of a gentleman perhaps your lordship replied i calmly will inform me upon what you may ground your inference did you not in the first place open a letter addressed to another my lord i opened a letter brought to me with the initials of my name and at the time i opened it i fully believed that it was intended for me we will grant that sir but after you had opened it you must have known that it was for some other person i will not deny that my lord notwithstanding which you apply to my lawyer representing yourself as another person to obtain sealed papers i did my lord but allow me to say that i never should have done so had i not been warned by a dream by a dream yes my lord i had determined not to go for them when in a dream i was ordered so to do paltry excuse and then you break private seals nay my lord although i did go for the papers i could not even with the idea of supernatural interposition make up my mind to break the seals if your lordship will recollect it was you who broke the seals and insisted upon my reading the papers yes sir under your false name it is the name by which i go at present although i acknowledge it is false but that is not my faulti have no other at present it is very true sir that in all i have now mentioned the law will not reach you but recollect that by assuming another persons name i never did my lord interrupted i well i may say by inducing me to believe that you were my nephew you have obtained money under false pretences and for that i now have you in my power my lord i never asked you for the money you yourself paid it into the bankers hands to my credit and to my own name i appeal to you now whether if you so deceived yourself the law can reach me mr newland i will say that much as i regret what has passed i regret more than all the rest that one so young so prepossessing so candid in appearance should prove such an adept in deceit thinking you were my nephew my heart warmed towards you and i must confess that since i have seen my real nephew the mortification has been very great my lord i thank you but allow me to observe that i am no swindler your thousand pounds you will find safe in the bank for penury would not have induced me to touch it but now that your lordship appears more cool will you do me the favour to listen to me when you have heard my life up to the present and my motives for what i have done you will then decide how far i am to blame his lordship took a chair and motioned to me to take another i narrated what had occurred when i was left at the foundling and gave him a succinct account of my adventures subsequentlymy determination to find my fatherthe dream which induced me to go for the papersand all that the reader has already been acquainted with his lordship evidently perceived the monomania which controlled me and heard me with great attention you certainly mr newland do not stand so low in my opinion as you did before this explanation and i must make allowances for the excitement under which i perceive you to labour on one subject but now sir allow me to put one question and i beg that you will answer candidly what price do you demand for your secrecy on this important subject my lord replied i rising with dignity this is the greatest affront you have put upon me yet still i will name the price by which i will solemnly bind myself by all my future hopes of finding my father in this world and of finding an eternal father in the next and that price my lord is a return of your good opinion his lordship also rose and walked up and down the room with much agitation in his manner what am i to make of you mr newland my lord if i were a swindler i should have taken your money if i had wished to avail myself of the secret i might have escaped with all the documents and made my own terms i am my lord nothing more than an abandoned child trying all he can to find his father my feelings overpowered me and i burst into tears as soon as i could recover myself i addressed his lordship who had been watching me in silence and not without emotion i have one thing more to say to you my lord i then mentioned the conversation between mr estcourt and myself and pointed out the propriety of not making him a party to the important secret his lordship allowed me to proceed without interruption and after a few moments thought said i believe that you are right mr newland and i now begin to think that it was better that this secret should have been entrusted to you than to him you have now conferred an obligation on me and may command me i believe you to be honest but a little mad and i beg your pardon for the pain which i have occasioned you my lord i am more than satisfied can i be of any assistance to you mr newland if my lord you could at all assist me or direct me in my search there i am afraid i can be of little use but i will give you the means of prosecuting your search and in so doing i am doing but an act of justice for in introducing you to major carbonnell i am aware that i must have very much increased your expenses it was an error which must be repaired and therefore mr newland i beg you will consider the money at the bank as yours and make use of it to enable you to obtain your ardent wish my lord i will not be denied mr newland and if you feel any delicacy on the subject you may take it as a loan to be repaid when you find it convenient do not for a moment consider that it is given to you because you possess an important secret for i will trust entirely to your honour on that score indeed my lord replied i your kindness overwhelms me and i feel as if in you i had already almost found a father excuse me my lord but did your lordship everever i know what you would say my poor fellow no i never did i never was blessed with children had i been i should not have felt that i was disgraced by having one resembling you allow me to entreat you mr newland that you do not suffer the mystery of your birth to weigh so heavily on your mind and now i wish you good morning and if you think i can be useful to you i beg that you will not fail to let me know may heaven pour down blessings on your head replied i kissing respectfully his lordships hand and may my father when i find him be as like unto you as possible i made my obeisance and quitted the house chapter xxiii the major prevents the landlord from imposing on me but i gain nothing by his interferencefor economical reasons i agree to live with him that he may live on me i returned to the hotel for my mind had been much agitated and i wished for quiet and the friendship of timothy as soon as i arrived i told him all that had passed indeed replied timothy things do now wear a pleasant aspect for i am afraid that without that thousand we could not have carried on for a fortnight longer the bill here is very heavy and im sure the landlord wishes to see the colour of his money how much do you think we have left it is high time timothy that we now make up our accounts and arrange some plans for the future replied i i have paid the jeweller and the tailor by the advice of the major who says that you should always pay your first bills as soon as possible and all your subsequent bills as late as possible and if put off sine die so much the better in fact i owe very little now but the bill here i will send for it tonight here we were interrupted by the entrance of the landlord o mr wallace you are the very person i wished to see let me have my bill if you please its not of the least consequence sir replied he but if you wish it i have posted down to yesterday and the landlord left the room you were both of one mind at all events said timothy laughing for he had the bill in his hand and concealed it the moment you asked for it in about ten minutes the landlord reappeared and presenting the bill upon a salver made his bow and retired i looked it over it amounted to l which for little more than three weeks was pretty well timothy shrugged up his shoulders while i ran over the items i do not see that there is anything to complain of tim observed i when i came to the bottom of it but i do see that living here with the major keeping me an open house will never do let us see how much money we have left tim brought the dressingcase in which our cash was deposited and we found that after paying the waiters and a few small bills not yet liquidated our whole stock was reduced to fifty shillings merciful heaven what an escape cried timothy if it had not been for this new supply what should we have done very badly timothy but the money is well spent after all i have now entrance into the first circles i can do without major carbonnell at all events i shall quit this hotel and take furnished apartments and live at the clubs i know how to put him off i laid the money on the salver and desired timothy to ring for the landlord when who should come up but the major and harcourt why newland what are you going to do with that money said the major i am paying my bill major paying your bill indeed let us seel o this is a confounded imposition you mustnt pay this at this moment the landlord entered mr wallace said the major my friend mr newland was about as you may see to pay you the whole of your demand but allow me to observe that being my very particular friend and the piazza having been particularly recommended by me i do think that your charges are somewhat exorbitant i shall certainly advise mr newland to leave the house tomorrow if you are not more reasonable allow me to observe major that my reason for sending for my bill was to pay it before i went into the country which i must do tomorrow for a few days then i shall certainly recommend mr newland not to come here when he returns mr wallace for i hold myself to a certain degree after the many dinners we have ordered here and of which i have partaken as i may say particeps criminis or in other words as having been a party to this extortion indeed mr wallace some reduction must be made or you will greatly hurt the credit of your house mr wallace declared that really he had made nothing but the usual charges that he would look over the bill again and see what he could do my dear newland said the major i have ordered your dinners allow me to settle your bill now mr wallace suppose we take off onethird onethird major carbonnell i should be a loser i am not exactly of your opinion but let me seenow take your choice take off l or you lose my patronage and that of all my friends yes or no the landlord with some expostulation at last consented he receipted the bill and leaving l of the money on the salver made his bow and retired rather fortunate that i supped in my dear newland now there are l saved bythebye im short of cash youve no objection to let me have this i shall never pay you you know i do know you never will pay me major nevertheless as i should have paid it to the landlord had you not interfered i will lend it to you you are a good fellow newland said the major pocketing the money if i had borrowed it and you had thought you would have had it repaid i should not have thanked you but as you lend it me with your eyes open it is nothing more than a very delicate manner of obliging me and i tell you candidly that i will not forget it so you really are off tomorrow yes replied i i must go for i find that i am not to make ducks and drakes of my money until i come into possession of my property i see my dear fellow executors are the very devil they have no feeling never mind theres a way of getting to windward of them i dine with harcourt and he has come to ask you to join us with pleasure i shall expect you at seven newland said harcourt as he quitted the room with the major dear me sir how could you let that gentleman walk off with your money cried timothy i was just rubbing my hands with the idea that we were l better off than we thought and away it went like smoke and will never come back again tim but never mind that it is important that i make a friend of him and his friendship is only to be bought i shall have value received and now tim we must pack up for i leave this tomorrow morning i shall go down to and see little fleta i dined with harcourt the major was rather curious to know what it was which appeared to flurry lord windermear and what had passed between us i told him that his lordship was displeased on money matters but that all was right only that i must be more careful for the future indeed major i think i shall take lodgings i shall be more comfortable and better able to receive my friends harcourt agreed with me that it was a much better plan when the major observed why newland i have a room quite at your service suppose you come and live with me i am afraid i shall not save by that replied i laughing for you will not pay your share of the bills no upon my honour i will not so i give you fair warning but as i always dine with you when i do not dine elsewhere it will be a saving to youfor you will have your lodgings newland and you know the house is my own and i let off the rest of it so as far as that bill is concerned you will be safe make the best bargain you can newland said harcourt accept his offer for depend upon it it will be a saving in the end it certainly deserves consideration replied i and the majors company must be allowed to have its due weight in the scale if carbonnell will promise to be a little more economical i will my dear fellowi will act as your steward and make your money last as long as i can for my own sake as well as yours is it a bargain i have plenty of room for your servant and if he will assist me a little i will discharge my own i then consented to the arrangement chapter xxiv the major teaches me how to play whist so as never to lose which is by playing against each other and into each others hands the next day i went to the bankers drew out l and set off with timothy for fleta threw herself into my arms and sobbed with joy when i told her timothy was outside and wished to see her she asked why he did not come in and to show how much she had been accustomed to see without making remarks when he made his appearance in his livery she did not by her countenance express the least surprise nor indeed did she put any questions to me on the subject the lady who kept the school praised her very much for docility and attention and shortly after left the room fleta then took the chain from around her neck into her hand and told me that she did recollect something about it which was that the lady whom she remembered wore a long pair of earrings of the same make and materials she could not however call to mind anything else i remained with the little girl for three hours and then returned to londontaking my luggage from the hotel and installed myself into the apartments of major carbonnell the major adhered to his promise we certainly lived well for he could not live otherwise but in every other point he was very careful not to add to expense the season was now over and everybody of consequence quitted the metropolis to remain in town would be to lose caste and we had a conference where we should proceed newland said the major you have created a sensation this season which has done great honour to my patronage but i trust next spring that i shall see you form a good alliance for believe me out of the many heartless beings we have mingled with there are still not only daughters but mothers who are not influenced by base and sordid views why carbonnell i never heard you venture upon so long a moral speech before true newland and it may be a long while before i do so again the world is my oyster which i must open that i may live but recollect i am only trying to recover my own which the world has swindled me out of there was a time when i was even more disinterested more confiding and more innocent than you were when i first took you in hand i suffered and was ruined by my good qualities and i now live and do well by having discarded them we must fight the world with its own weapons but still as i said before there is some good in it some pure ore amongst the dross and it is possible to find high rank and large fortune and at the same time an innocent mind if you do marry i will try hard but you shall possess both not that fortune can be of much consequence to you depend upon it carbonnell i never will marry without fortune i did not know that i had schooled you so well be it soit is but fair that you should expect it and it shall be an item in the match if i have anything to do with it but why are you so anxious that i should marry carbonnell because i think you will in all probability avoid the gamingtable which i should have taken you to myself had you been in possession of your fortune when i first knew you and have had my share of your plucking but now i do know you i have that affection for you that i think it better you should not lose your all for observe newland my share of your spoliation would not be more than what i have and may still receive from you and if you marry and settle down there will always be a good house and a good table for me as long as i find favour with your wife and at all events a friend in need that i feel convinced of so now you have my reasons some smack of the disinterestedness of former days others of my present worldliness you may believe which you please and the major laughed as he finished his speech carbonnell replied i i will believe that the better feelings predominatethat the world has made you what you are and that had you not been ruined by the world you would have been disinterested and generous even now your real nature often gains the ascendency and i am sure that in all that you have done which is not defensible your poverty and not your will has consented now blunted by habit and time the suggestion of conscience do not often give you any uneasiness you are very right my dear fellow replied the major and in having a better opinion of me than the world in general you do me i trust no more than justice i will not squander your fortune when you come to it if i can help it and youll allow thats a very handsome promise on my part ill defy you to squander my fortune replied i laughing nay dont defy me newland for if you do youll put me on my mettle above all dont lay me a bet for that will be still more dangerous we have only spent about four hundred of the thousand since we have lived together which i consider highly economical what do you say shall we go to cheltenham you will find plenty of irish girls looking out for husbands who will give you a warm reception i hate your fortune and establishment hunters replied i i grant that they are looking out for a good match so are all the world but let me do them justice although if you proposed in three days they would accept you yet once married they make the very best wives in the world but recollect we must go somewhere and i think cheltenham is as good a place as any other i do not mean for a wife butit will suit my own views this last observation decided me and in a few days we were at cheltenham and having made our appearance at the rooms were soon in the vortex of society newland said carbonnell i dare say you find time hang rather heavy in this monotonous place not at all replied i what with dining out dancing and promenading i do very well but we must do better tell me are you a good hand at whist not by any means indeed i hardly know the game it is a fashionable and necessary accomplishment i must make you master of it and our mornings shall be dedicated to the work agreed replied i and from that day every morning after breakfast till four oclock the major and i were shut up playing two dummies under his instruction adept as he was i very soon learnt all the finesse and beauty of the game you will do now newland said the major one morning tossing the cards away recollect if you are asked to play and i have agreed do not refuse but we must always play against each other i dont see what we shall gain by that replied i for if i win youll lose never do you mind that only follow my injunctions and play as high as they choose we only stay here three weeks longer and must make the most of our time i confess i was quite puzzled at what might be the majors intentions but that night we sauntered into the club not having made our appearance before we were considered as new hands by those who did not know the major and were immediately requested to make up a game upon my word gentlemen in the first place i play very badly replied the major and in the next continued he laughing if i lose i never shall pay you for im cleaned out the way in which the major said this only excited a smile he was not believed and i was also requested to take a hand ill not play with the major observed i for he plays badly and has bad luck into the bargain i might as well lay my money down on the table this was agreed to by the other parties and we sat down the first rubber of short whist was won by the major and his partner with the bets it amounted to eighteen pounds i pulled out my purse to pay the major but he refused saying no newland pay my partner and with you sir said he addressing my partner i will allow the debt to remain until we rise from the table newland we are not going to let you off yet i can tell you i paid my eighteen pounds and we recommenced although his partner did not perhaps observe it for he was but an indifferent player or if he did observe it had the politeness not to say anything the major now played very badly he lost three rubbers one after another and with bets and stakes they amounted to one hundred and forty pounds at the end of the last rubber he threw up the cards exclaiming against his luck and declaring that he would play no more how are we now sir said he to my partner you owed me i think eighteen pounds eighteen from one hundred and forty leaves one hundred and twentytwo pounds which i now owe you you must im afraid allow me to be your debtor continued the major in a most insinuating manner i did not come here with the intention of playing i presume i shall find you here tomorrow night the gentleman bowed and appeared quite satisfied major carbonnells partner paid me one hundred and forty pounds which i put in my pocketbook and we quitted the club chapter xxv we fund our winnings and consider to refund a work of supererogationin looking after my father i obey the old adage follow your nose as soon as we were in the street i commenced an inquiry as to the majors motives not one word my dear fellow until we are at home replied he as soon as we arrived he threw himself in a chair and crossing his legs commenced you observe newland that i am very careful that you should do nothing to injure your character as for my own all the honesty in the world will not redeem it nothing but a peerage will ever set me right again in this world and a coronet will cover a multitude of sins i have thought it my duty to add something to our finances and intend to add very considerably to them before we leave cheltenham you have won one hundred and twentyeight pounds yes replied i but you have lost it granted but as in most cases i never mean to pay my losses you see that it must be a winning speculation as long as we play against each other i perceive replied i but am not i a confederate no you paid when you lost and took your money when you won leave me to settle my own debts of honour but you will meet him again tomorrow night yes and i will tell you why i never thought it possible that we could have met two such bad players at the club we must now play against them and we must win in the long run by which means i shall pay off the debt i owe him and you will win and pocket money ah replied i if you mean to allow him a chance for his money i have no objectionthat will be all fair depend upon it newland when i know that people play as badly as they do i will not refuse them but when we sit down with others it must be as it was beforewe must play against each other and i shall owe the money i told the fellow that i never would pay him yes but he thought you were only joking that is his faulti was in earnest i could not have managed this had it not been that you are known to be a young man of ten thousand pounds per annum and supposed to be my dupe i tell you so candidly and now goodnight i turned the affair over in my mind as i undressedit was not honestbut i paid when i lost and i only took the money when i wonstill i did not like it but the bank notes caught my eye as they lay on the table andi was satisfied alas how easy are scruples removed when we want money how many are there who when in a state of prosperity and affluence when not tried by temptation would have blushed at the bare idea of a dishonest action have raised and held up their hands in abhorrence when they have heard that others have been found guilty and yet when in adversity have themselves committed the very acts which before they so loudly condemned how many of the other sex who have expressed their indignation and contempt at those who have fallen when tempted have fallen themselves let us therefore be charitable none of us can tell to what we may be reduced by circumstances and when we acknowledge that the error is great let us feel sorrow and pity rather than indignation and pray that we also may not be led into temptation as agreed upon the next evening we repaired to the club and found the two gentlemen ready to receive us this time the major refused to play unless it was with me as i had such good fortune and no difficulty was made by our opponents we sat down and played till four oclock in the morning at first notwithstanding our good play fortune favoured our adversaries but the luck soon changed and the result of the evening was that the major had a balance in his favour of forty pounds and i rose a winner of one hundred and seventyone pounds so that in two nights we had won three hundred and fortytwo pounds for nearly three weeks this continued the major not paying when not convenient and we quitted cheltenham with about eight hundred pounds in our pockets the major having paid about one hundred and twenty pounds to different people who frequented the club but they were irishmen who were not to be trifled with i proposed to the major that we should pay those debts as there still would be a large surplus he replied give me the money i did so now continued he so far your scruples are removed as you will have been strictly honest but my dear fellow if you know how many debts of this sort are due to me of which i never did touch one farthing you would feel as i dothat it is excessively foolish to part with money i have them all booked here and may some day paywhen convenient but at present most decidedly it is not so the major put the notes into his pocket and the conversation was dropped the next morning we had ordered our horses when timothy came up to me and made a sign as we were at breakfast for me to come out i followed him oh sir i could not help telling you but there is a gentleman with with what replied i hastily with your nose sir exactlyand in other respects very like youjust about the age your father should be where is he timothy replied i all my feelings in search of my father rushing into my mind down below sir about to set off in a postchaise and four now waiting at the door i ran down with my breakfast napkin in my hand and hastened to the portico of the hotelhe was in his carriage and the porter was then shutting the door i looked at him he was as timothy said very like me indeed the nose exact i was breathless and i continued to gaze all right cried the ostler i beg your pardon sir said i addressing the gentleman in the carriage who perceiving a napkin in my hand probably took me for one of the waiters for he replied very abruptly i have remembered you and pulling up the glass away whirled the chariot the nave of the hind wheel striking me a blow on the thigh which numbed it so that it was with difficulty i could limp up to our apartments when i threw myself on the sofa in a state of madness and despair good heavens newland what is the matter cried the major matter replied i faintly i have seen my father your father newland you must be mad he was dead before you could recollect himat least so you told me how then even if it were his ghost could you have recognised him the majors remarks reminded me of the imprudence i had been guilty of major replied i i believe i am very absurd but he was so like me and i have so often longed after my father so long wished to see him face to facethatthatim a great fool thats the fact you must go to the next world my good fellow to meet him face to face thats clear and i presume upon a little consideration you will feel inclined to postpone your journey very often in your sleep i have heard you talk about your father and wondered why you should think so much about him i cannot help it replied i from my earliest days my father has ever been in my thoughts i can only say that very few sons are half so dutiful to their fathers memoriesbut finish your breakfast and then we start for london i complied with his request as well as i could and we were soon on our road i fell into a reveriemy object was to again find out this person and i quietly directed timothy to ascertain from the postboys the directions he gave at the last stage the major perceiving me not inclined to talk made but few observations one however struck me windermear said he i recollect one day when i was praising you said carelessly that you were a fine young man but a little tete montee upon one point i see now it must have been upon this i made no reply but it certainly was a strange circumstance that the major never had any suspicions on this pointyet he certainly never had we had once or twice talked over my affairs i had led him to suppose that my father and mother died in my infancy and that i should have had a large fortune when i came of age but this had been entirely by indirect replies not by positive assertions the fact was that the major who was an adept in all deceit never had an idea that he could have been deceived by one so young so prepossessing and apparently so ingenuous as myself he had in fact deceived himself his ideas of my fortune arose entirely from my asking him whether he would have refused the name of japhet for ten thousand pounds per annum lord windermear after having introduced me did not consider it at all necessary to acquaint the major with my real history as it was imparted to him in confidence he allowed matters to take their course and me to work my own way in the world thus do the most cunning overreach themselves and with their eyes open to any deceit on the part of others prove quite blind when they deceive themselves timothy could not obtain any intelligence from the people of the inn at the last stage except that the chariot had proceeded to london we arrived late at night and much exhausted i was glad to go to bed chapter xxvi in following my nose i narrowly escaped being nosed by a beak and as i lay in my bed thinking that i was now nearly twenty years old and had not yet made any discovery my heart sank within me my monomania returned with redoubled force and i resolved to renew my search with vigour so i told timothy the next morning when he came into my room but from him i received little consolation he advised me to look out for a good match in a rich wife and leave time to develop the mystery of my birth pointing out the little chance i ever had of success town was not full the season had hardly commenced and we had few invitations or visits to distract my thoughts from their object my leg became so painful that for a week i was on the sofa timothy every day going out to ascertain if he could find the person whom we had seen resembling me and every evening returning without success i became melancholy and nervous carbonnell could not imagine what was the matter with me at last i was able to walk and i sallied forth perambulating or rather running through street after street looking into every carriage so as to occasion surprise to the occupants who believed me mad my dress and person were disordered for i had become indifferent to it and timothy himself believed that i was going out of my senses at last after we had been in town about five weeks i saw the very object of my search seated in a carriage of a dark brown colour arms painted in shades so as not to be distinguishable but at a near approach his hat was off and he sat upright and formally that is he ejaculated i and away i ran after the carriage it is the nose cried i as i ran down the street knocking every one to the right and left i lost my hat but fearful of losing sight of the carriage i hastened on when i heard a cry of stop him stop him stop him cried i also referring to the gentleman in black in the carriage that wont do cried a man seizing me by the collar i know a trick worth two of that let me go roared i struggling but he only held me the faster i tussled with the man until my coat and shirt were torn but in vain the crowd now assembled and i was fast the fact was that a pickpocket had been exercising his vocation at the time that i was running past and from my haste and loss of my hat i was supposed to be the criminal the police took charge of mei pleaded innocence in vain and i was dragged before the magistrate at marlborough street my appearance the disorder of my dress my coat and shirt in ribbons with no hat were certainly not at all in my favour when i made my appearance led in by two bow street officers whom have we here inquired the magistrate a pickpocket sir replied they ah one of the swell mob replied he are there any witnesses yes sir replied a young man coming forward i was walking up bond street when i felt a tug at my pocket and when i turned round this chap was running away can you swear to his person there were plenty to swear that i was the person who ran away now sir have you anything to offer in your defence said the magistrate yes sir replied i i certainly was running down the street and it may be for all i know or care that this persons pocket may have been pickedbut i did not pick it i am a gentleman all your fraternity lay claim to gentility replied the magistrate perhaps you will state why you were running down the street i was running after a carriage sir that i might speak to the person inside of it pray who was the person inside i do not know sir why should you run after a person you do not know it was because of his nose his nose replied the magistrate angrily do you think to trifle with me sir you shall now follow your own nose to prison make out his committal as you please sir replied i but still i have told you the truth if you will allow any one to take a note i will soon prove my respectability i ask it in common justice be it so replied the magistrate let him sit down within the bar till the answer comes in less than an hour my note to major carbonnell was answered by his appearance in person followed by timothy carbonnell walked up to the magistrate while timothy asked the officers in an angry tone what they had been doing to his master this rather startled them but both they and the magistrate were much surprised when the major asserted that i was his most particular friend mr newland who possessed ten thousand pounds per annum and who was as well known in fashionable society as any young man of fortune about town the magistrate explained what had passed and asked the major if i was not a little deranged but the major who perceived what was the cause of my strange behaviour told him that somebody had insulted me and that i was very anxious to lay hold of the person who had avoided me and who must have been in that carriage i am afraid that after your explanation major carbonnell i must as a magistrate bind over your friend mr newland to keep the peace to this i consented the major and timothy being taken as recognisances and then i was permitted to depart the major sent for a hackney coach and when we were going home he pointed out to me the folly of my conduct and received my promise to be more careful for the future thus did this affair end and for a short time i was more careful in my appearance and not so very anxious to look into carriages still however the idea haunted me and i was often very melancholy it was about a month afterwards that i was sauntering with the major who now considered me to be insane upon that point and who would seldom allow me to go out without him when i again perceived the same carriage with the gentleman inside as before there he is major cried i there is who replied he the man so like my father what in that carriage that is the bishop of e my good fellow what a strange idea you have in your head newland it almost amounts to madness do not be staring in that waycome along still my head was turned quite round looking at the carriage after it had passed till it was out of sight but i knew who the party was and for the time i was satisfied as i determined to find out his address and call upon him i narrated to timothy what had occurred and referring to the red book i looked out the bishops town address and the next day after breakfast having arranged my toilet with the utmost precision i made an excuse to the major and set off to portland place chapter xxvii a chapter of mistakesno benefit of clergyi attack a bishop and am beaten offthe major hedges upon the filly stakes my hand trembled as i knocked at the door it was opened i sent in my card requesting the honour of an audience with his lordship after waiting a few minutes in an anteroom i was ushered in my lord said i in a flurried manner will you allow me to have a few minutes conversation with you alone this gentleman is my secretary sir but if you wish it certainly for although he is my confidant i have no right to insist that he shall be yours mr temple will you oblige me by going up stairs for a little while the secretary quitted the room the bishop pointed to a chair and i sat down i looked him earnestly in the facethe nose was exact and i imagined that even in the other features i could distinguish a resemblance i was satisfied that i had a last gained the object of my search i believe sir observed i that you will acknowledge that in the heat and impetuosity of youth we often rush into hasty and improvident connections i paused with my eyes fixed upon his very true my young sir and when we do we are ashamed and repent of them afterwards replied the bishop rather astonished i grant that sir replied i but at the same time we must feel that we must abide by the results however unpleasant when we do wrong mr newland replied the bishop first looking at my card and then upon me we find that we are not only to be punished in the next world but suffer for it also in this i trust you have no reason for such suffering unfortunately the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children and in that view i may say that i have suffered my dear sir replied the bishop i trust you will excuse me when i say that my time is rather valuable if you have anything of importance to communicateanything upon which you would ask my advicefor assistance you do not appear to require do me the favour to proceed at once to the point i will sir be as concise as the matter will admit of allow me then to ask you a few questions and i trust to your honour and the dignity of your profession for a candid answer did you not marry a young woman early in life and were you not very much pressed in your circumstances the bishop stared really mr newland it is a strange question and i cannot imagine to what it may lead but still i will answer it i did marry early in life and i was at that time not in very affluent circumstances you had a child by that marriageyour eldest borna boy that is also true mr newland replied the bishop gravely how long is it since you have seen him it is many years replied the bishop putting his handkerchief up to his eyes answer me now sirdid you not desert him no no replied the bishop it is strange that you should appear to know so much about the matter mr newland as you could have hardly been born i was poor thenvery poor but although i could ill afford it he had fifty pounds from me but sir replied i much agitated why have you not reclaimed him i would have reclaimed him mr newlandbut what could i dohe was not to be reclaimed and nowhe is lost for ever surely sir in your present affluence you must wish to see him again he died and i trust he has gone to heaven replied the bishop covering up his face no sir replied i throwing myself on my knees before him he did not die here he is at your feet to ask your blessing the bishop sprang from his chair what does this mean sir said he with astonishment you my son yes reverend fatheryour son who with fifty pounds you left on the top of the portsmouth coach no sir in the basket my son sirimpossible he died in the hospital no sir he has come out of the hospital replied i and as you perceive safe and well either sir this must be some strange mistake or you must be trifling with me replied his lordship for sir i was at his deathbed and followed him to his grave are you sure of that sir replied i starting up with amazement i wish that i was not sirfor i am now childless but pray sir who and what are you who know so much of my former life and who would have thus imposed upon me imposed upon you sir replied i perceiving that i was in error alas i would do no such thing who am i i am a young man who is in search of his father your face and especially your nose so resembled mine that i made sure that i had succeeded pity me sirpity me continued i covering up my face with my hands the bishop perceiving that there was little of the impostor in my appearance and that i was much affected allowed a short time for me to recover myself and then entered into an explanation when a curate he had had an only son very wild who would go to sea in spite of his remonstrances he saw him depart by the portsmouth coach and gave him the sum mentioned his son received a mortal wound in action and was sent to the plymouth hospital where he died i then entered into my explanation in a few concise sentences and with a heart beating with disappointment took my leave the bishop shook hands with me as i quitted the room and wished me better success at my next application i went home almost in despair timothy consoled me as well as he could and advised me to go as much as possible into society as the most likely chance of obtaining my wish not that he considered there was any chance but he thought that amusement would restore me to my usual spirits i will go and visit little fleta replied i for a few days the sight of her will do me more good than anything else and the next day i set off for the town of where i found the dear little girl much grown and much improved i remained with her for a week walking with her in the country amusing her and amused myself with our conversation at the close of the week i bade her farewell and returned to the majors lodgings i was astonished to find him in deep mourning my dear carbonnell said i inquiringly i hope no severe loss nay my dear newland i should be a hypocrite if i said so for there never was a more merry mourner and thats the truth of it mr m who you know stood between me and the peerage has been drowned in the rhone i now have a squeak for it his wife has one daughter and is enceinte should the child prove a boy i am done for but if a girl i must then come in to the barony and fifteen thousand pounds per annum however ive hedged pretty handsomely how do you mean why they say that when a woman commences with girls she generally goes on and the odds are two to one that mrs m has a girl i have taken the odds at the clubs to the amount of fifteen thousand pounds so if it be a girl i shall have to pay that out of my fifteen thousand pounds per annum as soon as i fall into it if it be a boy and i am floored i shall pocket thirty thousand pounds by way of consolation for the disappointment they are all good men yes but they know you never pay they know i never do now because i have no money but they know i will pay if i come into the estate and so i will most honourably besides a few more thousands that i have in my book i congratulate you with all my heart major how old is the present lord b i have just been examining the peeragehe is sixtytwo but he is very fresh and hearty and may live a long while yet bythebye newland i committed a great error last night at the club i played pretty high and lost a great deal of money that is unfortunate that was not the error i actually paid all my losings newland and it has reduced the stock amazingly i lost seven hundred and fifty pounds i know i ought not to have paid away your money but the fact was as i was hedging it would not do not to have paid as i could not have made up my book as i wished it is however only waiting a few weeks till mrs m decides my fate and then either one way or the other i shall have money enough if your people wont give you any more till you are of age why we must send to a little friend of mine thats all and you shall borrow for both of us borrow replied i not much liking the idea they will never lend me money wont they replied the major no fear of that your signature and my introduction will be quite sufficient we had better try to do without it major i do not much like it well if we can we will but i have not fifty pounds left in my desk how much have you about twenty replied i in despair at this intelligence but i think there is a small sum left at the bankers i will go and see i took up my hat and set off to ascertain what funds we might have in store chapter xxviii i am over head and ears in trouble about a ladys earrings commit myself sadly and am very nearly committed i must say that i was much annoyed at this intelligence the moneylenders would not be satisfied unless they knew where my estates were and had examined the will at doctors commons then all would be exposed to the major and i should be considered by him as an impostor i walked down pall mall in a very unhappy mood so deep in thought that i ran against a lady who was stepping out of her carriage at a fashionable shop she turned round and i was making my best apologies to a very handsome woman when her earrings caught my attention they were of alternate coral and gold and the facsimile in make to the chain given by nattee to fleta during my last visit i had often had the chain in my hand and particularly marked the workmanship to make more sure i followed into the shop and stood behind her carefully examining them as she looked over a quantity of laces there could be no doubt i waited till the lady rose to go away and then addressed the shopman asking the ladys name he did not knowshe was a stranger but perhaps mr h the master did and he went back to answer the question mr h being at that moment busy the man stayed so long that i heard the carriage drive off fearful of losing sight of the lady i took to my heels and ran out of the shop my sudden flight from the counter covered with lace made them imagine that i had stolen some and they cried out stop thief as loud as they could springing over the counter and pursuing me as i pursued the carriage which was driven at a rapid pace a man perceiving me running and others without their hats following with the cries of stop thief put out his leg and i fell on the pavement the blood rushing in torrents from my nose i was seized roughly handled and again handed over to the police who carried me before the same magistrate in marlborough street what is this demanded the magistrate a shoplifter your worship i am not sir replied i you know me well enough i am mr newland mr newland replied the magistrate suspiciously this is strange a second time to appear before me upon such a charge and just as innocent as before sir youll excuse me sir but i must have my suspicions this time where is the evidence the people of the shop then came forward and stated what had occurred let him be searched said the magistrate i was searched but nothing was found upon me are you satisfied now sir inquired i by no means let the people go back and look over their laces and see if any are missing in the meantime i shall detain you for it is very easy to get rid of a small article such as lace when you are caught the men went away and i wrote a note to major carbonnell requesting his attendance he arrived at the same time as the shopman and i told him what had happened the shopman declared that the stock was not correct as far as they could judge there were two pieces of lace missing if so i did not take them replied i upon my honour mr b said the major to the magistrate it is very hard for a gentleman to be treated in this manner this is the second time that i have been sent for to vouch for his respectability very true sir replied the magistrate but allow me to ask mr newland as he calls himself what induced him to follow a lady into the shop her earrings replied i her earrings why sir the last time you were brought before me you said it was after a gentlemans nosenow it appears you were attracted by a ladys ears and pray sir what induced you to run out of the shop because i wanted particularly to inquire about her earrings sir i cannot understand these paltry excuses there are it appears two pieces of lace missing i must remand you for further examination sir and you also sir said the magistrate to major carbonnell for if he is a swindler you must be an accomplice sir replied major carbonnell sneeringly you are certainly a very good judge of a gentleman when you happen by accident to be in his company with your leave i will send a note to another confederate the major then wrote a note to lord windermear which he despatched by timothy who hearing i was in trouble had accompanied the major and while he was away the major and i sat down he giving himself all manner of airs much to the annoyance of the magistrate who at last threatened to commit him immediately youll repent this replied the major who perceived lord windermear coming in you shall repent it sir by god cried the magistrate in a great passion put five shillings in the box for swearing mr b you fine other people said the major here is my other confederate lord windermear carbonnell said lord windermear what is all this nothing my lord except that our friend newland is taken up for shoplifting because he thought proper to run after a pretty womans carriage and i am accused by his worship of being his confederate i could forgive his suspicions of mr newland in that plight but as for his taking me for one of the swell mob it proves a great deficiency of judgment perhaps he will commit your lordship also as he may not be aware that your lordships person is above caption i can assure you sir said lord windermear proudly that this is my relative major carbonnell and the other is my friend mr newland i will bail them for any sum you please the magistrate felt astonished and annoyed for after all he had only done his duty before he could reply a man came from the shop to say that the laces had been found all right lord windermear then took me aside and i narrated what had happened he recollected the story of fleta in my narrative of my life and felt that i was right in trying to find out who the lady was the magistrate now apologised for the detention but explained to his lordship how i had before made my appearance upon another charge and with a low bow we were dismissed my dear mr newland said his lordship i trust that this will be a warning to you not to run after other peoples noses and earrings at the same time i will certainly keep a lookout for those very earrings myself major i wish you a good morning his lordship then shook us both by the hand and saying that he should be glad to see more of me than he latterly had done stepped into his carriage and drove off what the devil did his lordship mean about earrings newland inquired the major i told him that i was examining the ladys earrings as very remarkable replied i you appear to be able to deceive everybody but me my good fellow i know that you were examining the lady herself i left the major in his error by making no reply chapter xxix i borrow money upon my estate and upon very favourable terms when i came down to breakfast the next morning the major said my dear newland i have taken the liberty of requesting a very old friend of mine to come and meet you this morning i will not disguise from you that it is emmanuel the moneylender money you must have until my affairs are decided one way or the other and in this instance i will most faithfully repay the sum borrowed as soon as i receive the amount of my bets or am certain of succeeding to the title which is one and the same thing i bit my lips for i was not a little annoyed but what could be done i must have either confessed my real situation to the major or have appeared to raise scruples which as the supposed heir to a large fortune would have appeared to him to be very frivolous i thought it better to let the affair take its chance well replied i if it must be it must be but it shall be on my own terms nay observed the major there is no fear but that he will consent and without any trouble after a moments reflection i went up stairs and rang for timothy tim said i hear me i now make you a solemn promise on my honour as a gentleman that i will never borrow money upon interest and until you release me from it i shall adhere to my word very well sir replied timothy i guess your reason for so doing and i expect you will keep your word is that all yes now you may take up the urn we had finished our breakfast when timothy announced mr emmanuel who followed him into the room well old cent per cent how are you said the major allow me to introduce my most particular friend mr newland auh master major replied the descendant of abraham a little puny creature bent double with infirmity and carrying one hand behind his back as if to counterbalance the projection of his head and shoulders you vash please to call me shent per shent i wish i vash able to make de monies pay that mr newland can i be of any little shervice to you sit down sit down emmanuel you have my warrant for mr newlands respectability and the sooner we get over the business the better auh mr major it ish true you was recommend many goodno not always goodcustomers to me and i was very much obliged vat can i do for your handsome young friend de young gentlemen always vant money and it is de youth which is de time for de pleasure and enjoyment he wants a thousand pounds emmanuel dat is a large sumone tousand pounds he does not vant any more no replied i that will be sufficient vel den i have de monish in my pocket i will just beg de young gentleman to sign a little memorandum dat i may von day receive my monish but what is that to be interrupted i it will be to promise to pay me my monish and only fifteen per shent when you come into your own that will not do replied i i have pledged my solemn word of honour that i will not borrow money on interest and you have given de pledge but you did not swear upon de book no but my word has been given and that is enough if i would forfeit my word with those to whom i have given it i would also forfeit my word with you my keeping my promise ought to be a pledge to you that i will keep my promise to you dat is veil saidvery veil said but den we must manage some oder way supposelet me sheehow old are you my young sir past twenty auh dat is a very pleasant age dat twenty veil den you shall shign a leetle bit of paper that you pay me l ven you come into your properties on condition dat i pay now one tousand dat is very fairish it not mr major rather too hard emmanuel but de rishquede rishque mr major i will not agree to those terms replied i you must take your money away mr emmanuel veil denvat vill you pay me i will sign an agreement to pay you l for the thousand if you please if that will not suit you i will try elsewhere dat is very bad bargain how old you shay twenty vell i shuppose i must oblige you and my very goot friend de major mr emmanuel drew out his spectacles pen and inkhorn filled up a bond and handed it to me to sign i read it carefully over and signed it he then paid down the money and took his leave it may appear strange to the reader that the money was obtained so easily but he must remember that the major was considered a person who universally attached himself to young men of large fortune he had already been the means of throwing many profitable speculations into the hands of emmanuel and the latter put implicit confidence in him the moneylenders also are always on the look out for young men with large fortunes and have their names registered emmanuel had long expected me to come to him and although it was his intention to have examined more particularly and not to have had the money prepared yet my refusal to sign the bond bearing interest and my disputing the terms of the second proposal blinded him completely and put him off his usual guard upon my word newland you obtained better terms than i could have expected from the old hunks much better than i expected also major replied i but now how much of the money would you like to have my dear fellow this is very handsome of you but i thank heaven i shall be soon able to repay it but what pleases me newland is your perfect confidence in one whom the rest of the world would not trust with a shilling i will accept your offer as freely as it is made and take l just to make a show for the few weeks that i am in suspense and then you will find that with all my faults i am rot deficient in gratitude i divided the money with the major and he shortly afterwards went out well sir said timothy entering full of curiosity what have you done i have borrowed a thousand to pay fifteen hundred when i come into my property you are safe then excellent and the jew will be bit no timothy i intend to repay it as soon as i can i should like to know when that will be so should i tim for it must depend upon my finding out my parentage heigho thought i when shall i ever find out who is my father chapter xxx the major is very fortunate and very unfortunatehe receives a large sum in gold and one ounce of lead i dressed and went out met harcourt dined with him and on my return the major had not come home it was then past midnight and feeling little inclination to sleep i remained in the drawingroom waiting for his arrival about three oclock he came in flushed in the face and apparently in high good humour newland said he throwing his pocketbook on the table just open that and then you will open your eyes i obeyed him and to my surprise took out a bundle of banknotes i counted up their value and they amounted to l you have been fortunate indeed yes replied the major knowing that in a short time i shall be certain of cash one way or the other i had resolved to try my luck with the l i went to the hazard table and threw in seventeen timeshedged upon the deuce ace and threw out with itvoila they wont catch me there again in a hurryluck like that only comes once in a mans life but japhet there is a little drawback to all this i shall require your kind attendance in two or three hours why whats the matter merely an affair of honour i was insulted by a vagabond and we meet at six oclock a vagabondbut surely carbonnell you will not condescend my dear fellow although as great a vagabond as there is on the face of the earth yet he is a peer of the realm and his title warrants the meetingbut after all what is it i trust it will be nothing carbonnell but still it may prove otherwise granted and what then my dear newland we all owe heaven a death and if i am floored why then i shall no longer be anxious about title or fortune its a bad way of settling a dispute replied i gravely there is no other newland how would society be held in check if it were not for duelling we should all be a set of bears living in a beargarden i presume you have never been out never replied i and had hoped that i never should have then you must have better fortune or better temper than most others if you pass through life without an affair of this kind on your hands i mean as principal not as second but my dear fellow i must give you a little advice relative to your behaviour as a second for im very particular on these occasions and like that things should be done very correctly it will never do my dear newland that you appear on the ground with that melancholy face i do not mean that you should laugh or even smile that would be equally out of character but you should show yourself perfectly calm and indifferent in your behaviour towards the other second you must be most scrupulously polite but at the same time never give up a point of dispute in which my interest may be concerned even in your walk be slow and move as much as the ground will allow you as if you were in a drawingroom never remain silent offer even trivial remarks rather than appear distract there is one point of great importancei refer to choosing the ground in which perhaps you will require my unperceived assistance any decided line behind me would be very advantageous to my adversary such as the trunk of a tree post c even an elevated light or dark ground behind me is unadvisable choose if you can a broken light as it affects the correctness of the aim but as you will not probably be able to manage this satisfactorily i will assist you when on the ground after having divided the sun fairly between us i will walk about unconcernedly and when i perceive a judicious spot i will take a pinch of snuff and use my handkerchief turning at the same time in the direction in which i wish my adversary to be placed take your cue from that and with all suavity of manner insist as much as you can upon our being so placed that must be left to your own persuasive powers i believe i have now stated all that is necessary and i must prepare my instruments the major then went into his own room and i never felt more nervous or more unhinged than after this conversation i had a melancholy forebodingbut that i believe every one has when he for the first time has to assist at a mortal rencontre i was in a deep musing when he returned with his pistols and all the necessary apparatus and when the major pointed out to me and made me once or twice practice the setting of the hair triggers which is the duty of the second an involuntary shudder came over me why newland what is the matter with you i thought that you had more nerve i probably should show more carbonnell were i the principal instead of the second but i cannot bear the reflection that some accident should happen to you you are the only one with whom i have been on terms of friendship and the idea of losing you is very very painful newland you really quite unman me and you may now see a miracle continued carbonnell as he pressed his hand to his eye the moisture of a tear on the cheek of a london roue a man of the world who has long lived for himself and for this world only it never would be credited if asserted newland there was a time when i was like yourselfthe world took advantage of my ingenuousness and inexperience my good feelings were the cause of my ruin and then by degrees i became as callous and as hardened as the world itself my dear fellow i thought all affection all sentiment dried up within me but it is not the case you have made me feel that i have still a heart and that i can love you but this is all romance and not fitted for the present time it is now five oclock let us be on the ground earlyit will give us an advantage i do not much like speaking to you on the subject carbonnell but is there nothing that you might wish done in case of accident nothingwhy yes i may as well give me a sheet of paper the major sat down and wrote for a few minutes now send timothy and another here timothy and you sir see me sign this paper and put my seal to it i deliver this as my act and deed put your names as witnesses they complied with his request and then the major desired timothy to call a hackneycoach newland said the major putting the paper folded up in my pocket along with the bank notes take care of this for me till we come back the coach is at the door sir said timothy looking at me as if to say what can all this be about you may come with us and see said the major observing tims countenance and put that case into the coach tim who knew that it was the majors case of pistols appeared still more alarmed and stood still without obeying the order never mind tim your master is not the one who is to use them said the major patting him on the shoulder timothy relieved by this intelligence went down stairs with the pistols we followed him tim mounted on the box and we drove to chalk farm shall the coach wait inquired timothy yes by all means replied i in a low voice we arrived at the usual ground where disputes of this kind were generally settled and the major took a survey of it with great composure now observe japhet said he if you can contrive but here they are i will give you the notice agreed upon the peer whose title was lord tineholme now came up with his second whom he introduced to me as mr osborn mr newland replied the major saluting mr osborn in return we both took off our hats bowed and then proceeded to our duty i must do my adversarys second the justice to say that his politeness was fully equal to mine there was no mention on either side of explanations and retractionsthe insult was too gross and the character of his lordship as well as that of major carbonnell was too well known twelve paces were proposed by mr osborn and agreed to by methe pistols of major carbonnell were gained by drawing lotswe had nothing more to do but to place our principals the major took out his snuffbox took a pinch and blew his nose turning towards a copse of beech trees with your permission i will mark out the ground mr osborn said i walking up to the major and intending to pace twelve paces in the direction towards which he faced allow me to observe that i think a little more in this direction would be more fair for both parties said mr osborn it would so my dear sir replied i but submitting to your superior judgment perhaps it may not have struck you that my principal will have rather too much of the sun i am incapable of taking any advantage but i should not do my duty if i did not see every justice done to the major who has confided to me in this unpleasant affair i put it to you sir as a gentleman and man of honour whether i am claiming too much a little amicable altercation took place on this point but finding that i would not yield and that at every reply i was more and more polite and bland in my deportment mr osborn gave up the point i walked the twelve paces and mr osborn placed his principal i observed that lord tineholme did not appear pleased he expostulated with him but it was then too late the pistols had been already loadedthe choice was given to his lordship and major carbonnell received the other from my hand which actually trembled while his was firm i requested mr osborn to drop the handkerchief as i could not make up my mind to give a signal which might be fatal to the major they firedlord tineholme fell immediatelythe major remained on his feet for a second or two and then sank down on the ground i hastened up to him where are you hurt the major put his hand to his hipi am hit hard newland but not so hard as he is run and see i left the major and went up to where lord tineholme lay his head raised on the knee of his second it is all over with him mr newland the ball has passed through his brain chapter xxxi the major pays the only debt of consequence he ever did pay and i find myself a man of property i hastened back to the major to examine his wound and with the assistance of timothy i stripped him sufficiently to ascertain that the ball had entered his hip and probing the wound with my finger it appeared that it had glanced off in the direction of the intestines the suffusion of blood was very trifling which alarmed me still more could you bear removal major in the coach i cannot tell but we must try the sooner i am home the better japhet replied he faintly with the assistance of timothy i put him into the hackneycoach and we drove off after i had taken off my hat and made my obeisance to mr osborn an effort of politeness which i certainly should have neglected had i not been reminded of it by my principal we set off and the major bore his journey very well making no complaint but on our arrival he fainted as we lifted him out as soon as he was on the bed i despatched timothy for a surgeon on his arrival he examined the wound and shook his head taking me into the next room he declared his opinion that the ball had passed into the intestines which were severed and that there was no hope i sat down and covered up my facethe tears rolled down and trickled through my fingersit was the first heavy blow i had yet received without kindred or connections i felt that i was about to lose one who was dear to me to another not in my situation it might have only produced a temporary grief at the near loss of a friend but to me who was almost alone in the world the loss was heavy in the extreme whom had i to fly to for solacethere were timothy and fletaone who performed the duty of a servant to me and a child i felt that they were not sufficient and my heart was chilled the surgeon had in the meantime returned to the major and dressed the wound the major who had recovered from his weakness asked him his candid opinion we must hope for the best sir replied the surgeon that is to say there is no hope replied the major and i feel that you are right how long do you think that i may live if the wound does not take a favourable turn about fortyeight hours sir replied the surgeon but we must hope for a more fortunate issue in a deathbed case you medical men are like lawyers replied the major there is no getting a straightforward answer from you where is mr newland here i am carbonnell said i taking his hand my dear fellow i know it is all over with me and you of course know it as well as i do do not think that it is a source of much regret to me to leave this rascally worldindeed it is not but i do feel sorry very sorry to leave you the doctor tells me i shall live fortyeight hours but i have an idea that i shall not live so many minutes i feel my strength gradually failing me depend upon it my dear newland there is an internal hemorrhage my dear fellow i shall not be able to speak soon i have left you my executor and sole heir i wish there was more for youit will last you however till you come of age that was a lucky hit last night but a very unlucky one this morning bury me like a gentleman my dear carbonnell said i would you not like to see somebodya clergyman newland excuse me i do not refuse it out of disrespect or because i do not believe in the tenets of christianity but i cannot believe that my repentance at this late hour can be of any avail if i have not been sorry for the life i have livedif i have not had my moments of remorseif i have not promised to amend and intended to have so done and i trust i havewhat avails my repentance now no no japhet as i have sown so must i reap and trust to the mercy of heaven god only knows all our hearts and i would fain believe that i may find more favour in the eyes of the almighty than i have in this world from those whobut we must not judge give me to drink japheti am sinking fast god bless you my dear fellow the major sank on his pillow after he had moistened his lips and spoke no more with his hand clasped in mine he gradually sank and in a quarter of an hour his eyes were fixed and all was over he was right in his conjecturesan artery had been divided and he had bled to death the surgeon came again just before he was dead for i had sent for him it is better as it is said he to me had he not bled to death he would have suffered fortyeight hours of extreme agony from the mortification which must have ensued he closed the majors eyes and took his leave and i hastened into the drawingroom and sent for timothy with whom i sate in a long conversation on this unfortunate occurrence and my future prospects my grief for the death of the major was sincere much may indeed be ascribed to habit from our long residence and companionship but more to the knowledge that the major with all his faults had redeeming qualities and that the world had driven him to become what he had been i had the further conviction that he was attached to me and in my situation anything like affection was most precious his funeral was handsome without being ostentatious and i paid every demand upon him which i knew to be justmany indeed that were not sent in from a supposition that any claim made would be useless his debts were not much above l and these debts had never been expected to be liquidated by those who had given him credit the paper he had written and had been witnessed by timothy and another was a short will in which he left me his sole heir and executor the whole of his property consisted of his house in st jamess street the contents of his pocketbook entrusted to my care and his personal effects which especially in bijouterie were valuable the house was worth about l as he had told me in his pocketbook were notes to the amount of l and his other effects might be valued at l with all his debts and funeral expenses liquidated and with my own money i found myself in possession of about la sum which never could have been credited for it was generally supposed that he died worth less than nothing having lived for a long while upon a capital of a similar value i cannot but say observed timothy but that this is very fortunate had the major not persuaded you to borrow money he never would have won so large a sum had he lived he would have squandered it away but just in the nick of time he is killed and makes you his heir there is truth in your observation timothy but now you must go to mr emmanuel that i may pay him off i will repay the l lent me by lord windermear into his bankers and then i must execute one part of the poor majors will he left his diamond solitaire as a memento to his lordship bring it to me and i will call and present it chapter xxxii a chapter full of morality which ends in a jew refusing upwards of l proving the millenium to be nearly at hand this conversation took place the day after the funeral and attired in deep mourning i called upon his lordship and was admitted his lordship had sent his carriage to attend the funeral and was also in mourning when he received me i executed my commission and after a long conversation with his lordship in which i confided to him the contents of the will and the amount of property of the deceased i rose to take my leave excuse me mr newland said he but what do you now propose to do i confess i feel a strong interest about you and had wished that you had come to me oftener without an invitation i perceive that you never will have you no intention of following up any pursuit yes my lord i intend to search after my father and i trust that by husbanding my unexpected resources i shall now be able you have the credit in the fashionable world of possessing a large fortune that is not my fault my lord it is through major carbonnells mistake that the world is deceived still i must acknowledge myself so far participator that i have never contradicted the report meaning i presume by some good match to reap the advantage of the supposition not so my lord i assure you people may deceive themselves but i will not deceive them nor undeceive them mr newland undeceive them i will not nay if i did make the attempt i should not be believed they never would believe it possible that i could have lived so long with your relative without having had a large supply of money they might believe that i had run through my money but not that i never had any there is a knowledge of the world in that remark replied his lordship but i interrupted you so proceed i mean to observe my lord and you by your knowledge of my previous history can best judge how far i am warranted in saying so that i have as yet steered the middle course between that which is dishonest and honest if the world deceives itself you would say that in strict honesty i ought to undeceive it so i would my lord if it were not for my peculiar situation but at the same time i never will if possible be guilty of direct deceit that is to say i would not take advantage of my supposed wealth to marry a young person of large fortune i would state myself a beggar and gain her affections as a beggar a woman can have little confidence in a man who deceives her before marriage your secret will always be safe with me mr newland you have a right to demand it i am glad to hear the sentiments which you have expressed they are not founded perhaps upon the strictest code of morality but there are many who profess more who do not act up to so much still i wish you would think in what way i may be able to serve you for your life at present is useless and unprofitable and may tend to warp still more ideas which are not quite so strict as they ought to be my lord i have but one object in allowing the world to continue in their error relative to my means which is that it procures for me an entrance into that society in which i have a moral conviction that i shall find my father i have but one pursuit one end to attain which is to succeed in that search i return you a thousand thanks for your kind expressions and goodwill but i cannot at present avail myself of them i beg your lordships pardon but did you ever meet the lady with the earrings lord windermear smiled really mr newland you are a very strange person not content with finding out your own parents you must also be searching after other peoples not that i do not commend your conduct in this instance but im afraid in running after shadows you are too indifferent to the substance ah my lord it is very well for you to argue who have had a father and mother and never felt the want of them but if you knew how my heart yearns after my parents you would not be surprised at my perseverance i am surprised at nothing in this world mr newland every one pursues happiness in his own way your happiness appears to be centred in one feeling and you are only acting as the world does in general but recollect that the search after happiness ends in disappointment i grant it but too often does my lord but there is pleasure in the chase replied i well go and may you prosper all i can say is this mr newland do not have that false pride not to apply to me when you need assistance recollect it is much better to be under an obligation if such you will consider it than to do that which is wrong and that it is a very false pride which would blush to accept a favour and yet not blush to do what it ought to be ashamed of promise me mr newland that upon any reverse or exigence you will apply to me i candidly acknowledge to your lordship that i would rather be under an obligation to anyone but you and i trust you will clearly appreciate my feelings i have taken the liberty of refunding the one thousand pounds you were so kind as to place at my disposal as a loan at the same time i will promise that if at any time i should require your assistance i will again request leave to become your debtor i rose again to depart farewell newland when i thought you had behaved ill and i offered to better you you only demanded my good opinion you have it and have it so firmly that it will not easily be shaken his lordship then shook hands with me and i took my leave on my return i found emmanuel the moneylender who had accompanied timothy fancying that i was in want of more assistance and but too willing to give it his surprise was very great when i told him that i wished to repay the money i had borrowed vell dis is very strange i have lent my monish a tousand times and never once they did offer it me back vell i will take it sar but how much must i give you mr emmanuel for the ten days loan how mochvy you remember you vill give de bond moneyde fifteen hundred what five hundred pounds interest for ten days mr emmanuel no no thats rather too bad i will if you please pay you back eleven hundred pounds and that i think is very handsome i dont want my monish my good sar i lend you one tousand pounds on de condition that you pay me fifteen hundred when you come into your properties which will be in very short time you send for me and tell me you vish to pay back de monish directly i never refuse monishif you wish to pay i will take but i will not take von farding less dan de monish on de bond very well mr emmanuel just as you please i offer you your money back in presence of my servant and one hundred pounds for the loan of it for ten days refuse it if you choose but i earnestly recommend you to take it i will not have de monish sar dis is de childs play replied the jew i must have my fifteen hundredall in goot time sari am in no hurryi vish you a very good morning mr newland ven you vish for more monish to borrow i shall be happy to pay my respects so saying the jew walked out of the room with his arm behind his back as usual chapter xxxiii i decide upon honesty as the best policy and what is more strange receive legal advice upon this important point timothy and i burst into laughter really timothy observed i it appears that very little art is necessary to deceive the world for in every instance they will deceive themselves the jew is off my conscience at all events and now he never will be paid until until when japhet until i find out my father replied i everything is put off till that time arrives i observe said timothy other people will soon be as interested in the search as yourself i wish they were unfortunately it is a secret which cannot be divulged a ring at the bell called timothy down stairs he returned with a letter it was from lord windermear and ran as follows my dear newlandi have been thinking about you ever since you left me this morning and as you appear resolved to prosecute your search it has occurred to me that you should go about it in a more systematic way i do not mean to say that what i now propose will prove of any advantage to you but still it may as you will have a very old and very clever head to advise with i refer to mr masterton my legal adviser from whom you had the papers which led to our first acquaintance he is aware that you were i beg your pardon an impostor as he has since seen mr estcourt the letter enclosed is for him and with that in your hand you may face him boldly and i have no doubt but that he will assist you all in his power and put you to no expense narrate your whole history to him and then you will hear what he may propose he has many secrets much more important than yours wishing you every success that your perseverance deserves believe me yours very truly windermear i believe the advice to be good said i after reading the letter i am myself at fault and hardly know how to proceed i think i will go at once to the old gentleman timothy it can do no harm if it does no good two heads are better than one replied timothy some secrets are too well kept and deserting a child is one of those which is confided but to few bythebye timothy here have i been more than so many years out of the foundling hospital and have never yet inquired if any one has ever been to reclaim me very true and i think ill step myself to the workhouse at st bridgets and ask whether any one has asked about me replied timothy with a grin there is another thing that i have neglected observed i which is to inquire at the address in coleman street if there is any letter from melchior i have often thought of him replied timothy i wonder who he can bethere is another mystery there i wonder whether we shall ever fall in with him againand nattee too theres no saying timothy i wonder where that poor fool philotas and our friend jumbo are now the remembrance of the two last personages made us both burst out a laughing timothy ive been reflecting that my intimacy with poor carbonnell has rather hindered than assisted me in my search he found me with a good appearance and he has moulded me into a gentleman so far as manners and appearance are concerned but the constant vortex in which i have been whirled in his company has prevented me from doing anything his melancholy death has perhaps been fortunate for me it has left me more independent in circumstances and more free i must now really set to in earnest i beg your pardon japhet but did not you say the same when we first set off on our travels and yet remain more than a year with the gipsies did not you make the same resolution when we arrived in town with our pockets full of money and yet once into fashionable society think but little and occasionally of it now you make the same resolution and how long will you keep it nay timothy that remark is hardly fair you know that the subject is ever in my thoughts in your thoughts i grant very frequently but you have still been led away from the search i grant it but i presume that arises from not knowing how to proceed i have a skein to unravel and cannot find out an end to commence with i always thought people commenced with the beginning replied tim laughing at all events i will now try back and face the old lawyer do you call at coleman street tim and at st bridgets also if you please as for st bridgets im in no particular hurry about my mother if i stumble upon her i may pick her up but i never make diligent search after what in every probability will not be worth the finding leaving timothy to go his way i walked to the house at lincolns inn which i had before entered upon the memorable occasion of the papers of estcourt as before i rang the bell the door swang open and i was once more in the presence of mr masterton i have a letter sir said i bowing and presenting the letter from lord windermear the old gentleman peered at me through his spectacles why we have met beforebless mewhy youre the rogue that you are perfectly right sir interrupted i i am the rogue who presented the letter from lord windermear and who presents you with another from the same person do me the favour to read it while i take a chair upon my soulyou impudenthandsome dog i must saygreat pitycome for money i suppose well its a sad world muttered the lawyer as he broke open the letter of lord windermear i made no reply but watched his countenance which changed to that of an expression of surprise had his lordship sent me a request to have you hanged if possible said mr masterton i should have felt no surprise but in this letter he praises you and desires me to render you all the service in my power i cant understand it no sir but if you have leisure to listen to me you will then find that in this world we may be deceived by appearances well and so i was when i first saw you i never could have believed you to bebut never mind perhaps sir in an hour or two you will again alter your opinion are you at leisure or will you make an appointment for some future day mr newland i am not at leisurei never was more busy and if you had come on any legal business i should have put you off for three or four days at least but my curiosity is so raised that i am determined that i will indulge it at the expense of my interest i will turn the key and then you will oblige me by unravelling what at present is to me as curious as it is wholly incomprehensible chapter xxxiv i attempt to profit by intelligence i receive and throw a lady into hysterics in about three hours i had narrated the history of my life up to the very day almost as much detailed as it has been to the reader and now mr masterton said i as i wound up my narrative do you think that i deserve the title of rogue which you applied to me when i came in upon my word mr newland i hardly know what to say but i like to tell the truth to say that you have been quite honest would not be correcta rogue to a certain degree you have been but you have been the rogue of circumstances i can only say this that there are greater rogues than you whose characters are unblemished in the worldthat most people in your peculiar situation would have been much greater rogues and lastly that rogue or not rogue i have great pleasure in taking you by the hand and will do all i possibly can to serve youand that for your own sake your search after your parents i consider almost tantamount to a wildgoose chase but still as your happiness depends upon it i suppose it must be carried on but you must allow me time for reflection i will consider what may be the most judicious method of proceeding can you dine teteatete with me here on friday and we then will talk over the matter on friday sir i am afraid that i am engaged to lady maelstrom but that is of no consequencei will write an excuse to her ladyship lady maelstrom how very odd that you should bring up her name after our conversation why so my dear sir why replied mr masterton chuckling becauserecollect it is a secret mr newlandi remember some twenty years ago when she was a girl of eighteen before she married she had a little faux pas and i was called in about a settlement for the maintenance of the child is it possible sir replied i anxiously yes she was violently attached to a young officer without money but of good family some say it was a private marriage others that he wasa rascal it was all hushed up but he was obliged by the friends before he left for the west indies to sign a deed of maintenance and i was the party called in i never heard any more about it the officers name was warrender he died of the yellow fever i believe and after his death she married lord maelstrom he is dead then replied i mournfully well that cannot affect you my good fellow on friday then at six oclock precisely good afternoon mr newland i shook hands with the old gentleman and returned home but my brain whirled with the fear of a confirmation of that which mr masterton had so carelessly conveyed anything like a possibility immediately was swelled to a certainty in my imagination so ardent and heated on the one subject and as soon as i regained my room i threw myself on the sofa and fell into a deep reverie i tried to approximate the features of lady maelstrom to mine but all the ingenuity in the world could not effect that but still i might be like my fatherbut my father was dead and that threw a chill over the whole glowing picture which i had as usual conjured up besides it was asserted that i was born in wedlock and there was a doubt relative to the marriage of her ladyship after a long cogitation i jumped up seized my hat and set off for grosvenor square determining to ask a private interview with her ladyship and at once end my harassing doubts and surmises i think there could not be a greater proof of my madness than my venturing to attack a lady of forty upon the irregularities of her youth and to question her upon a subject which had been confided but to two or three and she imagined had been long forgotten but this never struck me all considerations were levelled in my ardent pursuit i walked through the streets at a rapid pace the crowd passed by me as shadows i neither saw nor distinguished them i was deep in reverie as to the best way of breaking the subject to her ladyship for notwithstanding my monomania i perceived it to be a point of great delicacy after having overturned about twenty people in my mad career i arrived at the door and knocked my heart beat almost as hard against my ribs with excitement is her ladyship at home yes sir i was ushered into the drawingroom and found her sitting with two of her nieces the misses fairfax mr newland you have been quite a stranger said her ladyship as i walked up to her and made my obeisance i did intend to scold you well but i suppose that sad affair of poor major carbonnells has been a heavy blow to youyou were so intimatelived together i believe did you not however you have not so much cause to regret for he was not a very proper companion for young men like you to tell you the truth i consider it as a fortunate circumstance that he was removed for he would by degrees have led you into all manner of mischief and have persuaded you to squander your fortune i did at one time think of giving you a hint but it was a delicate point now that he is gone i tell you very candidly that you have had an escape a young man like you mr newland who could command an alliance into the highest yes the very highest familiesand let me tell you mr newland that there is nothing like connectionmoney is of no consequence to you but connection mr newland is what you should look forconnection with some high family and then you will do well i should like to see you settledwell settled i mean mr newland now that you are rid of the major who has ruined many young men in his time i trust you will seriously think of settling down into a married man cecilia my dear show your tambour work to mr newland and ask him his opinion is it not beautiful mr newland extremely beautiful indeed maam replied i glad at last that her ladyship allowed me to speak a word emma my dear you look pale you must go out into the air go children put your bonnets on and take a turn in the garden when the carriage comes round i will send for you the young ladies quitted the room nice innocent girls mr newland but you are not partial to blondes i believe indeed lady maelstrom i infinitely prefer the blonde to the brunette that proves your taste mr newland the fairfaxes are of a very old familysaxon mr newland fairfax is saxon for light hair is it not remarkable that they should be blondes to this day pure blood mr newland you of course have heard of general fairfax in the time of cromwell he was their direct ancestoran excellent family and highly connected mr newland you are aware that they are my nieces my sister married mr fairfax i paid the misses fairfax the compliments which i thought they really deserved for they were very pretty amiable girls and required no puffing on the part of her ladyship and then i commenced your ladyship has expressed such kind wishes towards me that i cannot be sufficiently grateful but perhaps your ladyship may think me romantic i am resolved never to marry except for love a very excellent resolve mr newland there are few young men who care about love nowadays but i consider that love is a great security for happiness in the wedded state true madam and what can be more delightful than a first attachment i appeal to your ladyship was not your first attachment the most delightfulare not the reminiscences most lastingdo you not even now call to mind those halcyon days when love was all and every thing my days of romance are long past mr newland replied her ladyship indeed i never had much romance in my composition i married lord maelstrom for the connection and i loved him pretty well that is soberly mr newland i mean i loved him quite enough to marry him and to obey my parents that is all but my dear lady maelstrom i did not refer to your marriage with his lordship i referred to your first love my first love mr newland pray what do you mean replied her ladyship looking very hard at me your ladyship need not be ashamed of it our hearts are not in our own keeping nor can we always control our passions i have but to mention the name of warrender warrender shrieked her ladyship pray mr newland continued her ladyship recovering herself who gave you that piece of information my dear lady maelstrom pray do not be displeased with me but i am very particularly interested in this affair your love for mr warrender long before your marriage is well known to me and it is to that love to which i referred when i asked you if it was not most delightful well mr newland replied her ladyship how you have obtained the knowledge i know not but there was i acknowledge a trifling flirtation with edward warrender and mebut i was young very young at that time i grant it and do not for a moment imagine that i intend to blame your ladyship but as i before said madam i am much interested in the business what interest you can have with a little flirtation of mine which took place before you were born i cannot imagine mr newland it is because it took place before i was born that i feel so much interest i cannnot understand you mr newland and i think we had better change the subject excuse me madam but i must request to continue it a little longer is mr warrender dead or not did he die in the west indies you appear to be very curious on this subject mr newland i hardly can tell yes now i recollect he did die of the yellow fever i thinkbut i have quite forgotten all about itand i shall answer no more questions if you were not a favourite of mine mr newland i should say that you were very impertinent then your ladyship i will put but one more question and that one i must put with your permission i should think after what i have said mr newland that you might drop the subject i will your ladyship immediately but pardon me the question well mr newland do not be angry with me well exclaimed her ladyship who appeared alarmed nothing but the most important and imperative reasons could induce me to ask the question her ladyship gasped for breath and could not speak i stammered but at last i brought it out what has become ofofof the sweet pledge of your love lady maelstrom her ladyship coloured up with rage raised up her clenched hand and then fell back in violent hysterics chapter xxxv i repair the damage and make things worseplot and counterplottim gains a watch by setting watch upon his tongue i hardly knew how to actif i called the servants my interview would be at an end and i was resolved to find out the truthfor the same reason i did not like to ring for water some vases with flowers were on the table i took out the flowers and threw the water in her face but they had been in the water some time and had discoloured it green her ladyships dress was a high silk gown of a bright slate colour and was immediately spoiled but this was no time to stand upon trifles i seized hold of a glass bottle fancying in my hurry it was eau de cologne or some essence and poured a little into her mouth unfortunately it was a bottle of marking ink which her ladyship who was very economical had on the table in disguise i perceived my error and had recourse to another vase of flowers pouring a large quantity of the green water down her throat whether the unusual remedies had an effect or not i cannot tell but her ladyship gradually revived and as she leant back on the sofa sobbing every now and then convulsively i poured into her ear a thousand apologies until i thought she was composed enough to listen to me your ladyships maternal feelings said i its all a calumny a base lie sir shrieked she nay nay why be ashamed of a youthful passion why deny what was in itself creditable to your unsophisticated mind does not your heart even now yearn to embrace your sonwill not you bless me if i bring him to your feetwill not you bless your son and receive him with delight it was a girl screamed her ladyship forgetting herself and again falling into hysterics a girl replied i then i have lost my time and it is no use my remaining here mortified at the intelligence which overthrew my hopes and castle buildings i seized my hat descended the stairs and quitted the house in my hurry and confusion quite forgetting to call the servants to her ladyships assistance fortunately i perceived the misses fairfax close to the iron railing of the garden i crossed the road wished them goodbye and told them that i thought lady maelstrom looked very ill and they had better go in to her i then threw myself into the first hackneycoach and drove home i found timothy had arrived before me and i narrated all that had passed you will never be able to go there again observed timothy and depend upon it she will be your enemy through life i wish you had not said anything to her what is done cannot be undone but recollect that if she can talk i can talk also will she not be afraid yes openly she will and open attacks can be parried very true but it will be as well to pacify her if i can i will write to her i sat down and wrote as follows my dear lady maelstromi am so astonished and alarmed at the situation i put you in by my impertinence and folly that i hardly know how to apologise the fact is that looking over some of my fathers old letters i found many from warrender in which he spoke of an affair with a young lady and i read the name as your maiden name and also discovered where the offspring was to be found on reexamination for your innocence was too evident at our meeting to admit of a doubt i find that the name although something like yours is spelt very differently and that i must have been led into an unpardonable error what can i say except that i throw myself on your mercy i dare not appear before you again i leave town tomorrow but if you can pardon my folly and impertinence and allow me to pay my respects when london is full again and time shall have softened down your just anger write me one line to that effect and you will relieve the burdened conscience of yours most truly j newland there tim said i as i finished reading it over take that as a sop to the old cerberus she may think it prudent as i have talked of letters to believe me and make friends i will not trust her nevertheless tim went away and very soon returned with an answer you are a foolish madcap and i ought to shut my doors against you you have halfkilled mespoilt my gown and i am obliged to keep my bed remember in future to be sure of the right name before you make an assertion as for forgiving you i shall think of it and when you return to town you may call and receive my sentence cecilia was quite frightened poor dear girl what a dear affectionate child she isshe is a treasure to me and i dont think i ever could part with her she sends her regards yours c maelstrom come timothy at all events this is better than i expectedbut now ill tell you what i propose to do harcourt was with me yesterday and he wishes me to go down with him to there will be the assizes and the county ball and a great deal of gaiety and i have an idea that it is just as well to beat the country as the town i dine with mr masterton on friday on saturday i will go down and see fleta and on tuesday or wednesday i will start with harcourt to his fathers where he has promised me a hearty welcome was there anything at coleman street yes sir mr iving said that he had just received a letter from your correspondent and that he wished to know if the little girl was well i told him that she was mr iving laid the letter down on the desk and i read the postmark dublin dublin replied i i should like to find out who melchior isand so i will as soon as i can well sir i have not finished my story mr iving said my correspondent wishes to know whether the education of the little girl is attended to yes replied i it is is she at school yes she has been at school ever since we have been in london where is she at school inquired he now sir as i never was asked that question by him before i did not know whether i ought to give an answer so i replied that i did not know you know whether she is in london or not do you not how should i replied i master had put her to school before i put on his liveries does he never go to see her inquired he i suppose so said i then you really know nothing about itthen look you my lad i am anxious to find out where she is at school and the name of the people and if you will find out the direction for me it will be money in your pocket thats all um replied i but how much why more than you think for my man it will be a tenpound note that alters the case replied i now i think again i have an idea that i do remember seeing her address on a letter my master wrote to her ay replied mr iving its astonishing how money sharpens the memory ill keep to my bargain give me the address and heres the tenpound note im afraid that my master will be angry said i as if i did not much like to tell him your master will never know anything about it and you may serve a long time before he gives you a tenpound note above your wages thats very true said i sarvice is no inheritance well then give me the money and ill write it down and did you give it interrupted i stop a moment sir and you shall hear i wrote down the address of that large school at kensington which we pass when we go to mr aubrey whites what that tremendous large board with yellow lettersmrs letwhat is it mrs lipscombes seminaryi always read the board every time i go up and down i gave him the address miss johnson at mrs lipscombes seminary kensington welland heres the tenpound note sir which i have fairly earned fairly earned tim yes fairly earned for its all fair to cheat those who would cheat you i cannot altogether agree with you on that point tim but it certainly is no more than they deserve but this is matter for reflection why should melchior wish to find out her address without my knowledgedepend upon it there is something wrong thats what i said to myself coming home and i made up my mind that for some reason or another he wishes to regain possession of her i entertain the same idea timothy and i am glad you have disappointed him i will take care that they shall not find her out now that i am upon my guard but sir i wish to draw one good moral from this circumstance which is that if you had been served by any common footman your interest would in all probability have been sacrificed to the tenpound note and that not only in this instance but in many others i did a very wise thing in taking my present situation i am but too well aware of that tim my dear fellow said i extending my hand and depend upon it that if i rise you do you know me well enough by this time yes i do japhet and had rather serve you than the first nobleman in the land im going to purchase a watch with this tenpound note and i never shall look at it without remembering the advantage of keeping a watch over my tongue chapter xxxvi i fall very much in love with honesty because i find that it is well received in the worldand to prove my honesty inform the whole world that honest i have never been i proved the will of major carbonnell in which there was no difficulty and then i sat down to consider in what way i might best husband my resources the house was in good repair and well furnished at the time that i lived with the major we had our drawingroom and his bedroom and another room equally large used as his dressingroom on the first floor the second floor was appropriated to me and the sittingroom was used as a diningroom when we dined at home which was but seldom the basement was let as a shop at one hundred pounds per annum but we had a private door for entrance and the kitchens and attics i resolved to retain only the first floor and let the remainder of the house and i very soon got a tenant at sixty pounds per annum the attics were appropriated to timothy and the servants belonging to the lodger after having disposed of what was of no service to me i found that deducting the thousand pounds paid into the bankers for lord windermear i had a little above three thousand pounds in ready money and what to do with this i could not well decide i applied to mr masterton stating the exact amount of my finances on the day that i dined with him and he replied you have two good tenants bringing you in one hundred and sixty pounds per annumif this money is put out on mortgage i can procure you five per cent which will be one hundred and fifty pounds per annum now the question is do you think that you can live upon three hundred and ten pounds per annum you have no rent to pay and i should think that as you are not at any great expense for a servant you might with economy do very well recollect that if your money is lent on mortgage you will not be able to obtain it at a moments warning so reflect well before you decide i consulted with timothy and agreed to lend the money reserving about two hundred pounds to go on with until i should receive my rents and interest on the friday i went to dine with mr masterton and narrated what had passed between me and lady maelstrom he was very much diverted and laughed immoderately upon my faith mr newland but you have a singular species of madness you first attack lord windermear then a bishop and to crown all you attack a dowager peeress i must acknowledge that if you do not find out your parents it will not be for want of inquiry altogether you are a most singular character your history is most singular and your good fortune is equally so you have made more friends before you have come to age than most people do in their whole lives you commence the world with nothing and here you are with almost a competencehave paid off a loan of one thousand pounds which was not requiredand are moving in the best society now the only drawback i perceive in all this is that you are in society under false colours having made people suppose that you are possessed of a large fortune it was not exactly my assertion sir no i grant not exactly but you have been a party to it and i cannot allow that there is any difference now do you mean to allow this supposition to remain uncontradicted i hardly know what to say sir if i were to state that i have nothing but a bare competence it will be only injurious to the memory of major carbonnell all the world will suppose that he has ruined me and that i had the fortune whereas on the contrary it is to him that i am indebted for my present favourable position that may be very true mr newland but if i am to consider you as my protege and i may add the protege of lord windermear i must make you quite honesti will be no party to fraud in any shape are you prepared to resign your borrowed plumes and appear before the world as you really are there is but one inducement sir for me to wish that the world may still deceive themselves i may be thrown out of society and lose the opportunity of discovering my parents and pray mr newland which do you think is more likely to tend to the discovery a general knowledge that you are a foundling in search of your parents or your present method of taxing everybody upon suspicion if your parents wish to reclaim you they will then have their eyes directed towards you from your position being known and i will add there are few parents who will not be proud of you as a son you will have the patronage of lord windermear which will always secure you a position in society and the good wishes of all although i grant that such worldly people as lady maelstrom may strike your name off their porters list you will moreover have the satisfaction of knowing that the friends which you make have not been made under false colours and appearances and a still further satisfaction arising from a good conscience i am convinced sir and i thank you for your advice i will now be guided by you in everything give me your hand my good lad i now will be your friend to the utmost of my power i only wish sir replied i much affected that you were also my father thank you for the wish as it implies that you have a good opinion of me what do you mean to do i have promised my friend mr harcourt to go down with him to his fathers well and before i go i will undeceive him you are right you will then find whether he is a friend to you or to your supposed ten thousand pounds per annum i have been reflecting and i am not aware that anything else can be done at present than acknowledging to the world who you really are which is more likely to tend to the discovery of your parents than any other means but at the same time i shall not be idle all we lawyers have among us strange secrets and among my fraternity to whom i shall speak openly i think it possible that something may be found out which may serve as a clue do not be annoyed at being cut by many when your history is known those who cut you are those whose acquaintance and friendship are not worth having it will unmask your flatterers from your friends and you will not repent of your having been honest in the end it is the best policy even in a worldly point of view come to me as often as you please i am always at home to you and always your friend such was the result of my dinner with mr masterton which i narrated to timothy as soon as i returned home well japhet i think you have found a real friend in mr masterton and i am glad that you have decided upon following his advice as for me i am not under false colours i am in my right situation and wish no more in pursuance of my promise to mr masterton i called upon harcourt the next morning and after stating my intention to go down for a day or two into the country to see a little girl who was under my care i said to him harcourt as long as we were only town acquaintances mixing in society and under no peculiar obligation to each other i did not think it worth while to undeceive you on a point in which major carbonnell was deceived himself and has deceived others but now that you have offered to introduce me into the bosom of your family i cannot allow you to remain in error it is generally supposed that i am about to enter into a large property when i come of age now so far from that being the case i have nothing in the world but a bare competence and the friendship of lord windermear in fact i am a deserted child ignorant of my parents and most anxious to discover them as i have every reason to suppose that i am of no mean birth i tell you this candidly and unless you renew the invitation shall consider that it has not been given harcourt remained a short time without answering you really have astonished me newland but continued he extending his hand i admirei respect you and i feel that i shall like you better with ten thousand pounds ayear you were above menow we are but equals i as a younger brother have but a bare competence as well as you and as for parentsfor the benefit i now derive from them i might as well have none not but my father is a worthy fine old gentleman but the estates are entailed he is obliged to keep up his position in society and he has a large family to provide for and he can do no more you have indeed an uncommon moral courage to have made this confession do you wish it to be kept a secret on the contrary i wish the truth to be known i am glad that you say so as i have mentioned you as a young man of large fortune to my father but i feel convinced when i tell him this conversation he will be much more pleased in taking you by the hand than if you were to come down and propose to one of my sisters i repeat the invitation with double the pleasure that i gave it at first i thank you harcourt replied i some day i will tell you more i must not expect however that everybody will prove themselves as noble in ideas as yourself perhaps not but never mind that on friday next then we start agreed i shook hands and left him chapter xxxvii i try back to recover the lost scent and discover to my astonishment that i have been transported for forgery the behaviour of harcourt was certainly a good encouragement and had i been wavering in my promise to mr masterton would have encouraged me to proceed i returned home with a light heart and a pleasing satisfaction from the conviction that i had done right the next morning i set off for and as it was a long while since i had seen fleta our meeting was a source of delight on both sides i found her very much grown and improved she was approaching her fifteenth year as nearly as we could guessof course her exact age was a mystery her mind was equally expanded her mistress praised her docility and application and wished to know whether i intended that she should be taught music and drawing for both of which she had shown a decided taste to this i immediately consented and fleta hung on my shoulder and embraced me for the indulgence she was now fast approaching to womanhood and my feelings towards her were more intense than ever i took the chain of coral and gold beads from her neck telling her that i must put it into a secure place as much depended upon them she was curious to know why but i would not enter into the subject at that time one caution i gave her in case by any chance her retreat should be discovered by the companions of melchior which was that without i myself came she was on no account to leave the school even if a letter from me was produced requesting her to come unless that letter was delivered by timothy i gave the same directions to her mistress paid up her schooling and expenses and then left her promising not to be so long before i saw her again on my return to town i deposited the necklace with mr masterton who locked it up carefully in his iron safe on the friday as agreed harcourt and i accompanied by timothy and harcourts servant started on the outside of the coach as younger brothers usually convey themselves for his fathers seat in shire and arrived there in time for dinner i was kindly received by old mr harcourt and his family consisting of his wife and three amiable and beautiful girls but on the second day during which interval i presume harcourt had an opportunity of undeceiving his father i was delighted to perceive that the old gentlemans warmth of behaviour towards me was increased i remained there for a fortnight and never was so happy i was soon on the most intimate terms with the whole family and was treated as if i belonged to it yet when i went to bed every night i became more and more melancholy i felt what a delight it must be to have parents sisters and friendsthe bosom of a family to retire into to share with it your pleasures and your pains and the tears often ran down my cheeks and moistened my pillow when i had not an hour before been the happiest of the happy and the gayest of the gay in a family party there is nothing so amusing as any little talent out of the general way and my performances and tricks on cards c in which melchior had made me such an adept were now brought forward as a source of innocent gratification when i quitted i had a general and hearty welcome to the house from the parents and the eyes of the amiable girls as well as mine were not exactly dry as we bade each other farewell you told your father harcourt did you not yes and the whole of them japhet and you must acknowledge that in their estimation you did not suffer my father is pleased with our intimacy and advises me to cultivate it to prove to you that i am anxious so to do i have a proposal to make i know your house as well as you do and that you have reserved only the first floor for yourself but there are two good rooms on the first floor and you can dispense with a dressingroom suppose we club together it will be a saving to us both as poor carbonnell said when he took you in with all my heart i am delighted with the proposal harcourt then stated what it was his intention to offer for his share of the apartment the other expenses to be divided and his servant dismissed i hardly need say that we did not disagree and before i had been a week in town we were living together my interview with mr masterton and subsequent events had made me forget to call on the governors of the foundling hospital to ascertain whether there had been any inquiries after me on my return to town i went there and finding that there was a meeting to be held on the next day i presented myself i was introduced into the room where they were assembled you wish to speak with the governors of the hospital i understand said the presiding governor yes sir replied i i have come to ask whether an inquiry has been made after one of the inmates of this charity of the name of japhet newland japhet newland if you recollect sir he was bound to an apothecary of the name of cophagus in consequence of some money which was left with him as an infant enclosed in a letter in which it was said that he would be reclaimed if circumstances permitted i recollect it perfectly wellit is now about six years back i think there was some inquiry was there not mr g i think that there was about a year and a half ago but we will send for the secretary and refer to the minutes my heart beat quick and the perspiration bedewed my forehead when i heard this intelligence at last my emotion was so great that i felt faint you are ill sir said one of the gentlemen quicka glass of water the attendant brought a glass of water which i drank and recovered myself you appear to be much interested in this young mans welfare i am sir replied i no one can be more so the secretary now made his appearance with the register and after turning over the leaves read as follows august the th a gentleman came to inquire after an infant left here of the name of japhet with whom money had been depositedjaphet christened by order of the governors japhet newlandreferred to the shop of mr cophagus smithfield market he returned the next day saying that mr cophagus had retired from businessthat the parties in the shop knew nothing for certain but believed that the said japhet newland had been transported for life for forgery about a year before good heavens what an infamous assertion exclaimed i clasping my hands on reference back to the calendar we observed that one j newland was transported for such an offence query it must have been some other person but this has arisen from the vindictive feeling of those two scoundrels who served under pleggit cried i how can you possibly tell sir mildly observed one of the governors how can i tell sir replied i starting from my chair why i am japhet newland myself sir you sir replied the governor surveying my fashionable exterior my chains and bijouterie yes sir i am the japhet newland brought up in this asylum and who was apprenticed to mr cophagus probably then sir replied the president you are the mr newland whose name appears at all the fashionable parties in high life i believe that i am the same person sir i wish you joy upon your success in the world sir it would not appear that it can be very important to you to discover your parents sir replied i you have never known what it is to feel the want of parents and friends fortunate as you may consider me to beand i acknowledge i have every reason to be grateful for my unexpected rise in lifei would at this moment give up all that i am worth resume my foundling dress and be turned out a beggar if i could but discover the authors of my existencei then bowed low to the governors and quitted the room chapter xxxviii mischief brewingtimothy and i set our wits to work and he resumes his old profession of a gipsy i hastened home with feelings too painful to be described i had a soreness at my heart an oppression on my spirits which weighed me down i had but one wishthat i was dead i had already imparted to harcourt the history of my life and when i came in i threw myself upon the sofa in despair and relieved my agonised heart with a flood of tears as soon as i could compose myself i stated what had occurred my dear newland although it has been an unfortunate occurrence in itself i do not see that you have so much cause to grieve for you have this satisfaction that it appears there has been a wish to reclaim you yes replied i i grant that but have they not been told and have they not believed that i have been ignominiously punished for a capital crime will they ever seek me more probably not you must now seek them what i should recommend is that you repair tomorrow to the apothecarys shop and interrogate relative to the person who called to make inquiries after you if you will allow me i will go with you and be insulted by those malignant scoundrels they dare not insult you as an apothecarys apprentice they would but as a gentleman they will quail and if they do not their master will most certainly be civil and give you all the information which he can we may as well however not do things by halves i will borrow my aunts carriage for the morning and we will go in style i think i will call this evening upon mr masterton and ask his advice ask him to accompany us newland and he will frighten them with libel and defamation of character i called upon mr masterton that evening and told my story it is indeed very provoking newland but keep your courage up i will go with you tomorrow and will see what we can make of it at what time do you propose to start will it suit you sir if we call at one oclock yes so goodnight my boy for i have something here which i must contrive to get through before that time harcourt had procured the carriage and we picked up mr masterton at the hour agreed and proceeded to smithfield when we drove up to the door of mr pleggits shop the assistants at first imagined that it was a mistake few handsome carriages are to be seen stopping in this quarter of the metropolis we descended and entered the shop mr masterton inquiring if mr pleggit was at home the shopmen who had not recognised me bowed to the ground in their awkward way and one ran to call mr pleggit who was up stairs mr pleggit descended and we walked into the back parlour mr masterton then told him the object of our calling and requested to know why the gentleman who had inquired after me had been sent away with the infamous fabrication that i had been transported for forgery mr pleggit protested innocencerecollected however that a person had calledwould make every inquiry of his shopmen the head man was called in and interrogatedat first he appeared to make a joke of it but when threatened by mr masterton became humbleacknowledged that they had said that i was transported for they had read it in the newspaperswas sorry for the mistake said that the gentleman was a very tall person very well dressed very much of a gentlemancould not recollect his exact dresswas a large built man with a stern facebut seemed very much agitated when he heard that i had been transported called twice mr pleggit was not in at firstleft his namethinks the name was put down on the day bookwhen he called a second time mr pleggit was at home and referred him to them not knowing what had become of me the other shopman was examined and his evidence proved similar to that of the first the daybook was sent for and the day in august referred to there was a name written down on the side of the page which the shopman said he had no doubt indeed he could almost swear was the gentlemans name as there was no other name put down on that day the name as taken down was derbennon this was all the information we could obtain and we then quitted the shop and drove off without there being any recognition of me on the part of mr pleggit and his assistants i never heard that name before observed harcourt to mr masterton it is in all probability de benyon replied the lawyer we must make allowances for their ignorance at all events this is a sort of clue to follow up the de benyons are irish then i will set off for ireland tomorrow morning sir said i you will do no such thing replied the lawyer but you will call upon me tomorrow evening and perhaps i may have something to say to you i did not fail to attend mr masterton who stated that he had made every inquiry relative to the de benyons as he had said they were an irish family of the highest rank and holding the peerage of de beauvoir but that he had written to his agent in dublin giving him directions to obtain for him every possible information in his power relative to all the individuals composing it till this had been received all that i could do was to remain quiet i then narrated to him the behaviour of the agent mr iving to timothy there is some mystery there most assuredly observed mr masterton when do you go again to i replied that it was not my intention to go there for some time unless he would wish to see the little girl i do newland i think i must take her under my protection as well as you we will go down tomorrow sunday is the only day i can spare but it must be put down as a work of charity the next day we went down to fleta was surprised to see me so soon and mr masterton was much struck with the elegance and classical features of my little protegee he asked her many questions and with his legal tact contrived to draw from her many little points relative to her infant days which she had till he put his probing questions quite forgotten as we returned to town he observed you are right japhet that is no child of humble origin her very appearance contradicts it but we have i think a chance of discovering who she isa better one im afraid than at present we have for your identification but never mind let us trust to perseverance for three weeks i continued to live with harcourt but i did not go out much such was the state of my affairs when timothy came to my room one morning and said i do not know whether you have observed it sir but there is a man constantly lurking about here watching the house i believe i think but still im not quite sure that i have seen his face before but where i cannot recollect indeed what sort of a person may he be he is a very dark man stout and well made and is dressed in a sort of halfsailor halfgentlemans dress such as you see put on by those who belong to the funny clubs on the river but he is not at all a gentleman himselfquite the contrary it is now about a week that i have seen him every day and i have watched him and perceive that he generally follows you as soon as you go out well replied i we must find out what he wantsif we can point him out to me i will soon see if he is tracing my steps timothy pointed him out to me after breakfast i could not recollect the face and yet it appeared that i had seen it before i went out and after passing half a dozen streets i turned round and perceived that the man was dodging me i took no notice but being resolved to try him again i walked to the white horse cellar and took a seat inside a brentford coach about to start on my arrival at brentford i got out and perceived that the man was on the roof of a sudden it flashed on my memoryit was the gipsy who had come to the camp with the communication to melchior which induced him to quit it i recollected himand his kneeling down by the stream and washing his face the mystery was solvedmelchior had employed him to find out the residence of fleta in all probability they had applied to the false address given by timothy and in consequence were trying by watching my motions to find out the true one you shall be deceived at all events thought i as i walked on through brentford until i came to a ladies seminary i rang the bell and was admitted stating my wish to know the terms of the school for a young lady and contrived to make as long a stay as i could promising to call again if the relatives of the young lady were as satisfied as i professed to be on my quitting the house i perceived that my gipsy attendant was not far off i took the first stage back and returned to my lodgings when i had told all that had occurred to timothy he replied i think sir that if you could replace me for a week or two i could now be of great service he does not know me and if i were to darken my face and put on a proper dress i think i should have no difficulty in passing myself off as one of the tribe knowing their slang and having been so much with them but what good do you anticipate timothy my object is to find out where he puts up and to take the same quartersmake his acquaintance and find out who melchior is and where he lives my knowledge of him and nattee may perhaps assist me you must be careful then timothy for he may know sufficient of our history to suspect you let me alone sir do you like my proposal yes i do you may commence your arrangements immediately chapter xxxix i set off on a wild goose chaseand fall in with an old friend the next morning timothy had procured me another valet and throwing off his liveries made his appearance in the evening sending up to say a man wished to speak to me he was dressed in highlow boots worsted stockings greasy leather small clothes a shag waistcoat and a blue frock overall his face was stained of a dark olive and when he was ushered in harcourt who was sitting at table with me had not the slightest recognition of him as harcourt knew all my secrets i had confided this i had not told him what timothys intentions were as i wished to ascertain whether his disguise was complete i had merely said i had given timothy leave for a few days perhaps you may wish me away for a short time said harcourt looking at tim not at all my dear harcourt why should i theres nobody here but you and timothy timothy excellentupon my word i never should have known him he is going forth on his adventures and if you please sir i will lose no time it is now dark and i know where the gipsy hangs out success attend you then but be careful tim you had better write to me instead of calling i had the same idea and now i wish you a good evening when timothy quitted the room i explained our intentions to harcourt yours is a strange adventurous sort of life newland you are constantly plotted against and plotting in your turnmines and countermines i have an idea that you will turn out some grand personage after all for if not why should there be all this trouble about you the trouble in the present case is all about fleta who must by your argument turn out some grand personage well perhaps she may i should like to see that little girl newland that cannot be just now for reasons you well know but some other time it will give me great pleasure on the second day after tims departure i received a letter from him by the twopenny post he had made the acquaintance of the gipsy but had not extracted any information being as yet afraid to venture any questions he further stated that his new companion had no objection to a glass or two and that he had no doubt but that if he could contrive to make him tipsy in a few days he would have some important intelligence to communicate i was in a state of great mental agitation during this time i went to mr masterton and narrated to him all that had passed he was surprised and amused and desired me not to fail to let him have the earliest intelligence of what came to light he had not received any answer as yet from his agent in dublin it was not until eight days afterwards that i received further communication from timothy and i was in a state of great impatience combined with anxiety lest any accident should have happened his communication was important he was on the most intimate footing with the man who had proposed that he should assist him to carry off a little girl who was at a school at brentford they had been consulting how this should be done and timothy had proposed forging a letter desiring her to come up to town and his carrying it as a livery servant the man had also other plans one of which was to obtain an entrance into the house by making acquaintance with the servants another by calling to his aid some of the women of his fraternity to tell fortunes nothing was as yet decided but that he was resolved to obtain possession of the little girl even if he were obliged to resort to force in either case timothy was engaged to assist when i read this i more than congratulated myself upon the mans being on the wrong scent and that timothy had hit upon his scheme timothy continuedthat they had indulged in very deep potations last night and that the man had not scrupled to say that he was employed by a person of large fortune who paid well and whom it might not be advisable to refuse as he had great power after some difficulty he asked timothy if he had ever heard the name of melchior in his tribe timothy replied that he had and that at the gathering he had seen him and his wife timothy at one time thought that the man was about to reveal everything but of a sudden he stopped short and gave evasive answers to a question put by timothy as to where they were to take the child if they obtained possession of her the man had replied that she would go over the water such were the contents of the letter and i eagerly awaited a further communication the next day i called at longs hotel upon a gentleman with whom i was upon intimate terms after remaining a short time with him i was leaving the hotel when i was attracted by some trunks in the entrance hall i started when i read the address ofa de benyon esq to be left at ft hotel dublin i asked the waiter who was by whether mr de benyon had left the hotel he replied that he had left it in his own carriage that morning and having more luggage than he could take with him had desired these trunks to be forwarded by the coach i had by that time resumed my serenity i took out a memorandumbook wrote down the address on the trunks saying that i was sorry not to have seen mr de benyon and that i would write to him but if i composed myself before the waiter how did my heart throb as i hastily passed through bond street to my home i had made up my mind upon what very slight grounds the reader must be aware that this mr de benyon either must be my father or if not was able to tell me who was had not mr masterton said that there was a cluehad he not written to dublin the case was to my excited imagination as clear as the noonday and before i arrived at home i had made up my mind in what manner i should proceed it was then about four oclock i hastily packed up my portmanteautook with me all my ready money about sixty pounds and sent the servant to secure a place in the mail to holyhead he returned stating that there was a seat taken for me i waited till halfpast five to see harcourt but he did not come home i then wrote him a short note telling him where i was going and promising to write as soon as i arrived ireland is to be the ground of my future adventures my dear harcourt call upon mr masterton and tell him what i have done which he surely will approve open timothys letters and let me have their contents i leave you to arrange and act for me in every respect until i return in the meantime believe me ever yours j newland i gave the letter to the valet and calling a coach drove to the office and in less than five minutes afterwards was rolling away to holyhead felicitating myself upon my promptitude and decision little imagining to what the step i had taken was to lead it was a very dark night in november when i started on my expedition there were three other passengers in the mail none of whom had yet spoken a word although we had made several miles of our journey muffled up in my cloak i indulged in my own reveries as usual building up castles which toppled over one after another as i built and rebuilt again at last one of the passengers blew his nose as if to give warning that he was about to speak and then inquired of the gentleman next him if he had seen the evening newspapers the other replied in the negative it would appear that ireland is not in a very quiet state sir observed the first did you ever read the history of ireland inquired the other not very particularly then sir if you were to take that trouble you will find that ireland since it was first peopled never has been in a quiet state nor perhaps ever will it is a species of human volcanoalways either smoking burning or breaking out into eruptions and fire very true sir replied the other i am told the white boys are mustering in large numbers and that some of the districts are quite impassable sir if you had travelled much in ireland you would have found out that many of the districts are quite impassable without the impediment of the white boys you have been a great deal in ireland then sir replied the other yes sir said the other with a consequential air i believe i may venture to say that i am in charge of some of the most considerable properties in ireland lawyeragentfive per centand so on muttered the third party who sate by me and had not yet spoken there was no mistaking himit was my former master mr cophagus and i cannot say that i was very well pleased at this intimation of his presence as i took it for granted that he would recognise me as soon as it was daylight the conversation continued without any remarks being made upon this interruption on the part of mr cophagus the agent it appeared had been called to london on business and was returning the other was a professor of music bound to dublin on speculation what called mr cophagus in that direction i could not comprehend but i thought i would try and find out i therefore while the two others were engaged in conversation addressed him in a low tone of voice can you tell me sir if the college at dublin is considered good for the instruction of surgical pupils country good at all events plenty of practicebroken headsand so on have you ever been in ireland sir irelandneverdont wish to gomust goold women will dieexecutorbotherationand so on i hope she has left you a good legacy sir replied i legacyhumphcant tellsilver teapotsuit of black and so on long journeywont paycant be helpedold women always troublesome alive or deadbury her come backand so on chapter xl i deny my master although mr cophagus was very communicative in his own way he had no curiosity with regard to others and the conversation dropped the other two had also asked all the questions which they wished and we all as if by one agreement fell back in our seats and shut our eyes to court sleep i was the only one who wooed it in vain day broke my companions were all in repose and i discontinued my reveries and examined their physiognomies mr cophagus was the first to whom i directed my attention he was much the same in face as when i had left him but considerably thinner in person his head was covered with a white nightcap and he snored with emphasis the professor of music was a very small man with mustachios his mouth was wide open and one would have thought that he was in the full execution of a bravura the third person who had stated himself to be an agent was a heavy fullfaced coarselooking personage with his hat over his eyes and his head bent down on his chest and i observed that he had a small packet in one of his hands with his forefinger twisted through the string i should not have taken further notice had not the name of t iving in the corner of the side on which was the direction attracted my attention it was the name of melchiors london correspondent who had attempted to bribe timothy this induced me to look down and read the direction of the packet and i clearly deciphered sir henry de clare bart mount castle connemara i took out my tablets and wrote down the address i certainly had no reason for so doing except that nothing should he neglected as there was no saying what might turn out i had hardly replaced my tablets when the party awoke made a sort of snatch at the packet as if recollecting it and wishing to ascertain if it were safe looked at it took off his hat let down the window and then looked round upon the other parties fine morning sir said he to me perceiving that i was the only person awake very replied i very fine but i had rather be walking over the mountains of connemara than be shut up in this close and confined conveyance hah you know connemara then im going there perhaps you are also bound to that part of the country but you are not irish i was not born or bred in ireland certainly replied i so i should say irish blood in your veins i presume i believe such to be the case replied i with a smile implying certainty do you know sir henry de clare sir henry de clareof mount castleis he not the same i am going over to him i am agent for his estates among others a very remarkable man have you ever seen his wife i really cannot tell replied i let me call to mind i had somehow or another formed an idea that sir henry de clare and melchior might be one and the same person nothing was too absurd or improbable for my imagination and i had now means of bringing home my suspicions i think continued i i recollect herthat is she is a very tall handsome woman dark eyes and complexion the very same replied he my heart bounded at the information it certainly was not any clue to my own parentage but it was an object of my solicitude and connected with the welfare of fleta if i recollect right observed i there are some curious passages in the life of sir henry nothing very particular observed the agent looking out of the window i thought that he had disappeared for some time disappeared he certainly did not live in ireland because he had quarrelled with his brother he lived in england until his brothers death how did his brother die sir killed by a fall when hunting replied the agent he was attempting to clear a stone wall the horse fell back on him and dislocated his spine i was on the spot when the accident happened i recollected the imperfect communication of fleta who had heard the gipsy say that he was dead and also the word horse made use of and i now felt convinced that i had found out melchior sir henry if i recollect right has no family observed i no and i am afraid there is but little chance had the late baronet his elder brother any family what sir william no or sir henry would not have come into the title he might have had daughters replied i very true now i think of it there was a girl who died when young is the widow of sir william alive yes and a very fine woman she is but she has left ireland since her husbands death i did not venture to ask any more questions our conversation had roused mr cophagus and the other passenger and as i had reflected how i should behave in case of recognition i wished to be prepared for him you have had a good nap sir said i turning to him napyescoach nap badhead soreand so on whybless mejaphetjaphet newyesit is do you speak to me sir inquired i with a quiet air speak to youyesbad memoryhip quite forgotold mastershop in smithfieldmad bulland so on really sir replied i i am afraid you mistake me for some other person mr cophagus looked very hard at me and perceiving that there was no alteration in my countenance exclaimed very oddsame nosesame facesame age toovery oddlike as two pillsbeg pardonmade a mistakeand so on satisfied with the discomfiture of mr cophagus i turned round when i perceived the irish agent with whom i had been in conversation eyeing me most attentively as i said before he was a hardfeatured man and his small grey eye was now fixed upon me as if it would have pierced me through i felt confused for a moment as the scrutiny was unexpected from that quarter but a few moments reflection told me that if sir henry de clare and melchior were the same person and this man his agent in all probability he had not been sent to england for nothing that if he was in search of fleta he must have heard of my name and perhaps something of my history i appear to have a great likeness to many people observed i to the agent smiling it was but the other day i was stopped in bond street as a mr rawlinson not a very common face either sir observed the agent if once seen not easily forgotten nor easily mistaken for another still such appears to be the case replied i carelessly we now stopped to take refreshment i had risen from the table and was going into the passage when i perceived the agent looking over the waybill with the guard as soon as he perceived me he walked out in front of the inn before the guard had put up the bill i requested to look at it wishing to ascertain if i had been booked in my own name it was so the four names were newland cophagus baltzi mdermott i was much annoyed at this circumstance mdermott was of course the name of the agent and that was all the information i received in return for my own exposure which i now considered certain i determined however to put a good face on the matter and when we returned to the coach again entered into conversation with mr mdermott but i found him particularly guarded in his replies whenever i spoke about sir henry or his family and i could not obtain any further information mr cophagus could not keep his eyes off mehe peered into my facethen he would fall back in the coach oddvery oddmust benosays notum in about another half hour he would repeat his examination and mutter to himself at last as if tormented with his doubts he exclaimed beg pardonbutyou have a name yes replied i i have a name well thennot ashamed what is it my name sir replied i is newland for i had resolved to acknowledge to my name and fall back upon a new line of defence thought sodont know medont recollect shopmr brookesstimrudimentsand so on i have not the least objection to tell you my name but i am afraid you have the advantage in your recollection of me where may i have had the honour of meeting you meetingwhat quite forgotsmithfield and pray sir where may smithfield be very oddcant comprehendsame name same facedont recollect me dont recollect smithfield it may be very odd sir but as i am very well known in london at the west end perhaps we have met there lord windermears perhapslady maelstromsand i continued mentioning about a dozen of the most fashionable names at all events you appear to have the advantage of me but i trust you will excuse my want of memory as my acquaintance is very extensive i seequite a mistakesame name not same personbeg pardon sirapologiesand so on replied the apothecary drawing in a long sigh chapter xli i turn lawyer i watched the countenance of the agent who appeared at last to be satisfied that there had been some mistake at least he became more communicative and as i no longer put any questions to him relative to sir henry we had a long conversation i spoke to him about the de benyons making every inquiry that i could think of he informed me that the deceased earl the father of the present had many sons who were some of them married and that the family was extensive he appeared to know them all the professions which they had been brought up to and their careers in life i treasured up his information and as soon as i had an opportunity wrote down all which he had told me on our arrival at holyhead the weather was very boisterous and the packet was to depart immediately mr mdermott stated his intentions to go over but mr cophagus and the professor declined and anxious as i was to proceed i did not wish to be any longer in company with the agent and therefore also declined going on board mr mdermott called for a glass of brandy and water drank it off in haste and then followed by the porter with his luggage went down to embark as soon as he was gone i burst into a fit of laughter well mr cophagus acknowledge that it is possible to persuade a man out of his senses you knew me and you were perfectly right in asserting that i was japhet yet did i persuade you at last that you were mistaken but i will explain to you why i did so all right said the apothecary taking my proffered hand thought sono mistakehandsome fellowso you arejaphet newlandmy apprenticeand so on yes sir replied i laughing i am japhet newland i turned round hearing a noise the door had been opened and mr mdermott had just stepped in he had returned for an umbrella which he had forgotten he looked at me at mr cophagus who still held my hand in his turned short round said nothing and walked out this is unfortunate observed i my reason for not avowing myself was to deceive that very person and now i have made the avowal to his face however it cannot be helped i sat down with my old master and as i knew that i could confide in him gave him an outline of my life and stated my present intentions i see japhet i seedone mischiefsorry for itcant be helpddo all i canumwhats to be donebe your friendalways like youhelp all i canand so on but what would you advise sir advicebad as physicnobody takes itirelandwild placeno lawbetter go backleave all to mefind outand so on this advice i certainly could not consent to follow we argued the matter over for some time and then it was agreed that we should proceed together i was informed by mr cophagus that he had retired with a very handsome fortune and was living in the country about ten miles from the metropolis that he had been summoned to attend the funeral of a maiden aunt in dublin who had left him executor and residuary legatee but that he knew nothing of her circumstances he was still a bachelor and amused himself in giving advice and medicines gratis to the poor people of the village in which he resided there being no resident practitioner within some distance he liked the country very much but there was one objection to itthe cattle he had not forgotten the mad bull at a very late hour we retired to our beds the next morning the weather had moderated and on the arrival of the mail we embarked and had a very good passage over on my arrival at dublin i directed my steps to the ft hotel as the best place to make inquiries relative to mr de benyon mr cophagus also put up at the same hotel and we agreed to share a sittingroom waiter said i do you know a mr de benyon yes sir replied he there is one of the de benyons at the hotel at this moment is he a married man yeswith a large family what is his christian name i really cannot tell sir but ill find out for you by tomorrow morning when does he leave tomorrow i believe do you know where he goes yes sir to his own seat the waiter left the room wont do japhet said cophagus large familydont want morehard times and so on no replied i it does not exactly answer but i may from him obtain further intelligence wont do japhettry another waylarge familywant all uncles moneyumnever tellgood night this remark of mr cophagus gave me an idea upon which i proceeded the next morning i sent in my card requesting the honour of speaking to mr de benyon stating that i had come over to ireland on business of importance but that as i must be back if possible by term time it would perhaps save much expense and trouble the waiter took in the message back by term timeit must be some legal gentleman show him up said mr de benyon i walked in with a businesslike air mr de benyon i believe yes sir will you do me the favour to take a chair i seated myself and drew out my memorandumbook my object mr de benyon in troubling you is to ascertain a few particulars relative to your family which we cannot so easily find out in england there is a property which it is supposed may be claimed by one of the de benyons but which we cannot ascertain until we have a little search into the genealogical tree is the property large inquired mr de benyon not very large replied i but still a very handsome property i am told the reader may surmise that the property referred to was my own pretty self may i ask you a few particulars relative to the present earl and his brothers most certainly sir replied mr de benyon any information i can give you will be at your service the earl has four brothers the eldest maurice is he married yes and has two children the next is william is he married no nor has he ever been he is a general in the army the third is myself henry you are married i believe sir yes with a large family may i request you will proceed sir arthur is the fourth brother he is lately married and has two children sir i feel much obliged to you it is a curious and intricate affair as i am here i may as well ask one question although not of great consequence the earl is married i perceive by the peerage but i do not find that he has any children on the contrary he has twoand prospects of more may i now request the particulars connected with this property the exact particulars sir i cannot well tell you as i am not acquainted with them myself but the property in question i rather think depends upon a name may i venture to ask the names of all your children mr de benyon gave me a list seriatim which i put down with great gravity of course there is no doubt of your second brother not being married i believe we ought to have a certificate do you know his address he has been in the east indies for many years he returned home on furlough and has now just sailed again for calcutta that is unfortunate we must forward a letter through the india board may i also be favoured with your address as in all probability it may be advisable mr de benyon gave me his address i rose promised to give him all the particulars as soon as they were known to me bowed and made my exit to one who was in his sober senses there certainly was not any important information gained but to me it was evident that the mr de benyon who was a general in the army was to be interrogated and i had almost made up my mind to set off for calcutta chapter xlii i affront an irish gentleman and make a handsome apology which is accepted before i had gained my own room i informed mr cophagus who had just returned from a visit to his maiden aunts house of what had passed cant see anything in it japhetwild goose chasewho told youoh pleggits mensad liarsde benyon not name depend upon itall stuff and so on and when i reflected i could but acknowledge that the worthy apothecary might be right and that i was running after shadows but this was only in my occasional fits of despondency i soon rallied and was as sanguine as ever undecided how to proceed and annoyed by what cophagus had said i quitted the hotel to walk out in no very good humour as i went out i perceived the agent mdermott speaking to the people in the bar and the sight of him reminded me of what for a moment i had forgotten which was to ascertain whether melchior and sir henry de clare were one and the same person as i passed a crossing a man in tattered habiliments who was sweeping it asked for alms but being in no very charitable humour i walked on he followed me pestering me so much that i gave him a tap with the cane in my hand saying to him be off you scoundrel oh very well be off is it you mane by the blood of the orourkes but youll answer for that same anyhow i passed on and having perambulated the city of dublin for some time returned to the hotel a few minutes afterwards i was told by the waiter that a mr odonaghan wished to speak to me i have not the honour of his acquaintance replied i but you may show him up mr odonaghan entered a tall thickwhiskered personage in a shabbygenteel dress evidently not made for him a pair of white cotton gloves and a small stick i believe that i have the honour of spaking to the gentleman who crossed over the street about two hours ago upon my word sir replied i that is so uncertain a definition that i can hardly pretend to say whether i am the person you mean indeed from not having the pleasure of any ones acquaintance in dublin i rather think there must be some mistake the devil a bit of a mistake at all at all for theres the little bit of cane with which you paid my friend mr orourke the compliment over his shoulders i really am quite mystified sir and do not understand you will you favour me with an explanation with all the pleasure in life for then we shall come to a right understanding you were crossing the street and a gentleman a particular friend of mine with a broom which he carries for his own amusement did himself the honour to address you whereupon of that same little stick of yours you did him the honour to give him a slight taste what do you mean do you refer to the sweeper who was so importunate when i crossed over the road then by the powers youve just hit it as you did him thats my particular friend thaddeus orourke gentleman gentleman exclaimed i and with as good and as true milesian blood as any in ireland if you think sir that because my friend just for his own amusement thinks proper to put on the worst of his clothes and carry a broom just by way of exercise to prevent his becoming too lusty he is therefore to be struck like a hound its a slight mistake thats all and here sir is his card and you will oblige me by mentioning any friend of yours with whom i may settle all the little points necessary before the meeting of two gentlemen i could hardly refrain from laughing at this irish gentleman and his friend but i thought it advisable to retain my countenance my dear sir replied i it grieves me to the heart that i should have committed such an error in not perceiving the gentility of your friend had i not been so careless i certainly should have requested him to do me the honour to accept a shilling instead of having offered him the insult i hope it is not now too late by the powers im not one of those harumscarum sort who would make up a fight when theres no occasion for it and as your haviour is that of a gentleman i think it will perhaps be better to shake hands upon it and forget it altogether suppose now well consider that it was all a mistake you give the shilling as you intended to do ill swear only you were in so great a hurryand then perhaps youll not object to throw in another shilling for that same tap with the cane just to wipe off the insult as it were as we do our sins when we fork out the money and receive absolution from the padre and then perhaps you will not think it too much if i charge another shilling for my time and trouble for carrying a message between two gentlemen on the contrary mr odonaghan i think all your demands are reasonable here is the money mr odonaghan took the three shillings then sir and many thanks to you ill wish you a good evening and mr orourke shall know from me that you have absolution for the whole and that you have offered every satisfaction which one gentleman could expect from another so saying mr odonaghan put his hat on with a firm cock pulled on his gloves manoeuvred his stick and with a flourishing bow took his departure i had hardly dismissed this gentleman and was laughing to myself at the ridiculous occurrence when mr cophagus returned first putting his cane up to his nose with an arch look and then laying it down on the table and rubbing his hands goodwarm old lady nodead and cold but left some thousandsonly one legacyold tom catphysic him tomorrowsoon die and so on on a more full explanation i found that the old lady had left about nine thousand pounds in the funds and bank securities all of which with the exception of twenty pounds per annum to a favourite cat was left to mr cophagus i congratulated him upon this accession of fortune he stated that the lease of the house and the furniture were still to be disposed of and that afterwards he should have nothing more to do but he wished me very much to assist him in rummaging over the various cabinets belonging to the old lady and which were full of secret drawers that in one cabinet alone he had found upwards of fifty pounds in various gold coins and that if not well examined they would probably be sold with many articles of consequence remaining in them as my only object in ireland was to find out sir henry de clare and identify him but really why i could not have said as it would have proved nothing after all i willingly consented to devote a day to assist mr cophagus in his examination the next morning after breakfast we went together to the house of the old lady whose name had been maitland as mr cophagus informed me her furniture was of the most ancient description and in every room in the house there was an ormolu or japan cabinet some of them were very handsome decorated with pillars and silver ornaments i can hardly recount the variety of articles which in all probability had been amassed during the whole of the old ladys life commencing with her years of childhood and ending with the day of her death there were antique ornaments some of considerable value miniatures fans etuis notes of which the ink from time had turned to a light red packages of letters of her various correspondents in her days of hope and anticipation down to those of solitude and age we looked over some of them but they appeared to both of us to be sacred and they were after a slight examination committed to the flames after we had examined all the apparent receptacles in these cabinets we took them up between us and shook them and in most cases found out that there were secret drawers containing other treasures there was one packet of letters which caught my eye it was from a miss de benyon i seized it immediately and showed the inscription to mr cophagus poohnothing at allher mother was a de benyon have you any objection to my looking at these letters noreadnothing in them i laid them on one side and we proceeded in our search when mr cophagus took up a sealed packet heh whats thisde benyon again japhet look here i took the packet it was sealed and tied with red tape papers belonging to lieutenant william de benyon to be returned to him at my decease alice maitland with great care was written at the bottom of the envelope this is it my dear sir cried i jumping up and embracing mr cophagus these are the papers which i require may i keep them madquite madgo to bedlamstrait waistcoathead shaved and so on chapter xliii i am not content with minding my own business but must have a hand in that of others by which means i put my foot in it he then after his own fashion told me that as executor he must retain those papers pointed out to me the little probability there was of their containing any information relative to my birth even allowing that a person of the name of de benyon did call at the foundling to ask for me which was only a supposition and finally overthrew all the hopes which had been for so many days buoying me up when he had finished i threw myself upon the sofa in despair and wished at the moment that i had never been born still hope again rose uppermost and i would have given all i possessed to have been able to break open the seals of that packet and have read the contents at one moment i was so frantic that i was debating whether i should not take them from mr cophagus by force and run off with them at last i rose and commenced reading the letters which i had put aside but there was nothing in them but the trifling communications of two young women who mentioned what was amusing to them but uninteresting to those who were not acquainted with the parties when we had finished mr cophagus collected all together and putting them into a box we returned in a coach to the hotel the next day mr cophagus had completed all his arrangements and the day following had determined to return to england i walked with him down to the vessel and watched it for an hour after it had sailed for it bore away a packet of papers which i could not help imagining were to discover the secret which i was so eager in pursuit of a nights sleep made me more rational and i now resolved to ascertain where sir henry de clare or melchior as i felt certain he must be was to be found i sent for the waiter and asked him if he could inform me he immediately replied in the affirmative and gave his address mount castle connemara asking me when i intended to set out it did not strike me till afterwards that it was singular that he should be so well acquainted with the address and that he should have produced a card with it written upon it or moreover that he should know that it was my intention to go there i took the address and desired that i might have horses ready very early the next morning i then sat down and wrote a letter to harcourt informing him of my proceedings also one to mr masterton much more explicit lastly to timothy to the care of harcourt requesting him to let me know what had occurred between him and the gipsies after dinner i packed up ready for my journey and having settled my bill i was not sorry to retire to my bed at daylight i was as i requested called by the waiter and taking with me only a very small portmanteau having left the rest of my effects in the charge of the people who kept the hotel i set off in a postchaise on my expedition i was soon clear of the city and on a fine smooth road and as i threw myself back in the corner of the chaise i could not help asking myself the questionwhat was the purport of my journey as the reader will perceive i was wholly governed by impulses and never allowed reason or common sense to stand in the way of my feelings what have i to do replied i to myself to find out if melchior and sir henry de clare be not one and the same person and what then what thenwhy then i may find out something relative to fletas parentage nay but is that likelyif as you suppose melchior is sir henry de clareif as you suppose it is he who is now trying to find out and carry off fletais it probable that you will gain any information from him i have an idea that fleta is the little girl said to have died who was the child of his elder brother why so what interest could melchior have in stealing his own niece that i cannot tell why did nattee give me the necklace i cannot tell she would hardly betray her husband at all events there is a mystery and it can only be unravelled by being pulled at and i may learn something by meeting melchior whereas i shall learn nothing by remaining quiet this last idea satisfied me and for many hours i remained in a train of deep thought only checked by paying for the horses at the end of every stage it was now past twelve oclock when i found that it was necessary to change the chaise at every post the country also as well as the roads had changed much for the worse cultivation was not so great the roads were mountainous and civilisation generally disappeared it was nearly dark when i arrived at the last post from whence i was to take horses to mount castle as usual the chaise also was to be changed and i could not help observing that each change was from bad to worse rope harness was used and the vehicles themselves were of the most crazy condition still i had travelled very fairly for an irish postillion knows how to make an irish horse go a very fair pace i descended from the chaise and ordered another out immediately to this there was no reply except wait your honour step in a moment and rest from your fatigue a little presuming this was merely to give them time to get ready i walked into the room of the inn which indeed was very little better than a hovel and sat down by the turf fire in company with some others whom i could hardly distinguish for smoke i paid the chaise and postillion and soon afterwards heard it drive off on its way back after a few minutes i inquired if the chaise was getting ready is it the chaise your honour means said the landlady yes replied i a chaise on to mount castle then i am sorry that your honour must wait a little for our chaise and the only one which we have is gone to the castle and wont be back till long after the moon is up what will your honour please to take not back till moonlight replied i why did you not say so and i would have gone on with the other is it with the other you mane your honour then if teddy driscoll could make his horses go one step farther than our door may i never have a soul to be saved will your honour please to sit in the little room kathleen shall light a fire vexed as i was with the idea of passing the night in this horrid place there was no help for it so i took up my portmanteau and followed the landlady to a small room if it deserved the appellation which had been built after the cottage and a door broken through the wall into it ceiling there was none it had only leanto rafters with tiles over head i took a seat on the only stool that was in the room and leant my elbow on the table in no very pleasant humour when i heard the girl say and why dont you let him go on to the castle sure the chaise is in the yard and the horses are in the stable theres orders gainst it kathleen replied the landlady mr mdermott was here this blessed day and who can deny him who is he then replied the girl an attorney with a warrant against sir henry and moreover they say that hes coming tostrain upon the cattle of jerry otoole for the tithes hes a bould young chap at all events replied the girl to come here all by himself oh but its not till tomorrow morning and then well have the troops here to assist him and does jerry otoole know of this sure enough he does and i hope therell be no murder committed in my house this blessed night but what can a poor widow do when mdermott holds up his finger now go light the fire kathleen and see if the poor young man wants anything its a burning pity that he shouldnt have something to comfort him before his misfortunes fall upon him kathleen made no reply the horror that i felt at this discourse may easily be imagined that it was intended that i should meet with foul play was certain and i knew very well that in such a desolate part of the country the murder of an individual totally unknown would hardly be noticed that i had been held up to the resentment of the inhabitants as a tithe collector and an attorney with a warrant was quite sufficient i felt conscious to induce them to make away with me how to undeceive them was the difficulty chapter xliv no hopes of rising next morning alive as a last chancei get into bed kathleen came in with fuel to light the fire and looking rather hard at me passed by and was soon busy blowing up the turf she was a very handsome darkeyed girl about nineteen years of age stout and well made what is your name said i kathleen at your service sir listen to me kathleen said i in a low voice you are a woman and all women are kindhearted i have overheard all that passed between your mistress and you and that mdermott has stated that i am a tithe collector and an attorney with a warrant i am no such thing i am a gentleman who wishes to speak to sir henry de clare on a business which he does not like to be spoken to about and to show you what i say is the truth it is about the daughter of his elder brother who was killed when hunting and who is supposed to be dead i am the only evidence to the contrary and therefore he and mdermott have spread this report that i may come to harm is she alive then replied kathleen looking up to me with wonder yes and i will not tell sir henry where she is and that is the reason of their enmity but i saw her body replied the girl in a low voice standing up and coming close to me it was not hers depend upon it replied i hardly knowing what to answer to this assertion at all events it was dressed in her clothes but it was so long before it was discovered that we could make nothing of the features well i knew the poor little thing for my mother nursed her i was myself brought up at the castle and lived there till after sir william was killed then we were all sent away kathleen kathleen cried the landlady call for everything you can think of one after another whispered kathleen leaving the room i cannot make the peat burn said she to the landlady after she had quitted the little room and the gentleman wants some whisky go out then and get some from the middle of the stack kathleen and be quick we have others to attend besides the tithe proctor theres the otooles all come in and your own corny is with them my corny indeed replied kathleen hes not quite so sure of that in a short time kathleen returned and brought some dry peat and a measure of whisky if what you say is true said kathleen and sure enough youre no irish and very young for a tithe proctor who must grow old before he can be such a villain you are in no very pleasant way the otooles are here and ive an idea they mean no good for they sit with all their heads together whispering to each other and all their shillelaghs by their sides tell me kathleen was the daughter of sir william a fairhaired blueeyed girl to be sure she was replied kathleen and like a little mountain fairy now kathleen tell me if you recollect if the little girl or her mother ever wore a necklace of red beads mixed with gold yes that my lady did and it was on the childs neck when it was lost and when the body was found it was not with it well i recollect that for my mother said the child must have been drowned or murdered for the sake of the gold beads then you have proved all i wished kathleen and now i tell you that this little girl is alive and that i can produce the necklace which was lost with her and more that she was taken away by sir henry himself merciful jesus replied kathleen the dear little child that we cried over so much but now kathleen i have told you this to prove to you that i am not what mdermott has asserted no doubt with the intention that my brains shall be knocked out this night and so they will sure enough replied kathleen if you do not escape but how am i to escape and will you assist me and i laid down on the table ten guineas from my purse take that kathleen and it will help you and corny now will you assist me its corny that will be the first to knock your brains out replied kathleen unless i can stop him i must go now and ill see what can be done kathleen would have departed without touching the gold but i caught her by the wrist collected it and put it into her hand thats not like a tithe proctor at all events replied kathleen but my heart aches and my head swims and whats to be done i know not so saying kathleen quitted the room well thought i after she had left the room at all events i have not been on a wrong scent this time kathleen has proved to me that fleta is the daughter of the late sir william and if i escape this snare melchior shall do her justice pleased with my having so identified melchior and fleta i fell into a train of thought and for the first time forgot my perilous situation but i was roused from my meditations by an exclamation from kathleen no no corny nor any of yenot nowand mother and me to witness itit shall not be corny hear me as sure as bloods drawn and we up to see it so sure does corny otoole never touch this hand of mine a pause and whispering followed and again all appeared to be quiet i unstrapped my portmanteau took out my pistols which were loaded reprimed them and remained quiet determined to sell my life as dearly as possible it was more than half an hour before kathleen returned she looked pale and agitated keep quiet and do not think of resistance said she it is useless i have told my mother all and she believes you and will risk her life to save him who has watched over the little girl whom she nursed but keep quiet we shall soon have them all out of the house corny dare not disobey me and he will persuade the others she then went out again and did not return for nearly an hour when she was accompanied by her mother kathleen has told me all young sir said she and do what we can we will but we hardly know what to do to go to the castle would be madness yes replied i but cannot you give me one of your horses to return the way i came that was our intention but i find that the otooles have taken them all out of the stable to prevent me and the house is watched they will come at midnight and attack us that i fully expect and how to conceal you puzzles my poor head if they come we can but persuade them that he has escaped replied kathleen they will no longer watch the house and he will then have some chance there is but one chance replied the mother who took kathleen aside and whispered to her kathleen coloured to the forehead and made no reply if your mother bids you kathleen there can be no harm yes but if corny was he dare not replied the mother and now put this light out and do you get into bed sir with your clothes on they led me to a small bedroom a miserable affair but in that part of the country considered respectable lie down there said the mother and wait till we call you they took the light away and left me to myself and my own reflections which were anything but pleasant i lay awake it might be for two hours when i heard the sound of feet and then a whispering under the window and shortly afterwards a loud knocking at the door which they were attempting to burst open every moment i expected that it would yield to the violence which was made use of when the mother came down halfdressed with a light in her hand hastened to me and desired me to follow her i did so and before she left my room she threw the window wide open she led me up a sort of halfstairs halfladder to a small room where i found kathleen sitting up in her bed and halfdressed o mother mother cried kathleen i bid ye do it child replied the mother desiring me to creep into her daughters bed and cover myself up on the side next the wall let me put on more clothes mother no no if you do they will suspect and will not hesitate to search your mother bids you the poor girl was burning with shame and confusion nay replied i if kathleen does not wish it i will not buy my safety at the expense of her feelings yes yes replied kathleen i dont mind now those words of yours are sufficient come in quick chapter xlv petticoat interest prevails and i escape but i put my head into the lions den there was no time for apology and stepping over kathleen i buried myself under the clothes by her side the mother then hastened downstairs and arrived at the door just as they had succeeded in forcing it open when in pounced a dozen men armed with their faces blackened holy jesus what is it that you want screamed the landlady the blood of the tithe proctor and thats what well have replied the otooles not in my housenot in my house cried she take him away at all events promise me to take him away so we will honey darlint well take him out of your sight and out of your hearing too only show us where he may be hes sleeping replied the mother pointing to the door of the bedroom where i had been lying down the party took the light from her hand and went into the room where they perceived the bed empty and the window open devil a bit of a proctor here anyhow cried one of them and the window open hes offhurrah my lads he cant be far by the powers its just my opinion mrs mshane replied the elder otoole that hes not quite so far off so with your lave or by your lave or without your lave well just have a look over the premises o and welcome mister jerry otoole if you think im the woman to hide a proctor look everywhere just as you please the party headed by jerry otoole who had taken the light out of mrs mshanes hand now ascended the ladder to the upper storey and as i lay by kathleen i felt that she trembled with fear after examining every nook and cranny they could think of they came to mrs mshanes room o go ingo in and look mr otoole its a very likely thing to insinuate that i should have a tithe proctor in my bed search pray and mrs mshane led the way into her own room every part had been examined except the small sleepingroom of kathleen and the party paused before the door we must search observed otoole doggedly search my daughters very well search if you please its a fine story youll have to tell how six great men pulled a poor girl out of her bed to look for a tithe proctor it will be a credit to you anyhow and you corny otoole youll stand well in her good graces when you come to talk about the wedding day and your wife that is to be pulled out of her bed by a dozen men what will ye say to kathleen when you affront her by supposing that a maiden girl has a tithe proctor in bed with her dye think that yell ever have the mothers consent or blessing no one goes into kathleens room cried corny otoole roused by the sarcasms of mrs mshane yes corny replied mrs mshane its not for a woman like me to be suspected at all events so you and you only shall go into the room if that will content ye mr jerry otoole yes replied the party and mrs mshane opened the door kathleen rose up on her elbow holding the bed clothes up to her throat and looking at them as they entered said o corny corny this to me corny never thought of looking for anybody his eyes were rivetted upon his sweetheart murder kathleen is it my fault jerry will have it are you satisfied corny said mrs mshane sure enough i was satisfied before i came in that kathleen would not have any one in her bedroom replied corny then goodnight corny and its tomorrow that ill talk with ye replied kathleen mrs mshane then walked out of the room expecting corny to follow but he could not restrain himself and he came to the bedside fearful that if he put his arms round her he would feel me kathleen raised herself and allowed him to embrace her fortunately the light was not in the room or i should have been discovered as in so doing she threw the clothes off my head and shoulders she then pushed back corny from her and he left the room shutting the door after him the party descended the ladder and as soon as kathleen perceived that they were all down she sprang out of bed and ran into her mothers room soon after i heard them depart mrs mshane made fast the door and came up stairs she first went to her own room where poor kathleen was crying bitterly from shame and excitement i had got up when she came into kathleens room for her clothes and in about five minutes they returned together i was sitting on the side of the bed when they came in the poor girl coloured up when our eyes met kathleen said i you have in all probability saved my life and i cannot express my thanks i am only sorry that your modesty has been put to so severe a trial if corny was to find it out replied kathleen sobbing again how could i do such a thing your mother bid you replied mrs mshane and that is sufficient but what must you think of me sir continued kathleen i think that you have behaved most nobly you have saved an innocent man at the risk of your reputation and the loss of your lover it is not now that i can prove my gratitude yes yes promise me by all thats sacred that youll never mention it surely you would not ruin one who has tried to serve you i promise you that and i hope to perform a great deal more replied i but now mrs mshane what is to be done remain here i cannot no you must leave and that very soon wait about ten minutes more and then they will give up their search and go home the road to e the post i had lately come from is the best you can take and you must travel as fast as you can for there is no safety for you here i am convinced that rascal mdermott will not leave me till he has rid himself of me i then took out my purse in which i still had nearly twenty guineas i took ten of them mrs mshane i must leave you in charge of my portmanteau which you may forward byandbye when you hear of my safety if i should not be so fortunate the money is better in your hands than in the hands of those who will murder me kathleen god bless you you are a good girl and corny otoole will be a happy man if he knows your value i then wished kathleen goodbye and she allowed me to kiss her without any resistance but the tears were coursing down her cheeks as i left the room with her mother mrs mshane looked carefully out of the windows holding the light to ascertain if there was anybody near and satisfied with her scrutiny she then opened the door and calling down the saints to protect me shook hands with me and i quitted the house it was a dark cloudy night and when i first went out i was obliged to grope for i could distinguish nothing i walked along with a pistol loaded in each hand and gained as i thought the high road to e but i made a sad mistake and puzzled by the utter darkness and turnings i took on the contrary the road to mount castle as soon as i was clear of the houses and the enclosure there was more light and i could distinguish the road i had proceeded about four or five miles when i heard the sound of horses hoofs and shortly afterwards two men rode by me i inquired if that was the way to e a pause ensued and a whisper alls right replied a deep voice i continued my way glad to find that i had not mistaken it and cogitating as to what must be the purpose of two men being out at such an hour about ten minutes afterwards i thought i again heard the sound of horses feet and it then occurred to me that they must be highwaymen who had returned to rob me i cocked my pistols determined to sell my life as dearly as i could and awaited their coming up with anxiety but they appeared to keep at the same distance as the sound did not increase after half an hour i came to two roads and was undecided which to take i stopped and listenedthe steps of the horses were no longer to be heard i looked round me to ascertain if i could recognise any object so as to decide me but i could not i took the road to the left and proceeded until i arrived at a brook which crossed the road there was no bridge and it was too dark to perceive the stepping stones i had just waded about half way across when i received a blow on the head from behind which staggered me i turned round but before i could see my assailant a second blow laid me senseless in the water chapter xlvi under ground but not yet dead and buriedthe prospect anything but pleasant when my recollection returned i found myself in the dark but where i knew not my head ached and my brain reeled i sat up for a moment to collect my senses but the effort was too painful i fell back and remained in a state of half stupor gradually i recovered and again sat up i perceived that i had been lying on a bed of straw composed of two or three trusses apparently i felt with my extended arms on each side of me but touched nothing i opened my eyes which i had closed again and tried to pierce through the obscurity but in vainall was dark as erebus i then rose on my feet and extending my hands before me walked five or six steps on one side till i was clear of the straw and came to a wall i followed the wall about twenty feet and then touched wood groping about i found it was a door i then made the circuit of the walls and discovered that the other side was built with bins for wine which were empty and i then found myself again at the straw upon which i had been laid it was in a cellar no longer usedbut where again i lay down upon the straw and as it may be imagined my reflections were anything but pleasing was i in the power of mdermott or melchior i felt convinced that i was but my head was too painful for long thought and after half an hours reflection i gave way to a sullen state of halfdreaming halfstupor in which the forms of mdermott kathleen melchior and fleta passed in succession before me how long i remained in this second species of trance i cannot say but i was roused by the light of a candle which flashed in my eyes i started up and beheld melchior in his gipsys dress just as when i had taken leave of him it is to you then that i am indebted for this treatment replied i no not to me replied melchior i do not command here but i knew you when they brought you in insensible and being employed in the castle i have taken upon myself the office of your gaoler that i might if possible serve you i felt i knew this to be false but a moments reflection told me that it was better at present to temporise who then does the castle belong to melchior to sir henry de clare and what can be his object in treating me thus that i can tell you because i am a party concerned you remember the little girl fleta who left the gipsy camp with youshe is now somewhere under your care well i grant it but i was answerable only to you about her very true but i was answerable to sir henry and when i could only say that she was well he was not satisfied for family reasons now make him very anxious that she should return to him and indeed it will be for her advantage as she will in all probability be his heir for he has satisfactorily proved that she is a near relative grant all that melchior but why did not sir henry de clare write to me on the subject and state his wishes and his right to demand his relative and why does he treat me in this way another questionhow is it that he has recognised me to be the party who has charge of the little girl answer me those questions melchior and then i may talk over the matter i will answer the last question first he knew your name from me and it so happened that a friend of his met you in the coach as you were coming to ireland the same person also saw you at the posthouse and gave information sir henry who is a violent man and here has almost regal sway determined to detain you till you surrendered up the child you recollect that you refused to tell his agent the person whose address i gave you where she was to be found and vexed at this he has taken the law into his own hands for which he shall smart one of these days replied i if there is law in this country there is a law in england but very little and none that will harm sir henry in this part of the country no officer would venture within five miles of the castle i can assure you for he knows very well that it would cost him his life and sir henry never quits it from one years end to the other you are in his power and all that he requires is information where the child may be found and an order for her being delivered to him you cannot object to this as he is her nearest relative if you comply i do not doubt but sir henry will make you full amends for this harsh treatment and prove a sincere friend ever afterwards it requires consideration replied i at present i am too much hurt to talk i was afraid so replied melchior that was one reason why i obtained leave to speak to you wait a moment melchior then put the candle down on the ground and went out and turned the key i found on looking round that i was right in my conjectures i was in a cellar which apparently had long been in disuse melchior soon returned followed by an old crone who carried a basket and a can of water she washed the blood off my head put some alve upon the wounds and bound them up she then went away leaving the basket there is something to eat and drink in that basket observed melchior but i think japhet you will agree with me that it will be better to yield to the wishes of sir henry and not remain in this horrid hole very true melchior replied i but allow me to ask you a question or two how came you here where is nattee and how is it that after leaving the camp i find you so reduced in circumstances as to be serving such a man as sir henry de clare a few words will explain that replied he in my early days i was wild and i am to tell you the truth in the power of this man nay i will tell you honestly my life is in his power he ordered me to come and i dare not disobey himand he retains me here and nattee is quite well and with me but not very happy in her present situation but he is a dangerous violent implacable man and i dare not disobey him i advise you as a friend to consent to his wishes that requires some deliberation replied i and i am not one of those who are to be driven my feelings towards sir henry after this treatment are not the most amicable besides how am i to know that fleta is his relative well i can say no more japhet i wish you well out of his hands you have the power to help me if that is the case said i i dare not then you are not the melchior that you used to be replied i we must submit to fate i must not stay longer you will find all that you want in the basket and more candles if you do not like being in the dark i do not think i shall be permitted to come again till tomorrow melchior then went out locked the door after him and i was left to my meditations chapter xlvii a friend in need is a friend in deedthe tables are turned and so is the keythe issue in deep tragedy was it possible that which melchior said was true a little reflection told me that it was all false and that he was himself sir henry de clare i was in his power and what might be the result he might detain me but he dare not murder me dare not my heart sank when i considered where i was and how easy would it be for him to despatch me if so inclined without any one ever being aware of my fate i lighted a whole candle that i might not find myself in the dark when i rose and exhausted in body and mind was soon fast asleep i must have slept many hours for when i awoke i was in darknessthe candle had burnt out i groped for the basket and examined the contents with my hands and found a tinderbox i struck a light and then feeling hungry and weak refreshed myself with the eatables it contained which were excellent as well as the wine i had replaced the remainder when the key again turned in the door and melchior made his appearance how do you feel japhet today today replied i day and night are the same to me that is your own fault replied he have you considered what i proposed to you yesterday yes replied i and i will agree to this let sir henry give me my liberty come over to england prove his relationship to fleta and i will give her up what can he ask for more he will hardly consent to that replied melchior for once in england you will take a warrant out against him no on my honour i will not melchior he will not trust to that then he must judge of others by himself replied i have you no other terms to propose replied melchior none then i will carry your message and give you his answer tomorrow melchior then brought in another basket and took away the former and did not make his appearance till the next day i now had recovered my strength and determined to take some decided measures but how to act i knew not i reflected all night and the next morning that is according to my supposition i attacked the basket whether it was that ennui or weakness occasioned it i cannot tell but either way i drank too much wine and was ready for any daring deed when melchior again the door sir henry will not accept of your terms i thought not said melchior i am sorryvery sorry melchior replied i starting up let us have no more of this duplicity i am not quite so ignorant as you suppose i know who fleta is and who you are indeed replied melchior perhaps you will explain i will you melchior are sir henry de clare you succeeded to your estates by the death of your elder brother from a fall when hunting melchior appeared astonished indeed replied he pray go on you have made a gentleman of me no rather a scoundrel as you please now will you make a lady of fleta yes i will she is your niece melchior started back your agent mdermott who was sent over to find out fletas abode met me in the coach and he has tracked me here and risked my life by telling the people that i was a tithe proctor your information is very important replied melchior you will find some difficulty to prove all you say not the least replied i flushed with anger and with wine i have proof positive i have seen her mother and i can identify the child by the necklace which was on her neck when you stole her necklace cried melchior yes the necklace put into my hands by your own wife when we parted damn her replied melchior do not damn her damn yourself for your villany and its being brought to light have i said enough or shall i tell you more pray tell me more no i will not for i must commit others and that will not do replied i for i felt i had already said too much you have committed yourself at all events replied melchior and now i tell you that untilnever mind and melchior hastened away the door was again locked and i was once more alone i had time to reflect upon my imprudence the countenance of melchior when he left me was that of a demon something told me to prepare for death and i was not wrong the next day melchior came not nor the next my provisions were all gone i had nothing but a little wine and water left the idea struck me that i was to die of starvation was there no means of escape none i had no weapon no tool not even a knife i had expended all my candles at last it occurred to me that although i was in a cellar my voice might be heard and i resolved as a last effort to attempt it i went to the door of the cellar and shouted at the top of my lungs murdermurder i shouted again and again as loud as i could until i was exhausted as it afterwards appeared this plan did prevent my being starved to death for such was melchiors villanous intention about an hour afterwards i repeated my cries of murdermurder and they were heard by the household who stated to melchior that there was some one shouting murder in the vaults below that night and all the next day i repeated my cries occasionally i was now quite exhausted i had been nearly two days without food and my wine and water had all been drunk i sat down with a parched mouth and heated brain waiting till i could sufficiently recover my voice to repeat my cries when i heard footsteps approaching the key was again turned in the door and a light appeared carried by one of two men armed with large sledge hammers it is then all over with me cried i and i never shall find out who is my father come on murderers and do your work do it quickly the two men advanced without speaking a word the foremost who carried the lantern laid it down at his feet and raised his hammer with both hands when the other behind him raised his weaponand the foremost fell dead at his feet chapter xlviii is full of perilous adventures and in which the reader may be assured there is much more than meets the eye silence said a voice that i well knew although his face was completely disguised it was timothy silence japhet again whispered timothy there is yet much danger but i will save you or die take the hammer melchior is waiting outside timothy put the lantern in the bin so as to render it more dark and led me towards the door whispering when he comes in we will secure him melchior soon made his appearance and as he entered the cellar is it all right said he going up to timothy and passing me with one blow i felled him to the ground and he lay insensible that will do replied timothy now we must be off not till he takes my place replied i as i shut the door and locked it now he may learn what it is to starve to death i then followed timothy by a passage which led outside of the castle through which he and his companion had been admitted our horses are close by said timothy for we stipulated upon leaving the country after it was done it was just dark when we were safe out of the castle we mounted our horses and set off with all speed we followed the high road to the post town to which i had been conveyed and i determined to pull up at mrs mshanes for i was so exhausted that i could go no further this was a measure which required precaution and as there was moonlight i turned off the road before i entered the town or village as it ought to have been called so that we dismounted at the back of mrs mshanes house i went to the window of the bedroom where i had lain down and tapped gently again and again and no answer at last kathleen made her appearance can i come in kathleen said i i am almost dead with fatigue and exhaustion yes replied she i will open the backdoor there is no one here tonightit is too early for them i entered followed by timothy and as i stepped over the threshold i fainted as soon as i recovered mrs mshane led me up stairs into her room for security and i was soon able to take the refreshment i so much required i stated what had passed to mrs mshane and kathleen who were much shocked at the account you had better wait till it is late before you go on said mrs mshane it will be more safe it is now nine oclock and the people will all be moving till eleven i will give your horses some corn and when you are five miles from here you may consider yourselves as safe holy saints what an escape the advice was too good not to be followed and i was so exhausted that i was glad that prudence was on the side of repose i lay down on mrs mshanes bed while timothy watched over me i had a short slumber and then was awakened by the good landlady who told me that it was time for us to quit kathleen then came up to me and said i would ask a favour of you sir and i hope you will not refuse it kathleen you may ask anything of me and depend upon it i will not refuse it if i can grant it then sir replied the good girl you know how i overcame my feelings to serve you will you overcome yours for me i cannot bear the idea that anyone bad as he may be of the family who have reared me should perish in so miserable a manner and i cannot bear that any man bad as he is even if i did not feel obliged to him should die so full of guilt and without absolution will you let me have the key that sir henry de clare may be released after you are safe and away i know he does not deserve any kindness from you but it is a horrid death and a horrid thing to die so loaded with crime kathleen replied i i will keep my word with you here is the key take it up tomorrow morning and give it to lady de clare tell her japhet newland sent it i will and god bless you sir goodbye sir said mrs mshane you have no time to lose god bless you sir said kathleen who now put her arms round me and kissed me we mounted our horses and set off we pressed our horses or rather ponies for they were very small till we had gained about six miles when we considered that we were comparatively speaking safe and then drew up to allow them to recover their wind i was very much exhausted myself and hardly spoke one word until we arrived at the next post town when we found everybody in bed we contrived however to knock them up and timothy having seen that our horses were put into the stable we lay down till the next morning upon a bed which happened to be unoccupied sorry as were the accommodations i never slept so soundly and woke quite refreshed the next morning i stated my intention of posting to dublin and asked tim what we should do with the horses they belong to the castle replied he then in gods name let the castle have them for i wish for nothing from that horrid place we stated to the landlord that the horses were to be sent back and that the man who took them would be paid for his trouble and then it occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity of writing to melchior alias sir henry i do not know why but certainly my animosity against him had subsided and i did not think of taking legal measures against him i thought it however right to frighten him i wrote therefore as follows sir henryi send you back your horses with thanks as they have enabled timothy and me to escape from your clutches your reputation and your life now are in my power and i will have ample revenge the fact of your intending murder will be fully proved by my friend timothy who was employed by you in disguise and accompanied your gipsy you cannot escape the sentence of the law prepare yourself then for the worst as it is not my intention that you shall escape the disgraceful punishment due to your crimes yours japhet newland having sealed this and given it to the lad who was to return with the horses we finished our breakfast and took a postchaise on for dublin where we arrived late in the evening during our journey i requested timothy to narrate what had passed and by what fortunate chance he had been able to come so opportunely to my rescue if you recollect japhet replied timothy you had received one or two letters from me relative to the movements of the gipsy and stating his intention to carry off the little girl from the boardingschool my last letter in which i had informed you that he had succeeded in gaining an entrance into the ladies school at brentford could not have reached you as i found by your note that you had set off the same evening the gipsy whom i only knew by the name of will inquired of me the name by which the little girl was known and my answer was smith as i took it for granted that in a large seminary there must be one if not more of that name acting upon this he made inquiries of the maidservant to whom he paid his addresses and made very handsome presents if there was a miss smith in the school she replied that there were two one a young lady of sixteen and the other about twelve years old of course the one selected was the younger will had seen me in my livery and his plan was to obtain a similar one hire a chariot and go down to brentford with a request that miss smith might be sent up with him immediately as you were so ill that you were not expected to live but previous to his taking this step he wrote to melchior requesting his orders as to how he was to proceed when he had obtained the child the answer from melchior arrived by this time he had discovered that you were in ireland and intended to visit him perhaps he had you in confinement for i do not know how long you were there but the answer desired will to come over immediately as there would be in all probability work for him that would be well paid for he had now become so intimate with me that he disguised nothing he showed me the letter and i asked him what it meant he replied that there was somebody to put out of the way that was clear it immediately struck me that you must be the person if such was the case and i volunteered to go with him to which after some difficulty he consented we travelled outside the mail and in four days we arrived at the castle will went up to melchior who told him what it was that he required will consented and then stated he had another hand with him which might be necessary vouching for my doing anything that was required melchior sent for me and i certainly was afraid that he would discover me but my disguise was too good i had prepared for it still further by wearing a wig of light hair he asked me some questions and i replied in a surly dogged tone which satisfied him the reward was two hundred pounds to be shared between us and as it was considered advisable that we should not be seen after the affair was over by the people about the place we had the horses provided for us the rest you well know i was willing to make sure that it was you before i struck the scoundrel and the first glimpse from the lantern and your voice convinced me thank god japhet but i have been of some use to you at all events my dear tim you have indeed and you know me too well to think i shall ever forget it but now i must first ascertain where the will of the late sir william is to be found we can read it for a shilling and then i may discover what are the grounds of melchiors conduct for to me it is still inexplicable are wills made in ireland registered here or at doctors commons in london in dublin i should imagine but on my arrival at dublin i felt so ill that i was obliged to retire to bed and before morning i was in a violent fever medical assistance was sent for and i was nursed by timothy with the greatest care but it was ten days before i could quit my bed for the first time i was sitting in an easy chair by the fire when timothy came in with the little portmanteau i had left in the care of mrs mshane open it timothy said i and see if there be anything in the way of a note from them timothy opened the portmanteau and produced one which was lying on the top it was from kathleen and as follows dear sirthey say there is terrible work at the castle and that sir henry has blown out his brains or cut his throat i dont know which mr mdermott passed in a great hurry but said nothing to anybody here i will send you word of what has taken place as soon as i can the morning after you went away i walked up to the castle and gave the key to the lady who appeared in a great fright at sir henry not having been seen for so long a while they wished to detain me after they had found him in the cellar with the dead man but after two hours i was desired to go away and hold my tongue it was after the horses went back that sir henry is said to have destroyed himself i went up to the castle but mdermott had given orders for no one to be let in on any account yours kathleen mshane this is news indeed said i handing the letter to timothy it must have been my threatening letter which has driven him to this mad act very likely replied timothy but it was the best thing the scoundrel could do after all the letter was not however written with that intention i wished to frighten him and have justice done to little fletapoor child how glad i shall be to see her chapter xlix another investigation relative to a child which in the same way as the former one ends by the lady going off in a fit the next day the newspapers contained a paragraph in which sir henry de clare was stated to have committed suicide no reason could be assigned for this rash act was the winding up of the intelligence i also received another letter from kathleen mshane confirming the previous accounts her mother had been sent for to assist in laying out the body there was now no further doubt and as soon as i could venture out i hastened to the proper office where i read the will of the late sir william it was very short merely disposing of his personal property to his wife and a few legacies for as i discovered only a small portion of the estates were entailed with the title and the remainder was not only to the heirs male but the eldest female should there be no male heir with the proviso that should she marry the husband was to take upon himself the name of de clare here then was the mystery explained and why melchior had stolen away his brothers child satisfied with my discovery i determined to leave for england immediately find out the dowager lady de clare and put the whole case into the hands of mr masterton fortunately timothy had money with him sufficient to pay all expenses and take us to london or i should have been obliged to wait for remittances as mine was all expended before i arrived at dublin we arrived safe and i immediately proceeded to my house where i found harcourt who had been in great anxiety about me the next morning i went to my old legal friend to whom i communicated all that had happened well done newland replied he after i had finished ill bet ten to one that you find out your father your life already would not make a bad novel if you continue your hairbreadth adventures in this way it will be quite interesting although satisfied in my own mind that i had discovered fletas parentage and anxious to impart the joyful intelligence i resolved not to see her until everything should be satisfactorily arranged the residence of the dowager lady de clare was soon discovered by mr masterton it was at richmond and thither he and i proceeded we were ushered into the drawingroom and to my delight upon her entrance i perceived that it was the same beautiful person in whose ears i had seen the coral and gold earrings matching the necklace belonging to fleta i considered it better to allow mr masterton to break the subject you are madam the widow of the late sir william de clare the lady bowed you will excuse me madam but i have most important reasons for asking you a few questions which otherwise may appear to be intrusive are you aware of the death of his brother sir henry de clare indeed i was not replied she i seldom look at a paper and i have long ceased to correspond with any one in ireland may i ask you what occasioned his death he fell by his own hands madam lady de clare covered up her face god forgive him said she in a low voice lady de clare upon what terms were your husband and the late sir henry it is important to know not on the very best sir indeed latterly for years they never met or spoke we did not know what had become of him were there any grounds for illwill many sir on the part of the elder brother but none on that of sir henry who was treated with every kindness until he lady de clare stoppeduntil he behaved very ill to him as we afterwards discovered henry de clare had squandered away the small portion left him by his father and had ever after that been liberally supplied by his eldest brother until he had attempted to seduce lady de clare upon which he was dismissed for ever and now madam i must revert to a painful subject you had a daughter by your marriage yes replied the lady with a deep sigh how did you lose her pray do not think i am creating this distress on your part without strong reasons she was playing in the garden and the nurse who thought it rather cold ran in for a minute to get a handkerchief to tie round her neck when the nurse returned the child had disappeared lady de clare put her handkerchief up to her eyes where did you find her afterwards it was not until three weeks afterwards that her body was found in a pond about a quarter of a mile off did the nurse not seek her when she discovered that she was not in the garden she did and immediately ran in that direction it is quite strange that the child could have got so far without the nurse perceiving her how long is it ago it is now nine years and the age of the child at the time about six years old i think newland you may now speak to lady de clare lady de clare have you not a pair of earrings of coral and gold of very remarkable workmanship i have sir replied she with surprise had you not a necklace of the same and if so will you do me the favour to examine this i presented the necklace merciful heaven cried lady de clare it is the very necklaceit was on my poor cecilia when she was drowned and it was not found with the body how came it into your possession sir at one time continued lady de clare weeping i thought that it was possible that the temptation of the necklace which has a great deal of gold in it must as it was not found on her corpse have been an inducement for the gipsies who were in the neighbourhood to drown her but sir william would not believe it rather supposing that in her struggles in the water she must have broken it and that it had thus been detached from her neck is it to return this unfortunate necklace that you have come here no madam not altogether had you two white ponies at the time yes sir was there a mulberry tree in the garden yes sir replied the astonished lady will you do me the favour to describe the appearance of your child as she was at the time that you lost her she wasbut all mothers are partial and perhaps i may also be soa very fair lovely little girl with light hair i presume yes sir but why these questions surely you cannot ask them for nothing continued she hurriedly tell me sir why all these questions mr masterton replied because madam we have some hopes that you have been deceived and that it is possible that your daughter was not drowned lady de clare breathless and her mouth open fixed her eyes upon mr masterton and exclaimed not drowned o my god my head and then she fell back insensible i have been too precipitate said mr masterton going to her assistance but joy does not kill ring for some water japhet chapter l in which if the reader does not sympathise with the parties he had better shut the book in a few minutes lady de clare was sufficiently recovered to hear the outline of our history and as soon as it was over she insisted upon immediately going with us to the school where fleta was domiciled as she could ascertain by several marks known but to a nurse or mother if more evidence was required whether fleta was her child or not to allow her to remain in such a state of anxiety was impossible mr masterton agreed and we posted to where we arrived in the evening now gentlemen leave me but one minute with the child and when i ring the bell you may enter lady de clare was in so nervous and agitated a state that she could not walk into the parlour without assistance we led her to a chair and in a minute fleta was called down perceiving me in the passage she ran to me stop my dear fleta there is a lady in the parlour who wishes to see you a lady japhet yes my dear go in fleta obeyed and in a minute we heard a scream and fleta hastily opened the door quick quick the lady has fallen down we ran in and found lady de clare on the floor and it was some time before she returned to her senses as soon as she did she fell down on her knees holding up her hands as in prayer and then stretched her arms out to fleta my child my longlost child it isit is indeed a flood of tears poured forth on fletas neck relieved her and we then left them together old masterton observing as we took our seats in the back parlour by g japhet you deserve to find your own father in about an hour lady de clare requested to see us fleta rushed into my arms and sobbed while her mother apologised to mr masterton for the delay and excusable neglect towards him mr newland madam is the person to whom you are indebted for your present happiness i will now if you please take my leave and will call upon you tomorrow i will not detain you mr masterton but mr newland will i trust come home with cecilia and me i have much to ask of him i consented and mr masterton went back to town i went to the principal hotel to order a chaise and horses while fleta packed up her wardrobe in half an hour we set off and it was midnight before we arrived at richmond during my journey i narrated to lady de clare every particular of our meeting with fleta we were all glad to go to bed and the kind manner in which lady de clare wished me goodnight with god bless you mr newland brought the tears into my eyes i breakfasted alone the next morning lady de clare and her daughter remaining up stairs it was nearly twelve oclock when they made their appearance both so apparently happy that i could not help thinking when shall i have such pleasurewhen shall i find out who is my father my brow was clouded as the thought entered my mind when lady de clare requested that i would inform her who it was to whom she and her daughter were under such eternal obligations i had then to relate my own eventful history most of which was as new to cecilia as she now must be called as it was to her mother i had just terminated the escape from the castle when mr mastertons carriage drove up to the door as soon as he had bowed to lady de clare he said to me japhet here is a letter directed to you to my care from ireland which i have brought for you it is from kathleen mshane sir replied i and requesting leave i broke the seal it contained another i read kathleens and then hastily opened the other it was from nattee or lady h de clare and ran as follows japhet newlandfleta is the daughter of sir william de clare dearly has my husband paid for his act of folly and wickedness and to which you must know i never was a party yours nattee the letter from kathleen added more strange information lady de clare after the funeral of her husband had sent for the steward made every necessary arrangement discharged the servants and then had herself disappeared no one knew whither but it was reported that somebody very much resembling her had been seen travelling south in company with a gang of gipsies i handed both letters over to lady de clare and mr masterton poor lady de clare observed the mother nattee will never leave her tribe observed cecilia quietly you are right my dear replied i she will be happier with her tribe where she commands as a queen than ever she was at the castle mr masterton then entered into a detail with lady de clare as to what steps ought immediately to be taken as the heirsatlaw would otherwise give some trouble and having obtained her acquiescence it was time to withdraw mr newland i trust you will consider us as your warmest friends i am so much in your debt that i never can repay you but i am also in your debt in a pecuniary waythat at least you must permit me to refund when i require it lady de clare i will accept it do not pray vex me by the proposition i have not much happiness as it is although i am rejoiced at yours and that of your daughter come lady de clare i must not allow you to tease my protege you do not know how sensitive he is we will now take our leave you will come soon said cecilia looking anxiously at me you have your mother cecilia replied i what can you wish for more i am anobodywithout a parent cecilia burst into tears i embraced her and mr masterton and i left the room chapter li i return to the gay world but am not well received i am quite disgusted with it and honesty and everything else how strange now that i had succeeded in the next dearest object of my wishes after ascertaining my own parentage that i should have felt so miserable but it was the fact and i cannot deny it i could hardly answer mr masterton during our journey to town and when i threw myself on the sofa in my own room i felt as if i was desolate and deserted i did not repine at cecilias happiness so far from it i would have sacrificed my life for her but she was a creature of my ownone of the objects in this world to which i was endearedone that had been dependent on me and loved me now that she was restored to her parent she rose above me and i was left still more desolate i do not know that i ever passed a week of such misery as the one which followed a denouement productive of so much happiness to others and which had been sought with so much eagerness and at so much risk by myself it was no feeling of envy god knows but it appeared to me as if everyone in the world was to be made happy except myself but i had more to bear up against when i had quitted for ireland it was still supposed that i was a young man of large fortunethe truth had not been told i had acceded to mr mastertons suggestions that i was no longer to appear under false colours and had requested harcourt to whom i made known my real condition that he would everywhere state the truth news like this flies like wildfire there were too many whom perhaps when under the patronage of major carbonnell and the universal rapture from my supposed wealth i had treated with hauteur glad to receive the intelligence and spread it far and wide my imposition as they pleased to term it was the theme of every party and many were the indignant remarks of the dowagers who had so often indirectly proposed to me their daughters and if there was anyone more virulent than the rest i hardly need say that it was lady maelstrom who nearly killed her job horses in driving about from one acquaintance to another to represent my unheardof atrocity in presuming to deceive my betters harcourt who had agreed to live with meharcourt who had praised my magnanimity in making the disclosureeven harcourt fell off and about a fortnight after i had arrived in town told me that not finding the lodgings so convenient as his former abode he intended to return to it he took a friendly leave but i perceived that if we happened to meet in the streets he often contrived to be looking another way and at last a slight recognition was all that i received satisfied that it was intended i no longer noticed him he followed but the example of others so great was the outcry raised by those who had hoped to have secured me as a good match that any young man of fashion who was seen with me had by many his name erased from their visiting lists this decided my fate and i was alone for some time i bore up proudly i returned a glance of defiance but this could not last the treatment of others received a slight check from the kindness of lord windermear who repeatedly asked me to his table but i perceived that even there although suffered as a proteg of his lordship anything more than common civility was studiously avoided in order that no intimacy might result mr masterton upon whom i occasionally called saw that i was unwell and unhappy he encouraged me but alas a man must be more than mortal who with fine feelings can endure the scorn of the world timothy poor fellow who witnessed more of my unhappy state of mind than anybody else offered in vain his consolation and this thought i is the reward of virtue and honesty truly virtue is its own reward for it obtains no other as long as i was under false colours allowing the world to deceive themselves i was courted and flattered now that i have thrown off the mask and put on the raiment of truth i am a despised miserable being yes but is not this my own fault did i not by my own deception bring all this upon myself whether unmasked by others or by myself is it not equally true that i have been playing false and am now punished for it what do the world care for your having returned to truth you have offended by deceiving them and that is an offence which your repentance will not extenuate it was but too true i had brought it all on myself and this reflection increased my misery for my dishonesty i had been justly and severely punished whether i was ever to be rewarded for my subsequent honesty still remained to be proved but i knew very well that most people would have written off such a reward as a bad debt once i consulted with mr masterton as to the chance of there being any information relative to my birth in the packet left in the charge of mr cophagus i have been thinking over it my dear newland said he and i wish i could give you any hopes but i cannot having succeeded with regard to your little protege you are now so sanguine with respect to yourself that a trifle light as air is magnified as the poet says into confirmation strong as holy writ now consider somebody calls at the foundling to ask after youwhich i acknowledge to be a satisfactory pointhis name is taken down by an illiterate brute as derbennon but how you can decide upon the real name and assume it is de benyon is really more than i can imagine allowing every scope to fancy it is in the first instance therefore you are at fault as there are many other names which may have been given by the party who called nay more is it at all certain that the party in a case like this would give his real name let us follow it up allowing the name to have been de benyon you discover that one brother is not married and that there are some papers belonging to him in the possession of an old woman who dies and upon these slight grounds what would you attempt to establish that because that person was known not to have married therefore he was married for you are stated to have been born in wedlock and because there is a packet of papers belonging to him in the possession of another party that this packet of papers must refer to you do you not perceive how you are led away by your excited feelings on the subject i could not deny that mr mastertons arguments had demolished the whole fabric which i had built up you are right sir replied i mournfully i wish i were dead never speak in that way mr newland before me replied the old lawyer in an angry tone without you wish to forfeit my good opinion i beg your pardon sir but i am most miserable i am avoided by all who know methrown out of all societyi have not a parent or a relative isolated being as i am what have i to live for my dear fellow you are not twentythree years of age replied mr masterton and you have made two sincere friends both powerful in their own way i mean lord windermear and myself and you have had the pleasure of making others happy believe me that is much to have accomplished at so early an age you have much to live forlive to gain more friendslive to gain reputationlive to do goodto be grateful for the benefits you have received and to be humble when chastened by providence you have yet to learn where and only where true happiness is to be found since you are so much out of spirits go down to lady de clares see her happiness and that of her little girl and then when you reflect that it was your own work you will hardly say that you have lived in vain i was too much overpowered to speak after a pause mr masterton continued when did you see them last i have never seen them sir since i was with you at their meeting what have you not callednow nearly two months japhet you are wrong they will be hurt at your neglect and want of kindness have you written or heard from them i have received one or two pressing invitations sir but i have not been in a state of mind to avail myself of their politeness politeness you are wrongall wrong japhet your mind is cankered or you never would have used that term i thought you were composed of better materials but it appears that although you can sail with a fair wind you cannot buffet against an adverse gale because you are no longer fooled and flattered by the interested and the designing like many others you have quarrelled with the world is it not so perhaps you are right sir i know that i am right and that you are wrong now i shall be seriously displeased if you do not go down and see lady de clare and her daughter as soon as you can i will obey your orders sir my wishes japhet not my orders let me see you when you return you must no longer be idle consider that you are about to recommence your career in life that hitherto you have pursued the wrong path from which you have nobly returned you must prepare for exertions and learn to trust to god and a good conscience lord windermear and i had a long conversation relative to you yesterday evening and when you come back i will detail to you what are our views respecting your future advantage chapter lii a new character appears but not a very amiable one but i attach myself to him as drowning men catch at straws i took my leave more composed in mind and the next day i went down to lady de clares i was kindly received more than kindly i was affectionately and parentally received by the mother and by cecilia as a dear brother but they perceived my melancholy and when they had upbraided me for my long neglect they inquired the cause as i had already made lady de clare acquainted with my previous history i had no secrets in fact it was a consolation to confide my griefs to them lord windermear was too much above memr masterton was too matteroffacttimothy was too inferiorand they were all men but the kind soothing of a woman was peculiarly grateful and after a sojourn of three days i took my leave with my mind much less depressed than when i arrived on my return i called upon mr masterton who stated to me that lord windermear was anxious to serve me and that he would exert his interest in any way which might be most congenial to my feelings that he would procure me a commission in the army or a writership to india or if i preferred it i might study the law under the auspices of mr masterton if none of these propositions suited me i might state what would be preferred and that as far as his interest and pecuniary assistance could avail i might depend upon it so now japhet you may go home and reflect seriously upon these offers and when you have made up your mind what course you will steer you have only to let me know i returned my thanks to mr masterton and begged that he would convey my grateful acknowledgments to his lordship as i walked home i met a captain atkinson a man of very doubtful character whom by the advice of carbonnell i had always kept at a distance he had lost a large fortune by gambling and having been pigeoned had as is usual ended by becoming a rook he was a fashionable welllooking man of good family suffered in society for he had found out that it was necessary to hold his position by main force he was a noted duellist had killed his three or four men and a cut direct from any person was with him sufficient grounds for sending a friend everybody was civil to him because no one wished to quarrel with him my dear mr newland said he offering his hand i am delighted to see you i have heard at the clubs of your misfortune and there were some free remarks made by some i have great pleasure in saying that i put an immediate stop to them by telling them that if they were repeated in my presence i should consider it as a personal quarrel three months before had i met captain atkinson i should have returned his bow with studied politeness and have left him but how changed were my feelings i took his hand and shook it warmly my dear sir replied i i am very much obliged for your kind and considerate conduct there are more who are inclined to calumniate than to defend and always will be in this world mr newland but i have a fellow feeling i recollect how i was received and flattered when i was introduced as a young man of fortune and how i was deserted and neglected when i was cleaned out i know now why they are so civil to me and i value their civility at just as much as it is worth will you accept my armi am going your way i could not refuse but i coloured when i took it for i felt that i was not adding to my reputation by being seen in his company and still i felt that although not adding to my reputation i was less likely to receive insult and that the same cause which induced them to be civil to him would perhaps operate when they found me allied with him be it so thought i i will if possible extort politeness we were strolling down bond street when we met a young man well known in the fashionable circles who had dropped my acquaintance after having been formerly most pressing to obtain it atkinson faced him good morning mr oxberry good morning captain atkinson replied mr oxberry i thought you knew my friend mr newland observed atkinson rather fiercely oh reallyi quitei beg pardon good morning mr newland you have been long absent i did not see you at lady maelstroms last night no replied i carelessly nor will you ever when you next see her ladyship ask her with my compliments whether she has had another fainting fit i shall certainly have great pleasure in carrying your message mr newlandgood morning that fool observed atkinson will now run all over town and you will see the consequence we met one or two others and to them atkinson put the same question i thought you knew my friend mr newland at last just as we arrived at my own house in st jamess street who should we meet but harcourt harcourt immediately perceived me and bowed low as he passed on so that his bow would have served for both but atkinson stopped i must beg your pardon harcourt for detaining you a moment but what are the odds upon the vestris colt for the derby upon my word captain atkinson i was told but i have forgotten your memory appears bad for you have also forgotten your old friend mr newland i beg your pardon mr newland there is no occasion to beg my pardon mr harcourt interrupted i for i tell you plainly that i despise you too much to ever wish to be acquainted with you you will oblige me sir by never presuming to touch your hat or otherwise notice me harcourt coloured and started back such language mr newland is what you deserve ask your own conscience leave us sir and i walked on with captain atkinson you have done well newland observed atkinson he cannot submit to that language for he knows that i have heard it a meeting you will of course have no objection to it will be of immense advantage to you none whatever replied i for if there is any one man who deserves to be punished for his conduct towards me it is harcourt will you come up captain atkinson and if not better engaged take a quiet dinner and a bottle of wine with me our conversation during dinner was desultory but after the first bottle atkinson became communicative and his history not only made me feel better inclined towards him but afforded me another instance as well as carbonnells how often it is that those who would have done well are first plundered and then driven to desperation by the heartlessness of the world the cases however had this difference that carbonnell had always contrived to keep his reputation above water while that of atkinson was gone and never to be reestablished we had just finished our wine when a note was brought from harcourt informing me that he should send a friend the next morning for an explanation of my conduct i handed it over to atkinson my dear sir i am at your service replied he without you have anybody among your acquaintances whom you may prefer thank you replied i captain atkinson it cannot be in better hands that is settled then and now where shall we go wherever you please then i shall try if i can win a little money tonight if you come you need not playyou can look on it will serve to divert your thoughts at all events i felt so anxious to avoid reflection that i immediately accepted his offer and in a few minutes we were in the welllighted room and in front of the rouge et noir table covered with gold and bank notes atkinson did not commence his play immediately but pricked the chances on a card as they ran after half an hour he laid down his stakes and was fortunate i could no longer withstand the temptation and i backed him in less than an hour we both had won considerably that is enough said he to me sweeping up his money we must not try the slippery dame too long i followed his example and shortly afterwards we quitted the house i will walk home with you newland never if you can help it especially if you have been a winner leave a gaming house alone going home i asked atkinson if he would come up he did so and then we examined our winnings i know mine replied he within twenty pounds for i always leave off at a certain point i have three hundred pounds and something more he had won three hundred and twentyfive pounds i had won ninety pounds as we sat over a glass of brandy and water i inquired whether he was always fortunate no of course i am not replied atkinson but on the whole in the course of the year i am a winner of sufficient to support myself is there any rule by which people are guided who play i observed many of those who were seated pricking the chances with great care and then staking their money at intervals rouge et noir i believe to be the fairest of all games replied atkinson but where there is a per centage invariably in favour of the bank although one may win and another lose still the profits must be in favour of the bank if a man were to play all the year round he would lose the national debt in the end as for martingales and all those calculations which you observed them so busy with they are all useless i have tried everything and there is only one chance of success but then you must not be a gambler not a gambler no you must not be carried away by the excitement of the game or you will infallibly lose you must have a strength of mind which few have or you will be soon cleaned out but you say that you win on the whole have you no rule to guide you yes i have strange as the chances are i have been so accustomed to them that i generally put down my stake right when i am once in a run of luck i have a method of my own but what it is i cannot tell only this i know that if i depart from it i always lose my money but that is what you may call good luck or what you pleaseit is not a rule where then are your rules simply these two the first it is not difficult to adhere to i make a rule never to lose but a certain sum if i am unlucky when i commencesay twenty stakes whatever may be the amount of the stake that you play this rule is easily adhered to by not taking more money with you and i am not one of those to whom the croupier or porters will lend money the second rule is the most difficult and decides whether you are a gambler or not i make a rule always to leave off when i have won a certain sumor even before if the chances of my game fluctuate there is the difficulty it appears very foolish not to follow up luck but the fact is fortune is so capricious that if you trust her more than an hour she will desert you this is my mode of play and with me it answers but it does not follow that it would answer with another but it is very late or rather very earlyi wish you a goodnight chapter liii i become principal instead of second in a duel and risk my own and anothers life my own and others happiness and peace of mind because i have been punished as i deserved after captain atkinson had left me i stated to timothy what had passed and do you think you will have to fight a duel sir cried timothy with alarm there is no doubt of it replied i you never will find your father sir if you go on this way said timothy as if to divert my attention from such a purpose not in this world perhaps tim perhaps i may be sent the right road by a bullet and find him in the next do you think your father if dead has gone to heaven i hope so timothy then what chance have you of meeting him if you go out of the world attempting the life of your old friend that is what you call a poser my dear timothy but i cannot help myself this i can safely say that i have no animosity against mr harcourtat least not sufficient to have any wish to take away his life well thats something to be sure but do you know japhet im not quite sure you hit the right road when you set up for a gentleman no timothy no man can be in the right road who deceives i have been all wrong and i am afraid i am going from worse to worse but i cannot moralise i must go to sleep and forget everything if i can the next morning about eleven oclock a mr cotgrave called upon me on the part of harcourt i referred him to captain atkinson and he bowed and quitted the room captain atkinson soon called he had remained at home expecting the message and had made every arrangement with the second he stayed with me the whole day the majors pistols were examined and approved of we dined drank freely and he afterwards proposed that i should accompany him to one of the hells as they are called this i refused as i had some arrangements to make and as soon as he was gone i sent for timothy tim said i if i should be unlucky tomorrow you are my executor and residuary legatee my will was made when in dublin and is in the charge of mr cophagus japhet i hope you will allow me one favour which is to go to the ground with you i had rather be there than remain here in suspense of course my dear fellow if you wish it replied i but i must go to bed as i am to be called at four oclockso lets have no sentimentalising or sermonising goodnight god bless you i was at that time in a state of mind which made me reckless of life or of consequences stung by the treatment which i received mad with the worlds contumely i was desperate true it was as mr masterton said i had not courage to buffet against an adverse gale timothy did not go to bed and at four oclock was at my side i rose dressed myself with the greatest care and was soon joined by captain atkinson we then set off in a hackneycoach to the same spot to which i had but a few months before driven with poor carbonnell his memory and his death came like a cloud over my mind but it was but for a moment i cared little for life harcourt and his second were on the ground a few minutes before us each party saluted politely and the seconds proceeded to business we fired and harcourt fell with a bullet above his knee i went up to him and he extended his hand newland said he i have deserved this i was a coward in the first place to desert you as i didand a coward in the second to fire at a man whom i had injured gentlemen continued he appealing to the seconds recollect i before you acquit mr newland of all blame and desire if any further accident should happen to me that my relations will take no steps whatever against him harcourt was very pale and bleeding fast without any answer i examined the wound and found by the colour of the blood and its gushing that an artery had been divided my professional knowledge saved his life i compressed the artery while i gave directions to the others a handkerchief was tied tight round his thigh above the wounda round stone selected and placed under the handkerchief in the femoral groove and the ramrod of one of the pistols then made use of as a winch until the whole acted as a tourniquet i removed my thumbs found that the hemorrhage was stopped and then directed that he should be taken home on a door and surgical assistance immediately sent for you appear to understand these things sir said mr cotgrave tell me is there any danger he must suffer amputation replied i in a low voice so that harcourt could not hear me pray watch the tourniquet carefully as he is taken home for should it slip it will be fatal i then bowed to mr cotgrave and followed by captain atkinson stepped into the hackneycoach and drove home i will leave you now newland said captain atkinson it is necessary that i talk this matter over so that it is properly explained i thanked captain atkinson for his services and was left alone for i had sent timothy to ascertain if harcourt had arrived safe at his lodgings never did i feel more miserable my anxiety for harcourt was indescribable true he had not treated me well but i thought of his venerable father who pressed my hand so warmly when i left his hospitable roofof his lovely sisters and the kindness and affection which they had shown towards me and our extreme intimacy i thought of the pain which the intelligence would give them and their indignation towards me when their brother first made his appearance at his fathers house mutilated and were he to diegood god i was maddened at the idea i had now undone the little good i had been able to do if i had made fleta and her mother happy had i not plunged another family into misery chapter liv this is a strange world i am cut by a man of no character because he is fearful that i should injure his character timothy returned and brought me consolationthe bleeding had not recommenced and harcourt was in tolerable spirits an eminent surgeon had been sent for go again my dear timothy and as you are intimate with harcourts servant you will be able to find out what they are about timothy departed and was absent about an hour during which i lay on the sofa and groaned with anguish when he returned i knew by his face that his intelligence was favourable alls right cried timothy no amputation after all it was only one of the smaller arteries which was severed and they have taken it up i sprang up from the sofa and embraced timothy so happy was i with the intelligence and then i sat down again and cried like a child at last i became more composed i had asked captain atkinson to dine with me and was very glad when he came he confirmed timothys report and i was so overjoyed that i sat late at dinner drinking very freely and when he again proposed that we should go to the rouge et noir table i did not refuseon the contrary flushed with wine i was anxious to go and took all the money that i had with me on our arrival atkinson played but finding that he was not fortunate he very soon left off as i had followed his game i also had lost considerably and he entreated me not to play any morebut i was a gamester it appeared and i would not pay attention to him and did not quit the table until i had lost every shilling in my pocket i left the house in no very good humour and atkinson who had waited for me accompanied me home newland said he i dont know what you may think of meyou may have heard that im a roue c c c but this i always do which is caution those who are gamesters from their hearts i have watched you tonight and i tell you that you will be ruined if you continue to frequent that table you have no command over yourself i do not know what your means may be but this i do know that if you were a croesus you would be a beggar i cared nothing for you while you were the mr newland the admired and leader of the fashion but i felt for you when i heard that you were scouted from society merely because it was found out that you were not so rich as you were supposed to be i had a fellowfeeling as i told you i did not make your acquaintance to win your moneyi can win as much as i wish from the scoundrels who keep the tables or from those who would not scruple to plunder others and i now entreat you not to return to that placeand am sorry very sorry that ever i took you there to me the excitement is nothingto you it is overpowering you are a gamester or rather you have it in your disposition take therefore the advice of a friend if i may so call myself and do not go there again i hope you are not seriously inconvenienced by what you have lost tonight not the least replied i it was ready money i thank you for your advice and will follow it i have been a fool tonight and one folly is sufficient atkinson then left me i had lost about two hundred and fifty pounds which included my winnings of the night before i was annoyed at it but i thought of harcourts safety and felt indifferent the reader may recollect that i had three thousand pounds which mr masterton had offered to put out at mortgage for me but until he could find an opportunity by his advice i had bought stock in the three per cents since that he had not succeeded as mortgages in general are for larger sums and it had therefore remained my rents were not yet due and i was obliged to have recourse to this money i therefore went into the city ordered the broker to sell out two hundred pounds intending to replace it as soon as i couldfor i would not have liked that mr masterton should have known that i had lost money by gambling when i returned from the city i found captain atkinson in my apartments waiting for me harcourt is doing well and you are not doing badly i have let all the world know that you intend to call out whoever presumes to treat you with indifference the devil you have but that is a threat which may easier be made than followed up by deeds shoot two or three more replied atkinson coolly and then depend upon it youll have it all your own way as it is i acknowledge there has been some show of resistance and they talk of making a resolution not to meet you on the score of your being an impostor and a very plausible reason too replied i nor do i think i have any righti am sure i have no intention of doing as you propose surely people have a right to choose their acquaintance and to cut me if they think i have done wrong i am afraid captain atkinson you have mistaken me i have punished harcourt for his conduct towards medeserved punishment i had claims on him but i have not upon the hundreds whom when in the zenith of my popularity i myself perhaps was not over courteous to i cannot run the muck which you propose nor do i consider that i shall help my character by so doing i may become notorious but certainly i shall not obtain that species of notoriety which will be of service to me no no i have done too much i may say already and although not so much to blame as the world imagines yet my own conscience tells me that by allowing it to suppose that i was what i was not i have to say the least been a party to the fraud and must take the consequence my situation now is very unpleasant and i ought to retire and if possible reappear with real claims upon the public favour i have still friends thank god and influential friends i am offered a writership in indiaa commission in the armyor to study the law will you favour me with your opinion you pay me a compliment by asking my advice a writership in india is fourteen years transportation returning with plenty to live on but no health to enjoy it in the army you might do well and moreover as an officer in the army none dare refuse to go out with you at the same time under your peculiar circumstances i think if you were in a crack regiment you would in all probability have to fight one half the mess and be put in coventry by the other you must then exchange on halfpay and your commission would be a great help to you as for the lawid sooner see a brother of mine in his coffin there you have my opinion not a very encouraging one at all events replied i laughing but there is much truth in your observations to india i will not go as it will interfere with the great object of my existence and pray if it be no secret may i ask what that is to find out who is my father captain atkinson looked very hard at me i more than once said he have thought you a little cracked but now i perceive you are maddownright mad dont be angry i couldnt help saying so and if you wish me to give you satisfaction i shall most unwillingly be obliged no no atkinson i believe you are not very far wrong and i forgive youbut to proceed the army as you say will give me a position in society from my profession being that of a gentleman but as i do not wish to take the advantage which you have suggested from the position i shrink from putting myself into one which may lead to much mortification as for the law although i do not exactly agree with you in your abhorrence of the profession yet i must say that i do not like the idea i have been rendered unfit for it by my life up to the present but i am permitted to select any other without wishing to pry into your affairs have you sufficient to live upon yes in a moderate way about a younger brothers portion which will just keep me in gloves cigars and eau de cologne then take my advice and be nothing the only difference i can see between a gentleman and anybody else is that one is idle and the other works hard one is a useless and the other a useful member of society such is the absurdity of the opinions of the world yes i agree with you and would prefer being a gentleman in that respect and do nothing if they would admit me in every other but that they will not do i am in an unfortunate position and will be until your feelings become blunted as mine have been replied atkinson had you acquiesced in my proposal you would have done better as it is i can be of no use to you nay without intending an affront i do not know if we ought to be seen together for your decision not to fight your way is rather awkward as i cannot back one with my support who will not do credit to it do not be angry at what i say you are your own master and have a right to decide for yourselfif you think yourself not so wholly lost as to be able eventually to recover yourself by other means i do not blame you as i know it is only from an error in judgment and not from want of courage at present i am i acknowledge lost captain atkinson but if i succeed in finding my father good morning newland good morning replied he hastily i see how it is of course we shall be civil to each other when we meet for i wish you well but we must not be seen together or you may injure my character injure your character captain atkinson yes mr newland injure my character i do not mean to say but that there are characters more respectable but i have a character which suits me and it has the merit of consistency as you are not prepared as the americans say to go the whole hog we will part good friends and if i have said anything to annoy you i beg your pardon goodbye then captain atkinson for the kindness you have shown me i am grateful he shook my hand and walked out of the room and for having thus broken up our acquaintance more grateful still thought i as he went down stairs chapter lv i cut my new acquaintance but his company even in so short a time proves my ruinnotwithstanding i part with all my property i retain my honesty in the meantime the particulars of the duel had found their way into the papers with various comments but none of them very flattering to me and i received a note from mr masterton who deceived by the representations of that class of people who cater for newspapers and who are but too glad to pull if they possibly can every one to their own level strongly animadverted upon my conduct and pointed out the folly of it adding that lord windermear wholly coincided with him in opinion and had desired him to express his displeasure he concluded by observing i consider this to be the most serious false step which you have hitherto made because you have been a party to deceiving the public and because one individual who had no objection to be intimate with a young man of fashion station and affluence does not wish to continue the acquaintance with one of unknown birth and no fortune you consider yourself justified in taking his life upon this principle all society is at an end all distinctions levelled and the rule of the gladiator will only be overthrown by the stiletto of the assassin i was but ill prepared to receive this letter i had been deeply thinking upon the kind offers of lord windermear and had felt that they would interfere with the primum mobile of my existence and i was reflecting by what means i could evade their kind intentions and be at liberty to follow my own inclinations when this note arrived to me it appeared to be the height of injustice i had been arraigned and found guilty upon an ex parte statement i forgot at the time that it was my duty to have immediately proceeded to mr masterton and have fully explained the facts of the case and that by not having so done i left the natural impression that i had no defence to offer i forgot all this still i was myself to blamei only saw that the letter in itself was unkind and unjustand my feelings were those of resentment what right have lord windermear and mr masterton thus to school and to insult me the right of obligations conferred but is not lord windermear under obligations to me have i not preserved his secret yes but how did i obtain possession of it by so doing i was only making reparation for an act of treachery well then at all events i have a right to be independent of them if i pleaseany one has a right to assert his independence if he chooses their offers of service only would shackle me if i accepted of their assistance i will have none of them such were my reflections and the reader must perceive that i was influenced by a state of morbid irritabilitya sense of abandonment which prostrated me i felt that i was an isolated being without a tie in the whole world i determined to spurn the world as it had spurned me to timothy i would hardly speak a word i lay with an aching head aching from increased circulation i was mad or nearly so i opened the case of pistols and thought of suicidereflection alone restrained me i could not abandon the search after my father feverish and impatient i wished to walk out but i dared not meet the public eye i waited till dark and then i sallied forth hardly knowing where i went i passed the gaming housei did pass it but i returned and lost every shilling not however till the fluctuations of the game had persuaded me that had i had more money to carry it on i should have won i went to bed but not to sleep i thought of how i had been caressed and admired when i was supposed to be rich of what use then was the money i possessed little or none i made up my mind that i would either gain a fortune or lose that which i had the next morning i went into the city and sold out all the remaining stock to timothy i had not communicated my intentions i studiously avoided speaking to him he felt hurt at my conduct i perceived but i was afraid of his advice and expostulation at nightfall i returned to the hellplayed with various success at one time was a winner of three times my capital and i ended at last with my pockets being empty i was indifferent when it was all gone although in the highest state of excitement while the chances were turning up the next day i went to a house agent and stated my wish to sell my house for i was resolved to try fortune to the last the agent undertook to find a ready purchaser and i begged an advance which he made and continued to make until he had advanced nearly half the value he then found a purchaser himself as i believe at twothirds of its value i did not hesitate i had lost every advance one after another and was anxious to retrieve my fortune or be a beggar i signed the conveyance and received the balance fifteen hundred and fifty pounds and returned to the apartments no longer mine about an hour before dinner i called timothy and ascertaining the amount of bills due gave him fifty pounds which left him about fifteen pounds as a residue i then sat down to my solitary meal but just as i commenced i heard a dispute in the passage what is that timothy cried i for i was nervous to a degree its that fellow emmanuel sir who says that he will come up yesh i vill go up sar let him come timothy replied i accordingly mr emmanuel ascended well emmanuel what do you want with me said i looking with contempt at the miserable creature who entered as before with his body bent double and his hand lying over his back i vash

i have sold my house you have sold de houseden you have neither de house nor de monish oh my monish my monish sare mr newland you are one dd rascal and the old wretchs frame quivered with emotion his hand behind his back shaking as much as the other which in his rage he shook in my face enraged myself at being called such an opprobrious term i opened the door twisted him round and applying my foot to a nameless part he flew out and fell down the stairs at the turning of which he lay groaning in pain mine got mine got i am murdered cried he fader abraham receive me my rage was appeased and i turned pale at the idea of having killed the poor wretch with the assistance of timothy whom i summoned we dragged the old man upstairs and placed him in a chair and found that he was not very much hurt a glass of wine was given to him and then as soon as he could speak his ruling passion broke out again mishter newlandah mishter newland cannot you give me my monishcannot you give me de tousand

laid it on the table catching up the notes i looked at the paper to see if it was all right and then tore it up emmanuel put the notes with a heavy sigh into his inside coat pocket and prepared to depart now mr emmanuel i will show that i have a little more honour than you think for this is all the money i have in the world said i taking out of my desk the remaining thousand pounds and half of it i give to you to pay you the whole money which you lent me here is five hundred pounds more and now we are quits the eyes of the old man were fixed upon me in astonishment and from my face they glanced upon the notes he could to use a common expression neither believe his eyes nor his ears at last he took the money again unbuttoned and pulled out his pocketbook and with a trembling hand stowed them away as before you vash a very odd gentleman mishter newland said he you kick me down stairs andbut dat is noting goodbye mr emmanuel said i and let me eat my dinner chapter lvi i resolve to begin the world again and to seek my fortune in the next pathi take leave of all my old friends the jew retired and i commenced my meal when the door again slowly opened and mr emmanuel crawled up to me mishter newland i vash beg your pardon but vill you not pay me de interest of de monish i started up from my chair with my rattan in my hand begone you old thief cried i and hardly were the words out of my mouth before mr emmanuel travelled out of the room and i never saw him afterwards i was pleased with myself for having done this act of honesty and for the first time for a long while i ate my dinner with some zest after i had finished i took a twenty pound note and laid it in my desk the remainder of the five hundred pounds i put in my pocket to try my last chance in an hour i quitted the hell penniless when i returned home i had composed myself a little after the dreadful excitement which i had been under i felt a calm and a degree of negative happiness i knew my fatethere was no more suspense i sat down to reflect upon what i should do i was to commence the world againto sink down at once into obscurityinto povertyand i felt happy i had severed the link between myself and my former conditioni was again a beggar but i was independentand i resolved so to be i spoke kindly to timothy went to bed and having arranged in my own mind how i should act i fell sound asleep i never slept better or awoke more refreshed the next morning i packed up my portmanteau taking with me only the most necessary articles all the details of the toilet further than cleanliness was concerned i abjured when timothy came in i told him that i was going down to lady de clares which i intended to do poor timothy was overjoyed at the change in my manner little thinking that he was so soon to lose mefor reader i had made up my mind that i would try my fortunes alone and painful as i felt would be the parting with so valued a friend i was determined that i would no longer have even his assistance or company i was determined to forget all that had passed and commence the world anew i sat down while timothy went out to take a place in the richmond coach and wrote to him the following letter my dear timothydo not think that i undervalue your friendship or shall ever forget your regard for me when i tell you that we shall probably never meet again should fortune favour me i trust we shallbut of that there is little prospect i have lost almost everything my money is all gone my house is sold and all is gambled away i leave you with only my clothes in my portmanteau and twenty pounds for yourself there is the furniture which you must sell as well as every other article left behind it is all yours and i hope you will find means to establish yourself in some way god bless youand believe me always and gratefully yours japhet newland this letter i reserved to put in the post when i quitted richmond my next letter was to mr masterton siryour note i received and i am afraid that unwittingly you have been the occasion of my present condition that i did not deserve the language addressed to me you may satisfy yourself by applying to mr harcourt driven to desperation i have lost all i had in the world by adding gaming to my many follies i now am about to seek my fortune and prosecute my search after my father you will therefore return my most sincere acknowledgments to lord windermear for his kind offers and intentions and assure him that my feelings towards him will always be those of gratitude and respect for yourself accept my warmest thanks for the friendly advice and kind interest which you have shown in my welfare and believe me when i say that my earnest prayers shall be offered up for your happiness if you can in any way assist my poor friend timothy who will i have no doubt call upon you in his distress you will confer an additional favour on yours ever gratefully japhet newland i sealed this letter and when timothy returned i told him that i wished him after my departure to take it to mr mastertons and not wait for an answer i then as i had an hour to spare before the coach started entered into a conversation with timothy i pointed out to him the unfortunate condition in which i found myself and my determination to quit the metropolis timothy agreed with me i have seen you so unhappy of latei may say so miserablethat i have neither eaten nor slept indeed japhet i have laid in bed and wept for my happiness depends upon yours go where you will i am ready to follow and to serve you and as long as i see you comfortable i care for nothing else these words of timothy almost shook my resolution and i was near telling him all but when i recollected i refrained my dear timothy said i in this world we must expect to meet with a chequered existence we may laugh at one time but we must cry at others i owe my life to you and i never shall forget you wherever i may be no replied timothy you are not likely to forget one who is hardly an hour out of your sight very true timothy but circumstances may occur which may separate us i cannot imagine such circumstances nor do i believe that bad as things may turn out that they will ever be so bad as that you have your money and your house if you leave london you will be able to add to your income by letting your own apartments furnished so we never shall want and we may be very happy running about the world seeking what we wish to find my heart smote me when timothy said this for i felt by his devotion and fidelity he had almost the same claim to the property i possessed as myself he had been my partner playing the inferior game for the mutual benefit but the time may come timothy when we may find ourselves without money as we were when we first commenced our career and shared threepence halfpenny each by selling the old woman the embrocation well sir and let it come i should be sorry for you but not for myself for then tim would be of more importance and more useful than as valet with little or nothing to do i mentally exclaimed i have i think i have been a fool a great fool but the die is cast i will sow in sorrow and may i reap a harvest in joy i feel thought i and i did feel i feel a delightful conviction that we shall meet again and all this misery of parting will be but a subject of future garrulity yes tim said i in a loud voice all is right alls right sir i never thought anything was wrong except your annoyance at people not paying you the attention which they used to do when they supposed you a man of fortune very true and tim recollect that if mr masterton speaks to you about me which he may after i am gone to richmond you tell him that before i left i paid that old scoundrel emmanuel every farthing that i had borrowed of him and you know and in fact so does mr masterton how it was borrowed well sir i will if he does talk to me but he seldom says much to me but he may perhaps tim and i wish him to know that i have paid every debt i owe in the world one would think that you were going to the east indies instead of to richmond by the way you talk no tim i was offered a situation in the east indies and i refused it but mr masterton and i have not been on good terms lately and i wish him to know that i am out of debt you know for i told you all that passed between emmanuel and myself how he accepted five hundred pounds and i paid him the thousand and i wish mr masterton should know it too and he will then be better pleased with me never fear sir said tim i can tell the whole story with flourishes no tim nothing but the truth but it is time i should go farewell my dear fellow may god bless you and preserve you and overcome by my feelings i dropped my face on timothys shoulder and wept what is the matter what do you mean japhet mr newlandpray sir what is the matter timothyit is nothing replied i recovering myself but i have been ill nervous lately as you well know and even leaving the last and only friend i have i may say for a few days annoys and overcomes me oh sirdear japhet do let us leave this house and sell your furniture and be off i mean that it shall be so tim god bless you and farewell i went downstairs the hackneycoach was at the door timothy put in my portmanteau and mounted the box i wept bitterly my readers may despise me but they ought not let them be in my situation and feel that they have one sincere faithful friend and then they will know the bitterness of parting i recovered myself before i arrived at the coach and shaking hands with timothy i lost sight of him for how long the reader will find out in the sequel of my adventures i arrived at lady de clares and hardly need say that i was well received they expressed their delight at my so soon coming again and made a hundred inquiriesbut i was unhappy and melancholy not at my prospects for in my infatuation i rejoiced at my anticipated beggarybut i wished to communicate with fleta for so i still call her fleta had known my history for she had been present when i had related it to her mother up to the time that i arrived in london further than that she knew little i was determined that before i quitted she should know all i dared not trust the last part to her when i was present but i resolved that i would do it in writing lady de clare made no difficulty whatever of leaving me with fleta she was now a beautiful creature of between fifteen and sixteen bursting into womanhood and lovely as the bud of the mossrose and she was precocious beyond her years in intellect i stayed there three days and had frequent opportunities of conversing with her i told her that i wished her to be acquainted with my whole life and interrogated her as to what she knew i carefully filled up the chasms until i brought it down to the time at which i placed her in the arms of her mother and now fleta said i you have much more to learnyou will learn that much at my departure i have dedicated hours every night in writing it out and as you will find have analysed my feelings and have pointed out to you where i have been wrong i have done it for my amusement as it may be of service even to a female on the third day i took my leave and requesting the pony chaise of lady de clare to take me over to that i might catch the first coach that went westward for i did not care which i put into fletas hands the packet which i had written containing all that had passed and i bid her farewell lady de clare may you be happy said i fletacecilia i should say may god bless and preserve you and sometimes think of your sincere friend japhet newland really mr newland said lady de clare one would think we were never to see you again i hope that will not be the case lady de clare for i know nobody to whom i am more devoted then sir recollect we are to see you very soon i pressed her ladyships hand and left the house thus did i commence my second pilgrimage chapter lvii my new career is not very prosperous at its commencementi am robbed and accused of being a robberi bind up wounds and am accused of having inflicted themi get into a horsepond and out of it into gaol i had proceeded half a mile from the house when i desired the servant to turn into a crossroad so as to gain brentford and so soon as i arrived the distance being only four miles i ordered him to stop at a publichouse saying that i would wait till the coach should pass by i then gave him halfacrown and ordered him to go home i went into the inn with my portmanteau and was shown into a small back parlour there i remained about half an hour reflecting upon the best plan that i could adopt leaving the ale that i had called for untasted i paid for it and with the portmanteau on my shoulder i walked away until i arrived at an old clothes shop i told the jew who kept it that i required some clothes and also wanted to dispose of my own portmanteau and all my effects i had a great rogue to deal with but after much chaffering for i now felt the value of money i purchased from him two pair of corduroy trousers two waistcoats four common shirts four pairs of stockings a smock frock a pair of highlows and a common hat for these i gave up all my portmanteau with the exception of six silk handkerchiefs and received fifty shillings when i ought to have received at least ten pounds but i could not well help myself and i submitted to the extortion i dressed myself in my more humble garments securing my money in the pocket of my trousers unobserved by the jew made up a bundle of the rest and procured a stick from the jew to carry it on however not without paying him threepence for it he observing that the stick wash not in de bargain thus attired i had the appearance of a countryman well to do and i set off through the long dirty main street of brentford quite undecided and indifferent as to the direction i should take i walked about a mile when i thought that it was better to come to some decision previous to my going farther and perceiving a bench in front of a publichouse i went to it and sat down i looked around and it immediately came to my recollection that i was sitting on the very bench on which timothy and i had stopped to eat our meal of pork at our first outset upon our travels yes it was the very same here sat i and there sat timothy two heedless boys with the paper containing the meat the loaf of bread and the pot of beer between us poor timothy i conjured up his unhappiness when he had received my note acquainting him with our future separation i remembered his fidelity his courage in defence and his preservation of my life in ireland and a tear or two coursed down my cheek i remained some time in a deep reverie during which the various circumstances and adventures of my life were passed in a rapid panorama before me i felt that i had little to plead in my own favour much to condemnthat i had passed a life of fraud and deceit i also could not forget that when i had returned to honesty i had been scouted by the world and here i am thought i once more with the world before me and it is just that i should commence again for i started in a wrong path at least now i can satisfactorily assert that i am deceiving nobody and can deservedly receive no contumely i am japhet newland and not in disguise i felt happy with this reflection and made a determination whatever my future lot might be that at least i would pursue the path of honesty i then began to reflect upon another point which was whither i should bend my steps and what i should do to gain my livelihood alas that was a subject of no little difficulty to me a person who has been brought up to a profession naturally reverts to that professionbut to what had i been brought up as an apothecarytrue but i well knew the difficulty of obtaining employment in what is termed a liberal profession without interest or recommendation neither did i wish for close confinement as the very idea was irksome as a mountebank a juggler a quack doctori spurned the very idea it was a system of fraud and deceit what then could i do i could not dig to beg i was ashamed i must trust to the chapter of accidents and considering how helpless i was such trust was but a broken reed at all events i had a sufficient sum of money upwards of twenty pounds to exist upon with economy for some time i was interrupted by a voice calling out hilloa my lad come and hold this horse a moment i looked up and perceived a person on horseback looking at me do you hear or are you stupid cried the man my first feeling was to knock him down for his impertinence but my bundle lying beside reminded me of my situation and appearance and i rose and walked towards the horse the gentleman for such he was in appearance dismounted and throwing the rein on the horses neck told me to stand by him for half a minute he went into a respectablelooking house opposite the inn and remained nearly half an hour during which i was becoming very impatient and kept an anxious eye upon my bundle which lay on the seat at last he came out and mounting his horse looked in my face with some degree of surprise why what are you said he as he pulled out a sixpence and tendered it to me i was again nearly forgetting myself affronted at the idea of sixpence being offered to me but i recovered myself saying as i took it a poor labouring man sir what with those hands said he looking at them as i took the money and then looking at my face he continued i think we have met before my ladi cannot be sure you know besti am a bow street magistrate in a moment i remembered that he was the very magistrate before whom i had twice made my appearance i coloured deeply and made no reply well my lad im not on my bench now and this sixpence you have earned honestly i trust you will continue in the right path be carefuli have sharp eyes so saying he rode off i never felt more mortified it was evident that he considered me as one who was acting a part for unworthy purposes perhaps one of the swell mob or a flash pickpocket rusticating until some hue and cry was over well well thought i as i took up a lump of dirt and rubbed over my then white hands it is my fate to be believed when i deceive and to be mistrusted when i am acting honestly and i returned to the bench for my bundle whichwas gone i stared with astonishment is it possible thought i how dishonest people are well i will not carry another for the present they might as well have left me my stick so thinking and without any great degree of annoyance at the loss i turned from the bench and walked away i knew not whither it was now getting dark but i quite forgot that it was necessary to look out for a lodging the fact is that i had been completely upset by the observations of the magistrate and the theft of my bundle and in a sort of brown study from which i was occasionally recalled for a moment by stumbling over various obstructions i continued my walk on the pathway until i was two or three miles away from brentford i was within a mile of hounslow when i was roused by the groans of some person and it being now dark i looked round trying to catch by the ear the direction in which to offer my assistance they proceeded from the other side of a hedge and i crawled through where i found a man lying on the ground covered with blood about the head and breathing heavily i untied his neckcloth and as well as i could examined his condition i bound his handkerchief round his head and perceiving that the position in which he was lying was very unfavourable his head and shoulders being much lower than his body i was dragging the body round so as to raise those parts when i heard footsteps and voices shortly after four people burst through the hedge and surrounded me that is him ill swear to it cried an immense stout man seizing me that is the other fellow who attacked me and ran away he has come to get off his accomplice and now weve just nicked them both you are very much mistaken replied i and you have no need to hold me so tight i heard the man groan and i came to his assistance that gammon wont do replied one of them who was a constable youll come along with us and we may as well put on the darbies continued he producing a pair of handcuffs indignant at the insult i suddenly broke from him who held me and darting at the constable knocked him down and then took to my heels across the ploughed field the whole four pursued but i rather gained upon them and was in hopes to make my escape i ran for a gap i perceived in the hedge and sprang over it without minding the old adage of look before you leap for when on the other side i found myself in a deep and stagnant pit of water and mud i sank over head and with difficulty extricated myself from the mud at the bottom and when at the surface i was equally embarrassed with the weeds at the top among which i floundered in the meantime my pursuers warned by the loud splash had paused when they came to the hedge and perceiving my situation were at the brink of the pit watching for my coming out all resistance was useless i was numbed with cold and exhausted by my struggles and when i gained the bank i surrendered at discretion chapter lviii worse and worseif out of gaol it will be to go out of the worldi am resolved to take my secret with me the handcuffs were now put on without resistance on my part and i was led away to hounslow by the two constables while the others returned to secure the wounded man on my arrival i was thrust into the clink or lockup house as the magistrates would not meet that evening and there i was left to my reflections previously however to this i was searched and my money amounting as i before stated to upwards of twenty pounds taken from me by the constables and what i had quite forgotten a diamond solitaire ring which i had intended to have left with my other bijouterie for timothy but in my hurry when i left london i had allowed to remain upon my finger the gaol was a square building with two unglazed windows secured with thick iron bars and the rain having beat in it was more like a pound for cattle for it was not even paved and the ground was three or four inches deep in mud there was no seat in it and there i was the whole of the night walking up and down shivering in my wet clothes in a state of mind almost bordering upon insanity reflect upon what was likely to happen i could not i only ran over the past i remembered what i had been and felt cruelly the situation i then was in had i deserved it i thought not oh fatherfather exclaimed i bitterly see to what your son is broughthandcuffed as a felon god have mercy on my brain for i feel that it is wandering father fatheralas i have nonehad you left me at the asylum without any clue or hopes of a clue to my hereafter being reclaimed it would have been a kindness i should then have been happy and contented in some obscure situation but you raised hopes only to prostrate themand imaginings which have led to my destruction sacred is the duty of a parent and heavy must be the account of those who desert their children and are required by heaven to render up an account of the important trust couldst thou oh father but now behold thy son god almightybut i will not curse you father no noand i burst into tears as i leant against the damp walls of the prison the day at last broke and the sun rose and poured his beaming rays through the barred windows i looked at myself and was shocked at my appearance my smockfrock was covered with black mud my clothes were equally disfigured i had lost my hat when in the water and i felt the dry mud cracking on my cheeks i put my hands up to my head and i pulled a quantity of duckweed out of my matted and tangled hair i thought of the appearance i should make when summoned before the magistrates and how much it would go against me good god thought i who of all the world of fashionwho of all those who once caught my salutation so eagerlywho of all those worldlyminded girls who smiled upon me but one short twelve months since would imagine or believe that japhet newland could ever have sunk so lowand how has he so fallen alas because he would be honest and had strength of mind enough to adhere to his resolution well well gods will be done i care not for life but still an ignominious deathto go out of the world like a dog and that too without finding out who is my father and i put my fettered hands up and pressed my burning brow and remained in a sort of apathetic sullen mood until i was startled by the opening of the door and the appearance of the constables they led me out among a crowd through which with difficulty they could force their way and followed by the majority of the population of hounslow who made their complimentary remarks upon the footpad i was brought before the magistrates the large stout man was then called up to give his evidence and deposed as follows that he was walking to hounslow from brentford whither he had been to purchase some clothes when he was accosted by two fellows in smockfrocks one of whom carried a bundle in his left hand they asked him what oclock it was and he took out his watch to tell them when he received a blow from the one with the bundle this one sir said he pointing to me on the back of his head at the same time the other the wounded man who was now in custody snatched his watchthat at the time he had purchased his clothes at brentford he had also bought a bag of shot fourteen pounds weight which he had for the convenience of carrying tied up with the clothes in the bundle and perceiving that he was about to be robbed he had swung his bundle round his head and with the weight of the shot had knocked down the man who had snatched at his watch he then turned to the other me who backed from him and struck at him with his stick the stick was here produced and when i cast my eye on it i was horrified to perceive that it was the very stick which i had bought of the jew for threepence to carry my bundle on he had closed in with me and was wresting the stick out of my hand when the other man who had recovered his legs again attacked him with another stick in the scuffle he had obtained my stick and i had wrested from him his bundle with which as soon as he had knocked down my partner i ran off that he beat my partner until he was insensible and then found that i had left my own bundle which in the affray i had thrown on one side he then made the best of his way to hounslow to give the information his return and finding me with the other man is already known to the readers the next evidence who came forward was the jew from whom i had bought the clothes and sold my own he narrated all that had occurred and swore to the clothes in the bundle left by the footpad and to the stick which he had sold to me the constable then produced the money found about my person and the diamond solitaire ring stating my attempt to escape when i was seized the magistrate then asked me whether i had anything to say in my defence cautioning me not to commit myself i replied that i was innocent that it was true that i had sold my own clothes and had purchased those of the jew as well as the stick that i had been asked to hold the horse of a gentleman when sitting on a bench opposite a publichouse and that some one had stolen my bundle and my stick that i had walked on towards hounslow and in assisting a fellowcreature whom i certainly had considered as having been attacked by others i had merely yielded to the common feelings of humanitythat i was seized when performing that duty and should willingly have accompanied them to the magistrates had not they attempted to put on handcuffs at which my feelings were roused and i knocked the constable down and made my attempt to escape certainly a very ingenious defence observed one of the magistrates pray where at this moment the door opened and in came the very gentleman the magistrate at bow street whose horse i had held good morning mr norman you have just come in time to render us your assistance we have a very deep hand to deal with here or else a very injured person i cannot tell which do us the favour to look over these informations and the defence of the prisoner previous to our asking him any more questions the bow street magistrate complied and then turned to me but i was so disguised with mud that he could not recognise me you are the gentleman sir who asked me to hold your horse said i i call you to witness that that part of my assertion is true i do now recollect that you are the person replied he and you may recollect the observation i made relative to your hands when you stated that you were a poor countryman i do sir perfectly replied i perhaps then you will inform us by what means a diamond ring and twenty pounds in money came into your possession honestly sir replied i will you state as you are a poor countryman with whom you worked lastwhat parish you belong toand whom you can bring forward in proof of good character i certainly shall not answer those questions replied i if i chose i might so do and satisfactorily what is your name i cannot answer that question either sir replied i i told you yesterday that we had met before was it not at bow street i am surprised at your asking a question sir from the bench to which if i answered the reply might affect me considerably i am here in a false position and cannot well help myself i have no friends that i choose to call for i should blush that they should see me in such a state and under such imputations your relations young man would certainly not be backward who is your father my father exclaimed i raising up my hands and eyes my father merciful godif he could only see me heresee to what he has reduced his unhappy son and i covered my face and sobbed convulsively chapter lix by the committing of magisterial mistakes i am personally and penally committedi prepare for my trial by calling in the assistance of the tailor and the perfumeri am resolved to die like a gentleman it is indeed a pity a great pity observed one of the magistrates such a fine young man and evidently by his demeanour and language well brought up but i believe said he turning to the others we have but one course what say you mr norman i am afraid that my opinion coincides with yours and that the grand jury will not hesitate to find a bill as the case stands at present let us however ask the witness armstrong one question do you positively swear to this young man being one of the persons who attacked you it was not very light at the time sir and both the men had their faces smutted but it was a person just his size and dressed in the ame way as near as i can recollect you cannot therefore swear to his identity no sir but to the best of my knowledge and belief he is the man take that evidence down as important said mr norman it will assist him at his trial the evidence was taken down and then my commitment to the county gaol was made out i was placed in a cart between two constables and driven off on my arrival i was put into a cell and my money returned to me but the ring was detained that it might be advertised at last i was freed from the manacles and when the prison dress was brought to me to put on in lieu of my own clothes i requested leave from the gaoler to wash myself which was granted and strange to say so unaccustomed had i been to such a state of filth that i felt a degree of happiness as i returned from the pump in the prisonyard and i put on the prison dress almost with pleasure for degrading as it was at all events it was new and clean i then returned to my cell and was left to my meditations now that my examination and committal were over i became much more composed and was able to reflect coolly i perceived the great danger of my situationhow strong the evidence was against meand how little chance i had of escape as for sending to lord windermear mr masterton or those who formerly were acquainted with me my pride forbade iti would sooner have perished on the scaffold besides their evidence as to my former situation in life although it would perhaps satisfactorily account for my possession of the money and the ring and for my disposing of my portmanteauall strong presumptive evidence against mewould not destroy the evidence brought forward as to the robbery which appeared to be so very conclusive to the bench of magistrates my only chance appeared to be in the footpad who had not escaped acknowledging that i was not his accomplice and i felt how much i was interested in his recovery as well as in his candour the assizes i knew were near at hand and i anxiously awaited the return of the gaoler to make a few inquiries at night he looked through the small square cut out of the top of the door of the cell for it was his duty to go his rounds and ascertain if all his prisoners were safe i then asked him if i might be allowed to make a few purchases such as pens ink and paper c as i was not committed to prison in punishment but on suspicion this was not denied although it would have been to those who were condemned to imprisonment and hard labour for their offences and he volunteered to procure them for me the next morning i then wished him a goodnight and threw myself on my mattress worn out with fatigue and distress of mind i slept soundly without dreaming until daylight the next morning as i awoke and my scattered senses were returning i had a confused idea that there was something which weighed heavily on my mind which sleep had banished from my memory what is it thought i and as i opened my eyes so did i remember that i japhet newland who but two nights before was pressing the down of luxury in the same habitation as lady de clare and her lovely child was now on a mattress in the cell of a prison under a charge which threatened me with an ignominious death i rose and sat on the bed for i had not thrown off my clothes my first thoughts were directed to timothy should i write to him no no why should i make him miserable if i was to suffer it should be under an assumed name but what name here i was interrupted by the gaoler who opened the door and desired me to roll up my mattress and bedclothes that they might as was the custom be taken out of the cell during the day my first inquiry was if the man who had been so much hurt was in the gaol you mean your complice replied the gaoler yes he is here and has recovered his senses the doctor says he will do very well has he made any confession inquired i the gaoler made no reply i ask that question continued i because if he acknowledges who was his accomplice i shall be set at liberty very likely replied the man sarcastically the fact is there is no occasion for kings evidence in this case or you might get off by crossing the water so you must trust to your luck the grand jury meet today and i will let you know whether a true bill is found against you or not what is the name of the other man inquired i well you are a good un to put a face upon a matter i will say you would almost persuade me with that innocent look of yours that you know nothing about the business nor do i replied i you will be fortunate if you can prove as much thats all still you have not answered my question what is the other mans name well replied the gaoler laughing since you are determined i shall tell you i will it must be news to you with a vengeance his name is bill ogle alias swamping bill i suppose you never heard that name before i certainly never did replied i perhaps you do not know your own name yet i can tell it you for bill ogle has blown upon you so far indeed replied i and what name has he given to me why to do him justice it wasnt until he saw a copy of the depositions before the magistrates and heard how you were nabbed in trying to help him off that he did tell it and then he said well phil maddox always was a true un and im mortal sorry that hes in fort by looking ater me now do you know your own name i certainly do not replied i well did you ever hear of one who went by the name of phil maddox i never did replied i and i am glad that ogle has disclosed so much well i never before met with a man who didnt know his own name or had the face to say so and expect to be believed but never mind you are right to be cautious with the halter looking you in the face o god o god exclaimed i throwing myself on the bedstead and covering up my face give me strength to bear even that if so it must be the gaoler looked at me for a time i dont know what to make of himhe puzzles me quite certainly yet its no mistake it is a mistake replied i rising but whether the mistake will be found out until too late is another point however it is of little consequence what have i to live forunless to find out who is my father find out your father whats in the wind now well it beats my comprehension altogether but did not you say you wished me to get you something yes replied i and i gave him some money with directions to purchase me implements for writing some scented wax a toothbrush and toothpowder eau de cologne hairbrush and comb razors small lookingglass and various implements for my toilet this is a rum world said the man repeating what i asked for as i put two guineas in his hand ive purchased many a article for a prisoner but never heard of such rattletraps afore however that be all the same you will have them though what ho de colum is i cant tell nor dang me if i shall recollectnot poison be it for that is not allowed in the prison no no replied i indulging in momentary mirth at the idea you may inquire and you will find that its only taken by ladies who are troubled with the vapours now i should ha thought that youd have spent your money in the cookshop which is so much more natural however we all have our fancies so saying he quitted the cell and locked the door chapter lx i am condemned to be hung by the neck until i am dead and to go out of the world without finding out who is my fatherafterwards my innocence is made manifest and i am turned adrift a maniac in the high road it may appear strange to the reader that i sent for the abovementioned articles but habit is second nature and although two days before when i set out on my pilgrimage i had resolved to discard these superfluities yet now in my distress i felt as if they would comfort me that evening after rectifying a few mistakes on the part of the goodtempered gaoler by writing down what i wanted on the paper which he had procured me i obtained all that i required the next morning he informed me that the grand jury had found a true bill against me and that on the saturday next the assizes would be held he also brought me the list of trials and i found that mine would be one of the last and would not probably come on until monday or tuesday i requested him to send for a good tailor as i wished to be dressed in a proper manner previous to appearing in court as a prisoner is allowed to go into court in his own clothes instead of the gaol dress this was consented to and when the man came i was very particular in my directions so much so that it surprised him he also procured me the other articles i required to complete my dress and on saturday night i had them all ready for i was resolved that i would at least die as a gentleman sunday passed away not as it ought to have passed certainly i attended prayers but my thoughts were elsewherehow indeed could it be otherwise who can control his thoughts he may attempt so to do but the attempt is all that can be made he cannot command them i heard nothing my mind was in a state of gyration whirling round from one thing to the other until i was giddy from intensity of feeling on monday morning the gaoler came and asked me whether i would have legal advice i replied in the negative you will be called about twelve oclock i hear continued he it is now ten and there is only one more trial before yours about the stealing of four geese and half a dozen fowls good god thought i and am i mixed up with such deeds as these i dressed myself with the utmost care and precision and never was more successful my clothes were black and fitted well about one oclock i was summoned by the gaoler and led between him and another to the courthouse and placed in the dock at first my eyes swam and i could distinguish nothing but gradually i recovered i looked round for i had called up my courage my eyes wandered from the judge to the row of legal gentlemen below him from them to the welldressed ladies who sat in the gallery above behind me i did not look i had seen enough and my cheeks burned with shame at last i looked at my fellowculprit who stood beside me and his eyes at the same time met mine he was dressed in the gaol clothes of pepper and salt coarse cloth he was a rough vulgar brutal looking man but his eye was brilliant his complexion was dark and his face was covered with whiskers good heavens thought i who will ever imagine or credit that we have been associates the man stared at me bit his lip and smiled with contempt but made no further remark the indictment having been read the clerk of the court cried out you benjamin ogle having heard the charge say guilty or not guilty not guilty replied the man to my astonishment you philip maddox guilty or not guilty i did not answer prisoner observed the judge in a mild voice you must answer guilty or not guilty it is merely a form my lord replied i my name is not philip maddox that is the name given in the indictment by the evidence of your fellowprisoner observed the judge your real name we cannot pretend to know it is sufficient that you answer to the question of whether you the prisoner are guilty or not guilty not guilty my lord most certainly replied i placing my hand to my heart and bowing to him the trial proceeded armstrong was the principal evidence to my person he would not swear the jew proved my selling my clothes purchasing those found in the bundle and the stick of which armstrong possessed himself the clothes i had on at the time of my capture were produced in court as for ogle his case was decisive we were then called upon for our defence ogles was very short he had been accustomed to fits all his lifewas walking to hounslow and had fallen down in a fit it must have been somebody else who had committed the robbery and had made off and he had been picked up in a mistake this defence appeared to make no other impression than ridicule and indignation at the barefaced assertion i was then called on for mine my lord said i i have no defence to make except that which i asserted before the magistrates that i was performing an act of charity towards a fellowcreature and was through that supposed to be an accomplice arraigned before so many upon a charge at the bare accusation of which my blood revolts i cannot and will not allow those who might prove what my life has been and the circumstances which induced me to take up the disguise in which i was taken to appear in my behalf i am unfortunate but not guilty one only chance appears to be open to me which is in the candour of the party who now stands by me if he will say to the court that he ever saw me before i will submit without murmur to my sentence im sorry that youve put that question my boy replied the man for i have seen you before and the wretch chuckled with repressed laughter i was so astonished so thunderstruck with this assertion that i held own my head and made no reply the judge then summed up the evidence to the jury pointing out to them that of ogles guilt there could be no doubt and of mine he was sorry to say but little still they must bear in mind that the witness armstrong could not swear to my person the jury without leaving the box consulted together a short time and brought in a verdict of guilty against benjamin ogle and philip maddox i heard no morethe judge sentenced us both to execution he lamented that so young and prepossessing a person as myself should be about to suffer for such an offence he pointed out the necessity of condign punishment and gave us no hopes of pardon or clemency but i heard him noti did not fall but i was in a state of stupor at last he wound up his sentence by praying us to prepare ourselves for the awful change by an appeal to that heavenly fatherfather exclaimed i in a voice which electrified the court did you say my father o god where is he and i fell down in a fit the handkerchiefs of the ladies were applied to their faces the whole court were moved for i had by my appearance excited considerable interest and the judge with a faltering subdued voice desired that the prisoners might be removed stop one minute my good fellow said ogle to the gaoler while others were taking me out of court my lord ive something rather important to say why i did not say it before you shall hear you are a judge to condemn the guilty and release the innocent we are told that there is no trial like an english jury but this i say that many a man is hung for what he never has been guilty of you have condemned that poor young man to death i could have prevented it if i had chosen to speak before but i would not that i might prove how little there is of justice he had nothing to do with the robberyphil maddox was the man and he is not philip maddox he said that he never saw me before nor do i believe that he ever did as sure as i shall hang he is innocent it was but now that when appealed to by him you stated that you had seen him before so i did and i told the truthi had seen him before i saw him go to hold the gentlemans horse but he did not see me i stole his bundle and his stick which he left on the bench and thats how they were found in our possession now you have the truth and you may either acknowledge that there is little justice by eating your own words and letting him free or you may hang him rather than acknowledge that you are wrong at all events his blood will now be on your hands and not mine if phil maddox had not turned tail like a coward i should not have been here so i tell the truth to save him who was doing me a kind act and to let him swing who left me in the lurch the judge desired that this statement might be taken down that further inquiry might be made intimating to the jury that i should be respited for the present but of all this i was ignorant as there was no placing confidence in the assertions of such a man as ogle it was considered necessary that he should repeat his assertions at the last hour of his existence and the gaoler was ordered not to state what had passed to me as he might excite false hopes when i recovered from my fit i found myself in the gaolers parlour and as soon as i was able to walk i was locked up in a condemned cell the execution had been ordered to take place on the thursday and i had two days to prepare in the meantime the greatest interest had been excited with regard to me my whole appearance so evidently belied the charge that everyone was in my favour ogle was requestioned and immediately gave a clue for the apprehension of maddox who he said he hoped would swing by his side the gaoler came to me the next day saying that some of the magistrates wished to speak with me but as i had made up my mind not to reveal my former life my only reply was that i begged they would allow me to have my last moments to myself i recollected melchiors idea of destiny and imagined that he was right it was my destiny thought i and i remained in a state of stupor the fact was that i was very ill my head was heavy my brain was on fire and the throbbing of my heart could have been perceived without touching my breast i remained on the mattress all day and all the next night with my face buried in the clothes i was too ill to raise my head on wednesday morning i felt myself gently pushed on the shoulder by some one i opened my eyes it was a clergyman i turned away my head and remained as before i was then in a violent fever he spoke for some time occasionally i heard a word and then relapsed into a state of mental imbecility he sighed and went away thursday came and the hour of deathbut time was by me unheeded as well as eternity in the meantime maddox had been taken and the contents of armstrongs bundle found in his possession and when he discovered that ogle had been evidence against him he confessed to the robbery whether it was on thursday or friday i knew not then but i was lifted off the bed and taken before somebodysomething passed but the fever had mounted up to my head and i was in a state of stupid delirium strange to say they did not perceive my condition but ascribed it all to abject fear of death i was led awayi had made no answerbut i was free chapter lxi when at the lowest spoke of fortunes wheel one is sure to rise as it turns roundi recover my senses and find myself amongst friends i think some people shook me by the hand and others shouted as i walked in the open air but i recollect no more i afterwards was informed that i had been reprieved that i had been sent for and a long exhortation delivered to me for it was considered that my life must have been one of error or i should have applied to my friends and have given my name my not answering was attributed to shame and confusionmy glassy eye had not been noticedmy tottering step when led in by the gaolers attributed to other causes and the magistrates shook their heads as i was led out of their presence the gaoler had asked me several times where i intended to go at last i had told him to seek my father and darting away from him i had run like a madman down the street of course he had no longer any power over me but he muttered as i fled from him ive a notion hell soon be locked up again poor fellow its turned his brain for certain as i tottered along my unsteady step naturally attracted the attention of the passersby but they attributed it to intoxication thus was i allowed to wander away in a state of madness and before night i was far from the town what passed and whither i had bent my steps i cannot tell all i know is that after running like a maniac seizing everybody by the arm that i met staring at them with wild and flashing eyes and sometimes in a solemn voice at others in a loud threatening tone startling them with the interrogatory are you my father and then darting away or sobbing like a child as the humour took me i had crossed the country and three days afterwards i was picked up at the door of a house in the town of reading exhausted with fatigue and exposure and nearly dead when i recovered i found myself in bed my head shaved my arm bound up after repeated bleedings and a female figure sitting by me god in heaven where am i exclaimed i faintly thou hast called often upon thy earthly father during the time of thy illness friend replied a soft voice it rejoiceth me much to hear thee call upon thy father which is in heaven be comforted thou art in the hands of those who will be mindful of thee offer up thy thanks in one short prayer for thy return to reason and then sink again into repose for thou must need it much i opened my eyes wide and perceived that a young person in a quakers dress was sitting by the bed working with her needle an open bible was on a little table before her i perceived also a cup and parched with thirst i merely said give me to drink she arose and put a teaspoon to my lips but i raised my hand took the cup from her and emptied it o how delightful was that draught i sank down on my pillow for even that slight exertion had overpowered me and muttering god i thank thee i was immediately in a sound sleep from which i did not awake for many hours when i did it was not daylight a lamp was on the table and an old man in a quakers dress was snoring very comfortably in the armchair i felt quite refreshed with my long sleep and was now able to recall what had passed i remembered the condemned cell and the mattress upon which i lay but all after was in a state of confusion here and there a fact or supposition was strong in my memory but the intervals between were total blanks i was at all events free that i felt convinced of and that i was in the hands of the sect who denominate themselves quakers but where was i and how did i come here i remained thinking on the past and wondering until the day broke and with the daylight roused up my watchful attendant he yawned stretched his arms and rising from the chair came to the side of my bed i looked him in the face hast thou slept well friend said he i have slept as much as i wish and would not disturb you replied i for i wanted nothing peradventure i did sleep replied the man watching long agreeth not with the flesh although the spirit is most willing requirest thou anything yes replied i i wish to know where i am verily thou art in the town of reading in berkshire and in the house of phineas cophagus cophagus exclaimed i mr cophagus the surgeon and apothecary phineas cophagus is his name he hath been admitted into our sect and hath married a daughter of our persuasion he hath attended thee in thy fever and thy frenzy without calling in the aid of the physician therefore do i believe that he must be the man of whom thou speakest yet doth he not follow up the healing art for the lucre of gain and the young person who was at my bedside is she his wife nay friend she is halfsister to the wife of phineas cophagus by a second marriage and a maiden who was named susannah temple at the baptismal font but i will go to phineas cophagus and acquaint him of your waking for such were his directions the man then quitted the room leaving me quite astonished with the information he had imparted cophagus turned quaker and attending me in the town of reading in a short time mr cophagus himself entered in his dressinggown japhet said he seizing my hand with eagerness and then as if recollecting he checked himself and commenced in a slow tone japhet newlandtruly glad am ihumverily do i rejoiceyou ephraimget out of the roomand so on yea i will depart since it is thy bidding replied the man quitting the room mr cophagus then greeted me in his usual waytold me that he had found me insensible at the door of a house a little way off and had immediately recognised me he had brought me to his own home but without much hope of my recovery he then begged to know by what strange chance i had been found in such a desolate condition i replied that although i was able to listen i did not feel myself equal to the exertion of telling so long a story and that i should infinitely prefer that he should narrate to me what had passed since we had parted at dublin and how it was that i now found that he had joined the sect of quakers peradventurelong word thatumqueer peoplevery goodand so on commenced mr cophagus but as the reader will not understand his phraseology quite so well as i did i shall give mr cophaguss history in my own version mr cophagus had returned to the small town at which he resided and on his arrival he had been called upon by a gentleman who was of the society of friends requesting that he would prescribe for a niece of his who was on a visit at his house and had been taken dangerously ill cophagus with his usual kindness of heart immediately consented and found that mr temples report was true for six weeks he attended the young quakeress and recovered her from an imminent and painful disease in which she showed such fortitude and resignation and such unconquerable good temper that when mr cophagus returned to his bachelors establishment he could not help reflecting upon what an invaluable wife she would make and how much more cheerful his house would be with such a domestic partner in short mr cophagus fell in love and like all elderly gentlemen who have so long bottled up their affections he became most desperately enamoured and if he loved miss judith temple when he witnessed her patience and resignation under suffering how much more did he love her when he found that she was playful merry and cheerful without being boisterous when restored to her health mr cophaguss attentions could not be misunderstood he told her uncle that he had thought seriously of wedding cakewhite favoursmarriagefamilyand so on and to the young lady he had put his cane up to his nose and prescribed a dose of matrimonyto be taken immediately to mr cophagus there was no objection raised by the lady who was not in her teens or by the uncle who had always respected him as a worthy man and a good christian but to marry one who was not of her persuasion was not to be thought of her friends would not consent to it mr cophagus was therefore dismissed with a full assurance that the only objection which offered was that he was not of their society mr cophagus walked home discomforted he sat down on his easy chair and found it excessively uneasyhe sat down to his solitary meal and found that his own company was unbearablehe went to bed but found that it was impossible to go to sleep the next morning therefore mr cophagus returned to mr temple and stated his wish to be made acquainted with the difference between the tenets of the quaker persuasion and those of the established church mr temple gave him an outline which appeared to mr cophagus to be very satisfactory and then referred him to his niece for fuller particulars when a man enters into an argument with a full desire to be convinced and with his future happiness perhaps depending upon that conviction and when further those arguments are brought forward by one of the prettiest voices and backed by the sweetest of smiles it is not to be wondered at his soon becoming a proselyte thus it was with mr cophagus who in a week discovered that the peace humility and goodwill upon which the quaker tenets are founded were much more congenial to the true spirit of the christian revelation than the athanasian creed to be sung or said in our established churches and with this conviction mr cophagus requested admission into the fraternity and shortly after his admission it was thought advisable by the friends that his faith should be confirmed and strengthened by his espousal of miss judith temple with whom at her requestand he could refuse her nothinghe had repaired to the town of reading in which her relations all resided and phineas cophagus of the society of friends declared himself to be as happy as a man could be good people japhetumhonest people japhetdont fightlittle stiffspirit movesand so on said mr cophagus as he concluded his narrative and then shaking me by the hand retired to shave and dress chapter lxii i fall in love with religion when preached by one who has the form of an angel in half an hour afterwards ephraim came in with a draught which i was desired to take by mr cophagus and then to try and sleep this was good advice and i followed it i awoke after a long refreshing sleep and found mr and mrs cophagus sitting in the room she at work and he occupied with a book when i opened my eyes and perceived a female i looked to ascertain if it was the young person whom ephraim had stated to be susannah temple not that i recollected her features exactly but i did the contour of her person mrs cophagus was taller and i had a fair scrutiny of her before they perceived that i was awake her face was very pleasing features small and regular she appeared to be about thirty years of age and was studiously neat and clean in her person her quakers dress was not without some little departure from the strict fashion and form sufficient to assist without deviating from its simplicity if i might use the term it was a little coquettish and evinced that the wearer had she not belonged to that sect would have shown great taste in the adornment of her person mr cophagus although he did not think so himself as i afterwards found out was certainly much improved by his change of costume his spindleshanks which as i have before observed were peculiarly at variance with his little orbicular orangeshaped stomach were now concealed in loose trousers which took off from the protuberance of the latter and added dignity to the former blending the two together so that his roundness became fine by degrees and beautifully less as it descended altogether the quaker dress added very much to the substantiability of his appearance and was a manifest improvement especially when he wore his broadbrimmed hat having satisfied my curiosity i moved the curtain so as to attract their attention and cophagus came to my bedside and felt my pulse goodvery goodall rightlittle broththrow in barkon his legswell as everand so on i am indeed much better this afternoon replied i indeed so well that i feel as if i could get up poohtumble downnever dolie a bedget strongwifemrs cophagusjaphetold friend mrs cophagus had risen from her chair and come towards the bed when her husband introduced her in his own fashion i am afraid that i have been a great trouble madam said i japhet newland we have done but our duty even if thou wert not as it appears that thou art a friend of my husband consider me therefore as thy sister and i will regard thee as a brother and if thou wouldst wish it thou shalt sojourn with us for so hath my husband communicated his wishes unto me i thanked her for her kind expressions and took the fair hand which was offered in such amity cophagus then asked me if i was well enough to inform him of what had passed since our last meeting and telling me that his wife knew my whole history and that i might speak before her he took his seat by the side of the bed his wife also drew her chair nearer and i commenced the narrative of what had passed since we parted in ireland when i had finished mr cophagus commenced as usual umvery oddlose moneybadgrow honestgoodrun away from friendsbadnot hung goodbrain feverbadcome heregoodstay with usquite comfortableand so on thou hast suffered much friend japhet said mrs cophagus wiping her eyes and i would almost venture to say hast been chastised too severely were it not that those whom he loveth he chastiseth still thou art saved and now out of danger peradventure thou wilt now quit a vain world and be content to live with us nay as thou hast the example of thy former master it may perhaps please the lord to advise thee to become one of us and to join us as a friend my husband was persuaded to the right path by me continued she looking fondly at him who knoweth but some of our maidens may also persuade thee to eschew a vain unrighteous world and follow thy redeemer in humility

the evening friend cophagus and his wife were not in the room but susannah temple whom i had first seen and of whom i had made inquiry of ephraim who was cophaguss servant she was sitting close to the light and reading and long did i continue to gaze upon her fearful of interrupting her she was the most beautiful specimen of clear and transparent white that i ever had beheldher complexion was unrivalledher eyes were large but i could not ascertain their colour as they were cast down upon her book and hid by her long fringed eyelashesher eyebrows arched and regular as if drawn by a pair of compasses and their soft hair in beautiful contrast with her snowy foreheadher hair was auburn but mostly concealed within her capher nose was very straight but not very large and her mouth was perfection she appeared to be between seventeen and eighteen years old as far as i could ascertain her figure was symmetrically perfect dressed as she was in the modest simple garb worn by the females of the society of friends she gave an idea of neatness cleanliness and propriety upon which i could have gazed for ever she was indeed most beautiful i felt her beauty her purity and i could have worshipped her as an angel while i still had my eyes fixed upon her exquisite features she closed her book and rising from her chair came to the side of the bed that she might not be startled at the idea of my having been watching her i closed my eyes and pretended to slumber she resumed her seat and then i changed my position and spoke is any one there yes friend newland what is it that thou requirest said she advancing wouldst thou see cophagus or ephraim i will summon them o no replied i why should i disturb them from their amusements or employments i have slept a long while and i would like to read a little i think if my eyes are not too weak thou must not read but i may read unto thee replied susannah tell me what is it that thou wouldest have me read i have no vain books but surely thou thinkest not of them after thy escape from death i care not what is read provided that you read to me replied i nay but thou shouldest care and be not wroth if i say to thee that there is but one book to which thou shouldest now listen thou hast been saved from deadly perilthou hast been rescued from the jaws of death art thou not thankful and to whom is gratitude most due but to thy heavenly father who hath been pleased to spare thee you are right replied i then i pray you to read to me from the bible susannah made no reply but resumed her seat and selecting those chapters most appropriate to my situation read them in a beautiful and impressive tone chapter lxiii pride and love at issuethe latter is victoriousi turn quaker and recommence my old profession if the reader will recall my narrative to his recollection he must observe that religion had had hitherto but little of my thoughts i had lived the life of most who live in this world perhaps not quite so correct in morals as many people for my code of morality was suited to circumstances as to religion i had none i had lived in the world and for the world i had certainly been well instructed in the tenets of our faith when i was at the asylum but there as in most other schools it is made irksome as a task and is looked upon with almost a feeling of aversion no proper religious sentiments are or can be inculcated to a large number of scholars it is the parent alone who can instil by precept and example that true sense of religion which may serve as a guide through life i had not read the bible from the time that i quitted the foundling hospital it was new to me and when i now heard read by that beautiful creature passages equally beautiful and so applicable to my situation weakened with disease and humbled in adversity i was moved even unto tears susannah closed the book and came to the bedside i thanked her she perceived my emotion and when i held out my hand she did not refuse hers i kissed it and it was immediately withdrawn and she left the room shortly afterwards ephraim made his appearance cophagus and his wife also came that evening but i saw no more of susannah temple until the following day when i again requested her to read to me i will not detain the reader by an account of my recovery in three weeks i was able to leave the room during that time i had become very intimate with the whole family and was treated as if i belonged to it during my illness i had certainly shown more sense of religion than i had ever done before but i do not mean to say that i was really religious i liked to hear the bible read by susannah and i liked to talk with her upon religious subjects but had susannah been an ugly old woman i very much doubt if i should have been so attentive it was her extreme beautyher modesty and fervour which so became her which enchanted me i felt the beauty of religion but it was through an earthly object it was beautiful in her she looked an angel and i listened to her precepts as delivered by one still whatever may be the cause by which a persons attention can be directed to so important a subject so generally neglected whether by fear of death or by love towards an earthly object the advantages are the same and although very far from what i ought to have been i certainly was through my admiration of her a better man as soon as i was on the sofa wrapped up in one of the dressinggowns of mr cophagus he told me that the clothes in which i had been picked up were all in tatters and asked me whether i would like to have others made according to the usual fashion or like those with whom i should he trusted in future reside i had already debated this matter in my mind return to the world i had resolved not to do to follow up the object of my search appeared to me only to involve me in difficulties and what were the intentions of cophagus with regard to me i knew not i was hesitating for i knew not what answer to give when i perceived the pensive deep blue eye of susannah fixed upon me watching attentively if not eagerly for my response it decided the point if replied i you do not think that i should disgrace you i should wish to wear the dress of the society of friends although not yet one of your body but soon to be i trust replied mrs cophagus alas replied i i am an outcast and i looked at susannah temple not so japhet newland replied she mildly i am pleased that thou hast of thy own accord rejected vain attire i trust that thou wilt not find that thou art without friends while i am with you replied i addressing myself to them all i consider it my duty to conform to your manners in every way but byandbye when i resume my search and why shouldst thou resume a search which must prove unavailing and but leads thee into error and misfortune i am but young japhet newland and not perhaps so able to advise yet doth it appear to me that the search can only be availing when made by those who left thee when they wish for you they will seek thee but thy seeking them is vain and fruitless but replied i recollect that inquiries have already been made at the foundling and those who inquired have been sent away disappointedthey will enquire no more and is a parents love so trifling that one disappointment will drive him from seeking of his child no no japhet if thou art yearned for thou wilt be found and fresh inquiries will be made but thy search is unavailing and already hast thou lost much time true susannah thy advice is good replied mrs cophagus in following a shadow japhet hath much neglected the substance it is time that thou shouldst settle thyself and earn thy livelihood and do thy duty in that path of life to which it hath pleased god to call thee continued susannah who with mrs cophagus walked out of the room cophagus then took up the conversation and pointing out the uselessness of my roving about and the propriety of my settling in life proposed that i should take an apothecarys shop for which he would furnish the means and that he could ensure me the custom of the whole society of friends in reading which was very large as there was not one of the sect in that line of business become one of us japhetgood businessmarry byandbyehappy lifelittle childrenand so on i thought of susannah and was silent cophagus then said i had better reflect upon his offer and make up my determination if that did not suit me he would still give me all the assistance in his power i did reflect long before i could make up my mind i was still worldly inclined still my fancy would revel in the idea of finding out my father in high life and as once more appearing as a star of fashion of returning with interest the contumely i had lately received and reassuming as a right that position in society which i had held under false colours i could not bear the idea of sinking at once into a tradesman and probably ending my days in obscurity pride was still my ruling passion such were my first impulses and then i looked upon the other side of the picture i was without the means necessary to support myself i could not return to high life without i discovered my parents in the first place and in the second found them to be such as my warm imagination had depicted i had no chance of finding them i had already been long seeking in vain i had been twice taken up to bow streetnearly lost my life in irelandhad been sentenced to deathhad been insane and recovered by a miracle and all in prosecuting this useless search all this had much contributed to cure me of the monomania i agreed with susannah that the search must be made by the other parties and not by me i recalled the treatment i had received from the worldthe contempt with which i had been treatedthe heartlessness of high life and the little chance of my ever again being admitted into fashionable society i placed all this in juxtaposition with the kindness of those with whom i now residedwhat they had done already for me and what they now offered which was to make me independent by my own exertions i weighed all in my mind was still undecided for my pride still carried its weight when i thought of the pure beautiful susannah temple andmy decision was made i would not lose the substance by running after shadows that evening with many thanks i accepted the kind offers of mr cophagus and expressed my determination of entering into the society of friends thou hast chosen wisely said mrs cophagus extending her hand to me and it is with pleasure that we shall receive thee i welcome thee japhet newland said susannah also offering her hand and i trust that thou wilt find more happiness among those with whom thou art about to sojourn than in the world of vanity and deceit in which thou hast hitherto played thy part no longer seek an earthly father who hath deserted thee but a heavenly father who will not desert thee in thy afflictions you shall direct me into the right path susannah replied i i am too young to be a guide japhet replied she smiling but not too young i hope to be a friend the next day my clothes came home and i put them on i looked at myself in the glass and was anything but pleased but as my head was shaved it was of little consequence what i wore so i consoled myself mr cophagus sent for a barber and ordered me a wig which was to be ready in a few days when it was ready i put it on and altogether did not dislike my appearance i flattered myself that if i was a quaker at all events i was a very good looking and a very smart one and when a day or two afterwards a reunion of friends took place at mr cophaguss house to introduce me to them i perceived with much satisfaction that there was no young man who could compete with me after this i was much more reconciled to my transformation chapter lxiv i prosper in every way and become reconciled to my situation mr cophagus was not idle in a few weeks he had rented a shop for me and furnished it much better than his own in smithfield the upper part of the house was let off as i was to reside with the family when it was ready i went over it with him and was satisfied all i wished for was timothy as an assistant but that wish was unavailing as i knew not where to find him that evening i observed to mr cophagus that i did not much like putting my name over the shop the fact was that my pride forbade it and i could not bear the idea that japhet newland at whose knock every aristocratic door had flown open should appear in gold letters above a shopwindow there are many reasons against it observed i one is that it is not my real namei should like to take the name of cophagus another is that the name being so well known may attract those who formerly knew me and i should not wish that they should come in and mock me another is japhet newland interrupted susannah with more severity than i ever had seen in her sweet countenance do not trouble thyself with giving thy reasons seeing thou hast given every reason but the right one which is that thy pride revolts at it i was about to observe replied i that it was a name that sounded of mammon and not fitting for one of our persuasion but susannah you have accused me of pride and i will now raise no further objections japhet newland it shall be and let us speak no more upon the subject if i have wronged thee japhet much do i crave thy forgiveness replied susannah but it is god alone who knoweth the secrets of our hearts i was presumptuous and you must pardon me susannah it is i who ought to plead for pardon you know me better than i know myself it was pride and nothing but pridebut you have cured me truly have i hopes of thee now japhet replied susannah smiling those who confess their faults will soon amend them yet i do think there is some reason in thy observation for who knoweth but meeting with thy former associates thou mayst not be tempted into falling away thou mayst spell thy name as thou listest and peradventure it would be better to disguise it so agreed mr and mrs cophagus and i therefore had it written gnowland and having engaged a person of the society strongly recommended to me as an assistant i took possession of my shop and was very soon busy in making up prescriptions and dispensing my medicines in all quarters of the good town of reading and i was happy i had enjoyment during the day my profession was at all events liberal i was dressed and lived as a gentleman or rather i should say respectably i was earning my own livelihood i was a useful member of society and when i retired home to meals and late at night i found that if cophagus and his wife had retired susannah temple always waited up and remained with me a few minutes i had never been in love until i had fallen in with this perfect creature but my love for her was not the love of the world i could not so depreciate heri loved her as a superior beingi loved her with fear and trembling i felt that she was too pure too holy too good for a vain worldly creature like myself i felt as if my destiny depended upon her and her fiat that if she favoured me my happiness in this world and in the next were secured that if she rejected me i was cast away for ever such was my feeling for susannah temple who perfect as she was was still a woman and perceived her power over me but unlike the many of her sex exerted that power only to lead to what was right insensibly almost my pride was quelled and i became humble and religiously inclined even the peculiarities of the sect their meeting at their places of worship their drawling and their quaint manner of talking became no longer a subject of dislike i found out causes and good reasons for everything which before appeared strangesermons in stones and good in everything months passed awaymy business prosperedi had nearly repaid the money advanced by mr cophagus i was in heart and soul a quaker and i entered into the fraternity with a feeling that i could act up to what i had promised i was happy quite happy and yet i had never received from susannah temple any further than the proofs of sincere friendship but i had much of her society and we were now very very intimate i found out what warm what devoted feelings were concealed under her modest quiet exteriorhow well her mind was stored and how right was that mind often when i talked over past events did i listen to her remarks all tending to one point morality and virtue often did i receive from her at first a severe but latterly a kind rebuke when my discourse was light and frivolous but when i talked of merry subjects which were innocent what could be more joyous or more exhilarating than her laughwhat more intoxicating than her sweet smile when she approved of my sentiments and when animated by the subject what could be more musical or more impassioned than her bursts of eloquence which were invariably followed by a deep blush when she recollected how she had been carried away by excitement there was one point upon which i congratulated myself which was that she had received two or three unexceptionable offers of marriage during the six months that i had been in her company and refused them at the end of that period thanks to the assistance i received from the friends i had paid mr cophagus all the money which he had advanced and found myself in possession of a flourishing business and independent i then requested that i might be allowed to pay an annual stipend for my board and lodging commencing from the time i first came to his house mr cophagus said i was rightthe terms were easily arranged and i was independent still my advances with susannah were slow but if slow they were sure one day i observed to her how happy mr cophagus appeared to be as a married man her reply was he is japhet he has worked hard for his independence and he now is reaping the fruits of his industry that is as much as to say that i must do the same thought i and that i have no business to propose for a wife until i am certain that i am able to provide for her i have as yet laid up nothing and an income is not a capital i felt that whether a party interested or not she was right and i redoubled my diligence chapter lxv a variety of the quaker tribewho had a curious disintegration of mind and body i was not yet weaned from the world but i was fast advancing to that state when a very smart young quaker came on a visit to reading he was introduced to mr and mrs cophagus and was soon as might be expected an admirer of susannah but he received no encouragement he was an idle person and passed much of his time sitting in my shop and talking with me and being much less reserved and guarded than the generality of the young men of the sect i gradually became intimate with him one day when my assistant was out he said to me friend gnowland tell me candidly hast thou ever seen my face before not that i can recollect friend talbot then my recollection is better than yours and now having obtained thy friendship as one of the society i will remind thee of our former acquaintance when thou wert mr newland walking about town with major carbonnell i was lieutenant talbot of thedragoon guards i was dumb with astonishment and i stared him in the face yes continued he bursting into laughter such is the fact you have thought perhaps that you were the only man of fashion who had ever been transformed into a quaker now you behold another so no longer imagine yourself the phoenix of your tribe i do certainly recollect that name replied i but although as you must be acquainted with my history it is very easy to conceive why i have joined the society yet upon what grounds you can have so done is to me inexplicable newland it certainly does require explanation it has been i assert my misfortune and not my fault not that i am not happy on the contrary i feel that i am now in my proper situation i ought to have been born of quaker parentsat all events i was born a quaker in disposition but i will come tomorrow early and then if you will give your man something to do out of the way i will tell you my history i know that you will keep my secret the next morning he came and as soon as we were alone he imparted to me what follows i recollect well newland when you were one of the leaders of fashion i was then in the dragoon guards and although not very intimate with you had the honour of a recognition when we met at parties i cannot help laughing upon my soul when i look at us both now but never mind i was of course a great deal with my regiment and at the club my father as you may not perhaps be aware was highly connected and all the family have been brought up in the army the question of profession has never been mooted by us and every talbot has turned out a soldier as naturally as a young duck takes to the water well i entered the army admired my uniform and was admired by the young ladies before i received my lieutenants commission my father the old gentleman died and left me a younger brothers fortune of four hundred per annum but as my uncle said it was quite enough for a talbot who would push himself forward in his profession as the talbots had ever done before him i soon found out that my income was not sufficient to enable me to continue in the guards and my uncle was very anxious that i should exchange into a regiment on service i therefore by purchase obtained a company in the rd ordered out to reduce the french colonies in the west indies and i sailed with all the expectation of covering myself with as much glory as the talbots had done from time immemorial we landed and in a short time the bullets and grape were flying in all directions and then i discovered what i declare never for a moment came into my head before to witthat i had mistaken my profession how do you mean talbot mean why that i was deficient in a certain qualification which never was before denied to a talbotcourage and you never knew that before never upon my honour my mind was always full of courage in my minds eye i built castles of feats of bravery which should eclipse all the talbots from him who burnt joan of arc down to the present day i assure you that surprised as other people were no one was more surprised than myself our regiment was ordered to advance and i led on my company the bullets flew like hail i tried to go on but i could not at last notwithstanding all my endeavours to the contrary i fairly took to my heels i was met by the commanding officerin fact i ran right against him he ordered me back and i returned to my regiment not feeling at all afraid again i was in the fire again i resisted the impulse but it was of no use and at last just before the assault took place i ran away as if the devil was after me wasnt it odd very odd indeed replied i laughing yes but you do not exactly understand why it was odd you know what philosophers tell you about volition and that the body is governed by the mind consequently obeys it now you see in my case it was exactly reversed i tell you that it is a fact that in mind i am as brave as any man in existence but i had a cowardly carcass and what is still worse it proved the master of my mind and ran away with it i had no mind to run away on the contrary i wished to have been of the forlorn hope and had volunteered but was refused surely if i had not courage i should have avoided such a post of danger is it not so it certainly appears strange that you should volunteer for the forlorn hope and then run away thats just what i say i have the soul of the talbots but a body which dont belong to the family and too powerful for the soul so it appears well go on it was go off instead of going on i tried again that day to mount the breach and as the fire was over i succeeded but there was a mark against me and it was intimated that i should have an opportunity of redeeming my character well there was a fort to be stormed the next day and i requested to lead my company in advance surely that was no proof of want of courage permission was granted we were warmly received and i felt that my legs refused to advance so what did i doi tied my sash round my thigh and telling the men that i was wounded requested they would carry me to the attack surely that was courage most undoubtedly so it was like a talbot we were at the foot of the breach when the shot flew about me i kicked and wrestled so that the two men who carried me were obliged to let me go and my rascally body was at liberty i say unfortunately for only conceive if they had carried me wounded up the breach what an heroic act it would have been considered on my part but fate decided it otherwise if i had lain still when they dropped me i should have done well but i was anxious to get up the breach that is my mind was so bent but as soon as i got on my legs confound them if they didnt run away with me and then i was found half a mile from the fort with a pretended wound that was enough i had a hint that the sooner i went home the better on account of the family i was permitted to sell out and i then walked the streets as a private gentleman but no one would speak to me i argued the point with several but they were obstinate and would not be convinced they said that it was no use talking about being brave if i ran away they were not philosophers talbot no they could not comprehend how the mind and the body could be at variance it was no use arguingthey would have it that the movements of the body depended upon the mind and that i had made a mistakeand that i was a coward in soul as well as body well what did you do oh i did nothing i had a great mind to knock them down but as i knew my body would not assist me i thought it better to leave it alone however they taunted me so by calling me fighting tom that my uncle shut his door upon me as a disgrace to the family saying he wished the first bullet had laid me deadvery kind of himat last my patience was worn out and i looked about to find whether there were not some people who did not consider courage as a sine quae non i found that the quakers tenets were against fighting and therefore courage could not be necessary so i have joined them and i find that if not a good soldier i am at all events a very respectable quaker and now you have the whole of my storyand tell me if you are of my opinion why really its a very difficult point to decide i never heard such a case of disintegration before i must think upon it of course you will not say a word about it newland never fear i will keep your secret talbot how long have you worn the dress oh more than a year bythebye what a nice young person that susannah temple is ive a great mind to propose for her but you must first ascertain what your body says to it talbot replied i sternly i allow no one to interfere with me quaker or not my dear fellow i beg your pardon i shall think no more about her said talbot rising up as he observed that i looked very fierce i wish you a good morning i leave reading tomorrow i will call on you and say goodbye if i can and i saw no more of friend talbot whose mind was all courage but whose body was so renegade chapter lxvi i fall in with timothy about a month after this i heard a sailor with one leg and a handful of ballads singing in a most lachrymal tone why whats that to you if my eyes im a wiping a tear is a pleasure dye see in its way bless your honour shy a copper to poor jack whos lost his leg in the sarvice thanky your honour and he continued its nonsense for trifles i own to be piping but they who cant pitywhy i pities they says the captain says he i shall never forget it of courage you know boys the true from the sham back your maintopsail your worship for half a minute and just assist a poor dismantled craft who has been riddled in the warstis a furious lion long life to your honourin battle so let it tis a furious lion in battle so let it but duty appeasedbut duty appeased buy a song young woman to sing to your sweetheart while you sit on his knee in the dogwatch but duty appeasedtis the heart of a lamb i believe there are few people who do not take a strong interest in the english sailor particularly in one who has been maimed in the defence of his country i always have and as i heard the poor disabled fellow bawling out his ditty certainly not with a very remarkable voice or execution i pulled out the drawer behind the counter and took out some halfpence to give him when i caught his eye i beckoned to him and he entered the shop here my good fellow said i although a man of peace myself yet i feel for those who suffer in the wars and i put the money to him may your honour never know a banyan day replied the sailor and a sickly season for you into the bargain nay friend that is not a kind wish to others replied i the sailor fixed his eyes earnestly upon me as if in astonishment for until i had answered he had not looked at me particularly what are you looking at said i good heavens exclaimed he it isyet it cannot be cannot be what friend he ran out of the door and read the name over the shop and then came in and sank upon a chair outside of the counter japheti have found you at last exclaimed he faintly good heaven who are you he threw off his hat with false ringlets fastened to the inside of it and i beheld timothy in a moment i sprang over the counter and was in his arms is it possible exclaimed i after a short silence on both sides that i find you timothy a disabled sailor is it possible japhet replied timothy that i find you a broadbrimmed quaker even so timothy i am really and truly one then you are less disguised than i am replied timothy kicking off his wooden leg and letting down his own which had been tied up to his thigh and concealed in his wide blue trousers i am no more a sailor than you are japhet and since you left me have never yet seen the salt water which i talk and sing so much about then thou hast been deceiving timothy which i regret much now i do perceive that you are a quaker replied tim but do not blame me until you have heard my story thank god i have found you at last but tell me japhet you will not send me awaywill you if your dress is changed your heart is not pray answer me before i say nything more you know i can be useful here indeed timothy i have often wished for you since i have been here and it will be your own fault if i part with you you shall assist me in the shop but you must dress like me dress like you have i not always dressed like you when we started from cophaguss were we not dressed much alike did we not wear spangled jackets together did i not wear your livery and belong to you ill put on anything japhetbut we must not part again my dear timothy i trust we shall not but i expect my assistant here soon and do not wish that he should see you in that garb go to a small publichouse at the farther end of this street and when you see me pass come out to me and we will walk out into the country and consult together i have put up at a small house not far off and have some clothes there i will alter my dress and meet you god bless you japhet timothy then picked up his ballads which were scattered on the floor put up his leg and putting on his wooden stump hastened away after once more silently pressing my hand in half an hour my assistant returned and i desired him to remain in the shop as i was going out on business i then walked to the appointed rendezvous and was soon joined by tim who had discarded his sailors disguise and was in what is called a shabby genteel sort of dress after the first renewed greeting i requested tim to let me know what had occurred to him since our separation you cannot imagine japhet what my feelings were when i found by your note that you had left me i had perceived how unhappy you had been for a long while and i was equally distressed although i knew not the cause i had no idea until i got your letter that you had lost all your money and i felt it more unkind of you to leave me then than if you had been comfortable and independent as for looking after you that i knew would be useless and i immediately went to mr masterton to take his advice as to how i should proceed mr masterton had received your letter and appeared to be very much annoyed very foolish boy said he but there is nothing that can be done now he is mad and that is all that can be said in his excuse you must do as he tells you i suppose and try the best for yourself i will help you in any way that i can my poor fellow said he so dont cry i went back to the house and collected together your papers which i sealed up i knew that the house was to be given up in a few days i sold the furniture and made the best i could of the remainder of your wardrobe and other things of value that you had left indeed everything with the exception of the dressingcase and pistols which had belonged to major carbonnell and i thought you might perhaps some day like to have them how very kind of you timothy to think of me in that way i shall indeed be glad but nowhat have i to do with pistols or silver dressingcases now i must not have them but still i thank you all the same the furniture and everything else fetched l after all expenses were paid i am glad of it timothy for your sake but i am sorry judging by your present plight that it appears to have done you but little good because i did not make use of it japhet what could i do with all that money i took it to mr masterton with all your papers and the dressingcase and pistolshe has it now ready for you when you ask for it he was very kind to me and offered to do anything for me but i resolved to go in search of you i had more money in my pocket when you went away than i generally have and with the surplus of what you left for the bills i had twelve or fourteen pounds so i wished mr masterton goodbye and have ever since been on my adventures in search of my master not master timothy say rather of your friend well of both if you please japhet and very pretty adventures i have had i assure you and some very hairbreadth escapes i think when we compare notes mine will be found most eventful timothy but we can talk of them and compare notes another time at present whom do you think i am residing with a quaker i presume you have guessed right so far but who do you think that quaker is there im at fault mr cophagas at this intelligence timothy gave a leap in the air turned round on his heel and tumbled on the grass in a fit of immoderate laughter cophagusa quaker cried he at last oh i long to see him snuffle snufflebroad brimswide skirtsand so on capital it is very true timothy but you must not mock at the persuasion i did not intend it japhet but there is something to me so ridiculous in the idea but continued timothy is it not still stranger that after having separated so many years we should all meet againand that i should find mr cophagusan apothecarys shopyou dispensing medicinesand ias i hope to becarrying them about as i did before well i will row in the same boat and i will be a quaker as well as you both well we will now return and i will take you to mr cophagus who will i am sure be glad to see you first japhet let me have some quakers clothesi should prefer it you shall have a suit of mine timothy since you wish it but recollect it is not at all necessary nor indeed will it be permitted that you enter into the sect without preparatory examination as to your fitness for admission i then went to the shop and sending out the assistant walked home and took out a worn suit of clothes with which i hastened to timothy he put them on in the shop and then walking behind the counter said this is my place and here i shall remain as long as you do i hope so timothy as for the one who is with me at present i can easily procure him other employment and he will not be sorry to go for he is a married man and does not like the confinement i have some money said timothy taking out of his old clothes a dirty rag and producing nearly twenty pounds i am well off you see you are indeed replied i yes there is nothing like being a sailor with one leg singing ballads do you know japhet that sometimes i have taken more than a pound a day since i have shammed the sailor not very honestly tim perhaps not japhet but it is very strange and yet very true that when honest i could make nothing and when i deceived i have done very well chapter lxvii timothy commences his narrative of his search after japhet i could not help calling to mind that the same consequences as timothy related in the last chapter had occurred to me during my eventful career but i had long considered that there was no excuse for dishonesty and that in the end it would only lead to exposure and disgrace i went home early in the evening to introduce timothy to mr cophagus who received him with great kindness and agreed immediately that he ought to be with me in the shop timothy paid his respects to the ladies and then went down with ephraim who took him under his protection in a few days he was as established with us as if he had been living with us for months i had some trouble at first in checking his vivacity and turn for ridicule but that was gradually effected and i found him not only a great acquisition but as he always was a cheerful and affectionate companion i had during the first days of our meeting recounted my adventures and made many inquiries of timothy relative to my few friends he told me that from mr masterton he had learnt that lady de clare and fleta had called upon him very much afflicted with the contents of my letterthat lord windermear also had been very much vexed and annoyedthat mr masterton had advised him to obtain another situation as a valet which he had refused and at the same time told him his intention of searching for me he had promised mr masterton to let him know if he found me and then bade him farewell i used to lie in bed japhet continued timothy and think upon the best method of proceeding at last i agreed to myself that to look for you as you looked after your father would be a wildgoose chase and that my money would soon be gone so i reflected whether i might not take up some roving trade which would support me and at the same time enable me to proceed from place to place what do you think was my first speculation why i saw a man with a dog harnessed in a little cart crying dogs meat and cats meat and i said to myself now theres the very thingtheres a professioni can travel and earn my livelihood i entered into conversation with him as he stopped at a low publichouse treating him to a pot of beer and having gained all i wanted as to the mysteries of the profession i called for another pot and proposed that i should purchase his whole concern down to his knife and apron the fellow agreed and after a good deal of bargaining i paid him three guineas for the set out or set up which you please he asked me whether i meant to hawk in london or not and i told him no that i should travel the country he advised the western road as there were more populous towns in it well we had another pot to clench the bargain and i paid down the money and took possession quite delighted with my new occupation away i went to brentford selling a bit here and there by the way and at last arrived at the very bench where we had sat down together and eaten our meal it is strange that i did the same and a very unlucky bench it proved to me so it did to me as you shall hear i had taken up my quarters at that inn and for three days had done very well in brentford on the third evening i had just come back it was nearly dusk and i took my seat on the bench thinking of you my dog rather tired was lying down before the cart when all of a sudden i heard a sharp whistle the dog sprang on his legs immediately and ran off several yards before i could prevent him the whistle was repeated and away went the dog and cart like lightning i ran as fast as i could but could not overtake him and i perceived that his old master was running ahead of the dog as hard as he could and this was the reason why the dog was off still i should i think have overtaken him but an old woman coming out of a door with a saucepan to pour the hot water into the gutter i knocked her down and tumbled right over her into a cellar without steps there i was and before i could climb out again man dog cart cats meat and dogs meat had all vanished and i have never seen them since the rascal got clear off and i was a bankrupt so much for my first set up in business you forgot to purchase the goodwill when you made your bargain timothy for the stock in trade very true japhet however after receiving a very fair share of abuse from the old woman and a plaister of hot greens in my facefor she went supperless to bed rather than not have her revengei walked back to the inn and sat down in the tap the two men next to me were hawkers one carried a large pack of dimities and calicoes and the other a box full of combs needles tapes scissors knives and mockgold trinkets i entered into conversation with them and as i again stood treat i soon was very intimate they told me what their profits were and how they contrived to get on and i thought for a rambling life it was by no means an unpleasant one so having obtained all the information i required i went back to town took out a hawkers licence for which i paid two guineas and purchasing at a shop to which they gave me a direction a pretty fair quantity of articles in the tape and scissor line off i set once more on my travels i took the north road this time and picked up a very comfortable subsistence selling my goods for a few halfpence here and a few halfpence there at the cottages as i passed by but i soon found out that without a newspaper i was not a confirmed hawker and the more radical the newspaper the better a newspaper will pay half the expenses of a hawker if he can read at every house particularly every small hedge alehouse he is received and placed in the best corner of the chimney and has his board and lodging with the exception of what he drinks gratis if he will pull out the newspaper and read it to those around him who cannot read particularly if he can explain what is unintelligible now i became a great politician and moreover a great radical for such were the politics of all the lower classes i lived well slept well and sold my wares very fast i did not take more than three shillings in the day yet as two out of the three were clear profit i did pretty well however a little accident happened which obliged me to change my profession or at least the nature of the articles which i dealt in what was that a mere trifle i had arrived late at a small alehouse had put up my pack which was in a painted deal box on the table in the taproom and was very busy after reading a paragraph in the newspaper making a fine speech which i always found was received with great applause and many shakes of the hand as a prime good fellowa speech about community of rights agrarian division and the propriety of an equal distribution of property proving that as we were all born alike no one had a right to have more property than his neighbour the people had all gathered round me applauding violently when i thought i might as well look after my pack which had been for some time hidden from my sight by the crowd when to my mortification i found out that my earnest assertions on the propriety of community of property had had such an influence upon some of my listeners that they had walked off with my pack and its contents unfortunately i had deposited in my boxes all my money considering it safer there than in my pockets and had nothing left but about seventeen shillings in silver which i had received within the last three days every one was very sorry but no one knew anything about it and when i challenged the landlord as answerable he called me a radical blackguard and turned me out of the door if you had looked a little more after your own property and interfered less with that of other people you would have done better tim observed i laughing very true but at all events i have never been a radical since replied tim but to go on i walked off to the nearest town and i commenced in a more humble way i purchased a basket and then with the remainder of my money i bought the commonest crockery ware such as basins jugs mugs and putting them on my head off i went again upon my new speculation i wandered about with my crockery but it was hard work i could not reap the profits which i did as a hawker and pedlar i averaged however from seven to nine shillings a week and that was about sufficient for my support i went down into as many kitchens as would have sufficed to have found a dozen mothers supposing mine to be a cook but i did not see anyone who was at all like me sometimes a cook replaced a basin she had broken by giving me as much meat as had cost her mistress five shillings and thus avoided a scolding for an article which was worth only twopence at other times a cottager would give me a lodging and would consider himself rewarded with a mug that only cost me one penny i was more than three months employed carrying crockery in every direction and never during the whole time broke one article until one day as i passed through eton there was a regular smash of the whole concern indeed how was that i met about a dozen of the eton boys and they proposed a cockshy as they called it that is i was to place my articles on the top of a post and they were to throw stones at them at a certain distance paying me a certain sum for each throw well this i thought a very good bargain so i put up a mug worth one penny at one penny a throw it was knocked down at the second shot so it was just as well to put the full price upon them at once they were such remarkably good aimers at anything each boy had a stick upon which i notched off their throws and how much they would have to pay when all was over one article after another was put on the post until my basket was empty and then i wanted to settle with them but as soon as i talked about that they all burst out into a loud laugh and took to their heels i chased them but one might as well have chased eels if i got hold of one the others pulled me behind until he escaped and at last they were all off and i had nothing left not your basket no not even that for while i was busy after some that ran one way the others kicked my basket before them like a football until it was fairly out of sight i had only eightpence in my pocket so you perceive japhet how i was going down in the world you were indeed tim chapter lxviii timothy finishes his narrative well i walked away cursing all the eton boys and all their tutors who did not teach them honesty as well as latin and greek and put up at a very humble sort of abode where they sold small beer and gave beds at twopence per night and i may add with plenty of fleas in the bargain there i fell in with some ballad singers and mumpers who were making very merry and who asked me what was the matter i told them how i had been treated and they laughed at me but gave me some supper so i forgave them an old man who governed the party then asked me whether i had any money i produced my enormous capital of eightpence quite enough if you are clever said he quite enoughmany a man with half that sum has ended in rolling in his carriage a man with thousands has only the advance of you a few years you will pay for your lodging and then spend this sixpence in matches and hawk them about the town if you are lucky it will be a shilling by tomorrow night besides you go down into areas and sometimes enter a kitchen when the cook is above stairs there are plenty of things to be picked up but i am not dishonest said i well then every man to his liking only if you were you would ride in your own coach the sooner and suppose i should lose all this or none would buy my matches what then replied i i shall starve starveno nono one starves in this country all you have to do is to get into gaolcommitted for a monthyou will live better perhaps than you ever did before i have been in every gaol in england and i know the good ones for even in gaols there is a great difference now the one in this town is one of the best in all england and i patronises it during the winter i was much amused with the discourse of this mumper who appeared to be one of the merriest old vagabonds in england i took his advice bought six pennyworth of matches and commenced my new vagrant speculation the first day i picked up threepence for one quarter of my stock and returned to the same place where i had slept the night before but the fraternity had quitted on an expedition i spent my twopence in bread and cheese and paid one penny for my lodging and again i started the next morning but i was very unsuccessful nobody appeared to want matches that day and after walking from seven oclock in the morning to past seven in the evening without selling one farthings worth i sat down at the porch of a chapel quite tired and worn out at last i fell asleep and how do you think i was awoke by a strong sense of suffocation and up i sprang coughing and nearly choked surrounded with smoke some mischievous boys perceiving that i was fast asleep had set fire to my matches as i held them in my hand between my legs and i did not wake until my fingers were severely burnt there was an end of my speculation in matches because there was an end of all my capital my poor timothy i really feel for you not at all my dear japhet i never in all my distress was sentenced to executionmy miseries were trifles to be laughed at however i felt very miserable at the time and walked off thinking about the propriety of getting into gaol as soon as i could for the beggar had strongly recommended it i was at the outskirts of the town when i perceived two men tussling with one another and i walked towards them i says says one who appeared to be a constable you must come along with i dont you see that ere board all wagrants shall be taken up and dealt with according to la now may the devil hold you in his claws you old psalmsinging thiefant i a sailorand ant i a wagrant by profession and all according to law that wont do says the other i commands you in the kings name to let me take you to prison and i commands you also young man says hefor i had walked up to themi commands you as a lawful subject to assist me what will you give the poor fellow for his trouble said the sailor its his duty as a lawful subject and ill give him nothing but ill put him in prison if he dont then you old rhinoceros ill give him five shillings if hell help me and so now he may take his choice at all events thought i this will turn out lucky one way or the other but i will support the man who is most generous so i went up to the constable who was a burly sort of a fellow and tripped up his heels and down he came on the back of his head you know my old trick japhet yes i never knew you fail at that well the sailor says to me ive a notion youve damaged his upper works so let us start off and clap on all sail for the next town i know where to drop an anchor come along with me and as long as ive a shot in the locker dn me if i wont share it with one who has proved a friend in need the constable did not come to his senses he was very much stunned but we loosened his neckcloth and left him there and started off as fast as we could my new companion who had a wooden leg stopped by a gate and clambered over it we must lose no time said he and i may just as well have the benefit of both legs so saying he took off his wooden stump and let down his real leg which was fixed up just as you saw mine i made no comments but off we set and at a good round pace gained a village about five miles distant here we will put up for the night but they will look for us tomorrow at daylight or a little after therefore we must be starting early i know the lawbeggars well they wont turn out afore sunrise he stopped at a paltry alehouse where we were admitted and soon were busy with a much better supper than i had ever imagined they could have produced but my new friend ordered right and left with a tone of authority and everybody in the house appeared at his beck and command after a couple of glasses of grog we retired to our beds the next morning we started before break of day on our road to another town where my companion said the constables would never take the trouble to come after him on our way he questioned me as to my mode of getting my livelihood and i narrated how unfortunate i had been one good turn deserves another replied the sailor and now ill set you up in trade can you sing have you anything of a voice i cant say that i have replied i i dont mean whether you can sing in tune or have a good voice thats no consequence all i want to know is have you a good loud one loud enough if thats all thats all thats requisite so long as you can make yourself heardyou may then howl like a jackal or bellow like a mad buffalo no matter whichas many pay us for to get rid of us as out of charity and so long as the money comes whats the odds why i once knew an old chap who could only play one tune on the clarionet and that tune out of all tune who made his fortune in six or seven streets for every one gave him money and told him to go away when he found out that he came every morning as regular as clockwork now there was one of the streets which was chiefly occupied by musicsellers and italian singersfor them foreigners always herd togetherand this tune which the old cow died of as the saying is used to be their horror and out came the halfpence to send him away there was a sort of club also in that street of larking sort of young men and when they perceived that the others gave the old man money to get rid of his squeaking they sent him out money with orders to stay and play to them so then the others sent out more for him to go away and between the two the old fellow brought home more money than all the cadgers and mumpers in the district now if you have a loud voice i can provide you with all the restdo you gain your livelihood by that to be sure i do and i can tell you that of all the trades going there is none equal to it you see my hearty i have been on board of a manofwarnot that im a sailor or was ever bred to the seabut i was shipped as a landsman and did duty in the waist and afterguard i know little or nothing of my duty as a seaman nor was it required in the station i was in so i never learnt although i was four years on board all i learnt was the lingo and slangand that you must contrive to learn from me i bolted and made my way good to lunnun but i should soon have been picked up and put on board the tender again if i hadnt got this wooden stump made which i now carry in my hand i had plenty of songs and i commenced my profession and a real good un it is i can tell you why do you know that ater a good victory i have sometimes picked up as much as two pounds aday for weeks running as it is i averages from fifteen shillings to a pound now as you helped me away from that land shark who would soon have found out that i had two legs and have put me into limbo as an impostor i will teach you to arn your livelihood after my fashion you shall work with me until you are fit to start alone and then theres plenty of room in england for both of us but mind never tell any one what you pick up or every mumper in the island will put on a suit of sailors clothes and the thing will be blown upon of course this was too good an offer to be rejected and i joyfully acceded at first i worked with him as having only one arm the other being tied down to my side and my jacket sleeve hanging loose and empty and we roared away right and left so as to bring down a shower of coppers wherever we went in about three weeks my friend thought i was able to start by myself and giving me half of the ballads and five shillings to start with i shook hands and parted with next to you the best friend that i certainly ever had ever since i have been crossing the country in every direction with plenty of money in my pocket and always with one eye looking sharp out for you my beautiful voice fortunately attracted your attention and here i am and at an end of my history but if ever i am away from you and in distress again depend upon it i shall take to my wooden leg and ballads for my support such were the adventures of timothy who was metamorphosed into a precise quaker i do not like the idea of your taking up a system of deceit timothy it may so happenfor who knows what may occurthat you may again be thrown upon your own resources now would it not be better that you should obtain a more intimate knowledge of the profession which we are now in which is liberal and equally profitable by attention and study you will be able to dispense medicines and make up prescriptions as well as myself and who knows but that some day you may be the owner of a shop like this verily verily thy words do savour of much wisdom replied tim in a grave voice and i will even so follow thy advice chapter lxix i am unsettled by unexpected intelligence and again yearn after the world of fashion i knew that he was mocking me in this reply but i paid no attention to that i was satisfied that he consented i now made him assist me and under my directions he made up the prescriptions i explained to him the nature of every medicine and i made him read many books of physic and surgery in short after two or three months i could trust to timothy as well as if i were in the shop myself and having an errand boy i had much more leisure and i left him in charge after dinner the business prospered and i was laying up money my leisure time i hardly need say was spent with mr cophagus and his family and my attachment to susannah temple increased every day indeed both mr and mrs cophagus considered that it was to be a match and often joked with me when susannah was not present with respect to susannah i could not perceive that i was farther advanced in her affections than after i had known her two months she was always kind and considerate evidently interested in my welfare always checking in me anything like levityfrank and confiding in her opinionsand charitable to all as i thought except to me but i made no advance that i could perceive the fact was that i dared not speak to her as i might have done to another who was not so perfect and yet she smiled as i thought more kindly when i returned than at other times and never appeared to be tired of my company if i did sometimes mention the marriage of another or attentions paid which would in all probability end in marriage it would create no confusion or blushing on her part she would talk over that subject as composedly as any other i was puzzled and i had been a year and nine months constantly in her company and had never dared to tell her that i loved her but one day mr cophagus brought up the subject when we were alone he commenced by stating how happy he had been as a married man that he had given up all hopes of a family and that he should like to see susannah temple his sisterinlaw well married that he might leave his property to her children and then he put the very pertinent questionjaphet verilythou hast done wellgood businessmoney coming in fastsettle japhetmarry have childrenand so on susannahnice girlgood wifepop questionall rightsly pusswont say noumwhat dye sayand so on i replied that i was very much attached to susannah but that i was afraid that the attachment was not mutual and therefore hesitated to propose cophagus then said that he would make his wife sound his sister and let me know the result this was in the morning just before i was about to walk over to the shop and i left the house in a state of anxiety and suspense when i arrived at the shop i found tim there as usual but the colour in his face was heightened as he said to me read this japhet and handed to me the reading mercury i read an advertisement as follows if japhet newland who was left at the foundling asylum and was afterwards for some time in london will call at no throgmorton court minories he will hear of something very much to his advantage and will discover that of which he has been so long in search should this reach his eye he is requested to write immediately to the above address with full particulars of his situation should anyone who reads this be able to give any information relative to the said jn he will be liberally rewarded i sank down on the chair merciful heaven this can be no mistakehe will discover the object of his search timothy my dear timothy i have at last found out my father so i should imagine my dear japhet replied timothy and i trust it will not prove a disappointment they never would be so cruel timothy replied i but still it is evident that mr masterton is concerned in it observed timothy why so inquired i how otherwise should it appear in the reading newspaper he must have examined the postmark of my letter to explain this i must remind the reader that timothy had promised to write to mr masterton when he found me and he requested my permission shortly after we had met again i consented to his keeping his word but restricted him to saying any more than that he had found me and that i was well and happy there was no address in the letter as a clue to mr masterton as to where i might be and it could only have been from the postmark that he could have formed any idea timothys surmise was therefore very probable but i would not believe that mr masterton would consent to the insertion of that portion of the advertisement if there was no foundation for it what will you do japhet do replied i recovering from my reverie for the information had again roused up all my dormant feelingsdo replied i why i shall set off for town this very morning in that dress japhet i suppose i must replied i for i have no time to procure another and all my former ideas of fashion and appearance were roused and in full activitymy pride recovered its ascendency well replied timothy i hope you will find your father all that you could wish im sure of it timim sure of it replied i you must run and take a place in the first coach but you are not going without seeing mr and mrs cophagus andmiss temple continued tim laying an emphasis upon the latter name of course not replied i colouring deeply i will go at once give me the newspaper tim i took the newspaper and hastened to the house of mr cophagus i found them all three sitting in the breakfast parlour mr cophagus as usual reading with his spectacles on his nose and the ladies at work what is the matter friend japhet exclaimed mr cophagus as i burst into the room my countenance lighted up with excitement read that sir said i to mr cophagus mr cophagus read it humbad newslose japhetman of fashionand so on said cophagus pointing out the paragraph to his wife as he handed over the paper in the meantime i watched the countenance of susannaha slight emotion but instantly checked was visible at mr cophaguss remark she then remained quiet until her sister who had read the paragraph handed the paper to her i give thee joy japhet at the prospect of finding out thy parent said mrs cophagus i trust thou wilt find in him one who is to be esteemed as a man when departest thou immediately replied i i cannot blame theethe ties of nature are ever powerful i trust that thou wilt write to us and that we soon shall see thee return yes yes said cophagus see fathershake handscome backheh settle hereand so on i shall not be altogether my own master perhaps observed i if my father desires that i remain with him must not i obey but i know nothing at present you shall hear from me timothy can take my place in the i could not bear the idea of the word shop and i stopped susannah for the first time looked me earnestly in the face but she said nothing mr and mrs cophagus who probably had been talking over the subject of our conversation and thought this a good opportunity to allow me to have an eclaircissement with susannah left the room saying they would look after my portmanteau and linen susannah said i you do not appear to rejoice with me japhet newland i will rejoice at everything that may tend to thy happiness believe me but i do not feel assured but that this trial may prove too great and that thou mayst fall away indeed i perceive even now that thou art excited with new ideas and visions of pride if i am wrong forgive me susannah you must know that the whole object of my existence has been to find my father and now that i have every reason to suppose that my wish is obtained can you be surprised or can you blame me that i long to be pressed in his arms nay japhet for that filial feeling i do commend thee but ask thy own heart is that the only feeling which now exciteth thee dost thou not expect to find thy father one high in rank and power dost thou not anticipate to join once more the world which thou hast quitted yet still hast sighed for dost thou not already feel contempt for thy honest professionnay more dost thou not only long to cast off the plain attire and not only the attire but the sect which in thy adversity thou didst embrace the tenets of ask thy own heart and reply if thou wilt but i press thee not so to do for the truth would be painful and a lie thou knowest i do utterly abhor i felt that susannah spoke the truth and i would not deny it i sat down by her susannah said i it is not very easy to change at once i have mixed for years in the world with you i have not yet lived two i will not deny but that the feelings you have expressed have risen in my heart but i will try to repress them at least for your sake susannah i would try to repress them for i value your opinion more than that of the whole world you have the power to do with me as you pleasewill you exert that power japhet replied susannah the faith which is not built upon a more solid foundation than to win the favour of an erring being like myself is but weak that power over thee which thou expectest will fix thee in the right path may soon be lost and what is then to direct thee if no purer motives than earthly affection are to be thy stay most surely thou wilt fall but no more of this thou hast a duty to perform which is to go to thy earthly father and seek his blessing nay more i would that thou shouldst once more enter into the world there thou mayst decide shouldst thou return to us thy friends will rejoice and not one of them will be more joyful than susannah temple fare thee well japhet mayst thou prove superior to temptation i will pray for theeearnestly i will pray for thee japhet continued susannah with a quivering of her lips and broken voice and she left the room chapter lxx i return to london and meet with mr masterton i went upstairs and found that all was ready and i took leave of mr and mrs cophagus both of whom expressed their hopes that i would not leave them for ever oh no replied i i should indeed be base if i did i left them and with ephraim following with my portmanteau i quitted the house i had gone about twenty yards when i recollected that i had left on the table the newspaper with the advertisement containing the direction whom to apply to and desiring ephraim to proceed i returned when i entered the parlour susannah temple was resting her face in her hands and weeping the opening of the door made her start up she perceived that it was i and she turned away i beg your pardon i left the newspaper said i stammering i was about to throw myself at her feet declare my sincere affection and give up all idea of finding my father until we were married when she without saying a word passed quickly by me and hastened out of the room she loves me then thought i thank godi will not go yet i will speak to her first i sat down quite overpowered with contending feelings the paper was in my hand the paragraph was again read i thought but of my father and i left the house in half an hour i had shaken hands with timothy and quitted the town of reading how i arrived in london that is to say what passed or what we passed i know not my mind was in such a state of excitement i hardly know how to express the state that i was in it was a sort of mental whirling which blinded meround and roundfrom my father and the expected meeting then to susannah my departure and her tearscastle building of every description after the coach stopped there i remained fixed on the top of it not aware that we were in london until the coachman asked me whether the spirit did not move me to get down i recollected myself and calling a hackneycoach gave orders to be driven to the piazza covent garden piazza common garden said the waterman why that bant an otel for the like o you master theyll torment you to death them young chaps i had forgotten that i was dressed as a quaker tell the coachman to stop at the first cloth warehouse where they have readymade cloaks said i the man did so i went out and purchased a roquelaure which enveloped my whole person i then stopped at a hatters and purchased a hat according to the mode now drive to the piazza said i entering the coach i know not why but i was resolved to go to that hotel it was the one i had stayed at when i first arrived in london and i wished to see it again when the hackney coach stopped i asked the waiter who came out whether he had apartments and answering me in the affirmative i followed him and was shown into the same rooms i had previously occupied these will do said i now let me have something to eat and send for a good tailor the waiter offered to remove my cloak but i refused saying that i was cold he left the room and i threw myself on the sofa running over all the scenes which had passed in that room with carbonnell harcourt and others my thoughts were broken in upon by the arrival of the tailor stop a moment said i and let him come in when i ring so ashamed was i of my quakers dress that i threw off my coat and waistcoat and put on my cloak again before i rang the bell for the tailor to come up mr said i i must have a suit of clothes ready by tomorrow at ten oclock impossible sir impossible said i and you pretend to be a fashionable tailor leave the room at this peremptory behaviour the tailor imagined that i must be somebody i will do my possible sir and if i can only get home in time to stop the workmen i think it may be managed of course you are aware of the expense of night work i am only aware of this that if i give an order i am accustomed to have it obeyed i learnt that from my poor friend major carbonnell the tailor bowed low there was magic in the name although the man was dead here have i been masquerading in a quakers dress to please a puritanical young lady and i am obliged to be off without any other clothes in my portmanteau so take my measure and i expect the clothes at ten precisely so saying i threw off my roquelaure and desired him to proceed this accomplished the tradesman took his leave shortly afterwards the door opened and as i lay wrapped up in my cloak on the sofa in came the landlord and two waiters each bearing a dish of my supper i wished them at the devil but i was still more surprised when the landlord made a low bow saying happy to see you returned mr newland youve been away some timeanother grand tour i presume yes mr i have had a few adventures since i was last here replied i carelessly but i am not very well you may leave the supper and if i feel inclined i will take a little byandbyeno one need wait the landlord and waiter bowed and went out of the room i turned the key of the door put on my quakers coat and made a hearty supper for i had had nothing since breakfast when i had finished i returned to the sofa and i could not help analysing my own conduct alas thought i susannah how rightly did you judge me i am not away from you more than eighteen hours and here i am ashamed of the dress which i have so long worn and been satisfied with in your society truly did you say that i was full of pride and would joyfully reenter the world of vanity and vexation and i thought of susannah and her tears after my supposed departure and i felt angry and annoyed at my want of strength of mind and my worldly feelings i retired early to bed and did not wake until late the next morning when i rang the bell the chambermaid brought in my clothes from the tailors i dressed and i will not deny that i was pleased with the alteration after breakfast i ordered a coach and drove to no throgmorton court minories the house was dirty outside and the windows had not been cleaned apparently for years and it was with some difficulty when i went in that i could decipher a tall haggardlooking man seated at the desk your pleasure sir said he am i speaking to the principal replied i yes sir my name is chatfield i come to you sir relative to an advertisement which appeared in the papers i refer to this continued i putting the newspaper down on the desk and pointing to the advertisement oh yes very true can you give us any information yes sir i can and the most satisfactory then sir i am sorry that you have had so much trouble but you must call at lincolns inn upon a lawyer of the name of masterton the whole affair is now in his hands can you sir inform me who is the party that is inquiring after this young man why yes it is a general de benyon who has lately returned from the east indies good god is it possible thought i how strange that my own wild fancy should have settled upon him as my father i hurried away threw myself into the hackneycoach and desired the man to drive to lincolns inn i hastened up to mr mastertons rooms he was fortunately at home although he stood at the table with his hat and his great coat on ready to go out my dear sir have you forgotten me said i in a voice choked with emotion taking his hand and squeezing it with rapture by heavens you are determined that i shall not forget you for some minutes at least exclaimed he wringing his hand with pain who the devil are you mr masterton could not see without his spectacles and my subdued voice he had not recognised he pulled them out as i made no reply and fixing them across his nosehah why yesit is japhet is it not it is indeed sir said i again offering my hand which he shook warmly not quite so hard my dear fellow this time said the old lawyer i acknowledge your vigour and that is sufficient i am very glad to see you japhet i am indeedyouyou scampyou ungrateful fellow sit downsit downfirst help me off with my great coat i presume the advertisement has brought you into existence again well its all true and you have at last found your father or rather he has found you and whats more strange you hit upon the right person that is strangevery strange indeed where is he sir interrupted i where is hetake me to him no rather be excused replied mr masterton for he is gone to ireland so you must wait wait sir oh noi must follow him that will only do harm for he is rather a queer sort of an old gentleman and although he acknowledges that he left you as japhet and has searched for you yet he is so afraid of somebody elses brat being put upon him that he insists upon most undeniable proofs now we cannot trace you from the hospital unless we can find that fellow cophagus and we have made every search after him and no one can tell where he is but i left him but yesterday morning sir replied i goodvery good we must send for him or go to him besides he has the packet intrusted to the care of miss maitland to whom he was executor which proves the marriage of your father very strangevery strange indeed that you should have hit upon it as you didalmost supernatural however all right now my dear boy and i congratulate you your father is a very strange person he has lived like a despot among slaves all his life and will not be thwarted i can tell you if you say a word in contradiction hell disinherit youterrible old tiger i must say if it had not been for your sake i should have done with him long ago he seems to think the world ought to be at his feet depend upon it japhet there is no hurry about seeing himand see him you shall not until we have every proof of your identity ready to produce to him i hope you have the bump of veneration strong japhet and plenty of filial duty or you will be kicked out of the house in a week dn me if he didnt call me an old thief of a lawyer indeed sir replied i laughing i must apologise to you for my fathers conduct never mind japhet i dont care about a trifle but why dont you ask after your friends i have longed so to do sir replied i lord windermear is quite well and will be most happy to see you lady de clare and her daughter lady de clare has entered into society again and her daughter as you call heryour fleta alias cecilia de clareis the belle of the metropolis but now sir as i have answered all your interrogatories and satisfied you upon the most essential points will you favour me with a narrative of your adventures for adventures i am sure you must have had since you ran away from us all in that ungrateful manner most certainly sir i will and as you say i have had adventures but it really will be a long story then well dine here and pass the evening togetherso thats settled chapter lxxi in which i am let into more particulars relative to my fathers history i dismissed the coach while mr masterton gave his orders for dinner and we then turned the key of the door to avoid intrusion and i commenced it was nearly dinnertime before i had finished my story well you really appear to be born for getting into scrapes and getting out of them again in a miraculous way observed mr masterton your life would make a novel it would indeed sir replied i i only hope like all novels it will wind up well so do i but dinners ready japhet and after dinner well talk the matter over again for there are some points upon which i require some explanation we sat down to dinner and when we had finished and the table had been cleared we drew to the fire with our bottle of wine mr masterton tirred the fire called for his slippers and then crossing his legs over the fender resumed the subject japhet i consider it most fortunate that we have met previous to our introduction to your father you have so far to congratulate yourself that your family is undeniably good there being as you know an irish peerage in it of which however you have no chance as the present earl has a numerous offspring you are also fortunate as far as money is concerned as i have every reason to believe that your father is a very rich man and of course you are his only child but i must now prepare you to meet with a very different person than perhaps the fond anticipations of youth may have led you to expect your father has no paternal feelings that i can discover he has wealth and he wishes to leave ithe has therefore sought you out but he is despotic violent and absurd the least opposition to his will makes him furious and i am sorry to add that i am afraid that he is very mean he suffered severely when young from poverty and his own father was almost as authoritative and unforgiving as himself and now i will state how it was that you were left at the asylum when an infant your grandfather had procured for your father a commission in the army and soon afterwards procured him a lieutenancy he ordered him to marry a young lady of large fortune whom he had never seen and sent for him for that purpose i understand that she was very beautiful and had your father seen her it is probable he would have made no objection but he very foolishly sent a peremptory refusal for which he was dismissed for ever in a short time afterwards your father fell in love with a young lady of great personal attractions and supposed to possess a large fortune to deceive her he pretended to be the heir to the earldom and after a hasty courtship they ran off and were married when they compared notes which they soon did it was discovered that on his side he had nothing but the pay of a subaltern and on hers that she had not one shilling your father stormed and called his wife an impostor she recriminated and the second morning after the marriage was passed in tears on her side and oaths curses and revilings on his the lady however appeared the more sensible party of the two their marriage was not known she had run away on a pretence to visit a relative and it was actually supposed in the county town where she resided that such was the case why should we quarrel in this way observed she you edmund wished to marry a fortune and not mei may plead guilty to the same duplicity we have made a mistake but it is not too late it is supposed that i am on a visit to and that you are on furlough for a few days did you confide your secret to any of your brother officers not one muttered your father well then let us part as if nothing had happened and nobody will be the wiser we are equally interested in keeping the secret is it agreedyour father immediately consented he accompanied your mother to the house at where she was expected and she framed a story for her delay by having met such a very polite young man your father returned to his regiment and thus did they like two privateers who when they meet and engage as soon as they find out their mistake hoist their colours and sheer off by mutual consent i cant say much for my mothers affection or delicacy observed i the less you say the better japhethowever that is your fathers story and now to proceed it appears that about two months afterwards your father received a letter from your mother acquainting him that their short intercourse had been productive of certain results and requesting that he would take the necessary steps to provide for the child and avoid exposure or that she would be obliged to confess her marriage by what means they contrived to avoid exposure until the period of her confinement i know not but your father states that the child was born in a house in london and by agreement was instantly put into his hands that he with the consent of his wife left you at the door of the asylum with the paper and the bank note from which you received the name of newland at the time he had no idea of reclaiming you himself but the mother had for heartless as she appears to have been yet a mother must feel for her child your fathers regiment was then ordered out to the east indies and he was rapidly promoted for his gallantry and good conduct during the war in the mysore territory once only has he returned home on furlough and then he did make inquiries after you not it appears with a view of finding you out on his own account but from a promise which he made your mother my mother what have they met since yes your mother went out to india on speculation passing off as a single girl and was very well married there i was going to say however she committed a very splendid bigamy good heavens how totally destitute of principle your father asserts that your mother was a freethinker japhet her father had made her one without religion a woman has no stay your father was in the up country during the time that your mother arrived and was married to one of the council of calcutta your father says that they met at a ball at government house she was still a very handsome woman and much admired when your father recognised her and was told that she was lately married to the honourable mr he was quite electrified and would have quitted the room but she had perceived him and walking up to him with the greatest coolness claimed him as an old acquaintance in england and afterwards they often met but she never adverted to what had passed between them until the time for his departure to england on leave and she then sent for him and begged that he would make some enquiries after you japhet he did so and you know the result on his return to india he found that your mother had been carried off by the prevailing pestilence at that period your father was not rich but he was then appointed to the chief command in the carnatic and reaped a golden harvest in return for his success and bravery it appears as far as i could obtain it from him that as long as your mother was alive he felt no interest about you but her death and the subsequent wealth which poured upon him have now induced him to find out an heir to whom it may be bequeathed such japhet are the outlines of your fathers history and i must point out that he has no feelings of affection for you at present the conduct of your mother is ever before him and if it were not that he wishes an heir i should almost say that his feelings are those of dislike you may create an interest in his heart it is true and he may be gratified by your personal appearance but you will have a very difficult task as you will have to submit to his caprices and fancies and i am afraid that to a high spirit like yours they will be almost unbearable really sir i begin to feel that the fondest anticipations are seldom realised and almost to wish that i had not been sought for by my father i was happy and contented and now i do not see any chance of having to congratulate myself on the change on one or two points i also wish to question you it appears that you have entered into the sect denominated quakers tell me candidly do you subscribe heartily and sincerely to their doctrines and i was going to add is it your intention to remain with them i perceive much difficulty in all this the tenets of the sect i certainly do believe to be more in accordance with the christian religion than any other and i have no hesitation in asserting from my knowledge of those who belong to that sect that they generally speaking lead better lives there are some points connected with their worship which at first i considered ridiculous the feeling has however worn off as to their quaint manner of speaking that has been grossly exaggerated their dress is a part of their religion why so japhet i can reply to you in the words of susannah temple when i made the same interrogatory you think the peculiarity of our dress is an outward form which is not required it was put on to separate us from others and as a proof that we had discarded vanity i am aware that it is not a proof of our sincerity but still the discarding of the dress is a proof of insincerity we consider that to admire the person is vain and our creed is humility it is therefore an outward and visible sign that we would act up to those tenets which we profess it is not all who wear the dress who are quakers in heart or conduct but we know that when it is put aside the tenets of our persuasion are at the same time renounced therefore do we consider it essential i do not mean to say but that the heart may be as pure and the faith continue as stedfast without such signs outwardly but it is a part of our creed and we must not choose but either reject all or none very well argued by the little quakeress and now japhet i should like to put another question to you are you very much attached to this young puritan i will not deny but that i am i love her sincerely does your love carry you so far that you would for her sake continue a quaker and marry her i have asked myself that question at least a hundred times during the last twentyfour hours and i cannot decide if she would dress as others do and allow me to do the same i would marry her tomorrow whether i shall ever make up my mind to adhere to the persuasion and live and die a quaker for her sake is quite another matterbut i am afraid noti am too worldlyminded the fact is i am in a very awkward position with respect to her i have never acknowledged my affection or asked for a return but she knows i love her and i know that she loves me like all vain boys you flatter yourself i leave you to judge sir replied i repeating to him our parting teteatete and how i had returned and found her in tears all that certainly is very corroborative evidence but tell me japhet do you think she loves you well enough to abandon all for your sake no nor ever will sir she is too high principled too highminded she might suffer greatly but she never would swerve from what she thought was right she must be a fine character japhet but you will be in a dilemma indeed it appears to me that your troubles are now commencing instead of ending and that you would have been much happier where you were than you will be by being again brought out into the world your prospect is not over cheerful you have an awkward father to deal with you will be under a strong check ive a notion and i am afraid you will find that notwithstanding you will be once more received into society all is vanity and vexation of spirit i am afraid you are right sir replied i but at all events it will be something gained to be acknowledged to the world by a father of good family whatever else i may have to submit to i have been the sport of fortune all my life and probably she has not yet done playing with me but it is late and i will now wish you goodnight goodnight japhet if i have any intelligence i will let you know lady de clares address is no park street you will of course go there as soon as you can i will sir after i have written my letters to my friends at reading chapter lxxii i am a little jealous and like the immortal williama bottom inclined to enact more parts than onewith a big effort my hankering after bigamy is mastered by mr mastertonand by my own good sense footnote a or rather nicked i returned home to reflect upon what mr masterton had told me and i must say that i was not very well pleased with his various information his account of my mother although she was no more distressed me and from the character which he gave of my father i felt convinced that my happiness would not be at all increased by my having finally attained the longdesired object of my wishes strange to say i had no sooner discovered my father but i wished that he had never turned up and when i compared the peaceful and happy state of existence which i had lately enjoyed with the prospects of what i had in future to submit to i bitterly repented that the advertisement had been seen by timothy still on one point i was peculiarly anxious without hardly daring to anatomise my feelings it was relative to cecilia de clare and what mr masterton had mentioned in the course of our conversation the next morning i wrote to timothy and to mr cophagus giving them a shortdetail of what i had been informed by mr masterton and expressing a wish which i then really did feel that i had never been summoned away from them having finished my letters i set off to park street to call upon lady de clare and cecilia it was rather early but the footman who opened the door recognised me and i was admitted upon his own responsibility it was now more than eighteen months since i had quitted their house at richmond and i was very anxious to know what reception i might have i followed the servant up stairs and when he opened the door walked in as my name was announced lady de clare rose in haste so did cecilia and so did a third person whom i had not expected to have metharcourt mr newland exclaimed lady de clare this is indeed unexpected cecilia also came forward blushing to the forehead harcourt held back as if waiting for the advances to be made on my side on the whole i never felt more awkwardly and i believe my feelings were reciprocated by the whole party i was evidently de trop do you know mr harcourt at last said lady de clare if it is the mr harcourt i once knew replied i i certainly do believe me it is the same newland said harcourt coming to me and offering his hand which i took with pleasure it is a long while since we met observed cecilia who felt it necessary to say something but at the same time did not like to enter upon my affairs before harcourt it is miss de clare replied i for i was not exactly pleased at my reception but i have been fortunate since i had the pleasure of seeing you last cecilia and her mother looked earnestly as much as to say in whatbut did not like to ask the question there is no one present who is not well acquainted with my history observed i that is until the time that i left you and lady de clare and i have no wish to create mystery i have at last discovered my father i hope we are to congratulate you mr newland said lady de clare as far as respectability and family are concerned i certainly have no reason to be ashamed replied i he is the brother of an earl and a general in the army his name i will not mention until i have seen him and i am formally and openly acknowledged i have also the advantage of being an only son and if i am not disinherited heir to considerable property continued i smiling sarcastically perhaps i may now be better received than i have been as japhet newland the foundling but lady de clare i am afraid that i have intruded unseasonably and will now take my leave good morning and without waiting for a reply i made a hasty retreat and gained the door flushed with indignation i had nearly gained the bottom of the stairs when i heard a light footstep behind me and my arm was caught by cecilia de clare i turned round and she looked me reproachfully in the face as the tear stood in her eye what have we done japhet that you should treat us in this manner said she with emotion miss de clare replied i i have no reproaches to make i perceived that my presence was not welcome and i would no further intrude are you then so proud now that you have found out that you are well born japhet i am much too proud to intrude where i am not wished for miss de clare as japhet newland i came here to see the fleta of former days when i assume my real name i shall always be most happy of an introduction to the daughter of lady de clare oh how changed exclaimed she fixing her large blue eyes upon me prosperity changes us all miss de clare i wish you a very good morning and i turned away and crossed the hall to the door as i went out i could not help looking back and i perceived that cecilias handkerchief was held to her eyes as she slowly mounted the stairs i walked home to the piazza in no very pleasant humour i was angry and disgusted at the coolness of my reception i thought myself ill used and treated with ingratitude so much for the world said i as i sat down in my apartment and spun my hat on the table she has been out two seasons and is no longer the same person yet how lovely she has grown but why this changeand why was harcourt there could he have prejudiced them against me very possibly while these ideas were running in my mind and i was making comparisons between cecilia de clare and susannah templenot much in favour of the formerand looking forward prospectively to the meeting with my father the doubts as to my reception in society colouring everything with the most sombre tints the door opened and in walked harcourt announced by the waiter a chair for mr harcourt said i to the waiter with formality newland said harcourt i come for two reasons in the first place i am commissioned by the ladies to assure you i beg your pardon mr harcourt for interrupting you but i require no ambassador from the ladies in question they may make you their confidant if they please but i am not at all inclined to do the same explanation after what i witnessed and felt this morning is quite unnecessary i surrender all claims upon either lady de clare or her daughter if i ever was so foolhardy as to imagine that i had any the first reason of your visit it is therefore useless to proceed with may i ask the other reason which has procured me this honour i hardly know mr newland replied harcourt colouring deeply whether after what you have now said i ought to proceed with the secondit related to myself i am all attention mr harcourt replied i bowing politely it was to say mr newland that i should have taken the earliest opportunity after my recovery had you not disappeared so strangely to have expressed my sorrow for my conduct towards you and to have acknowledged that i had been deservedly punished more perhaps by my own feelings of remorse than by the dangerous wound i had received by your hand i take even this opportunity although not apparently a favourable one of expressing what i consider it my duty as a gentleman who has wronged another to express i certainly was going to add more but there is so little chance of its being well received that i had better defer it to some future opportunity the time may come and i certainly trust it will come when i may be allowed to prove to you that i am not deserving of the coolness with which i am now received mr newland with every wish for your happiness i will now take my leave but i must say it is with painful sentiments as i feel that the result of this interview will be the cause of great distress to those who are bound to you not only by gratitude but sincere regard harcourt then bowed and quitted the room its all very well muttered i but i know the world and am not to be soothed down by a few fine words i trust that they will be sorry for their conduct but see me again inside their doors they will not and i sat down trying to feel satisfied with myselfbut i was not i felt that i had acted harshly to say no more i ought to have listened to an explanation sent by cecilia and her mother after her coming down stairs to expostulate they were under great obligations to me and by my quick resentment i rendered the obligations more onerous it was unkind of meand i wished that harcourt had not left the room as for his conduct i tried to find fault with it but could not it was gentlemanly and feeling the fact was i was in a very bad humour and could not at the time discover the reason which was neither more nor less than that i was more jealous of finding harcourt so intimate at lady de clares than i was at the unpalatable reception which i had met with the waiter came in and brought me a note from mr masterton i have this morning received a summons from your father who returned it appears two days ago and is now at the adelphi hotel i am sorry to say that stepping out of his carriage when travelling he missed his footing and has snapped his tendon achilles he is laid up on a couch and as you may suppose his amiability is not increased by the accident and the pain attending it as he has requested me to bring forward immediate evidence as to your identity and the presence of mr cophagus is necessary i propose that we start for reading tomorrow at nine oclock i have a curiosity to go down there and having a leisure day or two it will be a relaxation i wish to see my old acquaintance timothy and your shop answer by bearer j masterton i wrote a few lines informing mr masterton that i would be with him at the appointed hour and then sat down to my solitary meal how different from when i was last at this hotel now i knew nobody i had to regain my footing in society and that could only be accomplished by being acknowledged by my father and as soon as that was done i would call upon lord windermear who would quickly effect what i desired the next morning i was ready at nine oclock and set off with post horses with mr masterton in his own carriage i told him what had occurred the day before and how disgusted i was at my reception upon my word japhet i think you are wrong replied the old gentleman and if you had not told me of your affection for miss temple to see whom bythebye i confess to be one of the chief motives of my going down with you i should almost suppose that you were blinded by jealousy does it not occur to you that if mr harcourt was admitted to the ladies at such an early hour there is preference shown him in that quarter and now i recollect that i heard something about it harcourts elder brother died and hes come into the property and i heard somebody say that he would in all probability succeed in gaining the handsomest girl in london with a large fortunethat it was said to be a match now if such be the case and you broke in upon a quiet reunion between two young people about to be united almost without announcement and so unexpectedly after a lapse of so long a time surely you cannot be surprised at there being a degree of confusion and restraintmore especially after what had passed between harcourt and you depend upon it that was the cause of it had lady de clare and her daughter been alone your reception would have been very different indeed cecilias following you down stairs proves that it was not from coolness towards you and harcourt calling upon you and the conversation which took place is another proof that you have been mistaken i never viewed it in that light certainly sir observed i i merely perceived that i was considered intrusive and finding in the company one who had treated me ill and had been my antagonist in the field i naturally supposed that he had prejudiced them against me i hope i may be wrong but i have seen so much of the world young as i am that i have become very suspicious then discard suspicion as fast as you can it will only make you unhappy and not prevent your being deceived if you are suspicious you will have the constant fear of deception hanging over you which poisons existence after these remarks i remained silent for some time i was analysing my own feelings and i felt that i had acted in a very absurd manner the fact was that one of my castle buildings had been that i was to marry fleta as soon as i had found my own father and this it was which had actuated me almost without my knowing it i felt jealous of harcourt and that without being in love with miss de clare but actually passionately fond of another person i felt as if i could have married her without loving her and that i could give up susannah temple whom i did love rather than that a being whom i considered as almost of my own creation should herself presume to fall in love or that another should dare to love her until i had made up my mind whether i should take her myself and this after so long an absence and their having given up all hopes of ever seeing me again the reader may smile at the absurdity still more at the selfishness of this feeling so did i when i had reflected upon it and i despised myself for my vanity and folly what are you thinking of japhet observed mr masterton tired with my long abstraction that i have been making a most egregious fool of myself sir replied i with respect to the de clares i did not say so japhet but to tell you the truth i thought something very like it now tell me were you not jealous at finding her in company with harcourt exactly so sir ill tell susannah temple when i see her that she may form some idea of your constancy replied mr masterton smiling why what a dog in the manger you must beyou cant marry them both still under the circumstances i can analyse the feelingit is natural but all that is natural is not always creditable to human nature let us talk a little about susannah and then all these vagaries will be dispersed how old is she mr masterton plied me with so many questions relative to susannah that her image alone soon filled my mind and i recovered my spirits i dont know what she will say at my being in this dress sir observed i had i not better change it on my arrival by no means ill fight your battlei know her character pretty well thanks to your raving about her chapter lxxiii contains much learned argument upon broadbrims and garments of greyi get the best of itthe one great wish of my life is grantedi meet my father and a cold reception very indicative of much afterheat we arrived in good time at reading and as soon as we alighted at the inn we ordered dinner and then walked down to the shop where we found timothy very busy tying down and labelling he was delighted to see mr masterton and perceiving that i had laid aside the quakers dress made no scruple of indulging in his humour making a long face and theeing and thouing mr masterton in a very absurd manner we desired him to go to mr cophagus and beg that he would allow me to bring mr masterton to drink tea and afterwards to call at the inn and give us the answer we then returned to our dinner whether they will ever make a quaker of you japhet i am very doubtful observed mr masterton as we walked back but as for making one of that fellow timothy ill defy them he laughs at everything replied i and views everything in a ridiculous lightat all events they never will make him serious in the evening we adjourned to the house of mr cophagus having received a message of welcome i entered the room first susannah came forward to welcome me and then drew back when she perceived the alteration in my apparel colouring deeply i passed her and took the hand of mrs cophagus and her husband and then introduced mr masterton we hardly knew thee japhet mildly observed mrs cophagus i did not think that outward garments would disguise me from my friends replied i but so it appeareth for your sister hath not even greeted me in welcome i greet thee in all kindness and all sincerity japhet newland replied susannah holding out her hand yet did i not imagine that in so short a time thou wouldst have dismissed the apparel of our persuasion neither do i find it seemly miss temple interposed mr masterton it is to oblige those who are his sincere friends that mr newland has laid aside his dress i quarrel with no creedevery one has a right to choose for himself and mr newland has perhaps not chosen badly in embracing your tenets let him continue steadfast in them but fair young lady there is no creed which is perfect and even in yours we find imperfection our religion preaches humility and therefore we do object to his wearing the garb of pride of pride sayest thou hath he not rather put off the garb of humility and now appeareth in the garb of pride not so young madam when we dress as all the world dress we wear not the garb of pride but when we put on a dress different from others that distinguishes us from others then we show our pride and the worst of pride for it is the hypocritical pride which apes humility it is the pharisee of the scriptures who preaches in high places and sounds forth his charity to the poor not the humility of the publican who says lord be merciful to me a sinner your apparel of pretended humility is the garb of pride and for that reason have we insisted that he discards it when with us his tenets we interfere not with there can be no religion in dress and that must indeed be weak in itself which requires dress for its support susannah was astonished at this new feature of the case so aptly put by the old lawyer mrs cophagus looked at her husband and cophagus pinched my arm evidently agreeing with him when mr masterton had finished speaking susannah waited a few seconds and then replied it becomes not one so young and weak as i am to argue with thee who art so much my senior i cannot cavil at opinions which if not correct at least are founded on the holy writings but i have been otherwise instructed then let us drop the argument miss susannah and let me tell you that japhet wished to resume his quakers dress and i would not permit him if there is any blame it is to be laid to me and its no use being angry with an old man like myself i have no right to be angry with anyone replied susannah but you were angry with me susannah interrupted i i cannot say that it was anger japhet newland i hardly know what the feeling might have been but i was wrong and i must request thy forgiveness and susannah held out her hand now you must forgive me too miss temple said old masterton and susannah laughed against her wishes the conversation then became general mr masterton explained to mr cophagus what he required of him and mr cophagus immediately acceded it was arranged that he should go to town by the mail the next day mr masterton talked a great deal about my father and gave his character in its true light as he considered it would be advantageous to me so to do he then entered into conversation upon a variety of topics and was certainly very amusing susannah laughed very heartily before the evening was over and mr masterton retired to the hotel for i had resolved to sleep in my own bed i walked home with mr masterton i then returned to the house and found them all in the parlour mrs cophagus was expressing her delight at the amusement she had received when i entered with a grave face i wish that i had not left you said i to mrs cophagus i am afraid to meet my father he will exact the most implicit obedience what am i to do must not i obey him in all things lawful replied susannah most certainly japhet in all things lawful susannah now tell me in the very case of my apparel mr masterton says that he never will permit me to wear the dress what am i to do thou hast thy religion and thy bible for thy guide japhet i have and in the bible i find written on tablets of stone by the prophet of god honour thy father and thy mother there is a positive commandment but i find no commandment to wear this or that dress what think you continued i appealing to them all i should bid thee honour thy father japhet replied mrs cophagus and you susannah i shall bid thee goodnight japhet at this reply we all laughed and i perceived there was a smile on susannahs face as she walked away mrs cophagus followed her laughing as she went and cophagus and i were alone well japhetsee old gentlemankissshake handsand blessingand so on yes sir replied i but if he treats me ill i shall probably come down here again i am afraid that susannah is not very well pleased with me pooh nonsensewife knows alldie for youjaphet do as you pleasedress yourselfdress herany dressno dress like evesly pusswont lose youall rightand so on i pressed mr cophagus to tell me all he knew and i found from him that his wife had questioned susannah soon after my departure had found her weeping and that she had gained from her the avowal of her ardent affection for me this was all i wanted and i wished him goodnight and went to bed happy i had an interview with susannah temple before i left the next morning and although i never mentioned love had every reason to be satisfied she was kind and affectionate spoke to me in her usual serious manner warned me against the world acknowledged that i should have great difficulties to surmount and even made much allowance for my peculiar situation she dared not advise but she would pray for me there was a greater show of interest and confidence towards me than i had ever yet received from her when i parted from her i said dear susannah whatever change may take place in my fortunes or in my dress believe me my heart shall not be changed and i shall ever adhere to those principles which have been instilled into me since i have been in your company this was a phrase which admitted of a double meaning and she replied i should wish to see thee perfect japhet but there is no perfection now on earth be therefore as perfect as you can god bless you susannah may the blessing of the lord be on you always japhet replied she i put my arm round her waist and slightly pressed her to my bosom she gently disengaged herself and her large eyes glistened with tears as she left the room in a quarter of an hour i was with mr masterton on the road to london japhet said the old gentleman i will say that you have been very wise in your choice and that your little quaker is a most lovely creature i am in love with her myself and i think that she is far superior in personal attractions to cecilia de clare indeed sir yes indeed her face is more classical and her complexion is unrivalled as far as my present knowledge and experience go she is an emblem of purity her mind sir is as pure as her person i believe it she has a strong mind and will think for herself there sir is i am afraid the difficulty she will not yield a point in which she thinks she is right not even for her love for me i agree with you that she will not and i admire her for it but japhet she will yield to conviction and depend upon it she will abandon the outward observances of her persuasion did you observe what a spoke i put in your wheel last night when i stated that outward forms were pride leave that to work and ill answer for the consequences she will not long wear that quakers dress how beautiful she would be if she dressed like other people i think i see her now entering a ballroom but what occasions you to think she will abandon her persuasion i do not say that she will abandon it nor do i wish her to do it nor do i wish you to do it japhet there is much beauty and much perfection in the quakers creed all that requires to be abandoned are the dress and the ceremonies of the meetings which are both absurdities recollect that miss temple has been brought up as a quaker she has from the exclusiveness of the sect known no other form of worship and never heard any opposition to that which has been inculcated but let her once or twice enter the established church hear its beautiful ritual and listen to a sound preacher let her be persuaded to do that which cannot be asking her to do wrong and then let her think and act for herself and my word for it when she draws the comparison between what she has then heard and the nonsense occasionally uttered in the quakers conventicle by those who fancy themselves inspired she will herself feel that although the tenets of her persuasion may be more in accordance with true christianity than those of other sects the outward forms and observances are imperfect i trust to her own good sense you make me very happy by saying so well that is my opinion of her and if she proves me to be correct hang me if i dont think i shall adopt her what do you think of mrs cophagus sir i think she is no more a quaker in her heart than i am she is a lively merry kindhearted creature and would have no objection to appear in feathers and diamonds tomorrow well sir i can tell you that mr cophagus still sighs after his blue cottonnet pantaloons and hessian boots more fool he but however i am glad of it for it gives me an idea which i shall work upon byandbye at present we have this eventful meeting between you and your father to occupy us we arrived in town in time for dinner which mr masterton had ordered at his chambers as the old gentleman was rather tired with his two days travelling i wished him goodnight at an early hour recollect japhet we are to be at the adelphi hotel tomorrow at one oclockcome in time i called upon mr masterton at the time appointed on the ensuing day and we drove to the hotel in which my father had located himself on our arrival we were ushered into a room on the ground floor where we found mr cophagus and two of the governors of the foundling hospital really mr masterton said one of the latter gentlemen one would think that we were about to have an audience with a sovereign prince and instead of conferring favours were about to receive them my time is precious i ought to have been in the city this half hour and here is this old nabob keeping us waiting as if we were petitioners mr masterton laughed and said let us all go up stairs and not wait to be sent for he called one of the waiters and desired him to announce them to general de benyon they then followed the waiter leaving me alone i must say that i was a little agitated i heard the door open above and then an angry growl like that of a wild beast the door closed again and all was quiet and this thought i is the result of all my fond anticipations of my ardent wishes of my enthusiastic search instead of expressing anxiety to receive his son he litigiously requires proofs and more proofs when he has received every satisfactory proof already they say his temper is violent beyond control and that submission irritates instead of appeasing him what then if i resent i have heard that people of that description are to be better met with their own weaponssuppose i try itbut no i have no righti will however be firm and keep my temper under every circumstance i will show him at least that his son has the spirit and the feelings of a gentleman as these thoughts passed in my mind the door opened and mr masterton requested me to follow him i obeyed with a palpitating heart and when i had gained the landingplace up stairs mr masterton took my hand and led me into the presence of my longsoughtfor and muchdreaded parent i may as well describe him and the whole tableau the room was long and narrow and at the farther end was a large sofa on which was seated my father with his injured leg reposing on it his crutches propped against the wall on each side of him were two large poles and stands each with a magnificent macaw next to the macaws were two native servants arrayed in their muslin dresses with their arms folded a hooka was in advance of the table before the sofa it was magnificently wrought in silver and the snake passed under the table so that the tube was within my honoured fathers reach on one side of the room sat the two governors of the foundling hospital on the other was seated mr cophagus in his quakers dress the empty chair next to him had been occupied by mr masterton i looked at my father he was a man of great size apparently six feet three or four inches and stout in proportion without being burthened with fat he was gaunt broad shouldered and muscular and i think must have weighed seventeen or eighteen stone his head was in proportion to his body and very large so were all his features upon the same grand scale his complexion was of a brownishyellow and his hair of a snowy white he wore his whiskers very large and joined together under the throat and these which were also white from the circle which they formed round his face and contrasting with the colour of his skin gave his tout ensemble much more the appearance of a royal bengal tiger than a gentleman general de benyon saw mr masterton leading me forward to within a pace or two of the table before the generalallow me the pleasure of introducing your son japhet there was no hand extended to welcome me my father fixed his proud grey eyes upon me for a moment and then turned to the governors of the hospital is this the person gentlemen whom you received as an infant and brought up as japhet newland the governors declared i was the same person that they had bound me to mr cophagus and had seen me more than once since i quitted the asylum is this the japhet newland whom you received from these gentlemen and brought up to your business yea and verilyi do affirm the samesmart ladgood boy and so on i will not take a quakers affirmationwill you take your oath sir yes replied cophagus forgetting his quakership take oathbring biblekiss book and so on you then as a quaker have no objection to swear to the identity of this person swear cried cophagus yes swearswear nownot japhetim damnedgo to hell and so on the other parties present could not help laughing at this explosion from cophagus neither could i mr masterton then asked the general if he required any more proofs no replied the general discourteously and speaking in hindostanee to his attendants they walked to the door and opened it the hint was taken mr masterton saying to the others in an ironical tone after so long a separation gentlemen it must be natural that the general should wish to be left alone that he may give vent to his paternal feelings chapter lxxiv father and i grow warm in our argumentobliged to give him a little schooling to show my affectiontakes it at last very kindly and very dutifully owns himself a fool in the meantime i was left standing in the middle of the room the gentlemen departed and the two native servants resumed their stations on each side of the sofa i felt humiliated and indignant but waited in silence at last my honoured parent who had eyed me for some time commenced if you think young man to win my favour by your good looks you are very much mistaken you are too like your mother whose memory is anything but agreeable the blood mounted to my forehead at this cruel observation i folded my arms and looked my father steadfastly in the face but made no reply the choler of the gentleman was raised it appears that i have found a most dutiful son i was about to make an angry answer when i recollected myself and i courteously replied my dear general depend upon it that your son will always be ready to pay duty to whom duty is due but excuse me in the agitation of this meeting you have forgotten those little attentions which courtesy demands with your permission i will take a chair and then we may converse more at our ease i hope your leg is better i said this with the blandest voice and the most studied politeness and drawing a chair towards the table i took my seat as i expected it put my honoured father in a tremendous rage if this is a specimen sir of your duty and respect sir i hope to see no more of them to whom your duty is due sirand pray to whom is it due sir if not to the author of your existence cried the general striking the table before him with his enormous fist so as to make the ink fly out of the stand some inches high and bespatter the papers near it my dear father you are perfectly correct duty as you say is due to the author of our existence if i recollect right the commandment says honour your father and your mother but at the same time if i may venture to offer an observation are there not such things as reciprocal dutiessome which are even more paramount in a father than the mere begetting of a son what do you mean sir by these insolent remarks interrupted my father excuse me my dear father i may be wrong but if so i will bow to your superior judgment but it does appear to me that the mere hanging me in a basket at the gate of the foundling hospital and leaving me a banknote of fifty pounds to educate and maintain me until the age of twentyfour are not exactly all the duties incumbent upon a parent if you think that they are i am afraid that the world as well as myself will be of a different opinion not that i intend to make any complaint as i feel assured that now circumstances have put it in your power it is your intention to make me amends for leaving me so long in a state of destitution and wholly dependent upon my own resources you do do you sir well now ill tell you my resolution which isthere is the doorgo out and never let me see your face again my dear father as i am convinced this is only a little pleasantry on your part or perhaps a mere trial whether i am possessed of the spirit and determination of a de benyon i shall of course please you by not complying with your humorous request wont you by gd roared my father then turning to his two native servants he spoke to them in hindostanee they immediately walked to the door threw it wide open and then coming back to me were about to take me by the arms i certainly felt my blood boil but i recollected how necessary it was to keep my temper i rose from my chair and advancing to the side of the sofa i said my dear father as i perceive that you do not require your crutches at this moment you will not perhaps object to my taking one these foreign scoundrels must not be permitted to insult you through the person of your only son turn him out roared my father the natives advanced but i whirled the crutch round my head and in a moment they were both prostrate as soon as they gained their feet i attacked them again until they made their escape out of the room i then shut the door and turned the key thank you my dear sir said i returning the crutch to where it was before many thanks for thus permitting me to chastise the insolence of these black scoundrels whom i take it for granted you will immediately discharge and i again took my seat in the chair bringing it closer to him the rage of the general was now beyond all bounds the white foam was spluttered out of his mouth as he in vain endeavoured to find words once he actually rose from the sofa to take the law in his own hands but the effort seriously injured his leg and he threw himself down in pain and disappointment my dear father i am afraid that in your anxiety to help me you have hurt your leg again said i in a soothing voice sirrah sirrah exclaimed he at last if you think that this will do you are very much mistaken you dont know me you may turn out a couple of cowardly blacks but now ill show you that i am not to be played with i discard you for everi disinheriti disacknowledge you you may take your choice either to quit this room or be put into the hands of the police the police my dear sir what can the police do i may call in the police for the assault just committed by your servants and have them up to bow street but you cannot charge me with an assault but i will by gd sir true or not true indeed you would not my dear father a de benyon would never be guilty of a lie besides if you were to call in the policei wish to argue this matter coolly because i ascribe your present little burst of illhumour to your sufferings from your unfortunate accident allowing then my dear father that you were to charge me with an assault i should immediately be under the necessity of charging you also and then we must both go to bow street together were you ever at bow street general the general made no reply and i proceeded besides my dear sir only imagine how very awkward it would be when the magistrate put you on your oath and asked you to make your charge what would you be obliged to declare that you had married when young and finding that your wife had no fortune had deserted her the second day after your marriage that you an officer in the army and the honourable captain de benyon had hung up your child at the gates of the foundling hospitalthat you had again met your wife married to another and had been an accomplice in concealing her capital offence of bigamy and had had meetings with her although she belonged to another i say meetings for you did meet her to receive her directions about me i am charitable and suspect nothingothers will not be so then after her death you come home and inquire about your son his identity is establishedand what then not only you do not take him by the hand in common civility i might say but you first try to turn him out of the house and to give him in charge of the police and then you will have to state for what perhaps you will answer me that question for i really do not know by this time my honoured fathers wrath had to a certain degree subsided he heard all i had to say and he felt how very ridiculous would have been his intended proceedings and as his wrath subsided so did his pain increase he had seriously injured his leg and it was swelling rapidlythe bandages tightened in consequence and he was suffering under the acutest pain oh oh groaned he my dear father can i assist you ring the bell sir there is no occasion to summon assistance while i am here my dear general i can attend you professionally and if you will allow me will soon relieve your pain your leg has swollen from exertion and the bandages must be loosened he made no reply but his features were distorted with extreme pain i went to him and proceeded to unloose the bandages which gave him considerable relief i then replaced them secundum artem and with great tenderness and going to the sideboard took the lotion which was standing there with the other bottles and wetted the bandages in a few minutes he was quite relieved perhaps sir said i you had better try to sleep a little i will take a book and shall have great pleasure in watching by your side exhausted with pain and violence the general made no reply he fell back on the sofa and in a short time he snored most comfortably i have conquered you thought i as i watched him as he lay asleep if i have not yet i will that i am resolved i walked gently to the door unlocked it and opening it without waking him ordered some broth to be brought up immediately saying that the general was asleep and that i would wait for it outside i accomplished this little manoeuvre and reclosed the door without waking my father and then i took my seat in the chair and resumed my book having placed the broth on the side of the firegrate to keep it warm in about an hour he awoke and looked around him do you want anything my dearest father inquired i the general appeared undecided as to whether to recommence hostilities but at last he said i wish the attendance of my servants sir the attendance of a servant can never be equal to that of your own son general replied i going to the fire and taking the basin of broth which i replaced upon the tray containing the et ceteras on a napkin i expected you would require your broth and i have had it ready for you it was what i did require sir i must acknowledge replied my father and without further remark he finished the broth i removed the tray and then went for the lotion and again wetted the bandages on his leg is there anything else i can do for you sir said i nothingi am very comfortable then sir replied i i will now take my leave you have desired me to quit your presence for ever and you attempted force i resisted that because i would not allow you to have the painful remembrance that you had injured one who had strong claims upon you and had never injured you i resented it also because i wished to prove to you that i was a de benyon and had spirit to resist an insult but general if you imagine that i have come here with a determination of forcing myself upon you you are much mistaken i am too proud and happily am independent by my own exertions so as not to require your assistance had you received me kindly believe me you would have found a grateful and affectionate heart to have met that kindness you would have found a son whose sole object through life has been to discover a father after whom he has yearned who would have been delighted to have administered to his wants to have yielded to his wishes to have soothed him in his pain and to have watched him in his sickness deserted as i have been for so many years i trust that i have not disgraced you general de benyon and if ever i have done wrong it has been from a wish to discover you i can appeal to lord windermear for the truth of that assertion allow me to say that it is a very severe trialan ordeal which few pass through with safetyto be thrown as i have been upon the world with no friend no parent to assist or to advise me to have to bear up against the contingency of being of unacknowledged and perhaps disgraceful birth it is harder still when i expected to find my dearest wishes realised that without any other cause than that of my features resembling those of my mother i am to be again cast away one thing general de benyon i request and i trust it will not be denied which is that i may assume the name which i am entitled to i pledge you that i never will disgrace it and now sir asking and expecting no more i take my leave and you may be assured that neither poverty privation nor affliction of any kind will ever induce me to again intrude into your presence general de benyon farewell for ever i made my father a profound bow and was quitting the room stop sir said the general stop one moment if you please i obeyed why did you put me out of temper answer me that allow me to observe sir that i did not put you out of temper and what is more that i never lost my own temper during the insult and injury which i so undeservedly and unexpectedly have received but that very keeping your temper made me more angry sir that is very possible but surely i was not to blame the greatest proof of a perfect gentleman is that he is able to command his temper and i wished you to acknowledge that i was not without such pretensions that is as much as to say that your father is no gentleman and this i presume is a specimen of your filial duty replied the general warmly far from it sir there are many gentlemen who unfortunately cannot command their tempers and are more to be pitied than blamed for it but sir when such happens to be the case they invariably redeem their error and amply so by expressing their sorrow and offering an apology that is as much as to say that you expect me to apologise to you allow me sir to ask you did you ever know a de benyon submit to an insult no sir i trust not then sir those whose feelings of pride will not allow them to submit to an insult ought never to insult others if in the warmth of the moment they have done so that pride should immediately induce them to offer an apology not only due to the party but to their own characters there is no disgrace in making an apology when we are in error but there is a great disgrace in withholding such an act of common justice and reparation i presume i am to infer from all this that you expect an apology from me general de benyon as far as i am concerned that is now of little importance we part and shall probably never meet again if you think that it would make you feel more comfortable i am willing to receive it i must suppose by that observation that you fully expect it and otherwise will not stay i never had a thought of staying general you have told me that you have disinherited and discarded me for ever no one with the feelings of a man would ever think of remaining after such a declaration upon what terms then sir am i to understand that you will consent to remain with me and forget all that has passed my terms are simple general you must say that you retract what you have said and are very sorry for having insulted me and without i do that you will never come here again most decidedly not sir i shall always wish you well pray for your happiness be sorry at your death and attend your funeral as chief mourner although you disinherit me that is my duty in return for my having taken your name and your having acknowledged that i am your son but live with you or even see you occasionally i will not after what has passed this day without you make me an apology i was not aware that it was necessary for a father to apologise to his son if you wrong a stranger you offer an apology how much more is it due to a near relation but a parent has claims upon his own son sir for which he is bound to tender his duty i grant it in the ordinary course of things in this life but general de benyon what claims have you as a parent upon me a son in most cases is indebted to his parents for their care and attention in infancyhis educationhis religious instructionhis choice of a profession and his advancement in life by their exertions and interest and when they are called away he has a reasonable expectation of their leaving him a portion of their substance they have a heavy debt of gratitude to pay for what they have received and they are further checked by the hopes of what they may hereafter receive up to this time sir i have not received the first and this day i am told that i need not expect the last allow me to ask you general de benyon upon what grounds you claim from me a filial duty certainly not for benefits received or for benefits in expectation but i feel that i am intruding and therefore sir once more with every wish for your happiness i take my leave i went out and had half closed the door after me when the general cried out stopdont gojaphetmy soni was in a passioni beg your pardondont mind what i saidim a passionate old fool as he uttered this in broken sentences i returned to him he held out his hand forgive me boyforgive your father i knelt down and kissed his hand he drew me towards him and i wept upon his bosom chapter lxxv father still dutifully submissive at homeabroad i am splitting a straw in arguments with susannah about straw bonnetsthe rest of the chapter contains coquetry courting and costumes it was some time before we were sufficiently composed to enter into conversation and then i tried my utmost to please him still there was naturally a restraint on both sides but i was so particular and devoted in my attentions so careful of giving offence that when he complained of weariness and a wish to retire he stipulated that i should be with him to breakfast on the next morning i hastened to mr masterton although it was late to communicate to him all that had passed he heard me with great interest japhet said he you have done wellit is the proudest day of your life you have completely mastered him the royal bengal tiger is tamed i wish you joy my dear fellow now i trust that all will be well but keep your own counsel do not let this be known at reading let them still imagine that your father is as passionate as ever which he will be bythebye with everybody else you have still to follow up your success and leave me to help you in other matters i returned home to the piazza and thankful to heaven for the events of the day i soon fell fast asleep and dreamt of susannah temple the next morning i was early at the adelphi hotel my father had not yet risen but the native servants who passed in and out attending upon him and who took care to give me a wide berth had informed him that burra saibs son was come and he sent for me his leg was very painful and uncomfortable and the surgeon had not yet made his appearance i arranged it as before and he then dressed and came out to breakfast i had said nothing before the servants but as soon as he was comfortable on the sofa i took his hand and kissed it saying good morning my dear father i hope you do not repent of your kindness to me yesterday no no god bless you boy ive been thinking of you all night alls right thought i and i trust to be able to keep it so i shall pass over a fortnight during which i was in constant attendance upon my father at times he would fly out in a most violent manner but i invariably kept my temper and when it was all over would laugh at him generally repeating and acting all which he had said and done during his paroxysm i found this rather dangerous ground at first but by degrees he became used to it and it was wonderful how it acted as a check upon him he would not at first believe but that i exaggerated when the picture was held up to his view and he was again calm my father was not naturally a badtempered man but having been living among a servile race and holding high command in the army he had gradually acquired a habit of authority and an impatience of contradiction which was unbearable to all around those who were highspirited and sensitive shunned him the servile and the base continued with him for their own interests but trembled at his wrath i had during this time narrated to my father the events of my life and i am happy to say had by attention and kindness joined with firmness and good temper acquired a dominion over him i had at his request removed to the hotel and lived with him altogether his leg was rapidly arriving to a state of convalescence and he now talked of taking a house and setting up his establishment in london i had seen but little of mr masterton during this time as i had remained indoors in attendance upon the general i had written once to mr cophagus stating how i was occupied but saying nothing about our reconciliation one morning mr masterton called upon us and after a little conversation with the general he told me that he had persuaded mr cophagus and his wife to leave reading and come to london and that susannah temple was to come with them on a visit inquired i no not on a visit i have seen cophagus and he is determined to cut the quakers and reside in london altogether what does he intend to return to the pomps and vanities of this wicked world yes i believe so and his wife will join him she has no objection to decorate her pretty person i never thought that she hadbut susannah temple when susannah is away from her friends when she finds that her sister and brotherinlaw no longer wear the dress and when she is constantly in your company to all which please to add the effect i trust of my serious admonitions she will soon do as others do or she is no woman this is all my plan and leave it to meonly play your part by seeing as much of her as you can you need not fear that replied i does your father know of your attachment inquired mr masterton no i passed her over without mentioning her name replied i it is too soon yet to talk to him about my marrying in fact the proposal must if possible come from him could not you manage that yes i will if i can but as you say wait awhile here is their addressyou must call tomorrow if you can and do you think you can dine with me on thursday yes if the general continues improving if not i will send you word the next day i complained of a headache and said that i would walk out until dinnertime i hastened to the address given me by mr masterton and found that mr cophagus and his wife were out but susannah remained at home after our first questions i inquired of her how she liked london i am almost afraid to say japhet at least to you you would only laugh at me not so susannah i never laugh when i know people are sincere it appears to me then to be a vanity fair that there is more vanity in london than in any other city i grant replied i but recollect that there are more people and more wealth i do not think that there is more in proportion than in other towns in england and if there is more vanity susannah recollect also that there is more industry more talent and i should hope a greater proportion of good and honest people among its multitudes there is also unfortunately more misery and more crime i believe you are right japhet are you aware that mr cophagus has put off his plain attire if it grieves you susannah it grieves me also but i presume he finds it necessary not to be so remarkable for him i could find some excuse but what will you say japhet when i tell you that my own sister born and bred up to our tenets hath also deviated much from the dress of the females of our sect in what hath she made an alteration she has a bonnet of plaited straw with ribbons of what colour are the ribbons nay of the same as her dressof grey your bonnet susannah is of grey silk i do not see that there is vanity in descending to straw which is a more homely commodity but what reason has she given that her husband wills it as he does not like to walk out with her in her quakers dress is it not her duty to obey her husband even as i obey my father susannahbut i am not ashamed to walk out with you in your dress so if you have no objection let me show you a part of this great city susannah consented we had often walked together in the town of reading she was evidently pleased at what i said i soon escorted her to oxford street from thence down bond street and through all the most frequented parts of the metropolis the dress naturally drew upon her the casual glance of the passengers but her extreme beauty turned the glance to an ardent gaze and long before we had finished our intended walk susannah requested that i would go home she was not only annoyed but almost alarmed at the constant and reiterated scrutiny which she underwent ascribing it to her dress and not to her lovely person as soon as we returned i sat down with her so i understand that mr cophagus intends to reside altogether in london i have not heard so i understood that it was business which called him hither for a few weeks i trust not for i shall be unhappy here may i ask why the people are rudeit is not agreeable to walk out recollect my dear susannah that those of your sect are not so plentiful in london as elsewhere and if you wear a dress so different from other people you must expect that curiosity will be excited you cannot blame themit is you who make yourself conspicuous almost saying to the people by your garment come and look at me i have been reflecting upon what mr masterton said to you at reading and i do not know whether he was not right in calling it a garb of pride instead of a garb of humility if i thought so japhet even i would throw it off replied susannah it certainly is not pleasant that every one should think that you walk out on purpose to be stared at yet such is the illnatured construction of the world and they will never believe otherwise it is possible i should think to dress with equal simplicity and neatness to avoid gay colours and yet to dress so as not to excite observation i hardly know what to say but that you all appear against me and that sometimes i feel that i am too presumptuous in thus judging for myself i am not against you susannah i know you will do what you think is right and i shall respect you for that even if i disagree with you but i must say that if my wife were to dress in such a way as to attract the public gaze i should feel too jealous to approve of it i do not therefore blame mr cophagus for inducing his pretty wife to make some alteration in her attire neither do i blame but i commend her for obeying the wishes of her husband her beauty is his and not common property susannah did not reply she appeared very thoughtful you disagree with me susannah said i after a pause i am sorry for it i cannot say that i do japhet i have learned a lesson this day and in future i must think more humbly of myself and be more ruled by the opinions and judgment of others mr and mrs cophagus then came in cophagus had resumed his medical coat and waistcoat but not his pantaloons or hessians his wife who had a very good taste in dress would not allow him she was in her grey silk gown but wore a large handsome shawl which covered all but the skirts on her head she had a leghorn bonnet and certainly looked very pretty as usual she was all goodhumour and smiles i told them that we had been walking out and that susannah had been much annoyed by the staring of the people always so said cophagus never mindgirls like itfeel pleasedand so on you wrong me much brother cophagus replied susannah it pained me exceedingly all very well to say soknow bettersly pusswill wear dresspeople say pretty quakerand so on susannah hastily left the room after this attack and i told them what had passed mrs cophagus said i order a bonnet and shawl like yours for her without telling her and perhaps you will persuade her to put them on mrs cophagus thought the idea excellent and promised to procure them susannah not making her reappearance i took leave and arrived at the hotel in good time for dinner japhet said the general to me as we were at table you have mentioned lord windermear very often have you called upon him lately no sir it is now two years and more since i have seen him when i was summoned to town to meet you i was too much agitated to think of anything else and since that i have had too much pleasure in your company say rather my good boy that you have nursed me so carefully that you have neglected your friends and your health take my carriage tomorrow and call upon him and after that you had better drive about a little for you have been looking pale these last few days i hope to get out myself in a short time and then we will have plenty of amusement together in setting up our establishment chapter lxxvi i renew old ties of friendship and seek new ones of loveobliged to take my father to task once morehe receives his lesson with proper obedience i took the carriage the next day and drove to lord windermears he was at home and i gave my name to the servant as mr de benyon it was the first time that i had made use of my own name his lordship was alone when i entered he bowed as if not recognising me and waved his hand to a chair my lord i have given my true name and you treat me as a perfect stranger i will mention my former name and i trust you will honour me with a recognition i was japhet newland my dear mr newland you must accept my apology but it is so long since we met and i did not expect to see you again i thought my lord that mr masterton had informed you of what had taken place no i have just come from a visit to my sisters in westmoreland and have received no letters from him i have my lord at last succeeded in finding out the object of my mad search as you were truly pleased to call it in the honourable general de benyon lately arrived from the east indies where his services are well known added his lordship mr de benyon i congratulate you with all my heart when you refused my offers of assistance and left us all in that mad way i certainly despaired of ever seeing you again i am glad that you reappear under such fortunate auspices has your father any family none my lord but myself and my mother died in the east indies then i presume from what i know at the board of control that you may now safely be introduced as a young gentleman of large fortune allow me at least to assist your father in placing you in your proper sphere in society where is your father at present my lord he is staying at the adelphi hotel confined to his room by an accident but i trust that in a few days he will be able to come out will you offer my congratulations to him and tell him that if he will allow me i will have the honour of paying my respects to him will you dine with me on monday next i returned my thanks accepted the invitation and took my leave his lordship saying as he shook hands with me you dont know how happy this intelligence has made me i trust that your father and i shall be good friends when i returned to the carriage as my father had desired me to take an airing i thought i might as well have a companion so i directed them to drive to mr cophaguss the servant knocked and i went in as soon as the door was opened susannah and mrs cophagus were sitting in the room susannah said i i know you do not like to walk out so i thought perhaps you would have no objection to take an airing in the carriage my father has lent it to me will you comeit will do you good it is very kind of you japhet to think of me but but what replied mrs cophagus surely thou wilt not refuse susannah it would savour much of ingratitude on thy part i will not then be ungrateful replied susannah leaving the room and in a short time she returned in a leghorn bonnet and shawl like her sisters do not i prove that i am not ungrateful japhet since to do credit to thy carriage i am content to depart from the rules of our persuasion said susannah smiling i feel the kindness and the sacrifice you are making to please me susannah replied i but let us lose no time i handed her down to the carriage and we drove to the park it was a beautiful day and the park was filled with pedestrians as well as carriages susannah was much astonished as well as pleased now susannah said i if you were to call this vanity fair you would not be far wrong but still recollect that even all this is productive of much good reflect how many industrious people find employment and provision for their families by the building of these gay vehicles their painting and ornamenting how many are employed at the loom and at the needle in making these costly dresses this vanity is the cause of wealth not being hoarded but finding its way through various channels so as to produce comfort and happiness to thousands your observations are just japhet but you have lived in the world and seen much of it i am as one just burst from an eggshell all amazement i have been living in a little world of my own thoughts surrounded by a mist of ignorance and not being able to penetrate farther have considered myself wise when i was not my dear susannah this is a chequered world but not a very bad onethere is in it much of good as well as evil the sect to which you belong avoid itthey know it notand they are unjust towards it during the time that i lived at reading i will candidly state to you that i met with many who called themselves of the persuasion who were wholly unworthy of it but they made up in outward appearance and hypocrisy what they wanted in their conduct to their fellowcreatures believe me susannah there are pious and good charitable and humane conscientious and strictly honourable people among those who now pass before your view in such gay procession but society requires that the rich should spend their money in superfluities that the poor may be supported be not deceived therefore in future by the outward garments which avail nothing you have induced me much to alter my opinions already japhet so has that pleasant friend of thine mr masterton who has twice called since we have been in london but is it not time that we should return it is indeed later than i thought it was susannah replied i looking at my watch and i am afraid that my father will be impatient for my return i will order them to drive home as we drove along leaning against the back of the carriage my hand happened to touch that of susannah which lay beside her on the cushion i could not resist taking it in mine and it was not withdrawn what my thoughts were the reader may imagine susannahs i cannot acquaint him with but in that position we remained in silence until the carriage stopped at cophaguss door i handed susannah out of the carriage and went up stairs for a few moments mrs cophagus and her husband were out susannah this is very kind of you and i return you my thanks i never felt more happy than when seated with you in that carriage i have received both amusement and instruction japhet and ought to thank you do you know what passed in my mind at one time notell me when i first knew you and you came among us i was as it were the guide a presumptuous one perhaps to you and you listened to menow it is reversednow that we are removed and in the world it is you that are the guide and it is i who listen and obey because susannah when we first met i was much in error and had thought too little of serious things and you were fit to be my guide now we are mixing in the world with which i am better acquainted than yourself you then corrected me when i was wrong i now point out to you where you are not rightly informed but susannah what you have learnt of me is as nought compared with the valuable precepts which i gained from your lipsprecepts which i trust no collision with the world will ever make me forget oh i love to hear you say that i was fearful that the world would spoil you japhet but it will notwill it not so long as i have you still with me susannah but if i am obliged to mix again with the world tell me susannah will you reject mewill you desert mewill you return to your own people and leave me so exposed susannah dearest you must know how long how dearly i have loved youyou know that if i had not been sent for and obliged to obey the message i would have lived and died content with you will you not listen to me now or do you reject me i put my arm round her waist her head fell upon my shoulder and she burst into tears speak dearest this suspense is torture to me continued i i do love you japhet replied she at last looking fondly at me through her tears but i know not whether this earthly love may not have weakened my affection towards heaven if so may god pardon me for i cannot help it after this avowal for a few minutes which appeared seconds we were in each others arms when susannah disengaged herself dearest japhet thy father will be much displeased i cannot help it replied i i shall submit to his displeasure nay but japhet why risk thy fathers wrath well then replied i attempting to reach her lips i will go nay nayindeed japhet you exact too muchit is not seemly then i wont go recollect about thy father it is you who detain me susannah i must not injure thee with thy father japhet it were no proof of my affectionbut indeed you are selfwilled god bless you susannah said i as i gained the contested point and hastened to the carriage my father was a little out of humour when i returned and questioned me rather sharply as to where i had been i half pacified him by delivering lord windermears polite message but he continued his interrogations and although i had pointed out to him that a de benyon would never be guilty of an untruth i am afraid i told some half dozen on this occasion but i consoled myself with the reflection that in the code of honour of a fashionable man he is bound if necessary to tell falsehoods where a lady is concerned so i said i had driven through the streets looking at the houses and had twice stopped and had gone in to examine them my father supposed that i had been looking out for a house for him and was satisfied fortunately they were job horses had they been his own i should have been in a severe scrape horses are the only part of an establishment for which the gentlemen have any consideration and on which ladies have no mercy i had promised the next day to dine with mr masterton my father had taken a great aversion to this old gentleman until i had narrated the events of my life in which he had played such a conspicuous and friendly part then to do my father justice his heart warmed towards him my dear sir i have promised to dine out today with whom japhet why sir to tell you the truth with that old thief of a lawyer i am very much shocked at your using such an expression towards one who has been such a sincere friend japhet and you will oblige me sir by not doing so again in my presence i really beg your pardon general replied i but i thought to please you please me what do you think of me please me sir by showing yourself ungratefuli am ashamed of you sir my dear father i borrowed the expression from you you called mr masterton an old thief of a lawyer to his face he complained to me of the language before i had the pleasure of meeting you i feel and always shall feel the highest respect love and gratitude towards him have i your permission to go yes japhet replied my father looking very grave and do me the favour to apologise for me to mr masterton for my having used such an expression in my unfortunate warmth of temperi am ashamed of myself my dearest father no man need be ashamed who is so ready to make honourable reparationwe are all a little out of temper at times you have been a kind friend to me japhet as well as a good son replied my father with some emotion dont forget the apology at all events i shall be unhappy until it be made chapter lxxvii treats of apologies and love coming from churchwe finesse with the nabob to win me a wifei am successful in my suit yet the lawyer is still to play the cards to enable me to win the game i arrived at mr mastertons and walked into his room when whom should i find in company with him but harcourt japhet im glad to see you allow me to introduce you to mr harcourtmr de benyon and the old gentleman grinned maliciously but i was not to be taken aback harcourt said i extending my hand i have to apologise to you for a rude reception and for unjust suspicions but i was vexed at the timeif you will admit that as an excuse my dear japhet replied harcourt taking my hand and shaking it warmly i have to apologise to you for much more unworthy behaviour and it will be a great relief to my mind if you will once more enrol me in the list of your friends and now mr masterton said i as apologies appear to be the order of the day i bring you one from the general who has requested me to make one to you for having called you an old thief of a lawyer of which he was totally ignorant until i reminded him of it today harcourt burst into a laugh well japhet you may tell your old tiger that i did not feel particularly affronted as i took his expression professionally and not personally and if he meant it in that sense he was not far wrong japhet tomorrow is sunday do you go to meeting or to church i believe sir that i shall go to church well then come with mebe here at halfpast twowe will go to evening service at st jamess i have received many invitations but i never yet received an invitation to go to church replied i you will hear an extra lesson of the daya portion of susannah and the elders i took the equivoque which was incomprehensible to harcourt i hardly need say that the latter and i were on the best terms when we separated harcourt requested leave to call upon me the next morning and mr masterton said that he should also pay his respects to the tiger as he invariably called my most honoured parent harcourt was with me very soon after breakfast and after i had introduced him to my governor we retired to talk without interruption i have much to say to you de benyon commenced harcourt first let me tell you that after i rose from my bed and discovered that you had disappeared i resolved if possible to find you out and induce you to come back timothy who looked very sly at me would tell me nothing but that the last that was heard of you was at lady de clares at richmond having no other clue i went down there introduced myself and as they will tell you candidly acknowledged that i had treated you ill i then requested that they would give me any clue by which you might be found for i had an opportunity of offering to you a situation which was at my fathers disposal and which any gentleman might have accepted although it was not very lucrative it was very kind of you harcourt do not say that i beg it was thus that i formed an acquaintance with lady de clare and her daughter whose early history as fleta i had obtained from you but who i little imagined to be the little girl that you had so generously protected for it was not until after i had deserted you that you had discovered her parentage the extreme interest relative to you evinced by both the mother and the daughter surprised me they had heard of my name from you but not of our quarrel they urged me and thanked me for proposing to follow you and find you out i did make every attempt i went to brentford inquired at all the publichouses and of all the coachmen who went down the road but could obtain no information except that at one publichouse a gentleman stopped with a portmanteau and soon afterwards went away with it on his shoulders i returned to richmond with the tidings of my illsuccess about a week after i had first called there cecilia was much affected and cried very bitterly i could not help asking lady de clare why she took such a strong interest in your fortunes who ought replied cecilia if his poor fleta does not good heavens miss de clare are you the little fleta whom he found with the gipsies and talked to me so much about did you not know it said lady de clare i then explained to her all that had latterly passed between us and they in return communicated your events and dangers in ireland thus was an intimacy formed and ever since i have been constantly welcome at their house i did not however abandon my enquiries for many months when i thought it was useless and i had to console poor cecilia who constantly mourned for you and now japhet i must make my story short i could not help admiring a young person who showed so much attachment and gratitude joined to such personal attractions but she was an heiress and i was a younger brother still lady de clare insisted upon my coming to the house and i was undecided how to act when the unfortunate death of my elder brother put me in a situation to aspire to her hand after that my visits were more frequent and i was tacitly received as a suitor by lady de clare and had no reason to complain of the treatment i received from cecilia such was the position of affairs until the day on which you broke in upon us so unexpectedly and at the very moment that you came in i had with the sanction of her mother made an offer to cecilia and was anxiously awaiting an answer from her own dear lips can you therefore be surprised japhet at there being a degree of constraint on all sides at the interruption occasioned by the presence of one who had long been considered lost to us or that a young person just deciding upon the most important step of her life should feel confused and agitated at the entrance of a third party however dear he might be to her as a brother and benefactor i am perfectly satisfied harcourt replied i and i will go there and make my peace as soon as i can indeed japhet if you knew the distress of cecilia you would pity and love her more than ever her mother is also much annoyed as soon as you were gone they desired me to hasten after you and bring you back cecilia had not yet given her answer i requested it before my departure but i presume to stimulate me she declared that she would give me no answer until i reappeared with you this is now three weeks ago and i have not dared to go there i have been trying all i can to see you again since you repulsed me at the piazza but without success until i went to mr masterton and begged him to procure me an interview i thank god it has succeeded well harcourt you shall see cecilia tomorrow morning if you please japhet what obligations i am under to you had it not been for you i never should have known cecilia and more were it not for your kindness i might perhaps lose her for ever not so harcourt it was your own good feeling prompting you to find me out which introduced you to cecilia and i wish you joy with all my heart this is a strange worldwho would have imagined that in little fleta i was picking up a wife for a man whose life i nearly took away i will ask my governor for his carriage tomorrow and will call and take you up at your lodgings at two oclock if that hour will suit you i will tell you all that has passed since i absconded when we are at lady de clares one story will do for all harcourt then took his leave and i returned to my father with whom i found lord windermear de benyon i am happy to see you again said his lordship i have just been giving a very good character of you to the general i hope you will continue to deserve it i hope so too my lord i should be ungrateful indeed if i did not after my fathers kindness to me mr masterton was then introduced lord windermear shook hands with him and after a short conversation took his leave japhet said mr masterton aside i have a little business with your father get out of the room any way you think best there are but two ways my dear sir replied i the door or the windows with your permission i will select the former as most agreeable so saying i went to my own room what passed between the general and mr masterton i did not know until afterwards but they were closeted upwards of an hour when i was sent for by mr masterton japhet you said you would go with me to hear the new preacher we have no time to lose so general i shall take my leave and run away with your son i followed mr masterton into his carriage and we drove to the lodging of mr cophagus susannah was all ready and mr masterton went up stairs and brought her down a blush and a sweet smile illumined her features when she perceived me stowed away in the corner of the chariot we drove off and somehow or another our hands again met and did not separate until we arrived at the church door susannah had the same dress on as when she had accompanied me in my fathers carriage i went through the responses with her reading out of the same book and i never felt more inclined to be devout for i was happy and grateful to heaven for my happiness when the service was over we were about to enter the carriage when who should accost us but harcourt you are surprised to see me here said he to mr masterton but i thought there must be something very attractive that you should make an appointment with japhet to go to this church and as i am very fond of a good sermon i determined to come and hear it harcourts ironical look told me all he would say well replied mr masterton i hope you have been edifiednow get out of the way and let us go into the carriage tomorrow at two de benyon said harcourt taking another peep at susannah yes punctually replied i as the carriage drove off and now my dear child said mr masterton to susannah as the carriage rolled along tell me have you been disappointed or do you agree with me you have attended a meeting of your own persuasion this morningyou have now for the first time listened to the ritual of the established church to which do you give the preference i will not deny sir that i think in departing from the forms of worship those of my persuasion did not do wisely i would not venture thus much to say but you support me in my judgment you have answered like a good sensible girl and have proved that you can think for yourself but observe my child i have persuaded you for once and once only to enter our place of worship that you might compare and judge for yourself it now remains for you to decide as you please i would that some better qualified would decide for me replied susannah gravely your husband susannah whispered i must take that responsibility upon himself is he not the proper person susannah slightly pressed my hand which held hers and said nothing as soon as we had conveyed her home mr masterton offered to do me the same kindness which i accepted now japhet i dare say that you would like to know what it was i had so particular to say to the old general this morning of course i would sir if it concerned me it did concern you for we had not been two minutes in conversation before you were brought on the tapis he spoke of you with tears in his eyesof what a comfort you had been to him and how happy you had made him and that he could not bear you to be away from him for half an hour on that hint i spake and observed that he must not expect you to continue in retirement long neither must he blame you that when he had set up his establishment you would be as great a favourite as you were before and be unable without giving offence to refuse the numerous invitations which you would receive in short that it was nothing but right you should resume your position in society and it was his duty to submit to it the old governor did not appear to like my observations and said he expected otherwise from you i replied that it was impossible to change our natures and the other sex would naturally have attractions which you would not be able to resist and that they would occupy a large portion of your time the only way to ensure his company my dear sir is to marry him to a steady amiable young woman who not having been thrown into the vortex of fashion will find pleasure in domestic life then her husband will become equally domestic and you will be all very happy together your father agreed with me and appeared very anxious that it should take place i then very carefully introduced miss temple saying that i knew you had a slight partiality in that quarter highly commending her beauty prudence c i stated that feeling an interest about you i had gone down into the country where she resided and had made her acquaintance and had been much pleased with her that since she had come up to town with her relations i had seen a great deal and had formed so high an opinion of and so strong an attachment to her and had felt so convinced that she was the very person who would make you happy and domestic that having no family myself i had some idea of adopting her at all events that if she married you i was determined to give her something very handsome on the day of the wedding but my dear sir why should you not have said that susannah temple was left an orphan at seven years old and her fortune has accumulated ever since it is by no means despicable i understand from mr cophagus and moreover mr cophagus intends to leave her all his property i am very glad to hear it japhet and will not fail to communicate all this to your father but there is no reason why i may not do as i please with my own moneyand i love that girl dearly bythebye have you ever said anything to her o yes sir we are pledged to each other thats all right i thought so when i saw your fingers hooked together in the carriage but now japhet i should recommend a little indifferencenot exactly opposition when your father proposes the subject to you it will make him more anxious and when you consent more obliged to you i have promised to call upon him tomorrow on that and other business and you had better be out of the way i shall be out of the way sir i mean to go with harcourt to lady de clares i shall ask for the carriage he will certainly lend it to you as he wishes to get rid of you but here we are god bless you my boy chapter lxxviii the bengal tiger taken in the toils which promise a speedy end to minei kindly permit my father to insist upon the marriage that i have set my heart upon i found my father who had now completely recovered from his accident walking up and down the room in a brown study he did not speak to me until after dinner when he commenced with asking some questions relative to cecilia de clare i replied that i intended if he did not want the carriage to call there tomorrow with mr harcourt is she very handsome inquired he very much so sir i do not think i ever saw a handsomer young person yes i do recollect one who was that a young lady with whom i was slightly acquainted when living in the country i have been thinking my dear boy that with the competence which you will have it is right that you should marry early in so doing you will oblige your father who is anxious to see his grandchildren before he dies my health is not very good i could not help smiling at this pathetic touch of the old governors who if one could judge from appearances was as strong as a lion and likely to last almost as long as his dutiful son moreover his appetite was enormous and he invariably finished his bottle every day i did not therefore feel any serious alarm as to his health but i nevertheless replied matrimony is a subject upon which i have never thoughtahem a de benyon never tells an untruth i am very young yet and am too happy to remain with you but my dear boy i propose that you shall remain with mewe will all live together i do not intend that we shall part i really wish japhet you would think seriously of it my dear father allow me to observe that at present i am not in a situation to support a wife and i should be sorry to be a tax upon you at your age you require many comforts and luxuries and i presume that you live up to your income then my dear fellow you are under a great mistake i can lay down one hundred thousand pounds on the day of your marriage with any lady whom i approve of and still not spend half my remaining income that sir replied i certainly removes one difficulty at the same time that it proves what a generous and indulgent father i am blessed with but sir with such a fortune i have a right to expect that the lady will also bring a handsome addition miss de clare is engaged i believe to mr harcourt or i might have made strong interest in that quarter something my dear boy but a moderate fortune nowadays is all that we expect with wives and the best wives are those who are not born to too much wealth still she should bring something but tell me japhet who is that young lady whom you thought handsomer than miss de clare a miss temple sir templeit is a very good name i think girls brought up in the country make the best wives they do sir most certainly they are more domestic and make their husbands more content and happy at home well my dear boy i have mentioned the subject and wish you would think of it you will please me much my dear father i shall be most happy to obey in everything else but in so serious a point as uniting myself for life i think you must allow that a little discretionary power should be given to a son all i can say is this show me a young person who is eligible and if i find that i can love her i will not refuse to obey your wishes well sir do as you please replied my father very angrily but i think sir when i desire you to fall in love it is your duty to obey suppose i was to fall in love with a person you did not like would you allow me to marry her most certainly not sir then sir is it reasonable to expect me to marry without being in love i did not marry for love sir no replied i forgetting myself a little and a pretty mess you made of it i did rejoined my father in a rage by begetting an undutiful goodfornothing graceless insolent ungrateful son my dear father i was not aware that i had a brother i mean you sir to prove to you how unjust you are sir and how little i deserve what you have called me i now promise you to marry as soon as you wish thank you my boy thats kind of you but i will say that you are a comfort and a treasure to me and i bless the day that brought you to my arms well then look about you no sir i leave it all to you select the party and i am willing to obey you my dear boy well then ill talk the matter over with mr masterton tomorrow and the general shook me warmly by the hand the next day i picked up harcourt and proceeded to park street a note from him had informed them of our intended visit and other visitors had been denied all has been explained cecilia said i after the first greeting i was very wrong and very foolish and made me very miserable i little thought that you japhet would have made me cry so much but i forgive you for it as i would a thousand times as much more now sit down and tell us all that has happened since you left us not yet my dear cecilia you as well as i owe a reparation to poor harcourt whom i think you have treated cruelly you were about to answer a question of vital moment when i broke in upon you and you have since kept him in a state of cruel suspense for more than three weeks refusing him an answer until he brought me into your presence an hour of such suspense must be dreadful and before we sit down i wish everyone should feel comfortable and happy it was not altogether to stimulate mr harcourt to bring you back which induced me to refuse to answer his question japhet i considered that your return had rendered it necessary that it should be deferred until i saw you i have not forgotten japhet and never shall forget what i was when you rescued me and when i think what i might have been had you not saved me i shudder at the bare idea i have not forgotten how you risked and nearly lost your life in ireland for my sakeneither has my mother we are beholden to you for all our present happiness and i am eternally indebted to you for rescuing me from ignorance poverty and perhaps vice you have been more much more than a father to memore much more than a brother i am as it were a creature of your own fashioning and i owe to you that which i never can repay when then you returned so unexpectedly japhet i felt that you had a paramount right in my disposal and i was glad that i had not replied to mr harcourt as i wished first for your sanction and approval i know all that has passed between you but i know not your real feelings towards mr harcourt he acknowledges that he treated you very ill and it was his sincere repentance of having so done and his praise of you which first won my favour and now japhet if you have still animosity against mr harcourtif you stop my dear fleta i will answer all your questions at once i took harcourts hand and placed it in hers may god bless you both and may you be happy cecilia threw her arms round me and wept so did everybody else i believe it was lucky for harcourt that i was in love with susannah temple as soon as cecilia had recovered a little i kissed her and passed her over to her right owner who led her to the sofa lady de clare and i went out of the room on important business and did not return for a quarter of an hour when we returned cecilia went to her mother and embraced her while harcourt silently squeezed my hand we then all sat down and i gave them an account of all that had passed during my second excursionhow i had nearly been hangedhow i had gone madhow i had turned quaker and apothecarywhich they all agreed with what had happened to me before made up a very eventful history and japhet if it be a fair question about one so fair was that miss temple who was at church with you yesterday it was then cecilia if ever she appears in the same circle except in my eyes your beauty will stand in some danger of being eclipsed how can you say except in your eyes mr harcourt replied cecilia the very observation proves that it is eclipsed in your eyes whatever it may be in those of others now as a punishment i have a great mind to order you away again until you bring her face to face that i may judge myself if i am again banished replied harcourt i shall have a second time to appeal to de benyon to be able to come back again he can produce her i have no doubt and perhaps may some of these days cecilia oh do japhet i will love her so you must wait a little first i am not quite so far advanced as you and harcourt i have not received the consent of all parties as you have today but i must now leave you harcourt i presume you will dine here i must dine with my governor on my return i found that the table was laid for three and that the general had asked mr masterton from which i augured well masterton could not speak to me when he arrived but he gave me a wink and a smile and i was satisfied japhet said my father you have no engagement tomorrow i hope because i shall call at mr mastertons on business and wish you to accompany me i replied that i should be most happy and the conversation became general i accompanied my father the next day to lincolns inn and when we went up we found mr masterton at the table with mr cophagus and susannah sitting apart near the window the plot thickens thought i the fact was as i was afterwards told by mr masterton he had prevailed upon cophagus to pretend business and to bring susannah with him and appointed them a quarter of an hour before our time this he had arranged that the general might see miss temple as if by accident and also allow me who my father supposed was not aware of miss temple being in town to meet with her what a deal of humbug there is in this world nothing but plot and counterplot i shook hands with cophagus who i perceived had notwithstanding his wifes veto put on his blue cotton net pantaloons and hessian boots and he appeared to be so tight in both that he could hardly move as far as i could judge his legs had not improved since i had last seen them in this his favourite dress mr de benyon i believe that you have met miss temple before said mr masterton winking at me in berkshire was it not miss temple allow me to introduce general de benyon i went up to susannah who coloured and trembled at the sight of my father as i expressed my hope that she had been well since we last met she perceived that there was some planned scheme and was so puzzled that she said nothing my father then spoke to her and after a short time took a chair and seated himself close to her i never knew her make herself so agreeable he asked her where she was staying and when he heard that it was with mr cophagus he said that he should have the pleasure of calling upon mr cophagus and thank him for his kind information relative to me shortly afterwards cophagus took his leave and susannah rose to accompany him when my father hearing that they had walked insisted upon putting miss temple down in his carriage so that mr cophagus had to walk home one way and i the other chapter lxxxi poor cophagus finds an end to his adventures by the means of a mad bull i of mine by matrimonyfather is prettily behaved and my quaker wife the most fashionably dressed lady in townverily hum alas little did mr cophagus know how fatal to him would be the light cotton nets when he put them on that day he had proceeded as it appears about twothirds of his way home he lived in welbeck street when he perceived a rush from up a street leading into oxford street he looked to ascertain the cause when to his horror he perceivedwhat to him was the greatest of all horrorsa mad bull if anything could make mr cophagus run it was a sight like that and he did run but he could not run fast in his cotton nets and tight hessians which crippled him altogether as if out of pure spite the bull singled him out from at least one hundred who exerted their agility and again was poor mr cophagus tossed far behind the animal fortunately breaking his fall by tumbling on a large dog who was in full chase the dog who was unable to crawl from beneath the unfortunate cophagus was still in a condition to bite which he did most furiously and the butcher who had an affection for his dog when he perceived its condition also vented his fury upon poor cophagus by saluting him with several blows on his head with his cudgel what between the bull the dog and the butcher poor mr cophagus was taken into a shop in a very deplorable condition after some time he recovered and was able to name his residence when he was taken home it was late in the evening when i received a note from susannah informing me of that unfortunate accident my father had just finished a long story about filial duty country girls good wives c and had wound up by saying that he and mr masterton both considered that miss temple would be a very eligible match and that as i had requested him to select he had selected her accordingly i had just proved how truly dutiful i was by promising to do all i could to love her and to fulfil his wishes when the note was put in my hands i read it stated its contents to my father and with his permission immediately jumped into a hackneycoach and drove to welbeck street on my arrival i found poor mrs cophagus in a state of syncope and susannah attending her i sent for the surgeon who had been called in and then went up to mr cophagus he was much better than i expectedcalm and quite sensible his wounds had been dressed by the surgeon but he did not appear to be aware of the extent of the injury he had received when the surgeon came i questioned him he informed me that although much hurt he did not consider that there was any danger to be apprehended there were no bones broken the only fear that he had was that there might be some internal injury but at present that could not be ascertained i thanked him and consoled mrs cophagus with this information i then returned to her husband who shook his head and muttered as i put my ear down to hear him thought socome to londonfull of mad bullstosseddieand so on o no replied i the surgeon says that there is no danger you will be up in a weekbut now you must keep very quiet i will send mrs cophagus to you i went out and finding her composed i desired her to go to her husband who wished to see her and i was left alone with susannah i told her all that had passed and after two delightful hours had escaped i returned home to the hotel my father had waited up for some time and finding that i did not return had retired when i met him the next morning i mentioned what the surgeon had said but stated that in my opinion there was great cause for alarm in a man of mr cophaguss advanced age my father agreed with me but could not help pointing out what a good opportunity this would afford for my paying my attentions to miss temple as it was natural that i should be interested about so old a friend as mr cophagus my filial duty inclined me to reply that i should certainly avail myself of such a favourable opportunity my adventures are now drawing to a close i must pass over three months during which my father had taken and furnished a house in grosvenor square and i whenever i could spare time had under the auspices of lord windermear again been introduced into the world as mr de benyon i found that the new name was considered highly respectable my fathers hall tables were loaded with cards and i even received two dinner invitations from lady maelstrom who told me how her dear nieces had wondered what had become of me and that they were afraid that louisa would have fallen into a decline and during these three months cecilia and susannah had been introduced and had become as inseparable as most young ladies are who have a lover apiece and no cause for jealousy mr cophagus had so far recovered as to be able to go down into the country vowing much to the chagrin of his wife that he never would put his foot in london again he asked me whether i knew any place where there were no mad bulls and i took some trouble to find out but i could not for even if he went to the north pole although there were no bulls yet there were bull bisons and musk bulls which were even more savage upon which he declared that this was not a world to live in and to prove that he was sincere in his opinion poor fellow about three months after his retirement into the country he died from a general decay arising from the shock produced on his system but before these three months had passed it had been finally arranged that harcourt and i were to be united on the same day and having renewed my acquaintance with the good bishop whom i had taxed with being my father he united us both to our respective partners my father made over to me the sum which he had mentioned mr masterton gave susannah ten thousand pounds and her own fortune amounted to as much more with the reversion of mr cophaguss property at the decease of his widow timothy came up to the wedding and i formally put him in the possession of my shop and stock in trade and he has now a flourishing business although he has not yet found his mother he has found a very pretty wife which he says does quite as well if not better let it not be supposed that i forgot the good services of kathleenwho was soon after married to corny a small farm on fletas estate was appropriated to them at so low a rent that in a few years they were able to purchase the property and corny from a leveller as soon as he was comfortable became one of the governments firmest supporters i am now living in the same house with my father who is very happy and behaves pretty well he is seldom in a passion more than twice aweek which we consider as miraculous now that i am writing this he has his two grandchildren on his knees mrs cophagus has married a captain in the life guards and as far as fashion and dress are concerned may be said to be going the whole hog and now as i have no doubt that my readers will be curious to know whether my lovely wife adheres to her primitive style of dress i shall only repeat a conversation of yesterday night as she came down arrayed for a splendid ball given by mrs harcourt de clare tell me now de benyon said she is not this a pretty dress yes my dear replied i looking at her charming face and figure with all the admiration usual in the honeymoon it is indeed but do you not think my dear susan said i putting the tip of my white glove upon her snowy shoulder that it is cut down a little too low too low de benyon why its not half so low as mrs harcourt de clare or lady c wear their dresses well my dear i did not assert that it was i only asked well then if you only asked for information de benyon i will tell you that it is not too low and i think you will acknowledge that on this point my opinion ought to be decisive for if i have no other merit i have at least the merit of being the bestdressed woman in london verily thou persuadest me susannah replied i now de benyon hold your tongue like a welldisciplined husband i bowed and said no more and now having no more to say i shall also make my bow to my readers and bid them farewell the end

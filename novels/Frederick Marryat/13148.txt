metropolitan magazine and author of outward bound etc on the titlepage it is described simply as edited by marryat and according to his daughter the captain did no more than stand literary sponsor to the production in saunders and otley publishedthe floral telegraph or affections signals by the late captain marryat rn but mrs lean knows nothing of the book and it is probably not marryats work the life and letters of captain marryat by florence marryat mrs lean in vols richard bentley are the only biographical record of the novelist extant in some matters they are very detailed and personal in others reticent the story has been spiritedly retold with reflections and criticisms by mr david hannay in the great writers series the frontispiece is from a print published by henry colburn in after the portrait by simpson the favourite pupil of sir thomas lawrence which was considered more like him than any other count dorsay took a portrait of marryat in coloured crayons about but it was not a success a portrait in water colours by behnes was engraved as a frontispiece to the pirate and the three cutters his bust was taken by carew rbj frederick marryat without yielding implicit credence to the handsome pedigree of the marryats supplied by mrs lean the novelists daughter we may give a glance in passing to the firstfruits of this family tree they naturallycame over with the conqueror and emerged from obscurity under stephen as the proud possessors of much lands at the village of meryat ashton meryat and elsewhere in somersetshire one nicotas de maryet is deputed to collect the ransom of richard coeur de leon through the county of somerset in the reign of edward i sir john de maryet is called to attend the great parliament in that of edward ii his son is excommunicated for embowelling his deceased wife a fancy says the county historian peculiar to the knightly family of meryat mrs lean quotes records of other meryat hearts to which an honourable burial has been accorded the house of meryat finally lost its property on the fall of lady jane grey to whom it had descended through the female line captain marryat belonged to the suffolk branch of the family of whom one john de maryat had the honour of dancing in a masque before the virgin queen at trinity college cambridge was sent to aid the huguenots in their wars in france escaped the massacre of st bartholemew and in returned to england here he married mary the daughter and heiress of daniel luke of the covent garden a rank puritan family in hudibras and again settled in his paternal county of suffolk less partial biographers neglect to trace the marryats beyond this huguenot officer who is described by them as a refugee whatever may be the truth of these matters it is certain that during the th and th centuries the maryats were a respectable middleclass puritan familyministers doctors and business men in the days of the merry monarch a john marryat became distinguished as a painful preacher and was twice expelled from his livings for nonconformity captain marryats grandfather was a good doctor and his father joseph marryat of wimbledon house was an mp chairman for the committee of lloyds and colonial agent for the island of grenadaa substantial man who refused a baronetcy and was honoured by an elegy from campbell he married charlotte geyer or von geyer a hessian of good descent frederick born july was one of fifteen sons and daughters of whom ten attained maturity and several have entered the lists of literature his eldest brother joseph was a famous collector of china and author of pottery and porcelain the youngest horace wrote one year in sweden jutland and the danish isles and his sister mrs bury palliser was the author of nature and art not to be confounded with mrs inchbalds novel of that name the history of lace and historic devices badges and war cries his father and grandfather published political and medical works respectively while the generation below was equally prolific marryats youngest son frank described his travels in borneo and the eastern archipelago and mountains and molehills or recollections of a burnt journal and his daughter florence mrs lean the author of his life and letters has written a great many popular novels we can record little of marryats boyhood beyond a general impression of his discontent with schoolmasters and parents mr hannay is probably right in regarding his hard pictures of home and school life as reflections of his own experience it is said that on one occasion he was found to be engaged in the pursuit of knowledge while standing on his head and that he accounted for the circumstance with a humorous philosophy almost worthy of jack easywell ive been trying for three hours to learn it on my feet but i couldnt so i thought i would try whether it would be easier to learn it on my head another anecdote of a contest with his schoolfellow babbage is interesting and characteristic it appears that the inventor of the calculating machine unlike marryat was a very diligent lad and that he accordingly arranged with some kindred spirits to begin work at three in the morning the restless marryat wished to join the party but his motives were suspected and the conspirators adopted the simple expedient of not waking him marryat rolled his bed across the door and babbage pushed it away marryat tied a string from his wrist to the door handle and babbage unfastened it a thicker string was cut a chain was unlinked by pliers but at last the future captain forged a chain that was too stout for the future mathematician babbage however secured his revenge as soon as his comrade was safely asleep he slipped a piece of pack thread through the chain and carrying the other end to his own bed was enabled by a few rapid jerks to waken marryat whenever he chose apparently satisfied with his victory in the gentle art of tormenting babbage yielded voluntarily upon the original point of dispute marryat and others joined the reading party transformed it to a scene of carnival and were discovered by the authorities meanwhile marryat was constantly running awayto sea according to his own account because he was obliged to wear his elder brothers old clothes on one occasion his father injudiciously sent him back in a carriage with some money in his pocket the wise youth slipped out and finding his way home by some quiet approach carried off his younger brothers to the theatre he finally ran away from a private tutor and mr marryat recognised the wisdom of compliance being then fourteen that is of age to hold a commission frederick was allowed to enter the navy and on the rd of september he started on his first voyage on board hms imperieuse captain lord cochrane for the mediterranean he could scarcely have entered upon his career under better auspices in a lineofbattle ship he would have had no chance of service at this stage of the war when the most daring of the french could not be decoyed out of port but the frigates had always more exciting work on hand than mere patrolling there were cruisers to be captured privateers to be cut off convoys to be taken and work to be done on the coast among the forts and lord cochrane earl of dundonald was not the man to neglect his opportunities his daring gallantry and cool judgment are accredited to most of marryats captains particularly in frank mildmay where the cruise of the imperieuse along the spanish coast is most graphically and literally described cochranes autobiography betrays the strong stern individuality of the man invaluable in action somewhat disturbing in civil life as a reformer in season and out of season at the admiralty or in the house of commons his zeal became a byeword but marryat knew him only on board his frigate as an inspiring leader of men he never passed an opportunity of serving his country and winning renown but his daring was not reckless i must here remark says marryat in his private log that i never knew any one so careful of the lives of his ships company as lord cochrane or any one who calculated so closely the risks attending any expedition many of the most brilliant achievements were performed without loss of a single life so well did he calculate the chances and one half the merit which he deserves for what he did accomplish has never been awarded him merely because in the official despatches there has not been a long list of killed and wounded to please the appetite of the english public marryat has left us a graphic account of his first day at sea the imperieuse sailed the admiral of the port was one who would be obeyed but would not listen always to reason or common sense the signal for sailing was enforced by gun after gun the anchor was hove up and with all her stores on deck her guns not even mounted in a state of confusion unparalleled from her being obliged to hoist in faster than it was possible she could stow away she was driven out of harbour to encounter a heavy gale a few hours more would have enabled her to proceed to sea with security but they were denied the consequences were appalling they might have been fatal in the general confusion some iron too near the binnacles had attracted the needle of the compasses the ship was steered out of her course at midnight in a heavy gale at the close of november so dark that you could not distinguish any object however close the imperieuse dashed upon the rocks between ushant and the main the cry of terror which ran through the lower decks the grating of the keel as she was forced in the violence of the shocks which convulsed the frame of the vessel the hurrying up of the ships company without their clothes and then the enormous wave which again bore her up and carried her clean over the reef will never be effaced from my memory this after all was not an inappropriate introduction to the stormy three years which followed it the story is written in the novels particularly frank mildmay where every item of his varied and exciting experience is reproduced with dramatic effect it would be impossible to rival marryats narrative of episodes and we shall gain no sense of reality by adjusting the materials of fiction to an exact accordance with fact he says that these books except frank mildmay are wholly fictitious in characters in plot and in events but they are none the less truthful pictures of his life at sea cochranes autobiography contains a history of the imperieuse it is from peter simple and his companions that we must learn what marryat thought and suffered while on board under cochrane he cruised along the coast of france from ushant to the mouth of the gironde saw some active service in the mediterranean and after a return to the ocean was finally engaged in the basque roads a page of his private log contains a lively resume of the whole experience the cruises of the imperieuse were periods of continual excitement from the hour in which she hove up her anchor till she dropped it again in port the day that passed without a shot being fired in anger was to us a blank day the boats were hardly secured on the booms than they were cast loose and out again the yard and stay tackles were forever hoisting up and lowering down the expedition with which parties were formed for service the rapidity of the frigates movements night and day the hasty sleep snatched at all hours the waking up at the report of the guns which seemed the only keynote to the hearts of those on board the beautiful precision of our fire obtained by constant practice the coolness and courage of our captain inoculating the whole of the ships company the suddenness of our attacks the gathering after the combat the killed lamented the wounded almost envied the powder so burnt into our face that years could not remove it the proved character of every man and officer on board the implicit trust and adoration we felt for our commander the ludicrous situations which would occur in the extremest danger and create mirth when death was staring you in the face the hairbreadth escapes and the indifference to life shown by allwhen memory sweeps along these years of excitement even now my pulse beats more quickly with the reminiscence after some comparatively colourless service in other frigates during which he gained the personal familiarity with west indian life of which his novels show many traces he completed his time as a midshipman and in returned home to pass as a lieutenant his cruises were uneventful and after being several times invalided he was promoted commander in just as the great war was closing he was now only twentythree and had certainly received an admirable training for the work with which he was soon to enchant the public though never present at a great battle and many good officers were in the same position he had seen much smart service and knew from others what lay beyond his own experience he evidently took copious notes of all he saw and heard he had sailed in the north sea in the channel in the mediterranean and along the eastern coast of america from nova scotia to surinam he had been rapidly promoted it is tolerably obvious that both as midshipman and lieutenant he evinced the cool daring and manly independence that characterises his heroes with a dash perhaps of jack easys philosophy it was a rough life and he was not naturally amenable to discipline but probably his superiors made a favourite of the dashing handsome lad the habit which helps to redeem frank mildmay and even graces peter simple of saving others from drowning was always his own his daughter records with pardonable pride that he was presented while in the navy with twentyseven certificates recommendations and votes of thanks for having saved the lives of others at the risk of his own besides receiving a gold medal from the humane society during the peace of he occupied himself in acquiring a perfect knowledge of such branches of science as might prove useful should the lords of the admiralty think fit to employ him in a voyage of discovery or survey a vaguely projected expedition to africa was however relinquished on account of his marriage with catherine second daughter of sir stephen shairp knt of houston co linlithgow for many years her britannic majestys consulgeneral and twice charge daffaires at the court of russia which took place in january in this same year he was elected a fellow of the royal society according to tradition on account of his skill in drawing caricatures he was at sea again soon after his marriage as commander of the beaver sloop in which commission he was sent to mount guard over napoleon at st helena until his death he took a sketch of the dead emperor in full profile which was engraved in england and france and considered a striking likeness he was meanwhile no doubt perfecting the code of signals for the use of merchant vessels of all nations including the cipher for secret correspondence which was immediately adopted and secured to its inventor the cross of the legion of honour from louis philippe it was not actually published in book form till from which date its sale produced an appreciable income after returning in the rosario with the despatches concerning napoleons death he was sent to escort the body of queen caroline to cuxhaven he was then told off for revenue duty in the channel and had some smart cruising for smugglers until the rosario was pronounced unseaworthy and paid off on the nd of february as a result of this experience he wrote a long despatch to the admiralty in which he freely criticised the working of the preventive service and made some practical suggestions for its improvement in he also published suggestions for the abolition of the present system of impressment in the naval service a pamphlet which is said to have made him unpopular with royalty he frequently in his novels urges the same reform which he very earnestly desired he was appointed to the larne in march and saw some hard service against the burmese for which he received the thanks of the general and the indian government the companionship of the bath and the command of the ariadne two years later in november he resigned his ship and quitted active service according to mrs lean because of his appointment as equerry to his royal highness the duke of sussex he was probably influenced however by a distaste for routine duties in time of peace the claims of a growing family and literary ambitions he had already published frank mildmay and received for it the handsome sum of l and negotiations were very possibly on foot concerning the kings own of which the composition had been completed there is considerable difficulty in following the remainder of marryats life owing to the silence of our only authority mrs lean no reasons can be assigned for the sudden flittings in which he constantly indulged or for his hasty journeys to america and to the continent he was clearly impulsive in all things and though occasionally shrewd betrayed a mania for speculation moreover he was naturally addicted to the bohemian pleasures of life being somewhat promiscuous in hospitality and absolutely prodigal in the art of making presents to satisfy these various demands on his pocket he was often driven to spells of desperate work in spite of the really handsome sums he received from the publishers and editors with whom he was always at variance his first regular establishment was sussex house hampstead which he soon swapped after dinner and champagne for a small estate of acres at langham norfolk though he did not finally settle in the country till his original occupation of langham which realised him a steady annual deficit was followed by a return to london a visit to brighton and in a journey on the continent to brussels and lausanne he had meanwhile been contributing to the metropolitan magazine which he edited from to finally selling his proprietary rights to saunders and otley for l his editorial work was arduous and many of his own compositions were first published in the metropolitan here appeared newton forster peter simple jacob faithful midshipman easy and japhet in search of a father besides a comedy in three acts entitled the gipsy a tragedy called the cavalier of seville and the miscellaneous papers afterwards collected under the title olla podrida in he stood as a reformer for tower hamlets but his methods of canvassing were imprudent he dwelt upon his own hobbies and disregarded those of the electors he apparently expected to carry the day by opposing the pressgang in a time of peace and even permitted himself to repudiate philanthropy towards the african negro the gallantry with which on one occasion he saved the lives of his audience when the floor of the room had fallen in was not permitted to cover the rash energy of his reply to a persistent questionerif ever you or one of your sons should come under my command at sea and deserve punishment if there be no other effectual mode of conferring it i shall flog you it is hardly necessary to add that he lost the election he afterwards failed in a plan for the establishment of brevet rank in the army but gave some valuable assistance in the preparation of the merchant shipping bill of it was about this time that marryat is currently reported to have challenged fd maurice to a duel the latter had published an anonymous novel called eustace conway in which a prominent character represented in no amiable colours bore the name of captain marryat the truth of the story seems to be that the captain went in hot wrath to bentley and demanded an apology or a statement that the coincidence was unintentional maurice replied through his publisher that he had never heard of captain marryat it may be questioned whether the apology was not more galling than the original offence in some legal difficulties arose in connection with his fathers memory which marryat accepted with admirable philosophy as for the chancellors judgment he told his mother i cannot say that i thought anything about it on the contrary it appears to me that he might have been much more severe if he had thought proper it is easy to impute motives and difficult to disprove them i thought considering his enmity that he let us off cheap as there is no punishing a chancellor and he might say what he pleased with impunity i did not therefore roar i only smiled the effect will be nugatory not one in a thousand will read it those who do know it refers to a person not in this world and of those those who knew my father will not believe it those who did not will care little about it and forget the name in a week had he given the decision in our favour i should have been better pleased but its no use crying whats done cant be helped this letter was written from brighton and the following year found marryat on the continent at home in a circle of gay spirits who might almost be called the outcasts of english society they were pleasureseekers by no means necessarily depraved but by narrow incomes or other causes driven into a cheerful exile the captain was always ready to give and take in the matter of entertainment and he was invited everywhere though on one occasion at least it is recorded that he proved an uncongenial guest having dined as a recognised lion among lions he didnt make a single joke during the whole evening his host remarked on his silence the next morning and marryat replied oh if thats what you wanted you should have asked me when you were alone why did you imagine i was going to let out any of my jokes for those fellows to put in their next books no that is not my plan when i find myself in such company as that i open my ears and hold my tongue glean all i can and give them nothing in return he did not always however play the professional author so offensively and we hear of his taking part in private theatricals and dances preparing a christmas tree for the children and cleverly packing his friends portmanteaux meanwhile he was writing the pirate and three cutters for which he received l as well as snarleyyow and the pacha of many tales he had been contributing to the metropolitan at guineas a sheet until he paid a flying visit to england in in order to transfer his allegiance to the new monthly magazine from which he secured guineas mrs lean states that her father received l each for peter simple jacob faithful japhet and the pacha of many tales l for midshipman easy l for snarleyyow and l for the diary in america yet although captain marryat and his publishers mutually benefited by their transactions with each other one would have imagined from the letters exchanged between them that they had been natural enemies she relates how one of the fraternity told marryat he was somewhat eccentrican odd creature and added i am somewhat warmtempered myself and therefore make allowance for yours which is certainly warm enough marryat justified the charge by replying there was no occasion for you to make the admission that you are somewhat warmtempered your letter establishes that fact considering your age you are a little volcano and if the insurance were aware of your frequent visits at the royal exchange they would demand double premium for the building indeed i have my surmises now as to the last conflagration your remark as to the money i have received may sound well mentioned as an isolated fact but how does it sound when it is put in juxtaposition with the sums you have received i who have found everything receiving a pittance while you who have found nothing but the shop to sell in receiving such a lions share i assert again that it is slavery i am sinbad the sailor and you are the old man of the mountain clinging on my back and you must not be surprised at my wishing to throw you off the first convenient opportunity the fact is you have the vice of old age very strong upon you and you are blinded by it but put the question to your sons and ask them whether they consider the present agreement fair let them arrange with me and do you go and read your bible we all have our ideas of paradise and if other authors think like me the most pleasurable portion of anticipated bliss is that there will be no publishers there that idea often supports me after an interview with one of your fraternity marryat only returned to england a few months before hurrying off to america in april the reasons for this move it is impossible to conjecture as we can scarcely accept the apparent significance of his comments on switzerland in the diary on the continent do the faults of these people arise from the peculiarity of their constitutions or from the nature of their government to ascertain this one must compare them with those who live under similar institutions i must go to americathat is decided he was received by the americans with a curious mixture of suspicion and enthusiasm english men and women of letters in late years had been visiting the republic and criticising its institutions to the mother countrywith a certain forgetfulness of hospitalities received that was not to say the least of it in good taste marryat was also an author and it seemed only too probable that he had come to spy out the land on the other hand his books were immensely popular over the water and but for dread of possible consequences jonathan was delighted to see him his arrival at saratoga springs produced an outburst in the local papers of the most pronounced journalese this distinguished writer is at present a sojourner in our city before we knew the gallant captain was respiring our balmy air we really did wonder what laughing gas had imbued our atmosphereevery one we met in the streets appeared to be in such a state of jollification but when we heard that the author of peter simple was actually puffing a cigar amongst us we no longer marvelled at the pleasant countenances of our citizens he has often made them laugh when he was thousands of miles away surely now it is but natural that they ought to be tickled to death at the idea of having him present the bostonians were proud to claim him as a compatriot through his mother and a nautical drama from his penthe ocean wolf or the channel outlawwas performed at new york with acclamation he had some squabbles with american publishers concerning copyright and was clever enough to secure two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars from messrs carey hart for his forthcoming diary in america and the phantom ship which latter first appeared in the new monthly and he evidently pleased the americans on the whole and was not unfavourably impressed by what he saw but the six volumes which he produced on his return are only respectable specimens of bookmaking and do not repay perusal it was indeed his own opinion that he had already written enough if i were not rather in want of money he says in a letter to his mother i certainly would not write any more for i am rather tired of it i should like to disengage myself from the fraternity of authors and be known in future only in my profession as a good officer and seaman he had hoped to see some service in canada but the opportunity never came in england to which he returned in the want of money soon came to be felt more seriously his fathers fortune had been invested in the west indies and began to show diminishing returns for this and other reasons he led a very wandering existence for another four or five years until a year at duke street st james was followed by a short stay with his mother at wimbledon house from which he took chambers at piccadilly and then again moved to spanish place manchester square apparently at this time he made an unsuccessful attempt to return to active service he was meanwhile working hard at poor jack masterman ready the poacher percival keene etc and living hard in the merry circle of a literary bohemia with clarkson stanfield rogers dickens and forster to whom were sometimes added lady blessington ainsworth cruickshank and lytton the rival interests served to sour his spirits and weaken his constitution the publication of the poacher in the era newspaper involved its author in a very pretty controversy a foolish contributor to frasers magazine got into a rage with harrison ainsworth for condescending to write in the weekly papers and expressed himself as follows if writing monthly fragments threatened to deteriorate mr ainsworths productions what must be the result of this hebdomadal habit captain marryat we are sorry to say has taken to the same line both these popular authors may rely upon our warning that they will live to see their laurels fade unless they more carefully cultivate a spirit of selfrespect that which was venial in a miserable starveling of grub street is perfectly disgusting in the extravagantly paid novelists of these daysthe caressed of generous booksellers mr ainsworth and captain marryat ought to disdain such pitiful peddling let them eschew it without delay marryats reply was spirited and manly after ridiculing frasers attempt to set up a standard of precedency and rank in literature and humorously proving that an authors works were not to be esteemed in proportion to the length of time elapsing between their production he turned to the more serious and entirely honest defence that like dickens he was supplying the lower classes with wholesome recreation i would rather write for the instruction or even the amusement of the poor than for the amusement of the rich and i would sooner raise a smile or create an interest in the honest mechanic or agricultural labourer who requires relaxation than i would contribute to dispel the ennui of those who loll on their couches and wonder in their idleness what they shall do next is the rich man only to be amused are mirth and laughter to be made a luxury confined to the upper classes and denied to the honest and hardworking artisan in a moral point of view i hold that i am right we are educating the lower classes generations have sprung up who can read and write and may i enquire what it is that they have to read in the way of amusementfor i speak not of the bible which is for private examination they have scarcely anything but the weekly newspapers and as they cannot command amusement they prefer those which create the most excitement and this i believe to be the cause of the great circulation of the weekly dispatch which has but too well succeeded in demoralising the public in creating disaffection and illwill towards the government and assisting the nefarious views of demagogues and chartists it is certain that men would rather laugh than crywould rather be amused than rendered gloomy and discontentedwould sooner dwell upon the joys or sorrows of others in a tale of fiction than brood over their own supposed wrongs if i put good and wholesome food and as i trust sound moral before the lower classes they will eventually eschew that which is coarse and disgusting which is only resorted to because no better is supplied our weekly newspapers are at present little better than records of immorality and crime and the effect which arises from having no other matter to read and comment upon is of serious injury to the morality of the country i consider therefore that in writing for the amusement and instruction of the poor man i am doing that which has but been too much neglectedthat i am serving my country and you surely will agree with me that to do so in not infra dig in the proudest englishman and as a conservative you should commend rather than stigmatise my endeavours in the manner which you have so hastily done it has been said that marryats wandering ceased in and it was in that year that he settled down at langham to look after his own estate langham is in the northern division of norfolk half way between wellsnextthesea and holt the manor house says mrs lean without having any great architectural pretensions had a certain unconventional prettiness of its own it was a cottage in the elizabethan style built after the model of one at virginia water belonging to his late majesty george iv with latticed windows opening on to flights of stone steps ornamented with vases of flowers and leading down from the long narrow diningroom where surrounded by clarkson stanfields illustrations of poor jack with which the walls were clothed marryat composed his later works to the lawn behind the house was thatched and gabled and its pinkish white walls and round porch were covered with roses and ivy which in some parts climbed as high as the roof itself in the unpublished fragment of his life of lord napier marryat had declared that retired sailors naturally turned to agriculture and frequently made good farmers a sailor on land he rather quaintly remarks is but a sort of adama new creature starting into existence as it were in his prime and the greatest pleasures of man consist in imitating the deity in his creative power the anticipated pleasure in farming he did to a great extent realise but the profits were still to seek it can only be said that his losses were rather smaller that they had been in his absence thus total receipts l expenditure total receipts expenditure his former tenant had indeed shown but little respect for the property besides taking all he could out of the land without putting anything into it he fitted up the drawingroom of the manor which in its brightest days had been known in the village as the room of thousand columns from an effect produced by mirrors set in the panels of folding doors reflecting trellised pillars with rows of beds which he let out to tramps at twopence a night of these latter years on the farm we can gather some distinctly pleasant impressions marryat was evidently a good master at all times he delighted to arrange for festivities in the servants hall but he was also very tolerant to poachers and considered it his first duty to find work for his men when times were bad his model pigsties and cottages were unpopular but he loved his animals and understood them the chief merit of his lazy and somewhat asinine pony dumpling consisted in his talent for standing still upon this patient beast the captain would occasionally sally forth to shoot assisting his natural shortsightedness by a curious invention of his owna plain piece of crystal surrounded by a strip of whalebone hanging in front of his right eye from the brim of his shocking bad hat he was a careless dresser but scrupulously clean no smoker but very fond of snuff he had a fancy for pure white china which had to be procured from the continent cordial invitations from friends seldom drew him from his selfimposed labours and it appears that in spite of his sons debts and other domestic troubles he led a fairly contented existence among his dogs and his children to the latter though occasionally passionate he was a most indulgent father and friend he never locked anything away from them or shut them out of any room in the house though severe on falsehood and cowardice he was indifferent to mischief and one is certainly driven to pity for the governess who was summoned to look after them his methods in this connection were original he kept a quantity of small articles for presents in his secretary and at the termination of each week the children and governess armed with a report of their general behaviour were ushered with much solemnity into the library to render up an account those who had behaved well during the preceding seven days received a prize because they had been so good and those who had behaved ill also received one in hopes that they would never be naughty again the governess was also presented with a gift that her criticism on the justice of the transaction might be disarmed the father was not a strict disciplinarian and it is related that when a little one had made a large rent in a new frock for which she expected punishment from her governess and ran to him for advice he took hold of the rent and tore off the whole lower part of the skirt saying tell her i did it the sons were seldom at home but in spite of a certain constitutional wildness and lack of prudence they were evidently a gallant couple delighting their fathers heart frederick the eldest became a distinguished officer after conquering a strong propensity to practical joking and was much regretted in the service when wrecked at the age of twentyseven he was last seen upbraiding in his jocular manner some people who were frightened when a sea swept over the ship and took him with it frank was entered upon the roll of the navy at the tender age of three and presented to the port admiral of plymouth in full costume the officer patted him on the head saying well youre a fine little fellow to which the youngster replied and youre a fine old cock too he became a cultivated and bold traveller beloved by his friends and not unknown to fame he only survived his father a few years and died at the age of twentyeight marryat now began his charming series of stories for children a work to which he turned for a practical reason that sounds strangely from his impulsive lips i have lately taken to a different style of writing that is for young people my former productions like all novels have had their day and for the present at least will sell no more but it is not so with the juveniles they have an annual demand and become a little income to me which i infinitely prefer to receiving any sum in a mass which very soon disappears somehow or other save for a little tendency to preachment these volumes particularly masterman ready and the children of the new forest are admirably suited to their purpose from the genuine childlikeness of their conception and treatment meanwhile marryats health was rapidly giving way and almost his last appearance before the public was in when he addressed a pathetic but fairly dignified letter to the first lord of the admiralty as a protest against some affront which he suspected to his professional career the exact circumstances of the case cannot be now discovered but it may be readily conjectured that the formalism of official courtesy did not match with the captains taste and that the necessity for selfcontrol on his own part had irritated his resentment the first lord expressed his regret at having wounded a distinguished officer and bestowed on him a good service pension it may be said that the pension came too late if indeed it would at any time have been particularly serviceable marryat was now engaged in that melancholy chase for health which generally augurs the beginning of the end he had ruptured two blood vessels and was in great danger from the constitutional weakness which had first attacked him as a young lieutenant in the west indies he moved to his mothers house in order to consult the london doctors a mild climate was recommended and he went down to hastings where the news of his sons death destroyed his own chances of recovery after about a months trial of brighton he came back to the london doctors who told him that in six months he would be numbered with his forefathers he went home to langham to die through the summer of he lingered on in the room of a thousand columns with the mimic sky and birds and flowers above and around him where he chose to lie upon a mattress placed on the ground and there almost in darkness often in pain and without occupation he laycheerful and uncomplaining and at times even humorous his daughters frequently read aloud to him and he always asked for fresh flowers at the last he became delirious though continuing to dictate pages of talk and reflection on the morning of august th he expired in perfect quiet although not handsome says mrs lean captain marryats personal appearance was very prepossessing in figure he was upright and broadshouldered for his height which measured ft in his hands without being undersized were remarkably perfect in form and modelled by a sculptor at rome on account of their symmetry the character of his mind was borne out by his features the most salient expression of which was the frankness of an open heart the firm decisive mouth and massive thoughtful forehead were redeemed from heaviness by the humorous light that twinkled in his deepset grey eyes which bright as diamonds positively flashed out their fun or their reciprocation of the fun of others as a young man dark crisp curls covered his head but later in life when having exchanged the sword for the pen and the plougshare sic he affected a soberer and more patriarchal style of dress and manner he wore his grey hair long and almost down to his shoulder his eyebrows were not alike one being higher up and more arched than the other which peculiarity gave his face a look of enquiry even in repose in the upper lip was a deep cleft and in the chin as deep a dimple christopher north describes captain marryat as a captain in the navy and an honour to itan admirable sailor and an admirable writerand would that he were with us on the leads my lads for a pleasanter fellow to those who know him never enlivened the social board it is evident indeed that an intimate knowledge of his character was necessary to its appreciation for his daughter declares that like most warmhearted people he was quick to take offence and no one could have decided after an absence of six months with whom he was friends and with whom he was not one of the said friends wrote truly his faults proceeded from an overactive mind which could never be quietmorning noon or night if he had no one to love he quarrelled for want of something better to do he planned for himself and for everybody and changed his mind ten times aday many people have asked says mrs lean whether captain marryat when at home was not very funny no decidedly not in society with new topics to discuss and other wits about him on which to sharpen his own or like flint and steel to emit sparks by frictionhe was as gay and humorous as the best of them but at home he was always a thoughtful and at times a very grave man for he was not exempt from those ills that all flesh is heir to and had his sorrows and his difficulties and moments of depression like the rest of us at such times it was dangerous to thwart and disturb him for he was a man of strong passions and indomitable determination it is not difficult to conceive the character in outlinewise englishhearted captain marryat kingsley calls him he was incapable of any mean low vices but his zest for pleasure was keen and never restrained by motives of prudence or consideration for others his strong passions at times made him disagreeably selfish and overbearing qualities forgiven by acquaintances for his social brilliancy and by friends for his frank affection with some business talents and practical shrewdness he was quite incapable of wisely conducting his affairs by reason of a mania for speculation and originality there was considerable waste of good material in his fiery composition his books reveal the higher standard of his true nature their merits and faults are alike on the surface lockhart declared that he stood second in merit to no living novelist but miss edgeworth his happy delineations and contrasts of character and easy play of native fun redeem a thousand faults of verbosity clumsiness and coarseness his strong sense and utter superiority to affectation of all sorts command respect and in his quiet effectiveness of circumstantial narrative he sometimes approaches old defoe it is easy to criticise marryat for his grammar is reckless he could not construct a plot he wrote too much and too rapidly in order to earn money but then he was an altogether admirable raconteur and for the purposes of narration his style was peculiarly appropriatesimple rapid lucid and vigorous he does not tax our powers of belief beyond endurance or weary us with wonder his crises are the more effective from the absence of any studied introduction or thunderous comment and he carries his readers through stirring adventures of storm and battle with a businesslike precision that silences doubt he breathes the spirit of the sea himself a genuine sailor almost as childlike and simple as one of his own creations his books are real voyages in which a day of bustle and danger is followed by peace and quiet yarns on the quarterdeck and some practical joking among the middies he delights in the exhibition of oddities and the telling of tall stories outside the regular course of the narrative which bubbles over with somewhat boisterous fun and his humour is genuine and spontaneous it is farcical without descending to buffoonery his comic types are built up on character and if not subtle are undeniably human and living they are drawn moreover with sympathy the whole tone of marryats work is singularly fresh wholesome and manly his heroes endure rough handling but they fight their way for the most part to the essential qualities of gentlemen they are no saints but excellent comrades honest lovers and brave tars r brimley johnson footnotes in dwelling upon the autobiographical nature of the incident in frank mildmay it is necessary to guard against the supposition that

destiny is decided and i am consigned to a stockbroker as part of his majestys sea stockunfortunately for me mr handycock is a bear and i get very little dinner if i cannot narrate a life of adventurous and daring exploits fortunately i have no heavy crimes to confess and if i do not rise in the estimation of the reader for acts of gallantry and devotion in my countrys cause at least i may claim the merit of zealous and persevering continuance in my vocation we are all of us variously gifted from above and he who is content to walk instead of to run on his allotted path through life although he may not so rapidly attain the goal has the advantage of not being out of breath upon his arrival not that i mean to infer that my life has not been one of adventure i only mean to say that in all which has occurred i have been a passive rather than an active personage and if events of interest are to be recorded they certainly have not been sought by me as well as i can recollect and analyze my early propensities i think that had i been permitted to select my own profession i should in all probability have bound myself apprentice to a tailor for i always envied the comfortable seat which they appeared to enjoy upon the shopboard and their elevated position which enabled them to look down upon the constant succession of the idle or the busy who passed in review before them in the main street of the country town near to which i passed the first fourteen years of my existence but my father who was a clergyman of the church of england and the youngest brother of a noble family had a lucrative living and a soul above buttons if his son had not it has been from time immemorial the heathenish custom to sacrifice the greatest fool of the family to the prosperity and naval superiority of the country and at the age of fourteen i was selected as the victim if the custom be judicious i had no reason to complain there was not one dissentient voice when it was proposed before all the varieties of my aunts and cousins invited to partake of our newyears festival i was selected by general acclamation flattered by such an unanimous acknowledgment of my qualification and a stroke of my fathers hand down my head which accompanied it i felt as proud and alas as unconscious as the calf with gilded horns who plays and mumbles with the flowers of the garland which designates his fate to every one but himself i even felt or thought i felt a slight degree of military ardour and a sort of vision of future grandeur passed before me in the distant vista of which i perceived a coach with four horses and a service of plate it was however driven away before i could decipher it by positive bodily pain occasioned by my elder brother tom who having been directed by my father to snuff the candles took the opportunity of my abstraction to insert a piece of the still ignited cotton into my left ear but as my story is not a very short one i must not dwell too long on its commencement i shall therefore inform the reader that my father who lived in the north of england did not think it right to fit me out at the country town near to which we resided but about a fortnight after the decision which i have referred to he forwarded me to london on the outside of the coach with my best suit of bottlegreen and six shirts to prevent mistakes i was booked in the waybill to be delivered to mr thomas handycock no saint clements lanecarriage paid my parting with the family was very affecting my mother cried bitterly for like all mothers she liked the greatest fool which she had presented to my father better than all the rest my sisters cried because my mother cried tom roared for a short time more loudly than all the rest having been chastised by my father for breaking his fourth window in that weekduring all which my father walked up and down the room with impatience because he was kept from his dinner and like all orthodox divines he was tenacious of the only sensual enjoyment permitted to his cloth at last i tore myself away i had blubbered till my eyes were so red and swollen that the pupils were scarcely to be distinguished and tears and dirt had veined my cheeks like the marble of the chimneypiece my handkerchief was soaked through with wiping my eyes and blowing my nose before the scene was over my brother tom with a kindness which did honour to his heart exchanged his for mine saying with fraternal regard here peter take mine its as dry as a bone but my father would not wait for a second handkerchief to perform its duty he led me away through the hall when having shaken hands with all the men and kissed all the maids who stood in a row with their aprons to their eyes i quitted my paternal roof the coachman accompanied me to the place from whence the stage was to start having seen me securely wedged between two fat old women and having put my parcel inside he took his leave and in a few minutes i was on my road to london i was too much depressed to take notice of anything during my journey when we arrived in london they drove to the blue boar in a street the name of which i have forgotten i had never seen or heard of such an animal and certainly it did appear very formidable its mouth was open and teeth very large what surprised me still more was to observe that its teeth and hoofs were of pure gold who knows thought i that in some of the strange countries which i am doomed to visit but that i may fall in with and shoot one of these terrific monsters with what haste shall i select those precious parts and with what joy should i on my return pour them as an offering of filial affection into my mothers lapand then as i thought of my mother the tears again gushed into my eyes the coachman threw his whip to the ostler and the reins upon the horses backs he then dismounted and calling to me now young gentleman ise awaiting he put a ladder up for me to get down by then turning to a porter he said to him bill you must take this here young gemman and that ere parcel to this here directionplease to remember the coachman sir i replied that i certainly would if he wished it and walked off with the porter the coachman observing as i went away well he is a foolthats sartain i arrived quite safe at st clementslane when the porter received a shilling for his trouble from the maid who let me in and i was shown up into a parlour where i found myself in company with mrs handycock mrs handycock was a little meagre woman who did not speak very good english and who appeared to me to employ the major part of her time in bawling out from the top of the stairs to the servants below i never saw her either read a book or occupy herself with needlework during the whole time i was in the house she had a large grey parrot and i really cannot tell which screamed the worse of the twobut she was very civil and kind to me and asked me ten times a day when i had last heard of my grandfather lord privilege i observed that she always did so if any company happened to call in during my stay at her house before i had been there ten minutes she told me that she hadored sailorsthey were the defendiours and preserviours of their kings and countries and that mr handycock would be home by four oclock and then we should go to dinner then she jumped off her chair to bawl to the cook from the head of the stairsjemima jemimavell hae the viting biled instead of fried cant marm replied jemima they be all begged and crumbed with their tails in their mouths vell then never mind jemima replied the ladydont put your finger into the parrots cage my lovehes apt to be cross with strangers mr handycock will be home at four oclock and then we shall have our dinner are you fond of viting as i was very anxious to see mr handycock and very anxious to have my dinner i was not sorry to hear the clock on the stairs strike four when mrs handycock again jumped up and put her head over the banisters jemima jemima its four oclock i hear it marm replied the cook and she gave the fryingpan a twist which made the hissing and the smell come flying up into the parlour and made me more hungry than ever rap tap tap theres your master jemima screamed the lady i hear him marm replied the cook run down my dear and let mr handycock in said his wife hell be so surprised at seeing you open the door i ran down as mrs handycock desired me and opened the streetdoor who the devil are you in a gruff voice cried mr handycock a man about six feet high dressed in blue cottonnet pantaloons and hessian boots with a black coat and waistcoat i was a little rebuffed i must own but i replied that i was mr simple and pray mr simple what would your grandfather say if he saw you now i have servants in plenty to open my door and the parlour is the proper place for young gentlemen law mr handycock said his wife from the top of the stairs how can you be so cross i told him to open the door to surprise you and you have surprised me replied he with your cursed folly while mr handycock was rubbing his boots on the mat i went upstairs rather mortified i must own as my father had told me that mr handycock was his stockbroker and would do all he could to make me comfortable indeed he had written to that effect in a letter which my father showed to me before i left home when i returned to the parlour mrs handycock whispered to me never mind my dear its only because theres something wrong on change mr handycock is a bear just now i thought so too but i made no answer for mr handycock came upstairs and walking with two strides from the door of the parlour to the fireplace turned his back to it and lifting up his coattails began to whistle are you ready for your dinner my dear said the lady almost trembling if the dinner is ready for me i believe we usually dine at four answered her husband gruffly jemima jemima dish up do you hear jemima yes marm replied the cook directly ive thickened the butter and mrs handycock resumed her seat with well mr simple and how is your grandfather lord privilege he is quite well maam answered i for the fifteenth time at least but dinner put an end to the silence which followed this remark mr handycock lowered his coattails and walked downstairs leaving his wife and me to follow at our leisure pray maam inquired i as soon as he was out of hearing what is the matter with mr handycock that he is so cross to you vy my dear it is one of the misfortunes of matermony that ven the husbands put out the vife is sure to have her share of it mr handycock must have lost money on change and then he always comes home cross ven he vins then he is as merry as a cricket are you people coming down to dinner roared mr handycock from below yes my dear replied the lady i thought that you were washing your hands we descended into the diningroom where we found that mr handycock had already devoured two of the whitings leaving only one on the dish for his wife and me vould you like a little bit of viting my dear said the lady to me its not worth halving observed the gentleman in a surly tone taking up the fish with his own knife and fork and putting it on his plate well im so glad you like them my dear replied the lady meekly then turning to me theres some nice roast weal coming my dear the veal made its appearance and fortunately for us mr handycock could not devour it all he took the lions share nevertheless cutting off all the brown and then shoving the dish over to his wife to help herself and me i had not put two pieces in my mouth before mr handycock desired me to get up and hand him the porterpot which stood on the sideboard i thought that if it was not right for me to open a door neither was it for me to wait at tablebut i obeyed him without making a remark after dinner mr handycock went down to the cellar for a bottle of wine o deary me exclaimed his wife he must have lost a mint of moneywe had better go up stairs and leave him alone hell be better after a bottle of port perhaps i was very glad to go away and being very tired i went to bed without any tea for mrs handycock dared not venture to make it before her husband came up stairs chapter ii fitting out on the shortest noticefortunately for me this day mr handycock is a bear and i fare very welli set off for portsmouth behind the coach i meet a man before the masthe is disguised with liquor but is not the only disguise i fall in with in my journey the next morning mr handycock appeared to be in somewhat better humour one of the linendrapers who fitted out cadets c on the shortest notice was sent for and orders given for my equipment which mr handycock insisted should be ready on the day afterwards or the articles would be left on his hands adding that my place was already taken in the portsmouth coach really sir observed the man im afraidon such very short notice your card says the shortest notice rejoined mr handycock with the confidence and authority of a man who is enabled to correct another by his own assertions if you do not choose to undertake the work another will this silenced the man who made his promise took my measure and departed and soon afterwards mr handycock also quitted the house what with my grandfather and the parrot and mrs handycock wondering how much money her husband had lost running to the head of the stairs and talking to the cook the day passed away pretty well till four oclock when as before mrs handycock screamed the cook screamed the parrot screamed and mr handycock rapped at the door and was let inbut not by me he ascended the stair swith sic three bounds and coming into the parlour cried well nancy my love how are you then stooping over her give me a kiss old girl im as hungry as a hunter mr simple how do you do i hope you have passed the morning agreeably i must wash my hands and change my boots my love i am not fit to sit down to table with you in this pickle well polly how are you im glad youre hungry my dear ive such a nice dinner for you replied the wife all smiles jemima be quick and dish upmr handycock is so hungry yes marm replied the cook and mrs handycock followed her husband into his bedroom on the same floor to assist him at his toilet by jove nancy the bulls have been nicely taken in said mr handycock as we sat down to dinner o i am so glad replied his wife giggling and so i believe she was but why i did not understand mr simple said he will you allow me to offer you a little fish if you do not want it all yourself sir replied i politely mrs handycock frowned and shook her head at me while her husband helped me my dove a bit of fish we both had our share today and i never saw a man more polite than mr handycock he joked with his wife asked me to drink wine with him two or three times talked about my grandfather and in short we had a very pleasant evening the next morning all my clothes came home but mr handycock who still continued in good humour said that he would not allow me to travel by night that i should sleep there and set off the next morning which i did at six oclock and before eight i had arrived at the elephant and castle where we stopped for a quarter of an hour i was looking at the painting representing this animal with a castle on its back and assuming that of alnwick which i had seen as a fair estimate of the size and weight of that which he carried was attempting to enlarge my ideas so as to comprehend the stupendous bulk of the elephant when i observed a crowd assembled at the corner and asking a gentleman who sat by me in a plaid cloak whether there was not something very uncommon to attract so many people he replied not very for it is only a drunken sailor i rose from my seat which was on the hinder part of the coach that i might see him for it was a new sight to me and excited my curiosity when to my astonishment he staggered from the crowd and swore that hed go to portsmouth he climbed up by the wheel of the coach and sat down by me i believe that i stared at him very much for he said to me what are you gaping at you young sculping do you want to catch flies or did you never see a chap halfseasover before i replied that i had never been at sea in my life but that i was going well then youre like a young bear all your sorrows to comethats all my hearty replied he when you get on board youll find monkeys allowancemore kicks than halfpence i say you pewtercarrier bring us another pint of ale the waiter of the inn who was attending the coach brought out the ale half of which the sailor drank and the other half threw into the waiters face telling him that was his allowance and now said he whats to pay the waiter who looked very angry but appeared too much afraid of the sailor to say anything answered fourpence and the sailor pulled out a handful of banknotes mixed up with gold silver and coppers and was picking out the money to pay for his beer when the coachman who was impatient drove off theres cut and run cried the sailor thrusting all the money into his breeches pocket thats what youll learn to do my joker before youve been two cruises to sea in the meantime the gentleman in the plaid cloak who was seated by me smoked his cigar without saying a word i commenced a conversation with him relative to my profession and asked him whether it was not very difficult to learn larn cried the sailor interrupting us no it may be difficult for such chaps as me before the mast to larn but you i presume is a reefer and they ant got much to larn cause why they pipeclays their weekly accounts and walks up and down with their hands in their pockets you must larn to chaw baccy drink grog and call the cat a beggar and then you knows all a midshipmans expected to know nowadays arnt i right sir said the sailor appealing to the gentleman in a plaid cloak i axes you because i see youre a sailor by the cut of your jib beg pardon sir continued he touching his hat hope no offence i am afraid that you have nearly hit the mark my good fellow replied the gentleman the drunken fellow then entered into conversation with him stating that he had been paid off from the audacious at portsmouth and had come up to london to spend his money with his messmates but that yesterday he had discovered that a jew at portsmouth had sold him a seal as gold for fifteen shillings which proved to be copper and that he was going back to portsmouth to give the jew a couple of black eyes for his rascality and that when he had done that he was to return to his messmates who had promised to drink success to the expedition at the cock and bottle st martins lane until he should return the gentleman in the plaid cloak commended him very much for his resolution for he said that although the journey to and from portsmouth would cost twice the value of a gold seal yet that in the end it might be worth a jews eye what he meant i did not comprehend whenever the coach stopped the sailor called for more ale and always threw the remainder which he could not drink into the face of the man who brought it out for him just as the coach was starting off and then tossed the pewter pot on the ground for him to pick up he became more tipsy every stage and the last from portsmouth when he pulled out his money he could find no silver so he handed down a note and desired the waiter to change it the waiter crumpled it up and put it into his pocket and then returned the sailor the change for a onepound note but the gentleman in the plaid had observed that it was a fivepound note which the sailor had given and insisted upon the waiter producing it and giving the proper change the sailor took his money which the waiter handed to him begging pardon for the mistake although he coloured up very much at being detected i really beg your pardon said he again it was quite a mistake whereupon the sailor threw the pewter pot at the waiter saying i really beg your pardon tooand with such force that it flattened upon the mans head who fell senseless on the road the coachman drove off and i never heard whether the man was killed or not after the coach had driven off the sailor eyed the gentleman in the plaid cloak for a minute or two and then said when i first looked at you i took you for some officer in mufti but now that i see you look so sharp after the rhino its my idea that youre some poor devil of a scotchman mayhap second mate of a marchant vesseltheres half a crown for your servicesid give you more if i thought you would spend it the gentleman laughed and took the halfcrown which i afterwards observed that he gave to a greyheaded beggar at the bottom of portsdown hill i inquired of him how soon we should be at portsmouth he answered that we were passing the lines but i saw no lines and i was ashamed to show my ignorance he asked me what ship i was going to join i could not recollect her name but i told him it was painted on the outside of my chest which was coming down by the waggon all that i could recollect was that it was a french name have you no letter of introduction to the captain said he yes i have replied i and i pulled out my pocketbook in which the letter was captain savage hm ship diomede continued i reading to him to my surprise he very coolly proceeded to open the letter which when i perceived what he was doing occasioned me immediately to snatch the letter from him stating my opinion at the same time that it was a breach of honour and that in my opinion he was no gentleman just as you please youngster replied he recollect you have told me i am no gentleman he wrapped his plaid around him and said no more and i was not a little pleased at having silenced him by my resolute behaviour chapter iii i am made to look very blue at the blue postsfind wild spirits around and soon after hot spirits within me at length my spirits overcome me call to pay my respects to the captain and find that i had had the pleasure of meeting him beforeno sooner out of one scrape than into another when we stopped i inquired of the coachman which was the best inn he answered that it was the blue postesses where the midshipmen leave their chestesses call for tea and toastesses and sometimes forget to pay for their breakfastesses he laughed when he said it and i thought that he was joking with me but he pointed out two large blue posts at the door next the coachoffice and told me that all the midshipmen resorted to that hotel he then asked me to remember the coachman which by this time i had found out implied that i was not to forget to give him a shilling which i did and then went into the inn the coffeeroom was full of midshipmen and as i was anxious about my chest i inquired of one of them if he knew when the waggon would come in do you expect your mother by it replied he oh no but i expect my uniformsi only wear these bottlegreens until they come and pray what ship are you going to join the dieamaidcaptain thomas kirkwall savage the diomedei say robinson ant that the frigate in which the midshipmen had four dozen apiece for not having pipeclayed their weekly accounts on the saturday to be sure it is replied the other why the captain gave a youngster five dozen the other day for wearing a scarlet watchriband hes the greatest tartar in the service continued the other he flogged the whole starboard watch the last time that he was on a cruise because the ship would only sail nine knots upon a bowline oh dear said i then im very sorry that i am going to join him pon my soul i pity you youll be fagged to death for theres only three midshipmen in the ship nowall the rest ran away didnt they robinson theres only two left now for poor matthews died of fatigue he was worked all day and kept watch all night for six weeks and one morning he was found dead upon his chest god bless my soul cried i and yet on shore they say he is such a kind man to his midshipmen yes replied robinson he spreads that report every where now observe when you first call upon him and report your having come to join his ship hell tell you that he is very happy to see you and that he hopes your family are wellthen hell recommend you to go on board and learn your duty after that stand clear now recollect what i have said and see if it does not prove true come sit down with us and take a glass of grog it will keep your spirits up these midshipmen told me so much about my captain and the horrid cruelties which he had practised that i had some doubts whether i had not better set off home again when i asked their opinion they said that if i did i should be taken up as a deserter and hanged that my best plan was to beg his acceptance of a few gallons of rum for he was very fond of grog and that then i might perhaps be in his good graces as long as the rum might last i am sorry to state that the midshipmen made me very tipsy that evening i dont recollect being put to bed but i found myself there the next morning with a dreadful headache and a very confused recollection of what had passed i was very much shocked at my having so soon forgotten the injunctions of my parents and was making vows never to be so foolish again when in came the midshipman who had been so kind to me the night before come mr bottlegreen he bawled out alluding i suppose to the colour of my clothes rouse and bitt theres the captains coxswain waiting for you below by the powers youre in a pretty scrape for what you did last night did last night replied i astonished why does the captain know that i was tipsy i think you took devilish good care to let him know it when you were at the theatre at the theatre was i at the theatre to be sure you were you would go do all we could to prevent you though you were as drunk as davids sow your captain was there with the admirals daughters you called him a tyrant and snapped your fingers at him why dont you recollect you told him that you did not care a fig for him oh dear oh dear what shall i do what shall i do cried i my mother cautioned me so about drinking and bad company bad company you whelpwhat do you mean by that o i did not particularly refer to you i should hope not however i recommend you as a friend to go to the george inn as fast as you can and see your captain for the longer you stay away the worse it will be for you at all events it will be decided whether he receives you or not it is fortunate for you that you are not on the ships books come be quick the coxswain is gone back not on the ships books replied i sorrowfully now i recollect there was a letter from the captain to my father stating that he had put me on the books upon my honour im sorryvery sorry indeed replied the midshipman and he quitted the room looking as grave as if the misfortune had happened to himself i got up with a heavy head and heavier heart and as soon as i was dressed i asked the way to the george inn i took my letter of introduction with me although i was afraid it would be of little service when i arrived i asked with a trembling voice whether captain thomas kirkwall savage of hm ship diomede was staying there the waiter replied that he was at breakfast with captain courtney but that he would take up my name i gave it him and in a minute the waiter returned and desired that i would walk up o how my heart beati never was so frightenedi thought i should have dropped on the stairs twice i attempted to walk into the room and each time my legs failed me at last i wiped the perspiration from my forehead and with a desperate effort i went into the room mr simple i am glad to see you said a voice i had held my head down for i was afraid to look at him but the voice was so kind that i mustered up courage and when i did look up there sat with his uniform and epaulets and his sword by his side the passenger in the plaid cloak who wanted to open my letter and whom i had told to his face that he was no gentleman i thought i should have died as the other midshipman did upon his chest i was just sinking down upon my knees to beg for mercy when the captain perceiving my confusion burst out into a laugh and said so you know me again mr simple well dont be alarmed you did your duty in not permitting me to open the letter supposing me as you did to be some other person and you were perfectly right under that supposition to tell me that i was not a gentleman i give you credit for your conduct now sit down and take some breakfast captain courtney said he to the other captain who was at the table this is one of my youngsters just entering the service we were passengers yesterday by the same coach he then told him the circumstance which occurred at which they laughed heartily i now recovered my spirits a littlebut still there was the affair at the theatre and i thought that perhaps he did not recognize me i was however soon relieved from my anxiety by the other captain inquiring were you at the theatre last night savage no i dined at the admirals theres no getting away from those girls they are so pleasant i rather think you are a littletaken in that quarter no on my word i might be if i had time to discover which i liked best but my ship is at present my wife and the only wife i intend to have until i am laid on the shelf well thought i if he was not at the theatre it could not have been him that i insulted now if i can only give him the rum and make friends with him pray mr simple how are your father and mother said the captain very well i thank you sir and desire me to present their compliments i am obliged to them now i think the sooner you go on board and learn your duty the better just what the midshipman told methe very words thought ithen its all trueand i began to tremble again i have a little advice to offer you continued the captain in the first place obey your superior officers without hesitation it is for me not you to decide whether an order is unjust or not in the next place never swear or drink spirits the first is immoral and ungentlemanlike the second is a vile habit which will grow upon you i never touch spirit myself and i expect that my young gentlemen will refrain from it also now you may go and as soon as your uniforms arrive you will repair on board in the meantime as i had some little insight into your character when we travelled together let me recommend you not to be too intimate at first sight with those you meet or you may be led into indiscretions good morning i quitted the room with a low bow glad to have surmounted so easily what appeared to be a chaos of difficulty but my mind was confused with the testimony of the midshipman so much at variance with the language and behaviour of the captain when i arrived at the blue posts i found all the midshipmen in the coffeeroom and i repeated to them all that had passed when i had finished they burst out laughing and said that they had only been joking with me well said i to the one who had called me up in the morning you may call it joking but i call it lying pray mr bottlegreen do you refer to me yes i do replied i then sir as a gentleman i demand satisfaction slugs in a sawpit death before dishonour de i shall not refuse you replied i although i had rather not fight a duel my father cautioned me on the subject desiring me if possible to avoid it as it was flying in the face of my creator but aware that i must uphold my character as an officer he left me to my own discretion should i ever be so unfortunate as to be in such a dilemma well we dont want one of your fathers sermons at secondhand replied the midshipman for i had told them that my father was a clergyman the plain question is will you fight or will you not could not the affair be arranged otherwise interrupted another will not mr bottlegreen retract my name is simple sir and not bottlegreen replied i and as he did tell a falsehood i will not retract then the affair must go on said the midshipman robinson will you oblige me by acting as my second its an unpleasant business replied the other you are so good a shot but as you request it i shall not refuse mr simple is not i believe provided with a friend yes he is replied another of the midshipmen he is a spunky fellow and ill be his second it was then arranged that we should meet the next morning with pistols i considered that as an officer and a gentleman i could not well refuse but i was very unhappy not three days left to my own guidance and i had become intoxicated and was now to fight a duel i went up into my room and wrote a long letter to my mother enclosing a lock of my hair and having shed a few tears at the idea of how sorry she would be if i were killed i borrowed a bible from the waiter and read it during the remainder of the day chapter iv i am taught on a cold morning before breakfast how to stand fire and thus prove my courageafter breakfast i also prove my gallantrymy proof meets reproofwoman at the bottom of all mischiefby one i lose my liberty and by another my money when i began to wake the next morning i could not think what it was that felt like a weight upon my chest but as i roused and recalled my scattered thoughts i remembered that in an hour or two it would be decided whether i were to exist another day i prayed fervently and made a resolution in my own mind that i would not have the blood of another upon my conscience and would fire my pistol up in the air and after i had made that resolution i no longer felt the alarm which i did before before i was dressed the midshipman who had volunteered to be my second came into my room and informed me that the affair was to be decided in the garden behind the inn that my adversary was a very good shot and that i must expect to be winged if not drilled and what is winged and drilled inquired i i have not only never fought a duel but i have not even fired a pistol in my life he explained what he meant which was that being winged implied being shot through the arm or leg whereas being drilled was to be shot through the body but continued he is it possible that you have never fought a duel no replied i i am not yet fifteen years old not fifteen why i thought you were eighteen at the least but i was very tall and stout for my age and people generally thought me older than i actually was i dressed myself and followed my second into the garden where i found all the midshipmen and some of the waiters of the inn they all seemed very merry as if the life of a fellowcreature was of no consequence the seconds talked apart for a little while and then measured the ground which was twelve paces we then took our stations i believe that i turned pale for my second came to my side and whispered that i must not be frightened i replied that i was not frightened but that i considered that it was an awful moment the second to my adversary then came up and asked me whether i would make an apology which i refused to do as before they handed a pistol to each of us and my second showed me how i was to pull the trigger it was arranged that at the word given we were to fire at the same time i made sure that i should be wounded if not killed and i shut my eyes as i fired my pistol in the air i felt my head swim and thought i was hurt but fortunately i was not the pistols were loaded again and we fired a second time the seconds then interfered and it was proposed that we should shake hands which i was very glad to do for i considered my life to have been saved by a miracle we all went back to the coffeeroom and sat down to breakfast they then told me that they all belonged to the same ship that i did and that they were glad to see that i could stand fire for the captain was a terrible fellow for cuttingout and running under the enemys batteries the next day my chest arrived by the waggon and i threw off my bottlegreens and put on my uniform i had no cocked hat or dirk as the warehouse people employed by mr handycock did not supply those articles and it was arranged that i should procure them at portsmouth when i inquired the price i found that they cost more money than i had in my pocket so i tore up the letter i had written to my mother before the duel and wrote another asking for a remittance to purchase my dirk and cocked hat i then walked out in my uniform not a little proud i must confess i was now an officer in his majestys service not very high in rank certainly but still an officer and a gentleman and i made a vow that i would support the character although i was considered the greatest fool of the family i had arrived opposite a place called sally port when a young lady very nicely dressed looked at me very hard and said well reefer how are you off for soap i was astonished at the question and more so at the interest which she seemed to take in my affairs i answered thank you i am very well off i have four cakes of windsor and two bars of yellow for washing she laughed at my reply and asked me whether i would walk home and take a bit of dinner with her i was astonished at this polite offer which my modesty induced me to ascribe more to my uniform than to my own merits and as i felt no inclination to refuse the compliment i said that i should be most happy i thought i might venture to offer my arm which she accepted and we proceeded up high street on our way to her home just as we passed the admirals house i perceived my captain walking with two of the admirals daughters i was not a little proud to let him see that i had female acquaintances as well as he had and as i passed him with the young lady under my protection i took off my hat and made him a low bow to my surprise not only did he not return the salute but he looked at me with a very stern countenance i concluded that he was a very proud man and did not wish the admirals daughters to suppose that he knew midshipmen by sight but i had not exactly made up my mind on the subject when the captain having seen the ladies into the admirals house sent one of the messengers after me to desire that i would immediately come to him at the george inn which was nearly opposite i apologised to the young lady and promised to return immediately if she would wait for me but she replied if that was my captain it was her idea that i should have a confounded wigging and be sent on board so wishing me goodbye she left me and continued her way home i could as little comprehend all this as why the captain looked so black when i passed him but it was soon explained when i went up to him in the parlour at the george inn i am sorry mr simple said the captain when i entered that a lad like you should show such early symptoms of depravity still more so that he should not have the grace which even the most hardened are not wholly destitute ofi mean to practise immorality in secret and not degrade themselves and insult their captain by unblushingly avowing i may say glorying in their iniquity by exposing it in broad day and in the most frequented street of the town sir replied i with astonishment o dear o dear what have i done the captain fixed his keen eyes upon me so that they appeared to pierce me through and nail me to the wall do you pretend to say sir that you were not aware of the character of the person with whom you were walking just now no sir replied i except that she was very kind and goodnatured and then i told him how she had addressed me and what subsequently took place and is it possible mr simple that you are so great a fool i replied that i certainly was considered the greatest fool of our family i should think you were replied he drily he then explained to me who the person was with whom i was in company and how any association with her would inevitably lead to my ruin and disgrace i cried very much for i was shocked at the narrow escape which i had had and mortified at having fallen in his good opinion he asked me how i had employed my time since i had been at portsmouth and i made an acknowledgment of having been made tipsy related all that the midshipmen had told me and how i had that morning fought a duel he listened to my whole story very attentively and i thought that occasionally there was a smile upon his face although he bit his lips to prevent it when i had finished he said mr simple i can no longer trust you on shore until you are more experienced in the world i shall desire my coxswain not to lose sight of you until you are safe on board of the frigate when you have sailed a few months with me you will then be able to decide whether i deserve the character which the young gentlemen have painted with i must say i believe the sole intention of practising upon your inexperience altogether i did not feel sorry when it was over i saw that the captain believed what i had stated and that he was disposed to be kind to me although he thought me very silly the coxswain in obedience to his orders accompanied me to the blue posts i packed up my clothes paid my bill and the porter wheeled my chest down to the sally port where the boat was waiting come heave ahead my lads be smart the captain says we are to take the young gentleman on board directly his libertys stopped for getting drunk and running after the dolly mops i should thank you to be more respectful in your remarks mr coxswain said i with displeasure mister coxswain thanky sir for giving me a handle to my name replied he come be smart with your oars my lads la bill freeman said a young woman on the beach what a nice young gentleman you have there he looks like a sucking nelson i say my pretty young officer could you lend me a shilling i was so pleased at the woman calling me a young nelson that i immediately complied with her request i have not a shilling in my pocket said i but here is halfacrown and you can change it and bring me back the eighteen pence well you are a nice young man replied she taking the halfcrown ill be back directly my dear the men in the boat laughed and the coxswain desired them to shove off no observed i you must wait for my eighteen pence we shall wait a devilish long while then i suspect i know that girl and she has a very bad memory she cannot be so dishonest or ungrateful replied i coxswain i order you to stayi am an officer i know you are sir about six hours old well then i must go up and tell the captain that you have another girl in tow and that you wont go on board oh no mr coxswain pray dont shove off as soon as you please and never mind the eighteen pence the boat then shoved off and pulled towards the ship which lay at spithead chapter v i am introduced to the quarterdeck and first lieutenant who pronounces me very clevertrotted below to mrs trotterconnubial bliss in a cockpitmr trotter takes me in as a messmatefeel very much surprised that so many people know that i am the son ofmy father on our arrival on board the coxswain gave a note from the captain to the first lieutenant who happened to be on deck he read the note looked at me earnestly and then i overheard him say to another lieutenant the service is going to the devil as long as it was not popular if we had not much education we at least had the chance that natural abilities gave us but now that great people send their sons for a provision into the navy we have all the refuse of their families as if anything was good enough to make a captain of a manofwar who has occasionally more responsibility on his shoulders and is placed in situations requiring more judgment than any other people in existence heres another of the fools of a family made a present of to the countryanother cub for me to lick into shape well i never saw the one yet i did not make something of wheres mr simple i am mr simple sir replied i very much frightened at what i had overheard now mr simple said the first lieutenant observe and pay particular attention to what i say the captain tells me in this note that you have been shamming stupid now sir i am not to be taken in that way youre something like the monkeys who wont speak because they are afraid they will be made to work i have looked attentively at your face and i see at once that you are very clever and if you do not prove so in a very short time whyyou had better jump overboard thats all perfectly understand me i know that you are a very clever fellow and having told you so dont you pretend to impose upon me for it wont do i was very much terrified at this speech but at the same time i was pleased to hear that he thought me clever and i determined to do all in my power to keep up such an unexpected reputation quartermaster said the first lieutenant tell mr trotter to come on deck the quartermaster brought up mr trotter who apologized for being so dirty as he was breaking casks out of the hold he was a short thickset man about thirty years of age with a nose which had a red club to it very dirty teeth and large black whiskers mr trotter said the first lieutenant here is a young gentleman who has joined the ship introduce him into the berth and see his hammock slung you must look after him a little i really have very little time to look after any of them sir replied mr trotter but i will do what i can follow me youngster accordingly i descended the ladder after him then i went down another and then to my surprise i was desired by him to go down a third which when i had done he informed me that i was in the cockpit now youngster said mr trotter seating himself upon a large chest you may do as you please the midshipmens mess is on the deck above this and if you like to join why you can but this i will tell you as a friend that you will be thrashed all day long and fare very badly the weakest always goes to the wall there but perhaps you do not mind that now that we are in harbour i mess here because mrs trotter is on board she is a very charming woman i can assure you and will be here directly she has just gone up into the galley to look after a net of potatoes in the copper if you like it better i will ask her permission for you to mess with us you will then be away from the midshipmen who are a sad set and will teach you nothing but what is immoral and improper and you will have the advantage of being in good society for mrs trotter has kept the very best in england i make you this offer because i want to oblige the first lieutenant who appears to take an interest about you otherwise i am not very fond of having any intrusion upon my domestic happiness i replied that i was much obliged to him for his kindness and that if it would not put mrs trotter to an inconvenience i should be happy to accept of his offer indeed i thought myself very fortunate in having met with such a friend i had scarcely time to reply when i perceived a pair of legs cased in black cotton stockings on the ladder above us and it proved that they belonged to mrs trotter who came down the ladder with a net full of smoking potatoes upon my word mrs trotter you must be conscious of having a very pretty ankle or you would not venture to display it as you have to mr simple a young gentleman whom i beg to introduce to you and who with your permission will join our mess my dear trotter how cruel of you not to give me warning i thought that nobody was below i declare im so ashamed continued the lady simpering and covering her face with the hand which was unemployed it cant be helped now my love neither was there anything to be ashamed of i trust mr simple and you will be very good friends i believe i mentioned his desire to join our mess i am sure i shall be very happy in his company this is a strange place for me to live in mr simple after the society to which i have been accustomed but affection can make any sacrifice and rather than lose the company of my dear trotter who has been unfortunate in pecuniary matters say no more about it my love domestic happiness is everything and will enliven even the gloom of a cockpit and yet continued mrs trotter when i think of the time when we used to live in london and keep our carriage have you ever been in london mr simple i answered that i had then probably you may have been acquainted with or have heard of the smiths i replied that the only people that i knew there were a mr and mrs handycock well if i had known that you were in london i should have been very glad to have given you a letter of introduction to the smiths they are quite the topping people of the place but my dear interrupted mr trotter is it not time to look after our dinner yes i am going forward for it now we have skewer pieces today mr simple will you excuse me and then with a great deal of flirtation and laughing about her ankles and requesting me as a favour to turn my face away mrs trotter ascended the ladder as the reader may wish to know what sort of looking personage she was i will take this opportunity to describe her her figure was very good and at one period of her life i thought her face must have been very handsome at the time i was introduced to her it showed the ravages of time or hardship very distinctly in short she might be termed a faded beauty flaunting in her dress and not very clean in her person charming woman mrs trotter is she not mr simple said the masters mate to which of course i immediately acquiesced now mr simple continued he there are a few arrangements which i had better mention while mrs trotter is away for she would be shocked at our talking about such things of course the style of living which we indulge in is rather expensive mrs trotter cannot dispense with her tea and her other little comforts at the same time i must put you to no extra expensei had rather be out of pocket myself i propose that during the time you mess with us you shall only pay one guinea per week and as for entrance money why i think i must not charge you more than a couple of guineas have you any money yes i replied i have three guineas and a half left well then give me the three guineas and the halfguinea you can reserve for pocketmoney you must write to your friends immediately for a further supply i handed him the money which he put in his pocket your chest continued he you shall bring down here for mrs trotter will i am sure if i request it not only keep it in order for you but see that your clothes are properly mended she is a charming woman mrs trotter and very fond of young gentlemen how old are you i replied that i was fifteen no more well i am glad of that for mrs trotter is very particular after a certain age i should recommend you on no account to associate with the other midshipmen they are very angry with me because i would not permit mrs trotter to join their mess and they are sad storytellers that they certainly are replied i but here we were interrupted by mrs trotter coming down with a piece of stick in her hand upon which were skewered about a dozen small pieces of beef and pork which she first laid on a plate and then began to lay the cloth and prepare for dinner mr simple is only fifteen my dear observed mr trotter dear me replied mrs trotter why how tall he is he is quite as tall for his age as young lord foutretown whom you used to take out with you in the chay do you know lord foutretown mr simple no i do not maam replied i but wishing to let them know that i was well connected i continued but i dare say that my grandfather lord privilege does god bless me is lord privilege your grandfather well i thought i saw a likeness somewhere dont you recollect lord privilege my dear trotter that we met at lady scampsan elderly person its very ungrateful of you not to recollect him for he sent you a very fine haunch of venison privilegebless me yes oh yes an old gentleman is he not said mr trotter appealing to me yes sir replied i quite delighted to find myself among those who were acquainted with my family well then mr simple said mrs trotter since we have the pleasure of being acquainted with your family i shall now take you under my own charge and i shall be so fond of you that trotter shall become quite jealous added she laughing we have but a poor dinner today for the bumboat woman disappointed me i particularly requested her to bring me off a leg of lamb but she says that there was none in the market it is rather early for it thats true but trotter is very nice in his eating now let us sit down to dinner i felt very sick indeed and could eat nothing our dinner consisted of the pieces of beef and pork the potatoes and a baked pudding in a tin dish mr trotter went up to serve the spirits out to the ships company and returned with a bottle of rum have you got mr simples allowance my love inquired mrs trotter yes he is victualled today as he came on board before twelve oclock do you drink spirits mr simple no i thank you replied i for i remembered the captains injunction taking as i do such an interest in your welfare i must earnestly recommend you to abstain from them said mr trotter it is a very bad habit and once acquired not easy to be left off i am obliged to drink them that i may not check the perspiration after working in the hold i have nevertheless a natural abhorrence of them but my champagne and claret days are gone by and i must submit to circumstances my poor trotter said the lady well continued he its a poor heart that never rejoiceth he then poured out half a tumbler of rum and filled the glass up with water my love will you taste it now trotter you know that i never touch it except when the water is so bad that i must have the taste taken away how is the water today as usual my dear not drinkable after much persuasion mrs trotter agreed to sip a little out of his glass i thought that she took it pretty often considering that she did not like it but i felt so unwell that i was obliged to go on the maindeck there i was met by a midshipman whom i had not seen before he looked very earnestly in my face and then asked my name simple said he what are you the son of old simple yes sir replied i astonished that so many should know my family well i thought so by the likeness and how is your father very well i thank you sir when you write to him make my compliments and tell him that i desired to be particularly remembered to him and he walked forward but as he forgot to mention his own name i could not do it i went to bed very tired mr trotter had my hammock hung up in the cockpit separated by a canvasscreen from the cot in which he slept with his wife i thought this very odd but they told me it was the general custom on board ship although mrs trotters delicacy was very much shocked by it i was very sick but mrs trotter was very kind when i was in bed she kissed me and wished me good night and very soon afterwards i fell fast asleep chapter vi puzzled with very common wordsmrs trotter takes care of my wardrobea matrimonial duet ending con strepito i awoke the next morning at daylight with a noise over my head which sounded like thunder i found it proceeded from holystoning and washing down the maindeck i was very much refreshed nevertheless and did not feel the least sick or giddy mr trotter who had been up at four oclock came down and directed one of the marines to fetch me some water i washed myself on my chest and then went on the maindeck which they were swabbing dry standing by the sentry at the cabindoor i met one of the midshipmen with whom i had been in company at the blue posts so master simple old trotter and his faggot of a wife have got hold of youhave they said he i replied that i did not know the meaning of faggot but that i considered mrs trotter a very charming woman at which he burst into a loud laugh well said he ill just give you a caution take care or theyll make a clean sweep has mrs trotter shown you her ankle yet yes i replied and a very pretty one it is ah shes at her old tricks you had much better have joined our mess at once youre not the first greenhorn that they have plucked well said he as he walked away keep the key of your own chestthats all but as mr trotter had warned me that the midshipmen would abuse them i paid very little attention to what he said when he left me i went on the quarterdeck all the sailors were busy at work and the first lieutenant cried out to the gunner now mr dispart if you are ready well breech these guns now my lads said the first lieutenant we must slue the part that breeches cover more forward as i never heard of a gun having breeches i was very anxious to see what was going on and went up close to the first lieutenant who said to me youngster hand me that monkeys tail i saw nothing like a monkeys tail but i was so frightened that i snatched up the first thing that i saw which was a short bar of iron and it so happened that it was the very article which he wanted when i gave it to him the first lieutenant looked at me and said so you know what a monkeys tail is already do you now dont you ever sham stupid after that thought i to myself im very lucky but if thats a monkeys tail its a very stiff one i resolved to learn the names of everything as fast as i could that i might be prepared so i listened attentively to what was said but i soon became quite confused and despaired of remembering anything how is this to be finished off sir inquired a sailor of the boatswain why i beg leave to hint to you sir in the most delicate manner in the world replied the boatswain that it must be with a doublewalland be dd to youdont you know that yet captain of the foretop said he up on your horses and take your stirrups up three inchesay ay sir i looked and looked but i could see no horses mr chucks said the first lieutenant to the boatswain what blocks have we belownot on charge let me see sir ive one sister tother we split in half the other day and i think i have a couple of monkeys down in the storeroomi say you smith pass that brace through the bulls eye and take the sheepshank out before you come down and then he asked the first lieutenant whether something should not be fitted with a mouse or only a turks headtold him the gooseneck must be spread out by the armourer as soon as the forge was up in short what with dead eyes and shrouds cats and catblocks dolphins and dolphinstrikers whips and puddings i was so puzzled with what i heard that i was about to leave the deck in absolute despair and mr chucks recollect this afternoon that you bleed all the buoys bleed the boys thought i what can that be for at all events the surgeon appears to be the proper person to perform that operation this last incomprehensible remark drove me off the deck and i retreated to the cockpit where i found mrs trotter oh my dear said she i am glad you are come as i wish to put your clothes in order have you a list of themwhere is your key i replied that i had not a list and i handed her the key although i did not forget the caution of the midshipman yet i considered that there could be no harm in her looking over my clothes when i was present she unlocked my chest and pulled everything out and then commenced telling me what were likely to be useful and what were not now these worsted stockings she said will be very comfortable in cold weather and in the summer time these brown cotton socks will be delightfully cool and you have enough of each to last you till you outgrow them but as for these fine cotton stockings they are of no useonly catch the dirt when the decks are swept and always look untidy i wonder how they could be so foolish as to send them nobody wears them on board ship nowadays they are only fit for womeni wonder if they would fit me she turned her chair away and put on one of my stockings laughing the whole of the time then she turned round to me and showed me how nicely they fitted her bless you mr simple its well that trotter is in the hold hed be so jealousdo you know what these stockings cost they are of no use to you and they fit me i will speak to trotter and take them off your hands i replied that i could not think of selling them and as they were of no use to me and fitted her i begged that she would accept of the dozen pairs at first she positively refused but as i pressed her she at last consented and i was very happy to give them to her as she was very kind to me and i thought with her husband that she was a very charming woman we had beefsteaks and onions for dinner that day but i could not bear the smell of the onions mr trotter came down very cross because the first lieutenant had found fault with him he swore that he would cut the servicethat he had only remained to oblige the captain who said that he would sooner part with his right arm and that he would demand satisfaction of the first lieutenant as soon as he could obtain his discharge mrs trotter did all she could to pacify him reminded him that he had the protection of lord this and sir thomas that who would see him righted but in vain the first lieutenant had told him he said that he was not worth his salt and blood only could wipe away the insult he drank glass of grog after glass of grog and at each glass became more violent and mrs trotter drank also i observed a great deal more than i thought she ought to have done but she whispered to me that she drank it that trotter might not as he would certainly be tipsy i thought this very devoted on her part but they sat so late that i went to bed and left themhe still drinking and vowing vengeance against the first lieutenant i had not been asleep above two or three hours when i was awakened by a great noise and quarrelling and i discovered that mr trotter was drunk and beating his wife very much shocked that such a charming woman should be beaten and illused i scrambled out of my hammock to see if i could be of any assistance but it was dark although they scuffled as much as before i asked the marine who was sentry at the gunroom door above to bring his lantern and was very much shocked at his replying that i had better go to bed and let them fight it out shortly afterwards mrs trotter who had not taken off her clothes came from behind the screen i perceived at once that the poor woman could hardly stand she reeled to my chest where she sat down and cried i pulled on my clothes as fast as i could and then went up to her to console her but she could not speak intelligibly after attempting in vain to comfort her she made me no answer but staggered to my hammock and after several attempts succeeded in getting into it i cannot say that i much liked that but what could i do so i finished dressing myself and went up on the quarterdeck the midshipman who had the watch was the one who had cautioned me against the trotters he was very friendly to me well simple said he what brings you on deck i told him how ill mr trotter had behaved to his wife and how she had turned into my hammock the cursed drunken old catamaran cried he ill go and cut her down by the head but i requested he would not as she was a lady a lady replied he yes theres plenty of ladies of her description and then he informed me that she had many years ago been the mistress of a man of fortune who kept a carriage for her but that he grew tired of her and had given trotter l to marry her and that now they did nothing but get drunk together and fight with each other i was very much annoyed to hear all this but as i perceived that mrs trotter was not sober i began to think that what the midshipman said was true i hope added he that she has not had time to wheedle you out of any of your clothes i told him that i had given her a dozen pairs of stockings and had paid mr trotter three guineas for my mess this must be looked to replied he i shall speak to the first lieutenant tomorrow in the mean time i shall get your hammock for you quartermaster keep a good lookout he then went below and i followed him to see what he would do he went to my hammock and lowered it down at one end so that mrs trotter lay with her head on the deck in a very uncomfortable position to my astonishment she swore at him in a dreadful manner but refused to turn out he was abusing her and shaking her in the hammock when mr trotter who had been roused at the noise rushed from behind the screen you villain what are you doing with my wife cried he pommelling at him as well as he could for he was so tipsy that he could hardly stand i thought the midshipman able to take care of himself and did not wish to interfere so i remained above looking onthe sentry standing by me with his lantern over the coombings of the hatchway to give light to the midshipman and to witness the fray mr trotter was soon knocked down when all of a sudden mrs trotter jumped up from the hammock and caught the midshipman by the hair and pulled at him then the sentry thought right to interfere he called out for the masteratarms and went down himself to help the midshipman who was faring badly between the two but mrs trotter snatched the lantern out of his hand and smashed it all to pieces and then we were all left in darkness and i could not see what took place although the scuffling continued such was the posture of affairs when the masteratarms came up with his light the midshipman and sentry went up the ladder and mr and mrs trotter continued beating each other to this none of them paid any attention saying as the sentry had said before let them fight it out after they had fought some time they retired behind the screen and i followed the advice of the midshipman and got into my hammock which the masteratarms hung up again for me i heard mr and mrs trotter both crying and kissing each other cruel cruel mr trotter said she blubbering my life my love i was so jealous replied he dn and blast your jealousy replied the lady ive two nice black eyes for the galley tomorrow after about an hour of kissing and scolding they both fell asleep again the next morning before breakfast the midshipman reported to the first lieutenant the conduct of mr trotter and his wife i was sent for and obliged to acknowledge that it was all true he sent for mr trotter who replied that he was not well and could not come on deck upon which the first lieutenant ordered the sergeant of marines to bring him up directly mr trotter made his appearance with one eye closed and his face very much scratched did not i desire you sir said the first lieutenant to introduce this young gentleman into the midshipmens berth instead of which you have introduced him to that disgraceful wife of yours and have swindled him out of his property i order you immediately to return the three guineas which you received as messmoney and also that your wife give back the stockings which she cajoled him out of but then i interposed and told the first lieutenant that the stockings had been a free gift on my part and that although i had been very foolish yet that i considered that i could not in honour demand them back again well youngster replied the first lieutenant perhaps your ideas are correct and if you wish it i will not enforce that part of my order but continued he to mr trotter i desire sir that your wife leave the ship immediately and i trust that when i have reported your conduct to the captain he will serve you in the same manner in the meantime you will consider yourself under an arrest for drunkenness chapter vii scandalum magnatum clearly provedi prove to the captain that i consider him a gentleman although i had told him the contrary and i prove to the midshipmen that i am a gentleman myselfthey prove their gratitude by practising upon me because practice makes perfect the captain came on board about twelve oclock and ordered the discharge of mr trotter to be made out as soon as the first lieutenant had reported what had occurred he then sent for all the midshipmen on the quarterdeck gentlemen said the captain to them with a stern countenance i feel very much indebted to some of you for the character which you have been pleased to give of me to mr simple i must now request that you will answer a few questions which i am about to put in his presence did i ever flog the whole starboard watch because the ship would only sail nine knots on a bowline no sir no replied they all very much frightened did i ever give a midshipman four dozen for not having his weekly accounts pipeclayed or another five dozen for wearing a scarlet watch ribbon no sir replied they all together did any midshipman ever die on his chest from fatigue they again replied in the negative then gentlemen you will oblige me by stating which of you thought proper to assert these falsehoods in a public coffeeroom and further which of you obliged this youngster to risk his life in a duel they were all silent will you answer me gentlemen with respect to the duel sir replied the midshipman who had fought me i heard say that the pistols were only charged with powder it was a joke well sir well allow that the duel was only a joke and i hope and trust that your report is correct is the reputation of your captain only a joke allow me to ask i request to know who of you dared to propagate such injurious slander here there was a dead pause well then gentlemen since you will not confess yourselves i must refer to my authority mr simple have the goodness to point out the person or persons who gave you the information but i thought this would not be fair and as they had all treated me very kindly after the duel i resolved not to tell so i answered if you please sir i consider that i told you all that in confidence confidence sir replied the captain who ever heard of confidence between a postcaptain and a midshipman no sir replied i not between a postcaptain and a midshipman but between two gentlemen the first lieutenant who stood by the captain put his hand before his face to hide a laugh he may be a fool sir observed he to the captain aside but i can assure you he is a very straight forward one the captain bit his lip and then turning to the midshipmen said you may thank mr simple gentlemen that i do not press this matter further i do believe that you were not serious when you calumniated me but recollect that what is said in joke is too often repeated in earnest i trust that mr simples conduct will have its effect and that you leave off practising upon him who has saved you from a very severe punishment when the midshipmen went down below they all shook hands with me and said that i was a good fellow for not peaching but as for the advice of the captain that they should not practise upon me as he termed it they forgot that for they commenced again immediately and never left off until they found that i was not to be deceived any longer i had not been ten minutes in the berth before they began their remarks upon me one said that i looked like a hardy fellow and asked me whether i could not bear a great deal of sleep i replied that i could i dare say if it was necessary for the good of the service at which they laughed and i supposed that i had said a good thing why heres tomkins said the midshipman hell show you how to perform that part of your duty he inherits it from his father who was a marine officer he can snore for fourteen hours on a stretch without once turning round in his hammock and finish his nap on the chest during the whole of the day except mealtimes but tomkins defended himself by saying that some people were very quick in doing things and others were very slow that he was one of the slow ones and that he did not in reality obtain more refreshment from his long naps than other people did in short ones because he slept much slower than they did this ingenious argument was however overruled nem con as it was proved that he ate pudding faster than any one in the mess the postman came on board with the letters and put his head into the midshipmans berth i was very anxious to have one from home but i was disappointed some had letters and some had not those who had not declared that their parents were very undutiful and that they would cut them off with a shilling and those who had letters after they had read them offered them for sale to the others usually at halfprice i could not imagine why they sold or why the others bought them but they did do so and one that was full of good advice was sold three times from which circumstance i was inclined to form a better opinion of the morals of my companions the lowestpriced letters sold were those written by sisters i was offered one for a penny but i declined buying as i had plenty of sisters of my own directly i made that observation they immediately inquired all their names and ages and whether they were pretty or not when i had informed them they quarrelled to whom they should belong one would have lucy and another took mary but there was a great dispute about ellen as i had said that she was the prettiest of the whole at last they agreed to put her up to auction and she was knocked down to a masters mate of the name of obrien who bid seventeen shillings and a bottle of rum they requested that i would write home to give their love to my sisters and tell them how they had been disposed of which i thought very strange but i ought to have been flattered at the price bid for ellen as i repeatedly have since been witness to a very pretty sister being sold for a glass of grog i mentioned the reason why i was so anxious for a letter viz because i wanted to buy my dirk and cocked hat upon which they told me that there was no occasion for my spending my money as by the regulations of the service the pursers steward served them out to all the officers who applied for them as i knew where the pursers stewards room was having seen it when down in the cockpit with the trotters i went down immediately mr pursers steward said i let me have a cocked hat and a dirk immediately very good sir replied he and he wrote an order upon a slip of paper which he handed to me there is the order for it sir but the cocked hats are kept in the chest up in the maintop and as for the dirk you must apply to the butcher who has them under his charge i went up with the order and thought i would first apply for the dirk so i inquired for the butcher whom i found sitting in the sheeppen with the sheep mending his trousers in reply to my demand he told me that he had not the key of the storeroom which was under the charge of one of the corporals of marines i inquired who and he said cheeks the marine i went everywhere about the ship inquiring for cheeks the marine but could not find him some said that they believed he was in the foretop standing sentry over the wind that it might not change others that he was in the galley to prevent the midshipmen from soaking their biscuit in the captains drippingpan at last i inquired of some of the women who were standing between the guns on the maindeck and one of them answered that it was no use looking for him among them as they all had husbands and cheeks was a widows man as i could not find the marine i thought i might as well go for my cocked hat and get my dirk afterwards i did not much like going up the rigging because i was afraid of turning giddy and if i fell overboard i could not swim but one of the midshipmen offered to accompany me stating that i need not be afraid if i fell overboard of sinking to the bottom as if i was giddy my head at all events would swim so i determined to venture i climbed up very near to the maintop but not without missing the little ropes very often and grazing the skin of my shins then i came to large ropes stretched out from the mast so that you must climb them with your head backwards the midshipman told me these were called the catharpings because they were so difficult to climb that a cat would expostulate if ordered to go out by them i was afraid to venture and then he proposed that i should go through lubbers hole which he said had been made for people like me i agreed to attempt it as it appeared more easy and at last arrived quite out of breath and very happy to find myself in the maintop the captain of the maintop was there with two other sailors the midshipman introduced me very politelymr jenkinsmr simple midshipmanmr simple mr jenkins captain of the maintop mr jenkins mr simple has come up with an order for a cocked hat the captain of the top replied that he was very sorry that he had not one in store but the last had been served out to the captains monkey this was very provoking the captain of the top then asked me if i was ready with my footing i replied not very for i had lost it two or three times when coming up he laughed and replied that i should lose it altogether before i went down and that i must hand it out hand out my footing said i puzzled and appealing to the midshipman what does he mean he means that you must fork out a sevenshilling bit i was just as wise as ever and stared very much when mr jenkins desired the other men to get half a dozen foxes and make a spread eagle of me unless he had his parkisite i never should have found out what it all meant had not the midshipman who laughed till he cried at last informed me that it was the custom to give the men something to drink the first time that i came aloft and that if i did not they would tie me up to the rigging having no money in my pocket i promised to pay them as soon as i went below but mr jenkins would not trust me i then became very angry and inquired of him if he doubted my honour he replied not in the least but that he must have the seven shillings before i went below why sir said i do you know whom you are speaking to i am an officer and a gentleman do you know who my grandfather is o yes replied he very well then who is he sir replied i very angrily who is he why hes the lord knows who no replied i thats not his name he is lord privilege i was very much surprised that he knew that my grandfather was a lord and do you suppose continued i that i would forfeit the honour of my family for a paltry seven shillings this observation of mine and a promise on the part of the midshipman who said he would be bail for me satisfied mr jenkins and he allowed me to go down the rigging i went to my chest and paid the seven shillings to one of the topmen who followed me and then went up on the maindeck to learn as much as i could of my profession i asked a great many questions of the midshipmen relative to the guns and they crowded round me to answer them one told me they were called the frigates teeth because they stopped the frenchmans jaw another midshipman said that he had been so often in action that he was called the fireeater i asked him how it was that he escaped being killed he replied that he always made it a rule upon the first cannonball coming through the ships side to put his head into the hole which it had made as by a calculation made by professor innman the odds were and some decimals to boot that another ball would not come in at the same hole thats what i never should have thought of footnotes this celebrated personage is the prototype of mr nobody on board of a manofwar b widows men are imaginary sailors borne on the books and receiving pay and prizemoney which is appropriated to greenwich hospital chapter viii my messmates show me the folly of running in debtduty carried on politelyi become acquainted with some gentlemen of the home departmentthe episode of sholto mfoy now that i have been on board about a month i find that my life is not disagreeable i dont smell the pitch and tar and i can get into my hammock without tumbling out on the other side my messmates are goodtempered although they laugh at me very much but i must say that they are not very nice in their ideas of honour they appear to consider that to take you in is a capital joke and that because they laugh at the time that they are cheating you it then becomes no cheating at all now i cannot think otherwise than that cheating is cheating and that a person is not a bit more honest because he laughs at you in the bargain a few days after i came on board i purchased some tarts of the bumboat woman as she is called i wished to pay for them but she had no change and very civilly told me she would trust me she produced a narrow book and said that she would open an account with me and i could pay her when i thought proper to this arrangement i had no objection and i sent up for different things until i thought that my account must have amounted to eleven or twelve shillings as i promised my father that i never would run in debt i considered that it was then time that it should be settled when i asked for it what was my surprise to find that it amounted to l s d i declared that it was impossible and requested that she would allow me to look at the items when i found that i was booked for at least three or four dozen tarts every day ordered by the young gentlemen to be put down to mr simples account i was very much shocked not only at the sum of money which i had to pay but also at the want of honesty on the part of my messmates but when i complained of it in the berth they all laughed at me at last one of them said peter tell the truth did not your father caution you not to run in debt yes he did replied i i know that very well replied he all fathers do the same when their sons leave them its a matter of course now observe peter it is out of regard to you that your messmates have been eating tarts at your expense you disobeyed your fathers injunctions before you had been a month from home and it is to give you a lesson that may be useful in afterlife that they have considered it their duty to order the tarts i trust that it will not be thrown away upon you go to the woman pay your bill and never run up another that i certainly shall not replied i but as i could not prove who ordered the tarts and did not think it fair that the woman should lose her money i went up and paid the bill with a determination never to open an account with anybody again but this left my pockets quite empty so i wrote to my father stating the whole transaction and the consequent state of my finances my father in his answer observed that whatever might have been their motives my messmates had done me a friendly act and that as i had lost my money by my own carelessness i must not expect that he would allow me any more pocketmoney but my mother who added a postscript to his letter slipped in a fivepound note and i do believe that it was with my fathers sanction although he pretended to be very angry at my forgetting his injunctions this timely relief made me quite comfortable again what a pleasure it is to receive a letter from ones friends when far away especially when there is same money in it a few days before this mr falcon the first lieutenant ordered me to put on my sidearms to go away on duty i replied that i had neither dirk nor cocked hat although i had applied for them he laughed at my story and sent me on shore with the master who bought them and the first lieutenant sent up the bill to my father who paid it and wrote to thank him for his trouble that morning the first lieutenant said to me now mr simple well take the shine off that cocked hat and dirk of yours you will go in the boat with mr obrien and take care that none of the men slip away from it and get drunk at the tap this was the first time that i had ever been sent away on duty and i was very proud of being an officer in charge i put on my full uniform and was ready at the gangway a quarter of an hour before the men were piped away we were ordered to the dockyard to draw sea stores when we arrived there i was quite astonished at the piles of timber the ranges of storehouses and the immense anchors which lay on the wharf there was such a bustle every body appeared to be so busy that i wanted to look every way at once close to where the boat landed they were hauling a large frigate out of what they called the basin and i was so interested with the sight that i am sorry to say i quite forgot all about the boats crew and my orders to look after them what surprised me most was that although the men employed appeared to be sailors their language was very different from what i had been lately accustomed to on board of the frigate instead of damning and swearing everybody was so polite oblige me with a pull of the starboard bow hawser mr jonesease off the larboard hawser mr jenkins if you please side her over gentlemen side her overmy compliments to mr tompkins and request that he will cast off the quartercheckside her over gentlemen side her over if you pleasein the boat there pull to mr simmons and beg hell do me the favour to check her as she swings whats the matter mr johnsonvy theres one of them ere midshipmites has thrown a red hot tater out of the sternport and hit our officer in the eyereport him to the commissioner mr wiggins and oblige me by underrunning the guesswarp tell mr simkins with my compliments to coil away upon the jetty side her over side her over gentlemen if you please i asked of a bystander who these people were and he told me that they were dockyard mateys i certainly thought that it appeared to be quite as easy to say if you please as dn your eyes and that it sounded much more agreeable during the time that i was looking at the frigate being hauled out two of the men belonging to the boat slipped away and on my return they were not to be seen i was very much frightened for i knew that i had neglected my duty and that on the first occasion on which i had been intrusted with a responsible service what to do i did not know i ran up and down every part of the dockyard until i was quite out of breath asking everybody i met whether they had seen my two men many of them said that they had seen plenty of men but did not exactly know mine some laughed and called me a greenhorn at last i met a midshipman who told me that he had seen two men answering to my description on the roof of the coach starting for london and that i must be quick if i wished to catch them but he would not stop to answer any more questions i continued walking about the yard until i met twenty or thirty men with grey jackets and breeches to whom i applied for information they told me that they had seen two sailors skulking behind the piles of timber they crowded round me and appeared very anxious to assist me when they were summoned away to carry down a cable i observed that they all had numbers on their jackets and either one or two bright iron rings on their legs i could not help inquiring although i was in such a hurry why the rings were worn one of them replied that they were orders of merit given to them for their good behaviour i was proceeding on very disconsolately when as i turned a corner to my great delight i met my two men who touched their hats and said that they had been looking for me i did not believe that they told the truth but i was so glad to recover them that i did not scold but went with them down to the boat which had been waiting some time for us obrien the masters mate called me a young sculping a word i never heard before when we arrived on board the first lieutenant asked obrien why he had remained so long he answered that two of the men had left the boat but that i had found them the first lieutenant appeared to be pleased with me observing as he had said before that i was no fool and i went down below overjoyed at my good fortune and very much obliged to obrien for not telling the whole truth after i had taken off my dirk and cocked hat i felt for my pockethandkerchief and found that it was not in my pocket having in all probability been taken out by the men in grey jackets whom in conversation with my messmates i discovered to be convicts condemned to hard labour for stealing and picking pockets a day or two afterwards we had a new messmate of the name of mfoy i was on the quarterdeck when he came on board and presented a letter to the captain inquiring first if his name was captain sauvage he was a florid young man nearly six feet high with sandy hair yet very goodlooking as his career in the service was very short i will tell at once what i did not find out till some time afterwards the captain had agreed to receive him to oblige a brother officer who had retired from the service and lived in the highlands of scotland the first notice which the captain had of the arrival of mr mfoy was from a letter written to him by the young mans uncle this amused him so much that he gave it to the first lieutenant to read it ran as follows glasgow april sirour much esteemed and mutual friend captain malpine having communicated by letter dated the th inst your kind intentions relative to my nephew sholto mfoy for which you will be pleased to accept my best thanks i write to acquaint you that he is now on his way to join your ship the diomede and will arrive god willing twentysix hours after the receipt of this letter as i have been given to understand by those who have some acquaintance with the service of the king that his equipment as an officer will be somewhat expensive i have considered it but fair to ease your mind as to any responsibility on that score and have therefore enclosed the half of a bank of england note for ten pounds sterling no the other half of which will be duly forwarded in a frank promised to me the day after tomorrow i beg you will make the necessary purchases and apply the balance should there be any to his mess account or any other expenses which you may consider warrantable or justifiable it is at the same time proper to inform you that sholto had ten shillings in his pocket at the time of his leaving glasgow the satisfactory expenditure of which i have no doubt you will inquire into as it is a large sum to be placed at the discretion of a youth only fourteen years and five months old i mention his age as sholto is so tall that you might be deceived by his appearance and be induced to trust to his prudence in affairs of this serious nature should he at any time require further assistance beyond his pay which i am told is extremely handsome to all kings officers i beg you to consider that any draught of yours at ten days sight to the amount of five pounds sterling english will be duly honoured by the firm of monteith mkillop and company of glasgow sir with many thanks for your kindness and consideration i remain your most obedient walter monteith the letter brought on board by mfoy was to prove his identity while the captain read it mfoy stared about him like a wild stag the captain welcomed him to the ship asked him one or two questions introduced him to the first lieutenant and then went on shore the first lieutenant had asked me to dine in the gunroom i supposed that he was pleased with me because i had found the men and when the captain pulled on shore he also invited mr mfoy when the following conversation took place well mr mfoy you have had a long journey i presume it is the first that you have ever made indeed it is sir replied mfoy and sorely ive been pestered had i minded all they whispered in my lug as i came along i had need been made of moneysaxpence here saxpence there saxpence every where sich extortion i neer dreamt of how did you come from glasgow by the wheelboat or steamboat as they cad it to lunnon where they charged me saxpence for taking my baggage on shorea wee boxy nae bigger than yon cockedup hat i would fain carry it mysel but they wadna let me well where did you go to when you arrived in london i went to a place cad chichester rents to the house of storm and mainwaring warehousemen and they must have another saxpence for showing me the way there i waited halfanhour in the countinghouse till they took me to a place cad bull and mouth and put me into a coach paying my whole fare nevertheless they must din me for money the whole of the way down there was first the guard and then the coachman and another guard and another coachman but i wudna listen to them and so they growled and abused me and when did you arrive i came here last night and i only had a bed and a breakfast at the twa blue pillars house for which they extortioned me three shillings and saxpence as i sit here and then there was the chambermaid hussy and waiter loon axed me to remember them and wanted more siller but i told them as i told the guard and coachman that i had none for them how much of your ten shillings have you left inquired the first lieutenant smiling hoot sir lieutenant how came you for to ken that eh its my uncle monteith at glasgow why as i sit here ive but three shillings and a penny of it lift but theres a smell here thats no canny so ill just go up again into the fresh air when mr mfoy quitted the gunroom they all laughed very much after he had been a short time on deck he went down into the midshipmens berth but he made himself very unpleasant quarrelling and wrangling with everybody it did not however last very long for he would not obey any orders that were given to him on the third day he quitted the ship without asking the permission of the first lieutenant when he returned on board the following day the first lieutenant put him under an arrest and in charge of the sentry at the cabin door during the afternoon i was under the halfdeck and perceived that he was sharpening a long claspknife upon the aftertruck of the gun i went up to him and asked him why he was doing so and he replied as his eyes flashed fire that it was to revenge the insult offered to the bluid of mfoy his look told me that he was in earnest but what do you mean inquired i i mean said he drawing the edge and feeling the point of his weapon to put it into the weam of that man with the gold podge on his shoulder who has dared to place me here i was very much alarmed and thought it my duty to state his murderous intentions or worse might happen so i walked up on deck and told the first lieutenant what mfoy was intending to do and how his life was in danger mr falcon laughed and shortly afterwards went down on the maindeck mfoys eyes glistened and he walked forward to where the first lieutenant was standing but the sentry who had been cautioned by me kept him back with his bayonet the first lieutenant turned round and perceiving what was going on desired the sentry to see if mr mfoy had a knife in his hand and he had it sure enough open and held behind his back he was disarmed and the first lieutenant perceiving that the lad meant mischief reported his conduct to the captain on his arrival on board the captain sent for mfoy who was very obstinate and when taxed with his intention would not deny it or even say that he would not again attempt it so he was sent on shore immediately and returned to his friends in the highlands we never saw any more of him but i heard that he obtained a commission in the army and three months after he had joined his regiment was killed in a duel resenting some fancied affront offered to the bluid of mfoy footnote peters memory is short p ed chapter ix we post up to portsdown fairconsequence of disturbing a lady at supper natural affection of the pelican proved at my expensespontaneous combustion at ranelagh gardenspastry versus pietymany are bid to the feast but not the halt the lame or the blind a few days after mfoy quitted the ship we all had leave from the first lieutenant to go to portsdown fair but he would only allow the oldsters to sleep on shore we anticipated so much pleasure from our excursion that some of us were up early enough to go away in the boat sent for fresh beef this was very foolish there were no carriages to take us to the fair nor indeed any fair so early in the morning the shops were all shut and the blue posts where we always rendezvoused was hardly opened we waited there in the coffeeroom until we were driven out by the maid sweeping away the dirt and were forced to walk about until she had finished and lighted the fire when we ordered our breakfast but how much better would it have been to have taken our breakfast comfortably on board and then to have come on shore especially as we had no money to spare next to being too late being too soon is the worst plan in the world however we had our breakfast and paid the bill then we sallied forth and went up georgestreet where we found all sorts of vehicles ready to take us to the fair we got into one which they called a dilly i asked the man who drove it why it was so called and he replied because he only charged a shilling obrien who had joined us after breakfasting on board said that this answer reminded him of one given to him by a man who attended the hackneycoach stands in london pray said he why are you called waterman waterman replied the man vy sir cause we opens the hackneycoach doors at last with plenty of whipping and plenty of swearing and a great deal of laughing the old horse whose back curved upwards like a bow from the difficulty of dragging so many arrived at the bottom of portsdown hill where we got out and walked up to the fair it really was a most beautiful sight the bright blue sky and the coloured flags flapping about in all directions the grass so green and the white tents and booths the sun shining so bright and the shining gilt gingerbread the variety of toys and the variety of noise the quantity of people and the quantity of sweetmeats little boys so happy and shoppeople so polite the music at the booths and the bustle and eagerness of the people outside made my heart quite jump there was richardson with a clown and harlequin and such beautiful women dressed in clothes all over gold spangles dancing reels and waltzes and looking so happy there was flint and gyngell with fellows tumbling over head and heels playing such trickseating fire and drawing yards of tape out of their mouths then there was the royal circus all the horses standing in a line with men and women standing on their backs waving flags while the trumpeters blew their trumpets and the largest giant in the world and mr paap the smallest dwarf in the world and a female dwarf who was smaller still and miss biffin who did everything without legs or arms there was also the learned pig and the herefordshire ox and a hundred other sights which i cannot now remember we walked about for an hour or two seeing the outside of every thing we determined to go and see the inside first we went into richardsons where we saw a bloody tragedy with a ghost and thunder and afterwards a pantomime full of tricks and tumbling over one another then we saw one or two other things i forget what but this i know that generally speaking the outside was better than the inside after this feeling very hungry we agreed to go into a booth and have something to eat the tables were ranged all round and in the centre there was a boarded platform for dancing the ladies were there all ready dressed for partners and the music was so lively that i felt very much inclined to dance but we had agreed to go and see the wild beasts fed at mr politos menagerie and as it was now almost eight oclock we paid our bill and set off it was a very curious sight and better worth seeing than any thing in the fair i never had an idea that there were so many strange animals in existence they were all secured in iron cages and a large chandelier with twenty lights hung in the centre of the booth and lighted them up while the keeper went round and stirred them up with his long pole at the same time he gave us their histories which were very interesting i recollect a few of them there was the tapir a great pig with a long nose a variety of the hiptostamass which the keeper said was an amphibilious animal as couldnt live on land and dies in the waterhowever it seemed to live very well in a cage then there was the kangaroo with its young ones peeping out of ita most astonishing animal the keeper said that it brought forth two young ones at a birth and then took them into its stomach again until they arrived at years of discretion then there was the pelican of the wilderness i shall not forget him with a large bag under his throat which the man put on his head as a nightcap this bird feeds its young with its own bloodwhen fish are scarce and there was the laughing hyaena who cries in the wood like a human being in distress and devours those who come to his assistancea sad instance of the depravity of human nature as the keeper observed there was a beautiful creature the royal bengal tiger only three years old what growed ten inches every year and never arrived at its full growth the one we saw measured as the keeper told us sixteen feet from the snout to the tail and seventeen from the tail to the snout but there must have been some mistake there there was a young elephant and three lions and several other animals which i forget now so i shall go on to describe the tragical scene which occurred the keeper had poked up all the animals and had commenced feeding them the great lion was growling and snarling over the shinbone of an ox cracking it like a nut when by some mismanagement one end of the pole upon which the chandelier was suspended fell down striking the door of the cage in which the lioness was at supper and bursting it open it was all done in a second the chandelier fell the cage opened and the lioness sprang out i remember to this moment seeing the body of the lioness in the air and then all was dark as pitch what a change not a moment before all of us staring with delight and curiosity and then to be left in darkness horror and dismay there was such screaming and shrieking such crying and fighting and pushing and fainting nobody knew where to go or how to find their way out the people crowded first on one side and then on the other as their fears instigated them i was very soon jammed up with my back against the bars of one of the cages and feeling some beast lay hold of me behind made a desperate effort and succeeded in climbing up to the cage above not however without losing the seat of my trowsers which the laughing hyaena would not let go i hardly knew where i was when i climbed up but i knew the birds were mostly stationed above however that i might not have the front of my trowsers torn as well as the behind as soon as i gained my footing i turned round with my back to the bars of the cage but i had not been there a minute before i was attacked by something which digged into me like a pickaxe and as the hyaena had torn my clothes i had no defence against it to turn round would have been worse still so after having received above a dozen stabs i contrived by degrees to shift my position until i was opposite to another cage but not until the pelican for it was that brute had drawn as much blood from me as would have fed his young for a week i was surmising what danger i should next encounter when to my joy i discovered that i had gained the open door from which the lioness had escaped i crawled in and pulled the door to after me thinking myself very fortunate and there i sat very quietly in a corner during the remainder of the noise and confusion i had been there but a few minutes when the beefeaters as they were called who played the music outside came in with torches and loaded muskets the sight which presented itself was truly shocking twenty or thirty men women and children lay on the ground and i thought at first the lioness had killed them all but they were only in fits or had been trampled down by the crowd no one was seriously hurt as for the lioness she was not to be found and as soon as it was ascertained that she had escaped there was as much terror and scampering away outside as there had been in the menagerie it appeared afterwards that the animal had been as much frightened as we had been and had secreted herself under one of the waggons it was some time before she could be found at last obrien who was a very brave fellow went ahead of the beefeaters and saw her eyes glaring they borrowed a net or two from the carts which had brought calves to the fair and threw them over her when she was fairly entangled they dragged her by the tail into the menagerie all this while i had remained very quietly in the den but when i perceived that its lawful owner had come back to retake possession i thought it was time to come out so i called to my messmates who with obrien were assisting the beefeaters they had not discovered me and laughed very much when they saw where i was one of the midshipmen shot the bolt of the door so that i could not jump out and then stirred me up with a long pole at last i contrived to unbolt it again and got out when they laughed still more at the seat of my trowsers being torn off it was not exactly a laughing matter to me although i had to congratulate myself upon a very lucky escape and so did my messmates think when i narrated my adventures the pelican was the worst part of the business obrien lent me a dark silk handkerchief which i tied round my waist and let drop behind so that my misfortunes might not attract any notice and then we quitted the menagerie but i was so stiff that i could scarcely walk we then went to what they called the ranelagh gardens to see the fireworks which were to be let off at ten oclock it was exactly ten when we paid for our admission and we waited very patiently for a quarter of an hour but there were no signs of the fireworks being displayed the fact was that the man to whom the gardens belonged waited until more company should arrive although the place was already very full of people now the first lieutenant had ordered the boat to wait for us until twelve oclock and then return on board and as we were seven miles from portsmouth we had not much time to spare we waited another quarter of an hour and then it was agreed that as the fireworks were stated in the handbill to commence precisely at ten oclock we were fully justified in letting them off ourselves obrien went out and returned with a dozen penny rattans which he notched in the end the fireworks were on the posts and stages all ready and it was agreed that we should light them all at once and then mix with the crowd the oldsters lighted cigars and fixing them in the notched end of the canes continued to puff them until they were all well lighted they handed one to each of us and at a signal we all applied them to the match papers and as soon as the fire communicated we threw down our canes and ran in among the crowd in about half a minute off they all went in a most beautiful confusion there were silver stars and golden stars blue lights and catherinewheels mines and bombs grecianfires and romancandles chinesetrees rockets and illuminated mottoes all firing away cracking popping and fizzing at the same time it was unanimously agreed that it was a great improvement upon the intended show the man to whom the gardens belonged ran out of a booth where he had been drinking beer at his ease while his company were waiting swearing vengeance against the perpetrators indeed the next day he offered fifty pounds reward for the discovery of the offenders but i think that he was treated very properly he was in his situation a servant of the public and he had behaved as if he was their master we all escaped very cleverly and taking another dilly arrived at portsmouth and were down to the boat in good time the next day i was so stiff and in such pain that i was obliged to go to the doctor who put me on the list where i remained a week before i could return to my duty so much for portsdown fair it was on a saturday that i returned to my duty and sunday being a fine day we all went on shore to church with mr falcon the first lieutenant we liked going to church very much not i am sorry to say from religious feelings but for the following reasonthe first lieutenant sat in a pew below and we were placed in the gallery above where he could not see us nor indeed could we see him we all remained very quiet and i may say very devout during the time of the service but the clergyman who delivered the sermon was so tedious and had such a bad voice that we generally slipped out as soon as he went up into the pulpit and adjourned to a pastrycooks opposite to eat cakes and tarts and drink cherrybrandy which we infinitely preferred to hearing a sermon somehow or other the first lieutenant had scent of our proceedings we believed that the marine officer informed against us and this sunday he served us a pretty trick we had been at the pastrycooks as usual and as soon as we perceived the people coming out of church we put all our tarts and sweetmeats into our hats which we then slipped on our heads and took our station at the churchdoor as if we had just come down from the gallery and had been waiting for him instead however of appearing at the churchdoor he walked up the street and desired us to follow him to the boat the fact was he had been in the backroom at the pastrycooks watching our motions through the green blinds we had no suspicion but thought that he had come out of church a little sooner than usual when we arrived on board and followed him up the side he said to us as we came on deckwalk aft young gentlemen we did and he desired us to toe a line which means to stand in a row now mr dixon said he what was the text today as he very often asked us that question we always left one in the church until the text was given out who brought it to us in the pastrycooks shop when we all marked it in our bibles to be ready if he asked us dixon immediately pulled out his bible where he had marked down the leaf and read it o that was it said mr falcon you must have remarkably good ears mr dixon to have heard the clergyman from the pastrycooks shop now gentlemen hats off if you please we all slided off our hats which as he expected were full of pastry really gentlemen said he feeling the different papers of pastry and sweetmeats i am quite delighted to perceive that you have not been to church for nothing few come away with so many good things pressed upon their seat of memory masteratarms send all the ships boys aft the boys all came tumbling up the ladders and the first lieutenant desired each of them to take a seat upon the carronade slides when they were all stationed he ordered us to go round with our hats and request of each his acceptance of a tart which we were obliged to do handing first to one and then to another until the hats were all empty what annoyed me more than all was the grinning of the boys at their being served by us like footmen as well as the ridicule and laughter of the whole ships company who had assembled at the gangways when all the pastry was devoured the first lieutenant said there gentlemen now that you have had your lesson for the day you may go below we could not help laughing ourselves when we went down into the berth mr falcon always punished us goodhumouredly and in some way or other his punishments were severally connected with the description of the offence he always had a remedy for every thing that he disapproved of and the ships company used to call him remedy jack i ought to observe that some of my messmates were very severe upon the ships boys after that circumstance always giving them a kick or a cuff on the head whenever they could telling them at the same time theres another tart for you you whelp i believe if the boys had known what was in reserve for them they would much rather have left the pastry alone chapter x a pressgang beaten off by one womandangers at spithead and pointa treat for both parties of pulled chicken at my expensealso gin for twentyi am made a prisoner escape and rejoin my ship i must now relate what occurred to me a few days before the ship sailed which will prove that it is not necessary to encounter the winds and waves or the cannon of the enemy to be in danger when you have entered his majestys service on the contrary i have been in action since and i declare without hesitation that i did not feel so much alarm on that occasion as i did on the one of which i am about to give the history we were reported ready for sea and the admiralty was anxious that we should proceed the only obstacle to our sailing was that we had not yet completed our complement of men the captain applied to the portadmiral and obtained permission to send parties on shore to impress seamen the second and third lieutenants and the oldest midshipman were despatched on shore every night with some of the most trustworthy men and generally brought on board in the morning about half a dozen men whom they had picked up in the different alehouses or grogshops as the sailors call them some of them were retained but most of them sent on shore as unserviceable for it is the custom when a man either enters or is impressed to send him down to the surgeon in the cockpit where he is stripped and examined all over to see if he be sound and fit for his majestys service and if not he is sent on shore again impressing appeared to be rather serious work as far as i could judge from the accounts which i heard and from the way in which our sailors who were employed on the service were occasionally beaten and wounded the seamen who were impressed appearing to fight as hard not to be forced into the service as they did for the honour of the country after they were fairly embarked in it i had a great wish to be one of the party before the ship sailed and asked obrien who was very kind to me in general and allowed nobody to thrash me but himself if he would take me with him which he did on the night after i had made the request i put on my dirk that they might know i was an officer as well as for my protection about dusk we rowed on shore and landed on the gosport side the men were all armed with cutlasses and wore pea jackets which are very short greatcoats made of what they call flushing we did not stop to look at any of the grogshops in the town as it was too early but walked out about three miles in the suburbs and went to a house the door of which was locked but we forced it open in a minute and hastened to enter the passage where we found the landlady standing to defend the entrance the passage was long and narrow and she was a very tall corpulent woman so that her body nearly filled it up and in her hands she held a long spit pointed at us with which she kept us at bay the officers who were the foremost did not like to attack a woman and she made such drives at them with her spit that had they not retreated some of them would soon have been ready for roasting the sailors laughed and stood outside leaving the officers to settle the business how they could at last the landlady called out to her husband be they all out jem yes replied the husband they be all safe gone well then replied she ill soon have all these gone too and with these words she made such a rush forward upon us with her spit that had we not fallen back and tumbled one over another she certainly would have run it through the second lieutenant who commanded the party the passage was cleared in an instant and as soon as we were all in the street she bolted us out so there we were three officers and fifteen armed men fairly beat off by a fat old woman the sailors who had been drinking in the house having made their escape to some other place but i do not well see how it could be otherwise either we must have killed or wounded the woman or she would have run us through she was so resolute had her husband been in the passage he would have been settled in a very short time but what can you do with a woman who fights like a devil and yet claims all the rights and immunities of the softer sex we all walked away looking very foolish and obrien observed that the next time he called at that house he would weather the old cat for he would take her ladyship in the rear we then called at other houses where we picked up one or two men but most of them escaped by getting out at the windows or the back doors as we entered the front now there was a grogshop which was a very favourite rendezvous of the seamen belonging to the merchant vessels and to which they were accustomed to retreat when they heard that the pressgangs were out our officers were aware of this and were therefore indifferent as to the escape of the men as they knew that they would all go to that place and confide in their numbers for beating us off as it was then one oclock they thought it time to go there we proceeded without any noise but they had people on the lookout and as soon as we turned the corner of the lane the alarm was given i was afraid that they would all run away and we should lose them but on the contrary they mustered very strong on that night and had resolved to give fight the men remained in the house but an advanced guard of about thirty of their wives saluted us with a shower of stones and mud some of our sailors were hurt but they did not appear to mind what the women did they rushed on and then they were attacked by the women with their fists and nails notwithstanding this the sailors only laughed pushing the women on one side and saying be quiet polldont be foolish mollyout of the way sukey we ant come to take away your fancy man with expressions of that sort although the blood trickled down many of their faces from the way in which they had been clawed thus we attempted to force our way through them but i had a very narrow escape even in this instance a woman seized me by the arm and pulled me towards her had it not been for one of the quartermasters i should have been separated from my party but just as they dragged me away she caught hold of me by the leg and stopped them clap on here peg cried the woman to another and lets have this little midshipmite i wants a baby to dry nurse two more women came to her assistance catching hold of my other arm and they would have dragged me out of the grasp of the quartermaster had he not called out for more help on his side upon which two of the seamen laid hold of my other leg and there was such a tussle all at my expense such pulling and hauling sometimes the women gained an inch or two of me then the sailors got it back again at one moment i thought it was all over with me and in the next i was with my own men pull devil pull baker cried the women and then they laughed although i did not i can assure you for i really think that i was pulled out an inch taller and my knees and shoulders pained me very much indeed at last the women laughed so much that they could not hold on so i was dragged into the middle of our own sailors where i took care to remain and after a little more squeezing and fighting was carried by the crowd into the house the seamen of the merchant ships had armed themselves with bludgeons and other weapons and had taken a position on the tables they were more than two to one against us and there was a dreadful fight as their resistance was very desperate our sailors were obliged to use their cutlasses and for a few minutes i was quite bewildered with the shouting and swearing pushing and scuffling collaring and fighting together with the dust raised up which not only blinded but nearly choked me by the time that my breath was nearly squeezed out of my body our sailors got the best of it which the landlady and women of the house perceiving they put out all the lights so that i could not tell where i was but our sailors had every one seized his man and contrived to haul him out of the street door where they were collected together and secured now again i was in great difficulty i had been knocked down and trod upon and when i did contrive to get up again i did not know the direction in which the door lay i felt about by the wall and at last came to a door for the room was at that time nearly empty the women having followed the men out of the house i opened it and found that it was not the right one but led into a little side parlour where there was a fire but no lights i had just discovered my mistake and was about to retreat when i was shoved in from behind and the key turned upon me there i was all alone and i must acknowledge very much frightened as i thought that the vengeance of the women would be wreaked upon me i considered that my death was certain and that like the man orpheus i had read of in my books i should be torn to pieces by these bacchanals however i reflected that i was an officer in his majestys service and that it was my duty if necessary to sacrifice my life for my king and country i thought of my poor mother but as it made me unhappy i tried to forget her and call to my memory all i had read of the fortitude and courage of various brave men when death stared them in the face i peeped through the keyhole and perceived that the candles were relighted and that there were only women in the room who were talking all at once and not thinking about me but in a minute or two a woman came in from the street with her long black hair hanging about her shoulders and her cap in her hand well cried she theyve nabbed my husband but ill be dished if i havnt boxed up the midshipmite in that parlour and he shall take his place i thought i should have died when i looked at the woman and perceived her coming up to the door followed by some others to unlock it as the door opened i drew my dirk resolving to die like an officer and as they advanced i retreated to a corner brandishing my dirk without saying a word vell cried the woman who had made me a prisoner i do declare i likes to see a puddle in a stormonly look at the little biscuitnibbler showing fight come my lovey you belongs to me never exclaimed i with indignation keep off i shall do you mischief and i raised my dirk in advance i am an officer and a gentleman sall cried the odious woman fetch a mop and a pail of dirty water and ill trundle that dirk out of his fist no no replied another rather goodlooking young woman leave him to medont hurt himhe really is a very nice little man whats your name my dear peter simple is my name replied i and i am a kings officer so be careful what you are about dont be afraid peter nobody shall hurt you but you must not draw your dirk before ladies thats not like an officer and a gentlemanso put up your dirk thats a good boy i will not replied i unless you promise me that i shall go away unmolested i do promise you that you shall upon my word peterupon my honour will that content you yes replied i if every one else will promise the same upon our honours they all cried together upon which i was satisfied and putting my dirk into its sheath was about to quit the room stop peter said the young woman who had taken my part i must have a kiss before you go and so must i and so must we all cried the other women i was very much shocked and attempted to draw my dirk again but they had closed in with me and prevented me recollect your honour cried i to the young woman as i struggled my honourlord bless you peter the less we say about that the better but you promised that i should go away quietly said i appealing to them well and so you shall but recollect peter that you are an officer and a gentlemanyou surely would not be so shabby as to go away without treating us what money have you got in your pocket and without giving me time to answer she felt in my pocket and pulled out my purse which she opened why peter you are as rich as a jew said she as they counted thirty shillings on the table now what shall we have anything you please said i provided that you will let me go well then it shall be a gallon of gin sall call mrs flanagan mrs flanagan we want a gallon of gin and clean glasses mrs flanagan received the major part of my money and in a minute returned with the gin and wineglasses now peter my cove lets all draw round the table and make ourselves cosy o no replied i take my money drink the gin but pray let me go but they wouldnt listen to me then i was obliged to sit down with them the gin was poured out and they made me drink a glass which nearly choked me it had however one good effect it gave me courage and in a minute or two i felt as if i could fight them all the door of the room was on the same side as the fireplace and i perceived that the poker was between the bars and red hot i complained that i was cold although i was in a burning fever and they allowed me to get up to warm my hands as soon as i reached the fireplace i snatched out the redhot poker and brandishing it over my head made for the door they all jumped up to detain me but i made a poke at the foremost which made her run back with a shriek i do believe that i burnt her nose i seized my opportunity and escaped into the street whirling the poker round my head while all the women followed hooting and shouting after me i never stopped running and whirling my poker until i was reeking with perspiration and the poker was quite cold then i looked back and found that i was alone it was very dark every house was shut up and not a light to be seen anywhere i stopped at the corner not knowing where i was or what i was to do i felt very miserable indeed and was reflecting on my wisest plan when who should turn the corner but one of the quartermasters who had been left on shore by accident i knew him by his peajacket and straw hat to be one of our men and i was delighted to see him i told him what had happened and he replied that he was going to a house where the people knew him and would let him in when we arrived there the people of the house were very civil the landlady made us some purl which the quartermaster ordered and which i thought very good indeed after we had finished the jug we both fell asleep in our chairs i did not awaken until i was roused by the quartermaster at past seven oclock when we took a wherry and went off to the ship chapter xi obrien takes me under his protectionthe ships company are paid so are the bumboatwomen the jews and the emancipationist after a fashionwe go to seadoctor obriens cure for seasicknessone pill of the doctors more than a dose when we arrived i reported myself to the first lieutenant and told him the whole story of the manner in which i had been treated showing him the poker which i brought on board with me he heard me very patiently and then said well mr simple you may be the greatest fool of your family for all i know to the contrary but never pretend to be a fool with me that poker proves the contrary and if your wit can serve you upon your own emergency i expect that it will be employed for the benefit of the service he then sent for obrien and gave him a lecture for allowing me to go with the pressgang pointing out what was very true that i could have been of no service and might have met with a serious accident i went down on the main deck and obrien came to me peter said he i have been jawed for letting you go so it is but fair that you should be thrashed for having asked me i wished to argue the point but he cut all argument short by kicking me down the hatchway and thus ended my zealous attempt to procure seamen for his majestys service at last the frigate was full manned and as we had received drafts of men from other ships we were ordered to be paid previously to our going to sea the people on shore always find out when a ship is to be paid and very early in the morning we were surrounded with wherries laden with jews and other people some requesting admittance to sell their goods others to get paid for what they had allowed the sailors to take up upon credit but the first lieutenant would not allow any of them to come on board until after the ship was paid although they were so urgent that he was forced to place sentries in the chains with cold shot to stave the boats if they came alongside i was standing at the gangway looking at the crowd of boats when a blacklooking fellow in one of the wherries said to me i say sir let me slip in at the port and i have a very nice present to make you and he displayed a gold seal which he held up to me i immediately ordered the sentry to keep him further off for i was very much affronted at his supposing me capable of being bribed to disobey my orders about eleven oclock the dockyard boat with all the payclerks and the cashier with his chest of money came on board and was shown into the forecabin where the captain attended the paytable the men were called in one by one and as the amount of the wages due had been previously calculated they were paid very fast the money was always received in their hats after it had been counted out in the presence of the officers and captain outside the cabin door there stood a tall man in black with hair straight combed who had obtained an order from the port admiral to be permitted to come on board he attacked every sailor as he came out with his money in his hat for a subscription to emancipate the slaves in the west indies but the sailors would not give him anything swearing that the niggers were better off than they were for they did not work harder by day and had no watch and watch to keep during the night sarvitude is sarvitude all over the world my old psalmsinger replied one they sarve their masters as in duty bound we sarve the king cause he cant do without usand he never axes our leave but helps himself yes replied the straighthaired gentleman but slavery is a very different thing cant say that i see any difference do you bill not i and i suppose as if they didnt like it theyd run away run away poor creatures said the black gentleman why if they did they would be flogged floggedheh well and if we run away we are to be hanged the niggers better off nor we arnt he tom then the pursers steward came out he was what they call a bit of a lawyerthat is had received more education than the seamen in general i trust sir said the man in black that you will contribute something not i my hearty i owe every farthing of my money and more too im afraid still sir a small trifle why what an infernal rascal you must be to ask a man to give away what is not his own property did i not tell you that i owed it all theres an old proverbbe just before youre generous now its my opinion that you are a methodistical goodfornothing blackguard and if any one is such a fool as to give you money you will keep it for yourself when the man found that he could obtain nothing at the door he went down on the lower deck in which he did not act very wisely for now that the men were paid the boats were permitted to come alongside and so much spirits were smuggled in that most of the seamen were more or less intoxicated as soon as he went below he commenced distributing prints of a black man kneeling in chains and saying am not i your brother some of the men laughed and swore that they would paste their brother up in the mess to say prayers for the ships company but others were very angry and abused him at last one man who was tipsy came up to him do you pretend for to insinivate that this crying black thief is my brother to be sure i do replied the methodist then take that for your infernal lie said the sailor hitting him in the face right and left and knocking the man down into the cable tier from whence he climbed up and made his escape out of the frigate as soon as he was able the ship was now in a state of confusion and uproar there were jews trying to sell clothes or to obtain money for clothes which they had sold bumboatmen and bumboatwomen showing their long bills and demanding or coaxing for payment other people from the shore with hundreds of small debts and the sailors wives sticking close to them and disputing every bill presented as an extortion or a robbery there was such bawling and threatening laughing and cryingfor the women were all to quit the ship before sunsetat one moment a jew was upset and all his hamper of clothes tossed into the hold at another a sailor was seen hunting everywhere for a jew who had cheated himall squabbling or skylarking and many of them very drunk it appeared to me that the sailors had rather a difficult point to settle they had three claimants upon them the jew for clothes the bumboatmen for their mess in harbour and their wives for their support during their absence and the money which they received was generally speaking not more than sufficient to meet one of the demands as it may be supposed the women had the best of it the others were paid a trifle and promised the remainder when they came back from their cruise and although as the case stood then it might appear that two of the parties were illused yet in the long run they were more than indemnified for their charges were so extravagant that if onethird of their bills were paid there would still remain a profit about five oclock the orders were given for the ship to be cleared all disputed points were settled by the sergeant of marines with a party who divided their antagonists from the jews and every description of persons not belonging to the ship whether male or female was dismissed over the side the hammocks were piped down those who were intoxicated were put to bed and the ship was once more quiet nobody was punished for having been tipsy as payday is considered on board a manofwar as the windingup of all incorrect behaviour and from that day the sailors turn over a new leaf for although some latitude is permitted and the seamen are seldom flogged in harbour yet the moment that the anchor is at the bows strict discipline is exacted and intoxication must no longer hope to be forgiven the next day everything was prepared for sea and no leave was permitted to the officers stock of every kind was brought on board and the large boats hoisted and secured on the morning after at daylight a signal from the flagship in harbour was made for us to unmoor our orders had come down to cruise in the bay of biscay the captain came on board the anchor weighed and we ran through the needles with a fine ne breeze i admired the scenery of the isle of wight looked with admiration at alum bay was astonished at the needle rocks and then felt so very ill that i went down below what occurred for the next six days i cannot tell i thought that i should die every moment and lay in my hammock or on the chests for the whole of that time incapable of eating drinking or walking about obrien came to me on the seventh morning and said that if i did not exert myself i never should get well that he was very fond of me and had taken me under his protection and to prove his regard he would do for me what he would not take the trouble to do for any other youngster in the ship which was to give me a good basting which was a sovereign remedy for seasickness he suited the action to the word and drubbed me on the ribs without mercy until i thought the breath was out of my body and then he took out a ropes end and thrashed me until i obeyed his orders to go on deck immediately before he came to me i could never have believed it possible that i could have obeyed him but somehow or other i did contrive to crawl up the ladder to the maindeck where i sat down on the shotracks and cried bitterly what would i have given to have been at home again it was not my fault that i was the greatest fool in the family yet how was i punished for it if this was kindness from obrien what had i to expect from those who were not partial to me but by degrees i recovered myself and certainly felt a great deal better and that night i slept very soundly the next morning obrien came to me again its a nasty slow fever that seasickness my peter and we must drive it out of you and then he commenced a repetition of yesterdays remedy until i was almost a jelly whether the fear of being thrashed drove away my seasickness or whatever might be the real cause of it i do not know but this is certain that i felt no more of it after the second beating and the next morning when i awoke i was very hungry i hastened to dress myself before obrien came to me and did not see him until we met at breakfast pater said he let me feel your pulse oh no replied i indeed im quite well quite well can you eat biscuit and salt butter yes i can and a piece of fat pork yes that i can its thanks to me then pater replied he so youll have no more of my medicine until you fall sick again i hope not replied i for it was not very pleasant pleasant you simple simple when did you ever hear of physic being pleasant unless a man prescribe for himself i suppose youd be after lollipops for the yellow fever live and larn boy and thank heaven that youve found somebody who loves you well enough to baste you when its good for your health i replied that i certainly hoped that much as i felt obliged to him i should not require any more proofs of his regard any more such striking proofs you mean pater but let me tell you that they were sincere proofs for since youve been ill ive been eating your pork and drinking your grog which latter cant be too plentiful in the bay of biscay and now that ive cured you youll be tucking all that into your own little breadbasket so that im no gainer and i think that you may be convinced that you never had or will have two more disinterested thumpings in all your born days however youre very welcome so say no more about it i held my tongue and ate a very hearty breakfast from that day i returned to my duty and was put into the same watch with obrien who spoke to the first lieutenant and told him that he had taken me under his charge chapter xii new theory of mr muddle remarkable for having no end to itnovel practice of mr chucksobrien commences his historythere were giants in those daysi bring up the masters nightglass as i have already mentioned sufficient of the captain and the first lieutenant to enable the reader to gain an insight into their characters i shall now mention two very odd personages who were my shipmates the carpenter and the boatswain the carpenter whose name was muddle used to go by the appellation of philosopher chips not that he followed any particular school but had formed a theory of his own from which he was not to be dissuaded this was that the universe had its cycle of events turned round so that in a certain period of time everything was to happen over again i never could make him explain upon what data his calculations were founded he said that if he explained it i was too young to comprehend it but the fact was this that in years everything that was going on now would be going on again with the same people as were existing at this present time he very seldom ventured to make the remark to captain savage but to the first lieutenant he did very often ive been as close to it as possible sir i do assure you although you find fault but years ago you were first lieutenant of this ship and i was carpenter although we recollect nothing about it and years hence we shall both be standing by this boat talking about the repairs as we are now i do not doubt it mr muddle replied the first lieutenant i dare say that it is all very true but the repairs must be finished this night and years hence you will have the order just as positive as you have it now so let it be done this theory made him very indifferent as to danger or indeed as to anything it was of no consequence the affair took its station in the course of time it had happened at the above period and would happen again fate was fate but the boatswain was a more amusing personage he was considered to be the taughtest that is the most active and severe boatswain in the service he went by the name of gentleman chucksthe latter was his surname he appeared to have received half an education sometimes his language was for a few sentences remarkably well chosen but all of a sudden he would break down at a hard word but i shall be able to let the reader into more of his history as i go on with my adventures he had a very handsome person inclined to be stout keen eyes and hair curling in ringlets he held his head up and strutted as he walked he declared that an officer should look like an officer and comport himself accordingly in his person he was very clean wore rings on his great fingers and a large frill to his bosom which stuck out like the back fin of a perch and the collar of his shirt was always pulled up to a level with his cheekbones he never appeared on deck without his persuader which was three rattans twisted into one like a cable sometimes he called it his order of the bath or his trio juncto in uno and this persuader was seldom idle he attempted to be very polite even when addressing the common seamen and certainly he always commenced his observations to them in a very gracious manner but as he continued he became less choice in his phraseology obrien said that his speeches were like the sin of the poet very fair at the upper part of them but shocking at the lower extremities as a specimen of them he would say to the man on the forecastle allow me to observe my dear man in the most delicate way in the world that you are spilling that tar upon the decka deck sir if i may venture to make the observation i had the duty of seeing holystoned this morning you understand me sir you have defiled his majestys forecastle i must do my duty sir if you neglect yours so take thatand thatand thatthrashing the man with his rattanyou dd haymaking son of a seacook do it again dn your eyes and ill cut your liver out i remember one of the ships boys going forward with a kid of dirty water to empty in the head without putting his hand up to his hat as he passed the boatswain stop my little friend said the boatswain pulling out his frill and raising up both sides of his shirtcollar are you aware sir of my rank and station in society yes sir replied the boy trembling and eyeing the rattan oh you are replied mr chucks had you not been aware of it i should have considered a gentle correction necessary that you might have avoided such an error in future but as you were aware of it why then dn you you have no excuse so take thatand thatyou yelping halfstarved abortion i really beg your pardon mr simple said he to me as the boy went howling forward for i was walking with him at the time but really the service makes brutes of us all it is hard to sacrifice our health our nights rest and our comforts but still more so that in my responsible situation i am obliged too often to sacrifice my gentility the master was the officer who had charge of the watch to which i was stationed he was a very rough sailor who had been brought up in the merchant service not much of a gentleman in his appearance very goodtempered and very fond of grog he always quarrelled with the boatswain and declared that the service was going to the devil now that warrant officers put on white shirts and wore frills to them but the boatswain did not care for him he knew his duty he did his duty and if the captain was satisfied he said that the whole ships company might grumble as for the master he said the man was very well but having been brought up in a collier he could not be expected to be very refined in fact he observed pulling up his shirtcollarit was impossible to make a silk purse out of a sows ear the master was very kind to me and used to send me down to my hammock before my watch was half over until that time i walked the deck with obrien who was a very pleasant companion and taught me everything that he could connected with my profession one night when he had the middle watch i told him i should like very much if he would give me the history of his life that i will my honey replied he all that i can remember of it though i have no doubt but that ive forgotten the best part of it its now within five minutes of two bells so well heave the log and mark the board and then ill spin you a yarn which will keep us both from going to sleep obrien reported the rate of sailing to the master marked it down on the logboard and then returned so now my boy ill come to an anchor on the topsail halyard rack and you may squeeze your threadpaper little carcass under my lee and then ill tell you all about it first and foremost you must know that i am descended from the great obrien borru who was king in his time as the great fingal was before him of course youve heard of fingal i cant say that i ever did replied i never heard of fingalmurder where must you have been all your life well then to give you some notion of fingal i will first tell you how fingal bothered the great scotch giant and then ill go on with my own story fingal you must know was a giant himself and no fool of one and any one that affronted him was as sure of a bating as i am to keep the middle watch tonight but there was a giant in scotland as tall as the mainmast more or less as we say when we ant quite sure as it saves telling more lies than theres occasion for well this scotch giant heard of fingal and how he had beaten everybody and he said who is this fingal by jasus says he in scotch ill just walk over and see what hes made of so he walked across the irish channel and landed within halfamile of belfast but whether he was out of his depth or not i cant tell although i suspect that he was not dryfooted when fingal heard that this great chap was coming over he was in a devil of a fright for they told him that the scotchman was taller by a few feet or so giants you know measure by feet and dont bother themselves about the inches as we little devils are obliged to do so fingal kept a sharp lookout for the scotchman and one fine morning there he was sure enough coming up the hill to fingals house if fingal was afraid before he had more reason to be afraid when he saw the fellow for he looked for all the world like the monument upon a voyage of discovery so fingal ran into his house and called to his wife shaya my vourneen says he be quick now theres that big bully of a scotchman coming up the hill kiver me up with the blankets and if he asks who is in bed tell him its the child so fingal laid down on the bed and his wife had just time to cover him up when in comes the scotchman and though he stooped low he broke his head against the portal wheres that baste fingal says he rubbing his forehead show him to me that i may give him a bating whisht whisht cries shaya youll wake the babby and then him that you talk of bating will be the death of you if he comes in is that the babby cried the scotchman with surprise looking at the great carcass muffled up in the blankets sure it is replied shaya and fingals babby too so dont you wake him or fingal will twist your neck in a minute by the cross of st andrew replied the giant then its time for me to be off for if thats his babby ill be but a mouthful to the fellow himself good morning to ye so the scotch giant ran out of the house and never stopped to eat or drink until he got back to his own hills foreby he was nearly drowned in having mistaken his passage across the channel in his great hurry then fingal got up and laughed as well he might at his own cuteness and so ends my story about fingal and now ill begin about myself as i said before i am descended from the great obrien who was a king in his time but that times past i suppose as the world turns round my childrens childrens posterity may be kings again although there seems but little chance of it just now but theres ups and downs on a grand scale as well as in a mans own history and the wheel of fortune keeps turning for the comfort of those who are at the lowest spoke as i may be just now to cut the story a little shorter i skip down to my greatgrandfather who lived like a real gentleman as he was upon his ten thousand a year at last he died and eight thousand of the ten was buried with him my grandfather followed his father all in good course of time and only left my father about one hundred acres of bog to keep up the dignity of the family i am the youngest of ten and devil a copper have i but my pay or am i likely to have you may talk about descent but a more descending family than mine was never in existence for here am i with twentyfive pounds ayear and a halfpay of nothing a day and find myself when my great ancestor did just what he pleased with all ireland and everybody in it but this is all nothing except to prove satisfactorily that i am not worth a skillagalee and that is the reason which induces me to condescend to serve his majesty father mgrath the priest who lived with my father taught me the elements as they call them i thought i had enough of the elements then but ive seen a deal more of them since terence says my father to me one day what do you mane to do to get my dinner sure replied i for i was not a little hungry and so you shall today my vourneen replied my father but in future you must do something to get your own dinner theres not praties enow for the whole of ye will you go to the say ill just step down and look at it says i for we lived but sixteen irish miles from the coast so when i had finished my meal which did not take long for want of ammunition i trotted down to the cove to see what a ship might be like and i happened upon a large one sure enough for there lay a threedecker with an admirals flag at the fore may be youll be so civil as to tell me what ship that is said i to a sailor on the pier its the queen charlotte replied he of one hundred and twenty guns now when i looked at her size and compared her with all the little smacks and hoys lying about her i very naturally asked how old she was he replied that she was no more than three years old but three years old thought i to myself its a fine vessel youll be when youll come of age if you grow at that rate youll be as tall as the top of bencrowthats a mountain we have in our parts you see peter i was a fool at that time just as you are now but byandby when youve had as many thrashings as i have had you may chance to be as clever i went back to my father and told him all i had seen and he replied that if i liked it i might be a midshipman on board of her with nine hundred men under my command he forgot to say how many i should have over me but i found that out afterwards i agreed and my father ordered his pony and went to the lordlieutenant for he had interest enough for that the lordlieutenant spoke to the admiral who was staying at the palace and i was ordered on board as midshipman my father fitted me out pretty handsomely telling all the tradesmen that their bills should be paid with my first prizemoney and thus by promises and blarney he got credit for all i wanted at last all was ready father mgrath gave me his blessing and told me that if i died like an obrien he would say a power of masses for the good of my soul may you never have the trouble sir said i och trouble a pleasure my dear boy replied he for he was a very polite man so off i went with my big chest not quite so full as it ought to have been for my mother cribbed one half of my stock for my brothers and sisters i hope to be back again soon father said i as i took my leave i hope not my dear boy replied he ant you provided for and what more would you have so after a deal of bother i was fairly on board and i parted company with my chest for i stayed on deck and that went down below i stared about with all my eyes for some time when who should be coming off but the captain and the officers were ordered on deck to receive him i wanted to have a quiet survey of him so i took up my station on one of the guns that i might examine him at my leisure the boatswain whistled the marines presented arms and the officers all took off their hats as the captain came on the deck and then the guard was dismissed and they all walked about the deck as before but i found it very pleasant to be astride on the gun so i remained where i was what do you mane by that you big young scoundrel says he when he saw me its nothing at all i mane replied i but what do you mane by calling an obrien a scoundrel who is he said the captain to the first lieutenant mr obrien who joined the ship about an hour since dont you know better than to sit upon a gun said the captain to be sure i do replied i when theres anything better to sit upon he knows no better sir observed the first lieutenant then he must be taught replied the captain mr obrien since you have perched yourself on that gun to please yourself you will now continue there for two hours to please me do you understand siryoull ride on that gun for two hours i understand sir replied i but i am afraid that he wont move without spurs although theres plenty of metal in him the captain turned away and laughed as he went into his cabin and all the officers laughed and i laughed too for i perceived no great hardship in sitting down an hour or two any more than i do now well i soon found that like a young bear all my troubles were to come the first month was nothing but fighting and squabbling with my messmates they called me a raw irishman and raw i was sure enough from the constant thrashings and coltings i received from those who were bigger and stronger than myself but nothing lasts for everas they discovered that whenever they found blows i could find back they got tired of it and left me and my brogue alone we sailed for the toolong fleet what fleet inquired i why the toolong fleet so called i thought because they remained too long in harbour bad luck to them and then we were off cape seesee devil a bit could we see of them except their mastheads for i dont know how many months but i forgot to say that i got into another scrape just before we left harbour it was my watch when they piped to dinner and i took the liberty to run below as my messmates had a knack of forgetting absent friends well the captain came on board and there were no side boys no side ropes and no officers to receive him he came on deck foaming with rage for his dignity was hurt and he inquired who was the midshipman of the watch mr obrien said they all devil a bit replied i it was my forenoon watch who relieved you sir said the first lieutenant devil a soul sir replied i for they were all too busy with their pork and beef then why did you leave the deck without relief because sir my stomach would have had but little relief if i had remained the captain who stood by said do you see those crosstrees sir is it those little bits of wood that you mane on the top there captain yes sir now just go up there and stay until i call you down you must be brought to your senses young man or youll have but little prospect in the service ive an idea that ill have plenty of prospect when i get up there replied i but its all to please you so up i went as i have many a time since and as you often will peter just to enjoy the fresh air and your own pleasant thoughts all at one and the same time at last i became much more used to the manners and customs of saygoing people and by the time that i had been fourteen months off cape seesee i was considered a very genteel young midshipman and my messmates that is all that i could thrash which didnt leave out many had a very great respect for me the first time that i put my foot on shore was at minorca and then i put my foot into it as we say for i was nearly killed for a heretic and only saved by proving myself a true catholic which proves that religion is a great comfort in distress as father mgrath used to say several of us went on shore and having dined upon a roast turkey stuffed with plumpudding for everything else was cooked in oil and we could not eat it and having drunk as much wine as would float a jollyboat we ordered donkeys to take a little equestrian exercise some went off tail on end some with their hindquarters uppermost and then the riders went off instead of the donkeys some wouldnt go off at all as for mine he would goand where the devil do you think he went why into the church where all the people were at mass the poor brute was dying with thirst and smelt water as soon as he was in notwithstanding all my tugging and hauling he ran his nose into the holywater font and drank it all up although i thought that seeing how few christians have any religion you could not expect much from a donkey yet i was very much shocked at the sacrilege and fearful of the consequences nor was it without reason for the people in the church were quite horrified as well they might be for the brute drank as much holywater as would have purified the whole town of port mahon suburbs and all to boot they rose up from their knees and seized me calling upon all the saints in the calendar although i knew what they meant not a word of their lingo could i speak to plead for my life and i was almost torn to pieces before the priest came up perceiving the danger i was in i wiped my finger across the wet nose of the donkey crossed myself and then went down on my knees to the priests crying out culpa mea as all good catholics dothough twas no fault of mine as i said before for i tried all i could and tugged at the brute till my strength was gone the priests perceived by the manner in which i crossed myself that i was a good catholic and guessed that it was all a mistake of the donkeys they ordered the crowd to be quiet and sent for an interpreter when i explained the whole story they gave me absolution for what the donkey had done and after that as it was very rare to meet an english officer who was a good christian i was in great favour during my stay at minorca and was living in plenty paying for nothing and as happy as a cricket so the jackass proved a very good friend and to reward him i hired him every day and galloped him all over the island but at last it occurred to me that i had broken my leave for i was so happy on shore that i quite forgot that i had only permission for twentyfour hours and i should not have remembered it so soon had it not been for a party of marines headed by a sergeant who took me by the collar and dragged me off my donkey i was taken on board and put under an arrest for my misconduct now peter i dont know anything more agreeable than being put under an arrest nothing to do all day but eat and drink and please yourself only forbid to appear on the quarterdeck the only place that a midshipman wishes to avoid whether it was to punish me more severely or whether he forgot all about me i cant tell but it was nearly two months before i was sent for to the cabin and the captain with a most terrible frown said that he trusted that my punishment would be a warning to me and that now i might return to my duty plase your honour said i i dont think that ive been punished enough yet i am glad to find that you are so penitent but you are forgiven so take care that you do not oblige me to put you again in confinement so as there was no persuading him i was obliged to return to my duty again but i made a resolution that i would get into another scrape again as soon as i dared sail on the starboard bow cried the lookout man very well replied the master mr obrienwheres mr obrien is it me you mane sir said obrien walking up to the master for he had sat down so long in the topsailhalyard rack that he was wedged in and could not get out immediately yes sir go forward and see what that vessel is aye aye sir said obrien and mr simple continued the master go down and bring me up my nightglass yes sir replied i i had no idea of a nightglass and as i observed that about this time his servant brought him up a glass of grog i thought it very lucky that i knew what he meant take care that you dont break it mr simple oh then im all right thought i he means the tumbler so down i went called up the gunroom steward and desired him to give me a glass of grog for mr doball the steward tumbled out in his shirt mixed the grog and gave it to me and i carried it up very carefully to the quarterdeck during my absence the master had called the captain and in pursuance of his orders obrien had called the first lieutenant and when i came up the ladder they were both on deck as i was ascending i heard the master say i have sent young simple down for my nightglass but he is so long that i suppose he has made some mistake hes but half a fool that i deny replied mr falcon the first lieutenant just as i put my foot on the quarterdeck hes no fool perhaps not replied the master oh here he is what made you so long mr simplewhere is my nightglass here it is sir replied i handing him the tumbler of grog i told the steward to make it stiff the captain and the first lieutenant burst out into a laugh for mr doball was known to be very fond of grog the former walked aft to conceal his mirth but the latter remained mr doball was in a great rage did not i say that the boy was half a fool cried he to the first lieutenant at all events ill not allow that he has proved himself so in this instance replied mr falcon for he has hit the right nail on the head then the first lieutenant joined the captain and they both went off laughing put it on the capstan sir said mr doball to me in an angry voice ill punish you byandby i was very much astonished i hardly knew whether i had done right or wrong at all events thought i to myself i did for the best so i put it on the capstan and walked to my own side of the deck the captain and first lieutenant then went below and obrien came aft what vessel is it said i to the best of my belief its one of your bathingmachines going home with despatches replied he a bathing machine said i why i thought that they were hauled up on the beach thats the brighton sort but these are made not to go up at all what then why to go down to be sure and remarkably well they answer their purpose i wont puzzle you any more my peterim spaking helligorically which i believe means telling a hell of a lie its one of your tengun brigs to the best of my knowledge i then told obrien what had occurred and how the master was angry with me obrien laughed very heartily and told me never to mind but to keep in the leescuppers and watch him a glass of grog is a bait that hell play round till he gorges when you see it to his lips go up to him boldly and ask his pardon if you have offended him and then if hes a good christian as i believe him to be hell not refuse it i thought this was very good advice and i waited under the bulwark on the leeside i observed that the master made shorter and shorter turns every time till at last he stopped at the capstan and looked at the grog he waited about half a minute and then he took up the tumbler and drank about half of it it was very strong and he stopped to take breath i thought this was the right time and i went up to him the tumbler was again to his lips and before he saw me i said i hope sir youll forgive me i never heard of a night telescope and knowing that you had walked so long i thought you were tired and wanted something to drink to refresh you well mr simple said he after he had finished the glass with a deep sigh of pleasure as you meant kindly i shall let you off this time but recollect that whenever you bring me a glass of grog again it must not be in the presence of the captain or first lieutenant i promised him very faithfully and went away quite delighted with my having made my peace with him and more so that the first lieutenant had said that i was no fool for what i had done at last our watch was over and about two bells i was relieved by the midshipmen of the next watch it is very unfair not to relieve in time but if i said a word i was certain to be thrashed the next day upon some pretence or other on the other hand the midshipman whom i relieved was also much bigger than i was and if i was not up before one bell i was cut down and thrashed by him so that between the two i kept much more than my share of the watch except when the master sent me to bed before it was over chapter xiii the first lieutenant prescribes for one of his patients his prescriptions consisting of draughts onlyobrien finishes the history of his life in which the proverb of the more the merrier is sadly disprovedshipping a new pair of boots causes the unshipping of their ownerwalking home after a ball obrien meets with an accident the next morning i was on deck at seven bells to see the hammocks stowed when i was witness to mr falcon the first lieutenant having recourse to one of his remedies to cure a mizentopboy of smoking a practice to which he had a great aversion he never interfered with the men smoking in the galley or chewing tobacco but he prevented the boys that is lads under twenty or thereabouts from indulging in the habit too early the first lieutenant smelt the tobacco as the boy passed him on the quarterdeck why neill you have been smoking said the first lieutenant i thought you were aware that i did not permit such lads as you to use tobacco if you please sir replied the mizentopman touching his hat ise got worms and they say that smoking be good for them good for them said the first lieutenant yes very good for them but very bad for you why my good fellow theyll thrive upon tobacco until they grow as large as conger eels heat is what the worms are fond of but coldcold will kill them now ill cure you quartermaster come here walk this boy up and down the weathergangway and every time you get forward abreast of the maintack block put his mouth to windward squeeze him sharp by the nape of the neck until he opens his mouth wide and there keep him and let the cold air blow down his throat while you count ten then walk him aft and when you are forward again proceed as beforecold kills worms my poor boy not tobaccoi wonder that you are not dead by this time the quartermaster who liked the joke as did all the seamen seized hold of the lad and as soon as they arrived forward gave him such a squeeze of the neck as to force him to open his mouth if it were only to cry with pain the wind was very fresh and blew into his mouth so strong that it actually whistled while he was forced to keep it open and thus he was obliged to walk up and down cooling his inside for nearly two hours when the first lieutenant sent for him and told him that he thought all the worms must be dead by that time but if they were not the lad was not to apply his own remedies but come to him for another dose however the boy was of the same opinion as the first lieutenant and never complained of worms again a few nights afterwards when we had the middle watch obrien proceeded with his story where was it that i left off you left off at the time that you were taken out of confinement so i did sure enough and it was with no goodwill that i went to my duty however as there was no help for it i walked up and down the deck as before with my hands in my pockets thinking of old ireland and my great ancestor brien borru and so i went on behaving myself like a real gentleman and getting into no more scrapes until the fleet put into the cove of cork and i found myself within a few miles of my fathers house you may suppose that the anchor had hardly kissed the mud before i went to the first lieutenant and asked leave to go on shore now the first lieutenant was not in the sweetest of tempers seeing as how the captain had been hauling him over the coals for not carrying on the duty according to his satisfaction so he answered me very gruffly that i should not leave the ship oh bother said i to myself this will never do so up i walked to the captain and touching my hat reminded him that i had a father and mother and a pretty sprinkling of brothers and sisters who were dying to see me and that i hoped that he would give me leave ax the first lieutenant said he turning away i have sir replied i and he says that the devil a bit shall i put my foot on shore then you have misbehaved yourself said the captain not a bit of it captain willis replied i its the first lieutenant who has misbehaved how sir answered he in an angry tone why sir didnt he misbehave just now in not carrying on the duty according to your will and pleasure and didnt you serve him out just as he deservedand isnt he sulky because you did and arnt that the reason why i am not to go on shore you see your honour its all true as i said and the first lieutenant has misbehaved and not i i hope you will allow me to go on shore captain god bless you and make some allowance for my parental feelings towards the arthers of my existence have you any fault to find with mr obrien said the captain to the first lieutenant as he came aft no more than i have with midshipmen in general but i believe it is not the custom for officers to ask leave to go on shore before the sails are furled and the yards squared very true replied the captain therefore mr obrien you must wait until the watch is called and then if you ask the first lieutenant i have no doubt but you will have leave granted to you to go and see your friends thanke kindly sir replied i and i hoped that the yards and sails would be finished off as soon as possible for my heart was in my mouth and i felt that if i had been kept much longer it would have flown on shore before me i thought myself very clever in this business but i was never a greater fool in my life for there was no such hurry to have gone on shore and the first lieutenant never forgave me for appealing to the captainbut of that byandby and all in good time at last i obtained a grumbling assent to my going on shore and off i went like a skyrocket being in a desperate hurry i hired a jauntingcar to take me to my fathers house is it the obrien of ballyhinch that you mane inquired the spalpeen who drove the horse sure it is replied i and how is he and all the noble family of the obriens all well enough bating the boy tim who caught a bit of confusion in his head the other night at the fair and now lies at home in bed quite insensible to mate or drink but the doctors give hopes of his recovery as all the obriens are known to have such thick heads what do you mane by that bad manners to you said i but poor timhow did it happenwas there a fight not much of a fightonly a bit of a skrummagethree crowners inquests no more but you are not going the straight road you thief said i seeing that he had turned off to the left ive my reasons for that your honour replied he i always turn away from the castle out of principlei lost a friend there and it makes me melancholy how came that for to happen all by accident your honour they hung my poor brother patrick there because he was a bad hand at arithmetic he should have gone to a better school then said i ive an idea that it was a bad school that he was brought up in replied he with a sigh he was a cattledealer your honour and one day somehow or another hed a cow too muchall for not knowing how to count your honourbad luck to his schoolmaster all that may be very true said i and pace be to his soul but i dont see why you are to drag me thats in such a hurry two miles out of my way out of principle is your honour in a hurry to get home then ill be thinking theyll not be in such a hurry to see you and who told you that my name was obrien you basteand do you dare to say that my friends wont be glad to see me plase your honour its all an idea of mineso say no more about it only this i know father mgrath who gives me absolution tould me the other day that i ought to pay him and not run in debt and then run away like terence obrien who went to say without paying for his shirts and his shoes and his stockings nor anything else and who would live to be hanged as sure as st patrick swam over the liffey with his head under his arm bad luck to that father mcgrath cried i devil burn me but ill be revenged upon him by that time we had arrived at the door of my fathers house i paid the rapparee and in i popped there was my father and mother and all my brothers and sisters bating tim who was in bed sure enough and died next day and that baste father mcgrath to boot when my mother saw me she ran to me and hugged me as she wept on my neck and then she wiped her eyes and sat down again but nobody else said how dye do or opened their mouths to me i said to myself sure theres some trifling mistake here but i held my tongue at last they all opened their mouths with a vengeance my father commencedarnt you ashamed on yourself terence obrien arnt you ashamed on yourself terence obrien cried father mgrath arnt you ashamed on yourself cried out all my brothers and sisters in full chorus whilst my poor mother put her apron to her eyes and said nothing the devil a bit for myself but very much ashamed for you all replied i to treat me in this manner whats the meaning of all this havent they seized my two cows to pay for your toggery you spalpeen cried my father havent they taken the hay to pay for your shoes and stockings cried father mgrath havent they taken the pig to pay for that ugly hat of yours cried my eldest sister and havent they taken my hens to pay for that dirk of yours cried another and all our best furniture to pay for your white shirts and black cravats cried murdock my brother and havent we been starved to death ever since cried they all och hone said my mother the devil they have said i when theyd all done sure im sorry enough but its no fault of mine father didnt you send me to say yes you rapparee but didnt you promiseor didnt i promise for you which is all one and the same thingthat youd pay it all back with your prizemoneyand where is it answer that terence obrien where is it father ill tell you its where next christmas iscoming but not come yet spake to him father mgrath said my father is not that a lie of yours terence obrien that youre after telling now said father mcgrath give me the money its no lie father mcgrath if it pleased you to die tomorrow the devil of a shilling have i to jingle on your tombstone for good luck bating those three or four which you may divide between you and i threw them on the floor terence obrien said father mcgrath its absolution that youll be wanting tomorrow after all your sins and enormities and the devil a bit shall you havetake that now father mgrath replied i very angrily its no absolution that ill want from you any howtake that now then you have had your share of heaven for ill keep

mgrath and whos to save your soul and send you to heaven if i dont you wicked wretch but ill see you dd firstso take that now terence obrien then ill turn protestant and damn the popetake that now father mgrath at this last broadside of mine my father and all my brothers and sisters raised a cry of horror and my mother burst into tears father mgrath seized hold of the pot of holy water and dipping in the little whisk began to sprinkle the room saying a latin prayer while they all went on squalling at me at last my father seized the stool which he had been seated upon and threw it at my head i dodged and it knocked down father mgrath who had just walked behind me in full song i knew that it was all over after that so i sprang over his carcass and gained the door good morning to ye all and better manners to you next time we meet cried i and off i set as fast as i could for the ship i was melancholy enough as i walked back and thought of what had passed i need not have been in such a confounded hurry said i to myself to ask leave thereby affronting the first lieutenant and i was very sorry for what i had said to the priest for my conscience thumped me very hard at having even pretended that id turn protestant which i never intended to do nor never will but live and die a good catholic as all my posterity have done before me and as i trust all my ancestors will for generations to come well i arrived on board and the first lieutenant was very savage i hoped he would get over it but he never did and he continued to treat me so ill that i determined to quit the ship which i did as soon as we arrived in cawsand bay the captain allowed me to go for i told him the whole truth of the matter and he saw that it was true so he recommended me to the captain of a jackass frigate who was in want of midshipmen what do you mean by a jackass frigate inquired i i mean one of your twentyeight gunships so called because there is as much difference between them and a real frigate like the one we are sailing in as there is between a donkey and a racehorse well the ship was no sooner brought down to the dockyard to have her ballast taken in than our captain came down to hera little thin spare man but a man of weight nevertheless for he brought a great pair of scales with him and weighed everything that was put on board i forget his real name but the sailors christened him captain avoirdupois he had a large book and in it he inserted the weight of the ballast and of the shot water provisions coals standing and running rigging cables and everything else then he weighed all the men and all the midshipmen and all the midshipmens chests and all the officers with everything belonging to them lastly he weighed himself which did not add much to the sum total i dont exactly know what this was for but he was always talking about centres of gravity displacement of fluid and lord knows what i believe it was to find out the longitude somehow or other but i didnt remain long enough in her to know the end of it for one day i brought on board a pair of new boots which i forgot to report that they might be put into the scales which swang on the gangway and whether the captain thought that they would sink his ship or for what i can not tell but he ordered me to quit her immediatelyso there i was adrift again i packed up my traps and went on shore putting on my new boots out of spite and trod into all the mud and mire i could meet and walked up and down from plymouth to dock until i was tired as a punishment to them until i wore the scoundrels out in a fortnight one day i was in the dockyard looking at a twodecker in the basin just brought forward for service and i inquired who was to be the captain they told me that his name was oconnor thens hes a countryman of mine thought i and ill try my luck so i called at gouds hotel where he was lodging and requested to speak with him i was admitted and i told him with my best bow that i had come as a volunteer for his ship and that my name was obrien as it happened he had some vacancies and liking my brogue he asked me in what ships i had served i told him and also my reason for quitting my lastwhich was because i was turned out of it i explained the story of the boots and he made inquiries and found that it was all true and then he gave me a vacancy as masters mate we were ordered to south america and the trade winds took us there in a jiffey i liked my captain and officers very much and what was better we took some good prizes but somehow or other i never had the luck to remain long in one ship and that by no fault of mine at least not in this instance all went on as smooth as possible until one day the captain took us on shore to a ball at one of the peaceable districts we had a very merry night of it but as luck would have it i had the morning watch to keep and see the decks cleaned and as i never neglected my duty i set off about three oclock in the morning just at break of day to go on board of the ship i was walking along the sands thinking of the pretty girl that id been dancing with and had got about half way to the ship when three rapparees of spanish soldiers came from behind a rock and attacked me with their swords and bayonets i had only my dirk but i was not to be run through for nothing so i fought them as long as i could i finished one fellow but at last they finished me for a bayonet passed through my body and i forgot all about it well it appearsfor i can only say to the best of my knowledge and beliefthat after they had killed me they stripped me naked and buried me in the sand carrying away with them the body of their comrade so there i wasdead and buried but obrien said i whisthold your tongueyouve not heard the end of it well i had been buried about an hourbut not very deep it appears for they were in too great a hurrywhen a fisherman and his daughter came along the beach on their way to the boat and the daughter god bless her did me the favour to tread upon my nose it was clear that she had never trod upon an irishmans nose before for it surprised her and she looked down to see what was there and not seeing anything she tried it again with her foot and then she scraped off the sand and discovered my pretty face i was quite warm and still breathing for the sand had stopped the blood and prevented my bleeding to death the fisherman pulled me out and took me on his back to the house where the captain and officers were still dancing when he brought me in there was a great cry from the ladies not because i was murdered for they are used to it in those countries but because i was naked which they considered a much more serious affair i was put to bed and a boat despatched on board for our doctor and in a few hours i was able to speak and tell them how it happened but i was too ill to move when the ship sailed which she was obliged to do in a day or two afterwards so the captain made out my discharge and left me there the family were french and i remained with them for six months before i could obtain a passage home during which i learnt their language and a very fair allowance of spanish to boot when i arrived in england i found that the prizes had been sold and that the money was ready for distribution i produced my certificate and received l for my share so its come at last thought i i never had such a handful of money in my life but i hope i shall again very soon i spread it out on the table as soon as i got home and looked at it and then i said to myself now terence obrien will you keep this money to yourself or send it home then i thought of father mgrath and the stool that was thrown at my head and i was very near sweeping it all back into my pocket but then i thought of my mother and of the cows and the pig and the furniture all gone and of my brothers and sisters wanting praties and i made a vow that id send every farthing of it to them after which father mgrath would no longer think of not giving me absolution so i sent them every doit only reserving for myself the pay which i had received amounting to about l and i never felt more happy in my life than when it was safe in the postoffice and fairly out of my hands i wrote a bit of a letter to my father at the time which was to this purpose honoured father since our last pleasant meeting at which you threw the stool at my head missing the pigeon and hitting the crow i have been dead and buried but am now quite well thank god and want no absolution from father mgrath bad luck to him and whats more to the point i have just received a batch of prizemoney the first i have handled since i have served his majesty and every farthing of which i now send to you that you may get back your old cows and the pig and all the rest of the articles seized to pay for my fitting out so never again ask me whether i am not ashamed of myself more shame to you for abusing a dutiful son like myself who went to sea at your bidding and has never had a real good potato down his throat ever since im a true obrien tell my mother and dont mane to turn protestant but uphold the religion of my country although the devil may take father mgrath and his holy water to boot i shant come and see you as perhaps you may have another stool ready for my head and may take better aim next time so no more at present from your affectionate son terence obrien about three weeks afterwards i received a letter from my father telling me that i was a real obrien and that if any one dared hint to the contrary he would break every bone in his body that they had received the money and thanked me for a real gentleman as i was that i should have the best stool in the house next time i came not for my head but for my tail that father mgrath sent me his blessing and had given me absolution for all i had done or should do for the next ten years to come that my mother had cried with joy at my dutiful behaviour and that all my brothers and sisters bating tim who had died the day after i left them wished me good luck and plenty more prizemoney to send home to them this was all very pleasant and i had nothing left on my mind but to get another ship so i went to the portadmiral and told him how it was that i left my last and he said that being dead and buried was quite sufficient reason for any one leaving his ship and that he would procure me another now that i had come to life again i was sent on board of the guardship where i remained about ten days and then was sent round to join this frigateand so my storys ended and theres eight bells strikingso the watch is ended too jump down peter and call robinson and tell him that ill trouble him to forget to go to sleep again as he did last time and leave me here kicking my heels contrary to the rules and regulations of the service chapter xiv the first lieutenant has more patientsmr chucks the boatswain lets me into the secret of his gentility before i proceed with my narrative i wish to explain to the reader that my history was not written in afterlife when i had obtained a greater knowledge of the world when i first went to sea i promised my mother that i would keep a journal of what passed with my reflections upon it to this promise i rigidly adhered and since i have been my own master these journals have remained in my possession in writing therefore the early part of my adventures everything is stated as it was impressed on my mind at the time upon many points i have since had reason to form a different opinion from that which is recorded and upon many others i have since laughed heartily at my folly and simplicity but still i have thought it advisable to let the ideas of the period remain rather than correct them by those of dearbought experience a boy of fifteen brought up in a secluded country town cannot be expected to reason and judge as a young man who has seen much of life and passed through a variety of adventures the reader must therefore remember that i have referred to my journal for the opinions and feelings which guided me between each distinct anniversary of my existence we had now been cruising for six weeks and i found that my profession was much more agreeable than i had anticipated my desire to please was taken for the deed and although i occasionally made a blunder yet the captain and first lieutenant seemed to think that i was attentive to my duty to the best of my ability and only smiled at my mistakes i also discovered that however my natural capacity may have been estimated by my family that it was not so depreciated here and every day i felt more confidence in myself and hoped by attention and diligence to make up for a want of natural endowment there certainly is something in the life of a sailor which enlarges the mind when i was at home six months before i allowed other people to think for me and acted wholly on the leadingstrings of their suggestions on board to the best of my ability i thought for myself i became happy with my messmatesthose who were harsh upon me left off because i never resented their conduct and those who were kind to me were even kinder than before the time flew away quickly i suppose because i knew exactly what i had to do and each day was the forerunner of the ensuing the first lieutenant was one of the most amusing men i ever knew yet he never relaxed from the discipline of the service or took the least liberty with either his superiors or inferiors his humour was principally shown in his various modes of punishment and however severe the punishment was to the party the manner of inflicting it was invariably a source of amusement to the remainder of the ships company i often thought that although no individual liked being punished yet that all the ships company were quite pleased when a punishment took place he was very particular about his decks they were always as white as snow and nothing displeased him so much as their being soiled it was for that reason that he had such an objection to the use of tobacco there were spittingpans placed in different parts of the decks for the use of the men that they might not dirty the planks with the tobaccojuice sometimes a man in his hurry forgot to use these pans but as the mess to which the stain might be opposite had their grog stopped if the party were not found out they took good care not only to keep a lookout but to inform against the offender now the punishment for the offence was as followsthe mans hands were tied behind his back and a large tin spittingbox fixed to his chest by a strap over the shoulders all the other boxes on the lower deck were taken away and he was obliged to walk there ready to attend the summons of any man who might wish to empty his mouth of the tobaccojuice the other men were so pleased at the fancy that they spat twice as much as before for the pleasure of making him run about mr chucks the boatswain called it the first lieutenants perambulating spittingpan he observed to me one day that really mr falcon was such an epicure about his decks that he was afraid to pudding an anchor on the forecastle i was much amused one morning watch that i kept we were stowing the hammocks in the quarterdeck nettings when one of the boys came up with his hammock on his shoulder and as he passed the first lieutenant the latter perceived that he had a quid of tobacco in his cheek what have you got there my good lada gumboilyour cheek is very much swelled no sir replied the boy theres nothing at all the matter o there must be it is a bad tooth then open your mouth and let me see very reluctantly the boy opened his mouth and discovered a large roll of tobaccoleaf i see i see said the first lieutenant your mouth wants overhauling and your teeth cleaning i wish we had a dentist on board but as we have not i will operate as well as i can send the armourer up here with his tongs when the armourer made his appearance the boy was made to open his mouth while the chaw of tobacco was extracted with his rough instrument there now said the first lieutenant im sure that you must feel better already you never could have had any appetite now captain of the afterguard bring a piece of old canvas and some sand here and clean his teeth nicely the captain of the afterguard came forward and putting the boys head between his knees scrubbed his teeth well with the sand and canvas for two or three minutes there that will do said the first lieutenant now my little fellow your mouth is nice and clean and youll enjoy your breakfast it was impossible for you to have eaten anything with your mouth in such a nasty state when its dirty again come to me and ill be your dentist one day i was on the forecastle with mr chucks the boatswain who was very kind to me he had been showing me how to make the various knots and bends of rope which are used in our service i am afraid that i was very stupid but he showed me over and over again until i learnt how to make them amongst others he taught me a fishermans bend which he pronounced to be the king of all knots and mr simple continued he there is a moral in that knot you observe that when the parts are drawn the right way and together the more you pull the faster they hold and the more impossible to untie them but see by hauling them apart how a little difference a pull the other way immediately disunites them and then how easy they cast off in a moment that points out the necessity of pulling together in this world mr simple when we wish to hold on and thats a piece of philosophy worth all the twentysix thousand and odd years of my friend the carpenter which leads to nothing but a brown study when he ought to be attending to his duty very true mr chucks you are the better philosopher of the two i am the better educated mr simple and i trust more of a gentleman i consider a gentleman to be to a certain degree a philosopher for very often he is obliged to support his character as such to put up with what another person may very properly fly in a passion about i think coolness is the great characterstick of a gentleman in the service mr simple one is obliged to appear angry without indulging the sentiment i can assure you that i never lose my temper even when i use my rattan why then mr chucks do you swear so much at the men surely that is not gentlemanly most certainly not sir but i must defend myself by observing the very artificial state in which we live on board of a manofwar necessity my dear mr simple has no law you must observe how gently i always commence when i have to find fault i do that to prove my gentility but sir my zeal for the service obliges me to alter my language to prove in the end that i am in earnest nothing would afford me more pleasure than to be able to carry on the duty as a gentleman but thats impossible i really cannot see why perhaps then mr simple you will explain to me why the captain and first lieutenant swear that i do not pretend to answer but they only do so upon an emergency exactly so but sir their mergency is my daily and hourly duty in the continual working of the ship i am answerable for all that goes amiss the life of a boatswain is a life of mergency and therefore i swear i still cannot allow it to be requisite and certainly it is sinful excuse me my dear sir it is absolutely requisite and not at all sinful there is one language for the pulpit and another for on board ship and in either situation a man must make use of those terms most likely to produce the necessary effect upon his listeners whether it is from long custom of the service or from the indifference of a sailor to all common things and language i cant exactly explain myself mr simple but i know what i mean perhaps constant excitement may do and therefore he requires more stimilis as they call it to make him move certain it is that common parlancy wont do with a common seaman it is not here as in the scriptures do this and he doeth it by the bye that chap must have had his soldiers in tight order but it is do this dn your eyes and then it is done directly the order to do just carries the weight of a cannonshot but it wants the perpelling powerthe dn is the gunpowder which sets it flying in the execution of its duty do you comprehend me mr simple i perfectly understand you mr chucks and i cannot help remarking and that without flattery that you are very different from the rest of the warrant officers where did you receive your education mr simple i am here a boatswain with a clean shirt and i say it myself and no one dare gainsay it also with a thorough knowledge of my duty but although i do not say that i ever was better off i can say this that ive been in the best society in the company of lords and ladies i once dined with your grandfather thats more than ever i did for he never asked me nor took the least notice of me replied i what i state is true i did not know that he was your grandfather until yesterday when i was talking with mr obrien but i perfectly recollect him although i was very young at that time now mr simple if you will promise me as a gentleman and i know you are one that you will not repeat what i tell you then ill let you into the history of my life mr chucks as i am a gentleman i never will divulge it until you are dead and buried and not then if you do not wish it when i am dead and buried you may do as you please it may then be of service to other people although my story is not a very long one mr chucks then sat down upon the foreend of the booms by the funnel and i took my place by his side when he commenced as follows my father was a boatswain before meone of the old school rough as a bear and drunken as a gosport fiddler my mother wasmy mother and i shall say no more my father was invalided for harbour duty after a life of intoxication and died shortly afterwards in the meantime i had been by the kindness of the portadmirals wife educated at a foundation school i was thirteen when my father died and my mother not knowing what to do with me wished to bind me apprentice to a merchant vessel but this i refused and after six months quarrelling on the subject i decided the point by volunteering in the narcissus frigate i believe that my gentlemanly ideas were innate mr simple i never as a child could bear the idea of the merchant service after i had been a week on board i was appointed servant to the purser where i gave such satisfaction by my alertness and dexterity that the first lieutenant took me away from the purser to attend upon himself so that in two months i was a person of such consequence as to create a disturbance in the gunroom for the purser was very angry and many of the officers took his part it was whispered that i was the son of the first lieutenant and that he was aware of it how far that may be true i know not but there was a likeness between us and my mother who was a very pretty woman attended his ship many years before as a bumboat girl i cant pretend to say anything about it but this i do say mr simpleand many will blame me for it but i cant help my natural feelingsthat i had rather be the byeblow of a gentleman than the gitimate offspring of a boatswain and his wife theres no chance of good blood in your veins in the latter instance whereas in the former you may have stolen a drop or two it so happened that after i had served the first lieutenant for about a year a young lord i must not mention his name mr simple was sent to sea by his friends or by his own choice i dont know which but i was told that his uncle who was zeckative and had an interest in his death persuaded him to go a lord at that period some twentyfive years ago was a rarity in the service and they used to salute him when he came on board the consequence was that the young lord must have a servant to himself although all the rest of the midshipmen had but one servant between them the captain inquired who was the best boy in the ship and the purser to whom he appealed recommended me accordingly much to the annoyance of the first lieutenant for first lieutenants in those days did not assume as they do now not that i refer to mr falcon who is a gentleman i was immediately surrendered to his lordship i had a very easy comfortable life of iti did little or nothing if inquired for when all hands were turned up i was cleaning his lordships boots or brushing his lordships clothes and there was nothing to be said when his lordships name was mentioned we went to the mediterranean because his lordships mamma wished it and we had been there about a year when his lordship ate so many grapes that he was seized with a dysentery he was ill for three weeks and then he requested to be sent to malta in a transport going to gibraltar or rather to the barbary coast for bullocks he became worse every day and made his will leaving me all his effects on board which i certainly deserved for the kindness with which i had nursed him off malta we fell in with a xebeque bound to civita vecchia and the captain of the transport anxious to proceed advised our going on board of her as the wind was light and contrary and these mediterranean vessels sailed better on a wind than the transport my master who was now sinking fast consented and we changed our ships the next day he died and a gale of wind came on which prevented us from gaining the port for several days and the body of his lordship not only became so offensive but affected the superstition of the catholic sailors so much that it was hove overboard none of the people could speak english nor could i speak maltese they had no idea who we were and i had plenty of time for cogitation i had often thought what a fine thing it was to be a lord and as often wished that i had been born one the wind was still against us when a merchant vessel ran down to us that had left civita vecchia for gibraltar i desired the captain of the xebeque to make a signal of distress or rather i did myself and the vessel which proved to be english bore down to us i manned the boat to go on board and the idea came into my head that although they might refuse to take me they would not refuse a lord i put on the midshipmans uniform belonging to his lordship but then certainly belonging to me and went alongside of the merchant vessel i told them that i had left my ship for the benefit of my health and wanted a passage to gibraltar on my way home my title and immediate acceptance of the terms demanded for my passage was sufficient my property was brought from the xebeque and of course as they could not speak english they could not contradict even if they suspected here mr simple i must acknowledge a slight flaw in my early history which i impart to you in confidence or otherwise i should not have been able to prove that i was correct in asserting that i had dined with your grandfather but the temptation was too strong and i could not resist think yourself mr simple after having served as a ships boy clouted here kicked there damned by one and sent to hell by anotherto find myself treated with such respect and deference and my lorded this and my lorded that every minute of the day during my passage to gibraltar i had plenty of time for arranging my plans i hardly need say that my lords kit was valuable and what was better they exactly fitted me i also had his watches and trinkets and many other things besides a bag of dollars however they were honestly mine the only thing that i took was his name which he had no further occasion for poor fellow but its no use defending what was wrongit was dishonest and theres an end of it now observe mr simple how one thing leads to another i declare to you that my first idea of making use of his lordships name was to procure a passage to gibraltar i then was undecided how to act but as i had charge of his papers and letters to his mother and guardian i thinkindeed i am almost surethat i should have laid aside my dignity and midshipmans dress and applied for a passage home to the commissioner of the yard but it was fated to be otherwise for the master of the transport went on shore to report and obtain pratique and he told them everywhere that young lord a was a passenger with him going to england for the benefit of his health in less than halfanhour off came the commissioners boat and another boat from the governor requesting the honour of my company and that i would take a bed at their houses during my stay what could i do i began to be frightened but i was more afraid to confess that i was an impostor for i am sure the master of the transport alone would have kicked me overboard if i had let him know that he had been so confounded polite to a ships boy so i blushed half from modesty and half from guilt and accepted the invitation of the governor sending a polite verbal refusal to the commissioner upon the plea of there being no paper or pens on board i had so often accompanied my late master that i knew very well how to conduct myself and had borrowed a good deal of his air and appearanceindeed i had a natural taste for gentility i could write and read not perhaps so well as i ought to have done considering the education i had received but still quite well enough for a lord and indeed much better than my late master i knew his signature well enough although the very idea of being forced to use it made me tremble however the die was cast i ought to observe that in one point we were not unlikeboth had curly light hair and blue eyes in other points there was no resemblance i was by far the betterlooking chap of the two and as we had been up the mediterranean for two years i had no fear of any doubt as to my identity until i arrived in england well mr simple i dressed myself very carefully put on my chains and rings and a little perfume on my handkerchief and accompanied the aidedecamp to the governors where i was asked after my mother lady and my uncle my guardian and a hundred other questions at first i was much confused which was attributed to bashfulness and so it was but not of the right sort but before the day was over i had become so accustomed to be called my lord and to my situation that i was quite at my ease and began to watch the motions and behaviour of the company that i might regulate my comportment by that of good society i remained at gibraltar for a fortnight and then was offered a passage in a transport ordered to portsmouth being an officer of course it was free to a certain extent on my passage to england i again made up my mind that i would put off my dress and title as soon as i could escape from observation but i was prevented as before the portadmiral sent off to request the pleasure of my company to dinner i dared not refuse and there i was my lord as before courted and feasted by everybody tradesmen called to request the honour of my lordships custom my table at the hotel was covered with cards of all descriptions and to confess the truth i liked my situation so much and had been so accustomed to it that i now began to dislike the idea that one day or other i must resign it which i determined to do as soon as i quitted the place my bill at the hotel was very extravagant and more than i could pay but the master said it was not of the least consequence that of course his lordship had not provided himself with cash just coming from foreign parts and offered to supply me with money if i required it this i will say i was honest enough to refuse i left my cards ppc as they do mr simple in all wellregulated society and set off in the mail for london where i fully resolved to drop my title and to proceed to scotland to his lordships mother with the mournful intelligence of his deathfor you see mr simple no one knew that his lordship was dead the captain of the transport had put him into the xebeque alive and the vessel bound to gibraltar had received him as they imagined the captain of the frigate had very soon afterwards advices from gibraltar stating his lordships recovery and return to england well i had not been in the coach more than five minutes when who should get in but a gentleman whom i had met at the portadmirals besides which the coachman and others knew me very well when i arrived in london i still wore my midshipmans uniform i went to an hotel recommended to me as i afterwards found out the most fashionable in town my title still following me i now determined to put off my uniform and dress in plain clothesmy farce was over i went to bed that night and the next morning made my appearance in a suit of mufti making inquiry of the waiter which was the best conveyance to scotland post chay and four my lord at what time shall i order it o replied i i am not sure that i shall go tomorrow just at this moment in came the master of the hotel with the morning post in his hand making me a low bow and pointing to the insertion of my arrival at his hotel among the fashionables this annoyed me and now that i found how difficult it was to get rid of my title i became particularly anxious to be william chucks as before before twelve oclock three or four gentlemen were ushered into my sittingroom who observing my arrival in that damnd morning post came to pay their respects and before the day was over i was invited and reinvited by a dozen people i found that i could not retreat and i went away with the stream as i did before at gibraltar and portsmouth for three weeks i was everywhere and if i found it agreeable at portsmouth how much more so in london but i was not happy mr simple because i was a cheat every moment expecting to be found out but it really was a nice thing to be a lord at last the play was over i had been enticed by some young men into a gamblinghouse where they intended to fleece me but for the first night they allowed me to win i think about l i was quite delighted with my success and had agreed to meet them the next evening but when i was at breakfast with my legs crossed reading the morning post who should come to see me but my guardian uncle he knew his nephews features too well to be deceived and my not recognising him proved at once that i was an impostor you must allow me to hasten over the scene which took placethe wrath of the uncle the confusion in the hotel the abuse of the waiters the police officer and being dragged into a hackney coach to bowstreet there i was examined and confessed all the uncle was so glad to find that his nephew was really dead that he felt no resentment towards me and as after all i had only assumed a name but had cheated nobody except the landlord at portsmouth i was sent on board the tender off the tower to be drafted into a manofwar as for my l my clothes c i never heard any more of them they were seized i presume by the landlord of the hotel for my bill and very handsomely he must have paid himself i had two rings on my fingers and a watch in my pocket when i was sent on board the tender and i stowed them away very carefully i had also a few pounds in my purse i was sent round to plymouth where i was drafted into a frigate after i had been there some time i turned the watch and rings into money and bought myself a good kit of clothes for i could not bear to be dirty i was put into the mizentop and no one knew that i had been a lord you found some difference i should think in your situation yes i did mr simple but i was much happier i could not forget the ladies and the dinners and the opera and all the delights of london beside the respect paid to my title and i often sighed for them but the police officer and bowstreet also came to my recollection and i shuddered at the remembrance it had however one good effect i determined to be an officer if i could and learnt my duty and worked my way up to quartermaster and thence to boatswainand i know my duty mr simple but ive been punished for my folly ever since i formed ideas above my station in life and cannot help longing to be a gentleman its a bad thing for a man to have ideas above his station you certainly must find some difference between the company in london and that of the warrant officers its many years back now sir but i cant get over the feeling i cant sociate with them at all a man may have the feelings of a gentleman although in a humble capacity but how can i be intimate with such people as mr dispart or mr muddle the carpenter all very well in their way mr simple but what can you expect from officers who boil their tators in a cabbagenet hanging in the ships coppers when they know that there is onethird of a stove allowed them to cook their victuals on chapter xv i go on service and am made prisoner by an old lady who not able to obtain my hand takes part of my finger as a tokenobrien rescues me a lee shore and narrow escape two or three days after this conversation with mr chucks the captain ran the frigate in shore and when within five miles we discovered two vessels under the land we made all sail in chase and cut them off from escaping round a sandy point which they attempted to weather finding that they could not effect their purpose they ran on shore under a small battery of two guns which commenced firing upon us the first shot which whizzed between the masts had to me a most terrific sound but the officers and men laughed at it so of course i pretended to do the same but in reality i could see nothing to laugh at the captain ordered the starboard watch to be piped to quarters and the boats to be cleared ready for hoisting out we then anchored within a mile of the battery and returned the fire in the meantime the remainder of the ships company hoisted out and lowered down four boats which were manned and armed to storm the battery i was very anxious to go on service and obrien who had command of the first cutter allowed me to go with him on condition that i stowed myself away under the foresheets that the captain might not see me before the boats had shoved off this i did and was not discovered we pulled in abreast towards the battery and in less than ten minutes the boats were run on the beach and we jumped out the frenchmen fired a gun at us as we pulled close to the shore and then ran away so that we took possession without any fighting which to confess the truth i was not sorry for as i did not think that i was old or strong enough to cope hand to hand with a grownup man there were a few fishermens huts close to the battery and while two of the boats went on board of the vessels to see if they could be got off and others were spiking the guns and destroying the carriages i went with obrien to examine them they were deserted by the people as might have been supposed but there was a great quantity of fish in them apparently caught that morning obrien pointed to a very large skatemurder in irish cried he its the very ghost of my grandmother well have her if its only for the family likeness peter put your finger into the gills and drag her down to the boat i could not force my finger into the gills and as the animal appeared quite dead i hooked my finger into its mouth but i made a sad mistake for the animal was alive and immediately closed its jaws nipping my finger to the bone and holding it so tight that i could not withdraw it and the pain was too great to allow me to pull it away by main force and tear my finger which it held so fast there i was caught in a trap and made a prisoner by a flatfish fortunately i hallooed loud enough to make obrien who was close down to the boats with a large codfish under each arm turn round and come to my assistance at first he could not help me from laughing so much but at last he forced open the jaw of the fish with his cutlass and i got my finger out but very badly torn indeed i then took off my garter tied it round the tail of the skate and dragged it to the boat which was all ready to shove off the other boats had found it impossible to get the vessels off without unloadingso in pursuance of the captains orders they were set on fire and before we lost sight of them had burnt down to the waters edge my finger was very bad for three weeks and the officers laughed at me very much saying that i narrowly escaped being made a prisoner of by an old maid we continued our cruise along the coast until we had run down into the bay of arcason where we captured two or three vessels and obliged many more to run on shore and here we had an instance showing how very important it is that a captain of a manofwar should be a good sailor and have his ship in such discipline as to be strictly obeyed by his ships company i heard the officers unanimously assert after the danger was over that nothing but the presence of mind which was shown by captain savage could have saved the ship and her crew we had chased a convoy of vessels to the bottom of the bay the wind was very fresh when we hauled off after running them on shore and the surf on the beach even at that time was so great that they were certain to go to pieces before they could be got afloat again we were obliged to doublereef the topsails as soon as we hauled to the wind and the weather looked very threatening in an hour afterwards the whole sky was covered with one black cloud which sank so low as nearly to touch our mastheads and a tremendous sea which appeared to have risen up almost by magic rolled in upon us setting the vessel on a dead lee shore as the night closed in it blew a dreadful gale and the ship was nearly buried with the press of canvas which she was obliged to carry for had we searoom we should have been lyingto under storm staysails but we were forced to carry on at all risks that we might claw off shore the sea broke over as we lay in the trough deluging us with water from the forecastle aft to the binnacles and very often as the ship descended with a plunge it was with such force that i really thought she would divide in half with the violence of the shock double breechings were rove on the guns and they were further secured with tackles and strong cleats nailed behind the trunnions for we heeled over so much when we lurched that the guns were wholly supported by the breechings and tackles and had one of them broken loose it must have burst right through the lee side of the ship and she must have foundered the captain first lieutenant and most of the officers remained on deck during the whole of the night and really what with the howling of the wind the violence of the rain the washing of the water about the decks the working of the chainpumps and the creaking and groaning of the timbers i thought that we must inevitably have been lost and i said my prayers at least a dozen times during the night for i felt it impossible to go to bed i had often wished out of curiosity that i might be in a gale of wind but i little thought it was to have been a scene of this description or anything half so dreadful what made it more appalling was that we were on a lee shore and the consultations of the captain and officers and the eagerness with which they looked out for daylight told us that we had other dangers to encounter besides the storm at last the morning broke and the lookout man upon the gangway called out land on the lee beam i perceived the master dash his fist against the hammockrails as if with vexation and walk away without saying a word and looking very grave up there mr wilson said the captain to the second lieutenant and see how far the land trends forward and whether you can distinguish the point the second lieutenant went up the mainrigging and pointed with his hand to about two points before the beam do you see two hillocks inland yes sir replied the second lieutenant then it is so observed the captain to the master and if we weather it we shall have more searoom keep her full and let her go through the water do you hear quartermaster ay ay sir thus and no nearer my man ease her with a spoke or two when she sends but be careful or shell take the wheel out of your hands it really was a very awful sight when the ship was in the trough of the sea you could distinguish nothing but a waste of tumultuous water but when she was borne up on the summit of the enormous waves you then looked down as it were upon a low sandy coast close to you and covered with foam and breakers she behaves nobly observed the captain stepping aft to the binnacle and looking at the compass if the wind does not baffle us we shall weather the captain had scarcely time to make the observation when the sails shivered and flapped like thunder up with the helm what are you about quartermaster the wind has headed us sir replied the quartermaster coolly the captain and master remained at the binnacle watching the compass and when the sails were again full she had broken off two points and the point of land was only a little on the lee bow we must wear her round mr falcon hands wear shipready oh ready she has come up again cried the master who was at the binnacle hold fast there a minute hows her head now nne as she was before she broke off sir pipe belay said the captain falcon continued he if she breaks off again we may have no room to wear indeed there is so little room now that i must run the risk which cable was ranged last nightthe best bower yes sir jump down then and see it doublebitted and stoppered at thirty fathoms see it well doneour lives may depend upon it the ship continued to hold her course good and we were within half a mile of the point and fully expected to weather it when again the wet and heavy sails flapped in the wind and the ship broke off two points as before the officers and seamen were aghast for the ships head was right on to the breakers luff now all you can quartermaster cried the captain send the men aft directly my lads there is no time for wordsi am going to clubhaul the ship for there is no room to wear the only chance you have of safety is to be cool watch my eye and execute my orders with precision away to your stations for tacking ship hands by the best bower anchor mr wilson attend below with the carpenter and his mates ready to cut away the cable at the moment that i give the order silence there fore and aft quartermaster keep her full again for stays mind you ease the helm down when i tell you about a minute passed before the captain gave any further orders the ship had closedto within a quarter of a mile of the beach and the waves curled and topped around us bearing us down upon the shore which presented one continued surface of foam extending to within half a cables length of our position the captain waved his hand in silence to the quartermaster at the wheel and the helm was put down the ship turned slowly to the wind pitching and chopping as the sails were spilling when she had lost her way the captain gave the order let go the anchor we will haul all at once mr falcon said the captain not a word was spoken the men went to the fore brace which had not been manned most of them knew although i did not that if the ships head did not go round the other way we should be on shore and among the breakers in half a minute i thought at the time that the captain had said that he would haul all the yards at once there appeared to be doubt or dissent on the countenance of mr falcon and i was afterwards told that he had not agreed with the captain but he was too good an officer and knew that there was no time for discussion to make any remark and the event proved that the captain was right at last the ship was head to wind and the captain gave the signal the yards flew round with such a creaking noise that i thought the masts had gone over the side and the next moment the wind had caught the sails and the ship which for a moment or two had been on an even keel careened over to her gunnel with its force the captain who stood upon the weatherhammock rails holding by the mainrigging ordered the helm amidships looked full at the sails and then at the cable which grew broad upon the weather bow and held the ship from nearing the shore at last he cried cut away the cable a few strokes of the axes were heard and then the cable flew out of the hawsehole in a blaze of fire from the violence of the friction and disappeared under a huge wave which struck us on the chesstree and deluged us with water fore and aft but we were now on the other tack and the ship regained her way and we had evidently increased our distance from the land my lads said the captain to the ships company you have behaved well and i thank you but i must tell you honestly that we have more difficulties to get through we have to weather a point of the bay on this tack mr falcon splice the mainbrace and call the watch hows her head quartermaster sw by s southerly sir very well let her go through the water and the captain beckoning to the master to follow him went down into the cabin as our immediate danger was over i went down into the berth to see if i could get anything for breakfast where i found obrien and two or three more by the powers it was as nate a thing as ever i saw done observed obrien the slightest mistake as to time or management and at this moment the flatfish would have been dubbing at our ugly carcases peter youre not fond of flatfish are you my boy we may thank heaven and the captain i can tell you that my lads but now wheres the chart robinson hand me down the parallel rules and compasses peter they are in the corner of the shelf here we are now a devilish sight too near this infernal point who knows how her head is i do obrien i heard the quartermaster tell the captain sw by s southerly let me see continued obrien variation lee wayrather too large an allowance of that im afraid but however well give her points the diomede would blush to make any more under any circumstances herethe compassnow well see and obrien advanced the parallel rule from the compass to the spot where the ship was placed on the chart bother you see its as much as shell do to weather the other point now on this tack and thats what the captain meant when he told us we had more difficulty i could have taken my bible oath that we were clear of everything if the wind held see what the distance is obrien said robinson it was measured and proved to be thirteen miles only thirteen miles and if we do weather we shall do very well for the bay is deep beyond its a rocky point you see just by way of variety well my lads ive a piece of comfort for you anyhow its not long that youll be kept in suspense for by one oclock this day youll either be congratulating each other upon your good luck or youll be past praying for come put up the chart for i hate to look at melancholy prospects and steward see what you can find in the way of comfort some bread and cheese with the remains of yesterdays boiled pork were put on the table with a bottle of rum procured at the time they spliced the mainbrace but we were all too anxious to eat much and one by one returned on deck to see how the weather was and if the wind at all favoured us on deck the superior officers were in conversation with the captain who had expressed the same fear that obrien had in our berth the men who knew what they had to expectfor this sort of intelligence is soon communicated through a shipwere assembled in knots looking very grave but at the same time not wanting in confidence they knew that they could trust to the captain as far as skill or courage could avail them and sailors are too sanguine to despair even at the last moment as for myself i felt such admiration for the captain after what i had witnessed that morning that whenever the idea came over me that in all probability i should be lost in a few hours i could not help acknowledging how much more serious it was that such a man should be lost to his country i do not intend to say that it consoled me but it certainly made me still more regret the chances with which we were threatened before twelve oclock the rocky point which we so much dreaded was in sight broad on the leebow and if the low sandy coast appeared terrible how much more did this even at a distance the black masses of rock covered with foam which each minute dashed up in the air higher than our lower mastheads the captain eyed it for some minutes in silence as if in calculation mr falcon said he at last we must put the mainsail on her she never can bear it sir she must bear it was the reply send the men aft to the mainsheet see that careful men attend the buntlines the mainsail was set and the effect of it upon the ship was tremendous she careened over so that her lee channels were under the water and when pressed by a sea the leeside of the quarterdeck and gangway were afloat she now reminded me of a goaded and fiery horse mad with the stimulus applied not rising as before but forcing herself through whole seas and dividing the waves which poured in one continual torrent from the forecastle down upon the decks below four men were secured to the wheelthe sailors were obliged to cling to prevent being washed awaythe ropes were thrown in confusion to leeward the shot rolled out of the lockers and every eye was fixed aloft watching the masts which were expected every moment to go over the side a heavy sea struck us on the broadside and it was some moments before the ship appeared to recover herself she reeled trembled and stopped her way as if it had stupefied her the first lieutenant looked at the captain as if to say this will not do it is our only chance answered the captain to the appeal that the ship went faster through the water and held a better wind was certain but just before we arrived at the point the gale increased in force if anything starts we are lost sir observed the first lieutenant again i am perfectly aware of it replied the captain in a calm tone but as i said before and you must now be aware it is our only chance the consequence of any carelessness or neglect in the fitting and securing of the rigging will be felt now and this danger if we escape it ought to remind us how much we have to answer for if we neglect our duty the lives of a whole ships company may be sacrificed by the neglect or incompetence of an officer when in harbour i will pay you the compliment falcon to say that i feel convinced that the masts of the ship are as secure as knowledge and attention can make them the first lieutenant thanked the captain for his good opinion and hoped it would not be the last compliment which he paid him i hope not too but a few minutes will decide the point the ship was now within two cables lengths of the rocky point some few of the men i observed to clasp their hands but most of them were silently taking off their jackets and kicking off their shoes that they might not lose a chance of escape provided the ship struck twill be touch and go indeed falcon observed the captain for i had clung to the belayingpins close to them for the last halfhour that the mainsail had been set come aft you and i must take the helm we shall want nerve there and only there now the captain and first lieutenant went aft and took the forespokes of the wheel and obrien at a sign made by the captain laid hold of the spokes behind him an old quartermaster kept his station at the fourth the roaring of the seas on the rocks with the howling of the wind were dreadful but the sight was more dreadful than the noise for a few moments i shut my eyes but anxiety forced me to open them again as near as i could judge we were not twenty yards from the rocks at the time that the ship passed abreast of them we were in the midst of the foam which boiled around us and as the ship was driven nearer to them and careened with the wave i thought that our mainyardarm would have touched the rock and at this moment a gust of wind came on which laid the ship on her beamends and checked her progress through the water while the accumulated noise was deafening a few moments more the ship dragged on another wave dashed over her and spent itself upon the rocks while the spray was dashed back from them and returned upon the decks the main rock was within ten yards of her counter when another gust of wind laid us on our beamends the foresail and mainsail split and were blown clean out of the boltropesthe ship righted trembling fore and aft i looked astern the rocks were to windward on our quarter and we were safe i thought at the time that the ship relieved of her courses and again lifting over the waves was not a bad similitude of the relief felt by us all at that moment and like her we trembled as we panted with the sudden reaction and felt the removal of the intense anxiety which oppressed our breasts the captain resigned the helm and walked aft to look at the point which was now broad on the weather quarter in a minute or two he desired mr falcon to get new sails up and bend them and then went below to his cabin i am sure it was to thank god for our deliverance i did most fervently not only then but when i went to my hammock at night we were now comparatively safein a few hours completely so for strange to say immediately after we had weathered the rocks the gale abated and before morning we had a reef out of the topsails it was my afternoon watch and perceiving mr chucks on the forecastle i went forward to him and asked him what he thought of it thought of it sir replied he why i always think bad of it when the elements wont allow my whistle to be heard and i consider it hardly fair play i never care if we are left to our own exertions but how is it possible for a ships company to do their best when they cannot hear the boatswains pipe however god be thanked nevertheless and make better christians of us all as for that carpenter he is mad just before we weathered the point he told me that it was just the same and odd years ago i do believe that on his deathbed and he was not far from a very hard one yesterday he will tell us how he died so many thousand years ago of the same complaint and that gunner of ours is a fool would you believe it mr simple he went crying about the decks o my poor guns what will become of them if they break loose he appeared to consider it of no consequence if the ship and ships company were all lost provided that his guns were safely landed on the beach mr dispart said i at last allow me to observe in the most delicate way in the world that youre a dd old fool you see mr simple its the duty of an officer to generalise and be attentive to parts only in consideration of the safety of the whole i look after my anchors and cables as i do after the rigging not that i care for any of them in particular but because the safety of a ship depends upon her being well found i might just as well cry because we sacrificed an anchor and cable yesterday morning to save the ship from going on shore very true mr chucks replied i private feelings continued he must always be sacrificed for the public service as you know the lower deck was full of water and all our cabins and chests were afloat but i did not think then about my shirts and look at them now all blowing out in the forerigging without a particle of starch left in the collars or the frills i shall not be able to appear as an officer ought to do for the whole of the cruise as he said this the cooper going forward passed by him and jostled him in passing beg pardon sir said the man but the ship lurched the ship lurched did it replied the boatswain who i am afraid was not in the best of humours about his wardrobe and pray mr cooper why has heaven granted you two legs with joints at the knees except to enable you to counteract the horizontal deviation do you suppose they were meant for nothing but to work round a cask with hark sir did you take me for a post to scrub your pigs hide against allow me just to observe mr cooperjust to insinuate that when you pass an officer it is your duty to keep at a respectable distance and not to soil his clothes with your rusty iron jacket do you comprehend me sir or will this make you recollect in future the rattan was raised and descended in a shower of blows until the cooper made his escape into the head there take that you contaminating stavedubbing gimletcarrying quintessence of a bunghole i beg your pardon mr simple for interrupting the conversation but when duty calls we must obey very true mr chucks its now striking seven bells and i must call the masterso goodby chapter xvi news from homea fatigue party employed at gibraltarmore particulars in the life of mr chucksa brush with the enemya courtmartial and a lasting impression a few days afterwards a cutter joined us from plymouth with orders for the frigate to proceed forthwith to gibraltar where we should learn our destination we were all very glad of this for we had had quite enough of cruising in the bay of biscay and as we understood that we were to be stationed in the mediterranean we hoped to exchange gales of wind and severe weather for fine breezes and a bright sky the cutter brought out our letters and newspapers i never felt more happy than i did when i found one put into my hands it is necessary to be far from home and friends to feel the real delight of receiving a letter i went down into the most solitary place in the steerage that i might enjoy it without interruption i cried with pleasure before i opened it but i cried a great deal more with grief after i had read the contentsfor my eldest brother tom was dead of a typhus fever poor tom when i called to mind what tricks he used to play mehow he used to borrow my money and never pay meand how he used to thrash me and make me obey him because he was my eldest brotheri shed a torrent of tears at his loss and then i reflected how miserable my poor mother must be and i cried still more whats the matter spooney said obrien coming up to me who has been licking you now o nobody replied i but my eldest brother tom is dead and i have no other well peter i dare say that your brother was a very good brother but ill tell you a secret when youve lived long enough to have a beard to scrape at youll know better than to make a fuss about an elder brother but youre a good innocent boy just now so i wont thrash you for it come dry your eyes peter and never mind it well drink his health and long life to him after supper and then never think any more about it i was very melancholy for a few days but it was so delightful running down the portuguese and spanish coasts the weather was so warm and the sea so smooth that i am afraid i forgot my brothers death sooner than i ought to have done but my spirits were cheered up and the novelty of the scene prevented me from thinking every one too was so gay and happy that i could not well be otherwise in a fortnight we anchored in gibraltar bay and the ship was stripped to refit there was so much duty to be done that i did not like to go on shore indeed mr falcon had refused some of my messmates and i thought it better not to ask although i was very anxious to see a place which was considered so extraordinary one afternoon i was looking over the gangway as the people were at supper and mr falcon came up to me and said well mr simple what are you thinking of i replied touching my hat that i was wondering how they had cut out the solid rock into galleries and that they must be very curious that is to say that you are very curious to see them well then since you have been very attentive to your duty and have not asked to go on shore i will give you leave to go tomorrow morning and stay till gunfire i was very much pleased at this as the officers had a general invitation to dine with the mess and all who could obtain leave being requested to come i was enabled to join the party the first lieutenant had excused himself on the plea of there being so much to attend to on board but most of the gunroom officers and some of the midshipmen obtained leave we walked about the town and fortifications until dinnertime and then we proceeded to the barracks the dinner was very good and we were all very merry but after the dessert had been brought in i slipped away with a young ensign who took me all over the galleries and explained everything to me which was a much better way of employing my time than doing as the others did which the reader will acknowledge i was at the sallyport before gunfirethe boat was there but no officers made their appearance the gun fired the drawbridge was hauled up and i was afraid that i should be blamed but the boat was not ordered to shove off as it was waiting for commissioned officers about an hour afterwards when it was quite dark the sentry pointed his arms and challenged a person advancing with who comes therenaval officer drunk on a wheelbarrow was the reply in a loud singing voice upon which the sentry recovered his arms singing in return pass naval officer drunk on a wheelbarrowand alls well and then appeared a soldier in his fatigue dress wheeling down the third lieutenant in a wheelbarrow so tipsy that he could not stand or speak then the sentry challenged again and the answer was another naval officer drunk on a wheelbarrow upon which the sentry replied as before pass another naval officer drunk on a wheelbarrow and alls well this was my friend obrien almost as bad as the third lieutenant and so they continued for ten minutes challenging and passing until they wheeled down the remainder of the party with the exception of the second lieutenant who walked arm and arm with the officer who brought down the order for lowering the drawbridge i was much shocked for i considered it very disgraceful but i afterwards was told which certainly admitted of some excuse that the mess were notorious for never permitting any of their guests to leave the table sober they were all safely put into the boat and i am glad to say the first lieutenant was in bed and did not see them but i could not help acknowledging the truth of an observation made by one of the men as the officers were handed into the boat i say bill if them were we what a precious twisting we should get tomorrow at six bells the ship remained in gibraltar bay about three weeks during which time we had refitted the rigging fore and aft restowed and cleaned the hold and painted outside she never looked more beautiful than she did when in obedience to our orders we made sail to join the admiral we passed europa point with a fair wind and at sunset we were sixty miles from the rock yet it was distinctly to be seen like a blue cloud but the outline perfectly correct i mention this as perhaps my reader would not have believed that it was possible to see land at such a distance we steered for cape de gatte and we were next day close in shore i was very much delighted with the spanish coast mountain upon mountain hill upon hill covered with vines nearly to their summits we might have gone on shore at some places for at that time we were friendly with the spaniards but the captain was in too great a hurry to join the admiral we had very light winds and a day or two afterwards we were off valencia nearly becalmed i was on the gangway looking through a telescope at the houses and gardens round the city when mr chucks the boatswain came up to me mr simple oblige me with that glass a moment i wish to see if a building remains there which i have some reason to remember what were you ever on shore there yes i was mr simple and nearly stranded but i got off again without much damage how do you meanwere you wrecked then not my ship mr simple but my peace of mind was for some time but its many years ago when i was first made boatswain of a corvette during this conversation he was looking through the telescope yes there it is said he i have it in the field look mr simple do you see a small church with a spire of glazed tiles shining like a needle yes i do well then just above it a little to the right there is a long white house with four small windowsbelow the grove of orangetrees i see it replied i but what about that house mr chucks why thereby hangs a tale replied he giving a sigh which raised and then lowered the frill of his shirt at least six inches why what is the mystery mr chucks ill tell you mr simple with one who lived in that house i was for the first and for the last time in love indeed i should like very much to hear the story so you shall mr simple but i must beg that you will not mention it as young gentlemen are apt to quiz and i think that being quizzed hurts my authority with the men it is now about sixteen years backwe were then on good terms with the spaniards as we are now i was then little more than thirty years old and had just received my warrant as boatswain i was considered a welllooking young man at that time although lately i have to a certain degree got the better of that well i consider you a remarkably goodlooking man now mr chucks thank you mr simple but nothing improves by age that i know of except rum i used to dress very smart and cut the boatswain when i was on shore and perhaps i had not lost so much of the polish i had picked up in good society one evening i was walking in the plaza when i saw a female ahead who appeared to be the prettiest moulded little vessel that i ever cast my eyes on i followed in her wake and examined her such a clean run i never beheldso neat too in all her rigging everything so nicely stowed under hatches and then she sailed along in such a style at one moment lifting so lightly just like a frigate with her topsails on the caps that cant help going along at another time as she turned a corner sharp up in the windwake as straight as an arrowno leewayi made all sail to sheer alongside of her and when under quarter examined her close never saw such a fine swell in the counter and all so trimno ropes towing overboard well mr simple i said to myself dn it if her figurehead and bows be finished off by the same builder shes perfect so i shot ahead and yawed a littlecaught a peep at her through her veil and saw two black eyesas bright as beads and as large as damsons i saw quite enough and not wishing to frighten her i dropped astern shortly afterwards she altered her course steering for that white house just as she was abreast of it and i playing about her weather quarter the priests came by in procession taking the host to somebody who was dying my little frigate lowered her topgallant sails out of respect as other nations used to do and ought now and be dd to them whenever they pass the flag of old england how do you mean inquired i i mean that she spread her white handkerchief which fluttered in her hand as she went along and knelt down upon it on one knee i did the same because i was obliged to heaveto to keep my station and i thought that if she saw me it would please her when she got up i was on my legs also but in my hurry i had not chosen a very clean place and i found out when i got up again that my white jean trousers were in a shocking mess the young lady turned round and seeing my misfortune laughed and then went into the white house while i stood there like a fool first looking at the door of the house and then at my trousers however i thought that i might make it the means of being acquainted with her so i went to the door and knocked an old gentleman in a large cloak who was her father came out i pointed to my trousers and requested him in spanish to allow me a little water to clean them the daughter then came from within and told her father how the accident had happened the old gentleman was surprised that an english officer was so good a christian and appeared to be pleased he asked me very politely to come in and sent an old woman for some water i observed that he was smoking a bit of paper and having very fortunately about a couple of dozen of real havannahs in my pocket for i never smoke anything else mr simple it being my opinion that no gentleman can i took them out and begged his acceptance of them his eyes glistened at the sight of them but he refused to take more than one however i insisted upon his taking the whole bundle telling him that i had plenty more on board reserving one for myself that i might smoke it with him he then requested me to sit down and the old woman brought some sour wine which i declared was very good although it made me quite ill afterwards he inquired of me whether i was a good christian i replied that i was i knew that he meant a catholic for they call us heretics mr simple the daughter then came in without her veil and she was perfection but i did not look at her or pay her any attention after the first salutation i was so afraid of making the old gentleman suspicious he then asked what i waswhat sort of officer was i captain i replied that i was not was i tenente which means lieutenant i answered that i was not again but with an air of contempt as if i was something better what was i then i did not know the spanish for boatswain and to tell the truth i was ashamed of my condition i knew that there was an officer in spain called corregidor which means a corrector in english or one who punishes now i thought that quite near enough for my purpose and i replied that i was the corregidor now mr simple a corregidor in spain is a person of rank and consequence so they imagined that i must be the same and they appeared to be pleased the young lady then inquired if i was of good familywhether i was a gentleman or not i replied that i hoped so i remained with them for halfanhour more when my segar was finished i then rose and thanking the old gentleman for his civility begged that i might be allowed to bring him a few more segars and took my leave the daughter opened the street door and i could not refrain from taking her hand and kissing it wheres mr chucks call the boatswain there forward hallooed out the lieutenant here i am sir replied mr chucks hastening aft and leaving me and his story the captain of the maintop reports the breast backstay much chafed in the serving go up and examine it said the first lieutenant yes sir replied the boatswain who immediately went up the rigging and mr simple attend to the men scraping the spots off the quarterdeck yes sir replied i and thus our conversation was broken up the weather changed that night and we had a succession of rain and baffling winds for six or seven days during which i had no opportunity of hearing the remainder of the boatswains history we joined the fleet off toulon closed the admirals ship and the captain went on board to pay his respects when he returned we found out through the first lieutenant that we were to remain with the fleet until the arrival of another frigate expected in about a fortnight and then the admiral had promised that we should have a cruise the second day after we had joined we were ordered to form part of the inshore squadron consisting of two lineofbattle ships and four frigates the french fleet used to come out and manoeuvre within range of their batteries or if they proceeded further from the shore they took good care that they had a leading wind to return again into port we had been inshore about a week every day running close in and counting the french fleet in the harbour to see that they were all safe and reporting it to the admiral by signal when one fine morning the whole of the french vessels were perceived to hoist their topsails and in less than an hour they were under weigh and came out of the harbour we were always prepared for action night and day and indeed often exchanged a shot or two with the batteries when we reconnoitred the inshore squadron could not of course cope with the whole french fleet and our own was about twelve miles in the offing but the captain of the lineofbattle ship who commanded us hoveto as if in defiance hoping to entice them further out this was not very easy to do as the french knew that a shift of wind might put it out of their power to refuse an action which was what they would avoid and what we were so anxious to bring about i say we speaking of the english not of myself for to tell the truth i was not so very anxious i was not exactly afraid but i had an unpleasant sensation at the noise of a cannonball which i had not as yet got over however four of the french frigates made sail towards us and hoveto when within four miles three or four lineofbattle ships following them as if to support them our captain made signal for permission to close the enemy which was granted with our pennants and those of another frigate we immediately made all sail beat to quarters put out the fires and opened the magazines the french lineofbattle ships perceiving that only two of our frigates were sent against their four hoveto at about the same distance from their frigates as our lineofbattle ships and other frigates were from us in the meantime our main fleet continued to work in shore under a press of sail and the french main fleet also gradually approached the detached ships the whole scene reminded me of the tournaments i had read of it was a challenge in the lists only that the enemy were two to one a fair acknowledgment on their parts of our superiority in about an hour we closed so near that the french frigates made sail and commenced firing we reserved our fire until within a quarter of a mile when we poured our broadside into the headmost frigate exchanging with her on opposite tacks the seahorse who followed also gave her a broadside in this way we exchanged broadsides with the whole four and we had the best of it for they could not load so fast as we could we were both ready again for the frigates as they passed us but they were not ready with their broadside for the seahorse who followed us very closely so that they had two broadsides each and we had only four in the diomede the seahorse not having one our rigging was cut up a great deal and we had six or seven men wounded but none killed the french frigates suffered more and their admiral perceiving that they were cut up a good deal made a signal of recall in the meantime we had both tacked and were ranging up on the weather quarter of the sternmost frigate the lineofbattle ships perceiving this ran down with the wind two points free to support their frigates and our inshore squadron made all sail to support us nearly laying up for where we were but the wind was what is called at sea a soldiers wind that is blowing so that the ships could lie either way so as to run out or into the harbour and the french frigates in obedience to their orders made sail for their fleet inshore the lineofbattle ships coming out to support them but our captain would not give it up although we all continued to near the french lineofbattle ships every minutewe ran in with the frigates exchanging broadsides with them as fast as we could one of them lost her foretopmast and dropped astern and we hoped to cut her off but the others shortened sail to support her this continued for about twenty minutes when the french lineofbattle ships were not more than a mile from us and our own commodore had made the signal of our recall for he thought that we should be overpowered and taken but the seahorse who saw the recall up did not repeat it and our captain was determined not to see it and ordered the signalman not to look that way the action continued two of the french frigates were cut to pieces and complete wrecks when the french lineofbattle ships commenced firing it was then high time to be off we each of us poured in another broadside and then wore round for our own squadron which was about four miles off and rather to leeward standing in to our assistance as we wore round our maintopmast which had been badly wounded fell over the side and the french perceiving this made all sail with the hope of capturing us but the seahorse remained with us and we threw up in the wind and raked them until they were within two cables lengths of us then we stood on for our own ships at last one of the lineofbattle ships which sailed as well as the frigates came abreast of us and poured in a broadside which brought everything about our ears and i thought we must be taken but on the contrary although we lost several men the captain said to the first lieutenant now if they only wait a little longer they are nabbed as sure as fate just at this moment our own lineofbattle ships opened their fire and then the tables were turned the french tacked and stood in as fast as they could followed by the inshore squadron with the exception of our ship which was too much crippled to chase them one of their frigates had taken in tow the other who had lost her topmast and our squadron came up with her very fast the english fleet were also within three miles standing in and the french fleet standing out to the assistance of the other ships which had been engaged i thought and so did everybody that there would be a general action but we were disappointed the frigate which towed the other finding that she could not escape cast her off and left her to her fate which was to haul down her colours to the commodore of the inshore squadron the chase was continued until the whole of the french vessels were close under their batteries and then our fleet returned to its station with the prize which proved to be the narcisse of thirtysix guns captain le pelleteon our captain obtained a great deal of credit for his gallant behaviour we had three men killed and robinson the midshipman and ten men wounded some of them severely i think this action cured me of my fear of a cannonball for during the few days we remained with the fleet we often were fired at when we reconnoitred but i did not care anything for them about the time she was expected the frigate joined and we had permission to part company but before i proceed with the history of our cruise i shall mention the circumstances attending a courtmartial which took place during the time that we were with the fleet our captain having been recalled from the inshore squadron to sit as one of the members i was the midshipman appointed to the captains gig and remained on board of the admirals ship during the whole of the time that the court was sitting two seamen one an englishman and the other a frenchman were tried for desertion from one of our frigates they had left their ship about three months when the frigate captured a french privateer and found them on board as part of her crew for the englishman of course there was no defence he merited the punishment of death to which he was immediately sentenced there may be some excuse for desertion when we consider that the seamen are taken into the service by force but there could be none for fighting against his country but the case of the frenchman was different he was born and bred in france had been one of the crew of the french gunboats at cadiz where he had been made a prisoner by the spaniards and expecting his throat to be cut every day had contrived to escape on board of the frigate lying in the harbour and entered into our service i really believe to save his life he was nearly two years in the frigate before he could find an opportunity of deserting from her and returning to france when he joined the french privateer during the time that he was in the frigate he bore an excellent character the greatest point against him was that on his arrival at gibraltar he had been offered and had received the bounty when the englishman was asked what he had to say in his defence he replied that he had been pressed out of an american ship that he was an american born and that he had never taken the bounty but this was not true the defence of the frenchman was considered so very good for a person in his station of life that i obtained a copy of it which ran as follows mr president and officers of the honourable courtit is with the greatest humility that i venture to address you i shall be very brief nor shall i attempt to disprove the charges which have been made against me but confine myself to a few facts the consideration of which will i trust operate upon your feelings in mitigation of the punishment to which i may be sentenced for my faulta fault which proceeded not from any evil motive but from an ardent love for my country i am by birth a frenchman my life has been spent in the service of france until a few months after the revolution in spain when i together with those who composed the french squadron at cadiz was made a prisoner the hardships and cruel usage which i endured became insupportable i effected my escape and after wandering about the town for two or three days in hourly expectation of being assassinated the fate of too many of my unfortunate countrymen desperate from famine and perceiving no other chance of escaping from the town i was reduced to the necessity of offering myself as a volunteer on board of an english frigate i dared not as i ought to have done acknowledge myself to have been a prisoner from the dread of being delivered up to the spaniards during the period that i served on board of your frigate i confidently rely upon the captain and the officers for my character the love of our country although dormant for a time will ultimately be roused and peculiar circumstances occurred which rendered the feeling irresistible i returned to my duty and for having so done am i to be debarred from again returning to that country so dear to me from again beholding my aged parents who bless me in my absencefrom again embracing my brothers and sistersto end my days upon a scaffold not for the crime which i did commit in entering into your service but for an act of duty and repentancethat of returning to my own allow me to observe that the charge against me is not for entering your service but for having deserted from it for the former not even my misery can be brought forward but in extenuation for the latter i have a proud consciousness which will i trust be my support in my extremity gentlemen i earnestly entreat you to consider my situation and i am sure that your generous hearts will pity me let that love of your country which now animates your breasts and induces you to risk your lives and your all now plead for me already has british humanity saved thousands of my countrymen from the rage of the spaniards let that same humanity be extended now and induce my judges to add one more to the list of those who although our nations are at war if they are endowed with feeling can have but one sentiment towards their generous enemya sentiment overpowering all other that of a deepfelt gratitude whatever may have been the effect of the address upon the court individually it appeared at the time to have none upon them as a body both the men were condemned to death and the day after the morrow was fixed for their execution i watched the two prisoners as they went down the side to be conducted on board of their own ship the englishman threw himself down in the stern sheets of the boat every minor consideration apparently swallowed up in the thought of his approaching end but the frenchman before he sat down observing that the seat was a little dirty took out his silk handkerchief and spread it on the seat that he might not soil his nankeen trowsers i was ordered to attend the punishment on the day appointed the sun shone so brightly and the sky was so clear the wind so gentle and mild that it appeared hardly possible that it was to be a day of such awe and misery to the two poor men or of such melancholy to the fleet in general i pulled up my boat with the others belonging to the ships of the fleet in obedience to the orders of the officer superintending close to the forechains of the ship in about halfanhour afterwards the prisoners made their appearance on the scaffold the caps were pulled over their eyes and the gun fired underneath them when the smoke rolled away the englishman was swinging at the yardarm but the frenchman was not he had made a spring when the gun fired hoping to break his neck at once and put an end to his misery but he fell on the edge of the scaffold where he lay we thought that his rope had given way and it appeared that he did the same for he made an enquiry but they returned him no answer he was kept on the scaffold during the whole hour that the englishman remained suspended his cap had been removed and he looked occasionally at his fellowsufferer when the body was lowered down he considered that his time was come and attempted to leap overboard he was restrained and led aft where his reprieve was read to him and his arms were unbound but the effect of the shock was too much for his mind he fell down in a swoon and when he recovered his senses had left him and i heard that he never recovered them but was sent home to be confined as a maniac i thought and the result proved that it was carried too far it is not the custom when a man is reprieved to tell him so until after he is on the scaffold with the intention that his awful situation at the time may make a lasting impression upon him during the remainder of his life but as a foreigner he was not aware of our customs and the hour of intense feeling which he underwent was too much for his reason i must say that this circumstance was always a source of deep regret in the whole fleet and that his being a frenchman instead of an englishman increased the feeling of commiseration footnote this is factauthor chapter xvii mr chuckss opinion on proper nameshe finishes his spanish talemarch of intellect among the warrant officers we were all delighted when our signal was hoisted to part company as we anticipated plenty of prizemoney under such an enterprising captain we steered for the french coast near to its junction with spain the captain having orders to intercept any convoys sent to supply the french army with stores and provisions the day after we parted company with the fleet mr chucks finished his story where was i mr simple when i left off said he as we took a seat upon the long eighteen you had just left the house after having told them that you were a corregidor and had kissed the ladys hand very true well mr simple i did not call there for two or three days afterwards i did not like to go too soon especially as i saw the young lady every day in the plaza she would not speak to me but to make use of their expression she gave me her eyes and sometimes a sweet smile i recollect i was so busy looking at her one day that i tripped over my sword and nearly fell on my nose at which she burst out a laughing your sword mr chucks i thought boatswains never wore swords mr simple a boatswain is an officer and is entitled to a sword as well as the captain although we have been laughed out of it by a set of midshipman monkeys i always wore my sword at that time but nowadays a boatswain is counted as nobody unless there is hard work to do and then its mr chucks this and mr chucks that but ill explain to you how it is mr simple that we boatswains have lost so much of consequence and dignity the first lieutenants are made to do the boatswains duty nowadays and if they could only wind the call they might scratch the boatswains name off half the ships books in his majestys service but to go on with my yarn on the fourth day i called with my handkerchief full of segars for the father but he was at siesta as they called it the old servingwoman would not let me in at first but i shoved a dollar between her skinny old fingers and that altered her note she put her old head out and looked round to see if there was anybody in the street to watch us and then she let me in and shut the door i walked into the room and found myself alone with seraphina seraphinawhat a fine name no name can be too fine for a pretty girl or a good frigate mr simple for my part im very fond of these hard names your bess and poll and sue do very well for the point or castle rag but in my opinion they degrade a lady dont you observe mr simple that all our gunbrigs a sort of vessel that will certainly dn the inventor to all eternity have nothing but low common names such as pincher thrasher boxer badger and all that sort which are quite good enough for them whereas all our dashing saucy frigates have names as long as the maintop bowling and hard enough to break your jawsuch as melpomeny terpsichory arethusy bacchantyfine flourishers as long as their pennants which dip alongside in a calm very true replied i but do you think then it is the same with family names most certainly mr simple when i was in good society i rarely fell in with such names as potts or bell or smith or hodges it was always mr fortescue or mr fitzgerald or mr fitzherbertseldom bowed sir to anything under three syllables then i presume mr chucks you are not fond of your own name there you touch me mr simple but it is quite good enough for a boatswain replied mr chucks with a sigh i certainly did very wrong to impose upon people as i did but ive been severely punished for it it has made me discontented and unhappy ever since dearly have i paid for my spree for there is nothing so miserable as to have ideas above your station in life mr simple but i must make sail again i was three hours with seraphina before her father came home and during that time i never was quietly at an anchor for above a minute i was on my knees vowing and swearing kissing her feet and kissing her hand till at last i got to her lips working my way up as regularly as one who gets in at the hawsehole and crawls aft to the cabin windows she was very kind and she smiled and sighed and pushed me off and squeezed my hand and was angryfrowning till i was in despair and then making me happy again with her melting dark eyes beaming kindly till at last she said that she would try to love me and asked me whether i would marry her and live in spain i replied that i would and indeed i felt as if i could only at the time the thought occurred to me where the rhino was to come from for i could not live as her father did upon a paper segar and a piece of melon per day at all events as far as words went it was a settled thing when her father came home the old servant told him that i had just at that moment arrived and that his daughter was in her own room so she was for she ran away as soon as she heard her father knock i made my bow to the old gentleman and gave him the segars he was serious at first but the sight of them put him into good humour and in a few minutes donna seraphina they call a lady a donna in spain came in saluting me ceremoniously as if we had not been kissing for the hour together i did not remain long as it was getting late so i took a glass of the old gentlemans sour wine and walked off with a request from him to call again the young lady paying me little or no attention during the time that i remained or at my departure well mr chucks observed i it appears to me that she was a very deceitful young person so she was mr simple but a man in love cant see and ill tell you why if he wins the lady he is as much in love with himself as with her because he is so proud of his conquest that was my case if i had had my eyes i might have seen that she who could cheat her old father for a mere stranger would certainly deceive him in his turn but if love makes a man blind vanity mr simple makes him blinder in short i was an ass never mind mr chucks there was a good excuse for it well mr simple i met her again and again until i was madly in love and the father appeared to be aware of what was going on and to have no objection however he sent for a priest to talk with me and i again said that i was a good catholic i told him that i was in love with the young lady and would marry her the father made no objection on my promising to remain in spain for he would not part with his only daughter and there again i was guilty of deceit first in making a promise i did not intend to keep and then in pretending that i was a catholic honesty is the best policy mr simple in the long run you may depend upon it so my father has always told me and i have believed him replied i well sir i am ashamed to say that i did worse for the priest after the thing was settled asked me whether i had confessed lately i knew what he meant and answered that i had not he motioned me down on my knees but as i could not speak spanish enough for that i mumbledjumbled something or another half spanish and half english and ended with putting four dollars in his hand for carita which means charity he was satisfied at the end of my confession whatever he might have been at the beginning and gave me absolution although he could not have understood what my crimes were but four dollars mr simple will pay for a deal of crime in that country and now sir comes the winding up of this business seraphina told me that she was going to the opera with some of her relations and asked me if i would be there that the captain of the frigate and all the other officers were going and that she wished me to go with her you see mr simple although seraphinas father was so poor that a mouse would have starved in his house still he was of good family and connected with those who were much better off he was a don himself and had fourteen or fifteen long names which i forget now i refused to go with her as i knew that the service would not permit a boatswain to sit in an operabox when the captain and first lieutenant were there i told her that i had promised to go on board and look after the men while the captain went on shore thus as youll see mr simple making myself a man of consequence only to be more mortified in the end after she had gone to the opera i was very uncomfortable i was afraid that the captain would see her and take a fancy to her i walked up and down outside until i was so full of love and jealousy that i determined to go into the pit and see what she was about i soon discovered her in a box with some other ladies and with them were my captain and first lieutenant the captain who spoke the language well was leaning over her talking and laughing and she was smiling at what he said i resolved to leave immediately lest she should see me and discover that i had told her a falsehood but they appeared so intimate that i became so jealous i could not quit the theatre at last she perceived me and beckoned her hand i looked very angry and left the theatre cursing like a madman it appeared that she pointed me out to the captain and asked him who i was he told her my real situation on board and spoke of me with contempt she asked whether i was not a man of family at this the captain and first lieutenant both burst out laughing and said that i was a common sailor who had been promoted to a higher rank for good behaviournot exactly an officer and anything but a gentleman in short mr simple i was blown upon and although the captain said more than was correct as i learnt afterwards through the officers still i deserved it determined to know the worst i remained outside till the opera was over when i saw her come out the captain and first lieutenant walking with the partyso that i could not speak with her i walked to a posada thats an inn and drank seven bottles of rosolio to keep myself quiet then i went on board and the second lieutenant who was commanding officer put me under arrest for being intoxicated it was a week before i was released and you cant imagine what i suffered mr simple at last i obtained leave to go on shore and i went to the house to decide my fate the old woman opened the door and then calling me a thief slammed it in my face as i retreated donna seraphina came to the window and waving her hand with a contemptuous look said go and god be with you mr gentleman i returned on board in such a rage that if i could have persuaded the gunner to have given me a ball cartridge i should have shot myself through the head what made the matter worse i was laughed at by everybody in the ship for the captain and first lieutenant had made the story public well mr chucks replied i i cannot help being sorry for you although you certainly deserved to be punished for your dishonesty was that the end of the affair as far as i was concerned it was mr simple but not as respected others the captain took my place but without the knowledge of the father after all they neither had great reason to rejoice at the exchange how so mr chuckswhat do you mean why mr simple the captain did not make an honest woman of her as i would have done and the father discovered what was going on and one night the captain was brought on board run through the body we sailed immediately for gibraltar and it was a long while before he got round again and then he had another misfortune what was that why he lost his boatswain mr simple for i could not bear the sight of himand then he lost as you must know not from your own knowledge but from that of others a boatswain who knows his duty every one says so mr chucks im sure that our captain would be very sorry to part with you i trust that every captain has been with whom ive sailed mr simple but that was not all he lost mr simple for the next cruise he lost his masts and the loss of his masts occasioned the loss of his ship since which he has never been trusted with another but is laid on the shelf now he never carried away a spar of any consequence during the whole time that i was with him a mast itself is nothing mr simpleonly a piece of woodbut fit your rigging properly and then a mast is strong as a rock only ask mr faulkner and hell tell you the same and i never met an officer who knew better how to support a mast did you ever hear any more of the young lady yes about a year afterwards i returned there in another ship she had been shut up in a convent and forced to take the veil oh mr simple if you knew how i loved that girl i have never been more than polite to a woman since and shall die a bachelor you cant think how i was capsized the other day when i looked at the house i have hardly touched beef or pork since and am in debt two quarts of rum more than my allowance but mr simple i have told you this in confidence and i trust you are too much of a gentleman to repeat it for i cannot bear quizzing from young midshipmen i promised that i would not mention it and i kept my word but circumstances which the reader will learn in the sequel have freed me from the condition nobody can quiz him now we gained our station off the coast of perpignan and as soon as we made the land we were most provokingly driven off by a severe gale i am not about to make any remarks about the gale for one storm is so like another but i mention it to account for a conversation which took place and with which i was very much amused i was near to the captain when he sent for mr muddle the carpenter who had been up to examine the maintopsail yard which had been reported as sprung well mr muddle said the captain sprung sir most decidedly but i think well be able to mitigate it will you be able to secure it for the present mr muddle replied the captain rather sharply well mitigate it sir in half an hour i wish that you would use common phrases when you speak to me mr muddle i presume by mitigate you mean to say that you can secure it do you mean so sir or do you not yes sir that is what i mean most decidedly i hope no offence captain savage but i did not intend to displease you by my language very good mr muddle replied the captain its the first time that i have spoken to you on the subject recollect that it will be the last the first time replied the carpenter who could not forget his philosophy i beg your pardon captain savage you found just the same fault with me on this quarterdeck years ago and if i did mr muddle interrupted the captain very angrily depend upon it that at the same time i ordered you to go aloft and attend to your duty instead of talking nonsense on the quarterdeck and although as you say you and i cannot recollect it if you did not obey that order instantaneously i also put you in confinement and obliged you to leave the ship as soon as she returned to port do you understand me sir i rather think sir replied the carpenter humbly touching his hat and walking to the main rigging that no such thing took place for i went up immediately as i do now and continued the carpenter who was incurable as he ascended the rigging as i shall again in another years that man is incorrigible with his confounded nonsense observed the captain to the first lieutenant every mast in the ship would go over the side provided he could get any one to listen to his ridiculous theory he is not a bad carpenter sir replied the first lieutenant he is not rejoined the captain but there is a time for all things just at this moment the boatswain came down the rigging well mr chucks what do you think of the yard must we shift it inquired the captain at present captain savage replied the boatswain i consider it to be in a state which may be called precarious and not at all permanent but with a little human exertion four fathom of threeinch and halfadozen tenpenny nails it may last for all i know until it is time for it to be sprung again i do not understand you mr chucks i know no time when a yard ought to be sprung i did not refer to our time sir replied the boatswain but to the years of mr muddle when go forward immediately sir and attend to your duty cried the captain in a very angry voice and then he said to the first lieutenant i believe the warrant officers are going mad who ever heard a boatswain use such languageprecarious and not at all permanent his stay in the ship will become so if he does not mind what he is about he is a very odd character sir replied the first lieutenant but i have no hesitation in saying that he is the best boatswain in his majestys service i believe so too replied the captain butwell every one has his faults mr simple what are you about sir i was listening to what you said replied i touching my hat i admire your candour sir replied he but advise you to discontinue the practice walk over to leeward sir and attend to your duty when i was on the other side of the deck i looked round and saw the captain and first lieutenant both laughing chapter xviii i go away on service am wounded and taken prisoner with obrien diamond cut diamond between the obriensget into comfortable quarters my first interview with celeste and now i have to relate an event which young as i was at the time will be found to have seriously affected me in after life how little do we know what tomorrow may bring forth we had regained our station and for some days had been standing off and on the coast when one morning at daybreak we found ourselves about four miles from the town of cette and a large convoy of vessels coming round a point we made all sail in chase and they anchored close in shore under a battery which we did not discover until it opened fire upon us the shot struck the frigate two or three times for the water was smooth and the battery nearly level with it the captain tacked the ship and stood out again until the boats were hoisted out and all ready to pull on shore and storm the battery obrien who was the officer commanding the first cutter on service was in his boat and i again obtained permission from him to smuggle myself into it now peter lets see what kind of a fish youll bring on board this time said he after we had shoved off or may be the fish will not let you off quite so easy the men in the boat all laughed at this and i replied that i must be more seriously wounded than i was last time to be made a prisoner we ran on shore amidst the fire of the gunboats who protected the convoy by which we lost three men and made for the battery which we took without opposition the french artillerymen running out as we ran in the directions of the captain were very positive not to remain in the battery a minute after it was taken but to board the gunboats leaving only one of the small boats with the armourer to spike the guns for the captain was aware that there were troops stationed along the coast who might come down upon us and beat us off the first lieutenant who commanded desired obrien to remain with the first cutter and after the armourer had spiked the guns as officer of the boat he was to shove off immediately obrien and i remained in the battery with the armourer the boats crew being ordered down to the boat to keep her afloat and ready to shove off at a moments warning we had spiked all the guns but one when all of a sudden a volley of musketry was poured upon us which killed the armourer and wounded me in the leg above the knee i fell down by obrien who cried out by the powers here they are and one gun not spiked he jumped down wrenched the hammer from the armourers hand and seizing a nail from the bag in a few moments he had spiked the gun at this time i heard the tramping of the french soldiers advancing when obrien threw away the hammer and lifting me upon his shoulders cried come along peter my boy and made for the boat as fast as he could but he was too late he had not got half way to the boat before he was collared by two french soldiers and dragged back into the battery the french troops then advanced and kept up a smart fire our cutter escaped and joined the other boat who had captured the gunboats and convoy with little opposition our large boats had carronades mounted in their bows and soon returned the fire with round and grape which drove the french troops back into the battery where they remained popping at our men under cover until most of the vessels were taken out those which they could not man were burnt in the meantime obrien had been taken into the battery with me on his back but as soon as he was there he laid me gently down saying peter my boy as long as you were under my charge id carry you through thick and thin but now that you are under the charge of these french beggars why let them carry you every man his own bundle peter thats fair play so if they think youre worth the carrying let them bear the weight of ye and suppose they do not obrien will you leave me here will i lave you peter not if i can help it my boy but they wont leave you never fear them prisoners are so scarce with them that they would not leave the captains monkey if he were taken as soon as our boats were clear of their musketry the commanding officer of the french troops examined the guns in the battery with the hope of reaching them and was very much annoyed to find that every one of them was spiked hell look sharper than a magpie before he finds a clear touchhole i expect said obrien as he watched the officer and here i must observe that obrien showed great presence of mind in spiking the last gun for had they had one gun to fire at our boats towing out the prizes they must have done a great deal of mischief to them and we should have lost a great many men but in so doing and in the attempt to save me he sacrificed himself and was taken prisoner when the troops ceased firing the commanding officer came up to obrien and looking at him said officer to which obrien nodded his head he then pointed to meofficer obrien nodded his head again at which the french troops laughed as obrien told me afterwards because i was what they called an enfant which means an infant i was very stiff and faint and could not walk the officer who commanded the troops left a detachment in the battery and prepared to return to cette from whence they came obrien walked and i was carried on three muskets by six of the french soldiersnot a very pleasant conveyance at any time but in my state excessively painful however i must say that they were very kind to me and put a great coat or something under my wounded leg for i was in an agony and fainted several times at last they brought me some water to drink o how delicious it was i have often thought since when i have been in company where people fond of good living have smacked their lips at their claret that if they could only be wounded and taste a cup of water they would then know what it was to feel a beverage grateful in about an hour and a half which appeared to me to be five days at the least we arrived at the town of cette and i was taken up to the house of the officer who commanded the troops and who had often looked at me as i was carried there from the battery saying pauvre enfant i was put on a bed where i again fainted away when i came to my senses i found a surgeon had bandaged my leg and that i had been undressed obrien was standing by me and i believe that he had been crying for he thought that i was dead when i looked him in the face he said pater you baste how you frightened me bad luck to me if ever i take charge of another youngster what did you sham dead for i am better now obrien replied i how much i am indebted to you you have been made prisoner in trying to save me i have been made prisoner in doing my duty in one shape or another if that fool of an armourer hadnt held his hammer so tight after he was dead and it was of no use to him i should have been clear enough and so would you have been but however all this is nothing at all peter as far as i can see the life of a man consists in getting into scrapes and getting out of them by the blessing of god weve managed the first and by the blessing of god well manage the second also so be smart my honey and get well for although a man may escape by running away on two legs i never heard of a boy who hopped out of a french prison upon one i squeezed the offered hand of obrien and looked round me the surgeon stood at one side of the bed and the officer who commanded the troops at the other at the head of the bed was a little girl about twelve years old who held a cup in her hand out of which something had been poured down my throat i looked at her and she had such pity in her face which was remarkably handsome that she appeared to me as an angel and i turned round as well as i could that i might look at her alone she offered me the cup which i should have refused from any one but her and i drank a little another person then came into the room and a conversation took place in french i wonder what they mean to do with us said i to obrien whist hold your tongue replied he and then he leaned over me and said in a whisper i understand all they say dont you recollect i told you that i learnt the language after i was kilt and buried in the sand in south america after a little more conversation the officer and the others retired leaving nobody but the little girl and obrien in the room its a message from the governor said obrien as soon as they were gone wishing the prisoners to be sent to the gaol in the citadel to be examined and the officer says and hes a real gentleman as far as i can judge that youre but a baby and badly wounded in the bargain and that it would be a shame not to leave you to die in peace so i presume that ill part company from you very soon i hope not obrien replied i if you go to prison i will go also for i will not leave you who are my best friend to remain with strangers i should not be half so happy although i might have more comforts in my present situation pater my boy i am glad to see that your heart is in the right place as i always thought it was or i wouldnt have taken you under my protection well go together to prison my jewel and ill fish at the bars with a bag and a long string just by way of recreation and to pick up a little money to buy you all manner of nice things and when you get well you shall do it yourself mayhap youll have better luck as peter your namesake had who was a fisherman before you theres twice as much room in one of the cells as there is in a midshipmans berth my boy and the prison yards where you are allowed to walk will make a dozen quarterdecks and no need of touching your hat out of respect when you go into it when a man has been cramped up on board of a manofwar where midshipmen are stowed away like pilchards in a cask he finds himself quite at liberty in a prison peter but somehow or another i think we maynt be parted yet for i heard the officer who appears to be a real gentleman and worthy to have been an irishman born say to the other that hed ask the governor for me to stay with you on parole until you are well again the little girl handed me the lemonade of which i drank a little and then i felt very faint again i laid my head on the pillow and obrien having left off talking i was soon in a comfortable sleep in an hour i was awakened by the return of the officer who was accompanied by the surgeon the officer addressed obrien in french who shook his head as before why dont you answer obrien said i since you understand him peter recollect that i cannot speak a word of their lingo then i shall know what they say before us and they wont mind what they say supposing i do not understand them but is that honest obrien is it honest you mean if i had a fivepound note in my pocket and dont choose to show it to every fellow that i meetis that dishonest to be sure its not and ant that what the lawyers call a case in pint well replied i if you wish it i shall of course say nothing but i think that i should tell them especially as they are so kind to us during this conversation the officer occasionally spoke to the surgeon at the same time eyeing us i thought very hard two other persons then came into the room one of them addressed obrien in very bad english saying that he was interpreter and would beg him to answer a few questions he then inquired the name of our ship number of guns and how long we had been cruising after that the force of the english fleet and a great many other questions relative to them all of which were put in french by the person who came with him and the answer translated and taken down in a book some of the questions obrien answered correctly to others he pleaded ignorance and to some he asserted what was not true but i did not blame him for that as it was his duty not to give information to the enemy at last they asked my name and rank which obrien told them was i noble yes replied obrien dont say so obrien interrupted i peter you know nothing about it you are grandson to a lord i know that but still i am not noble myself although descended from him therefore pray dont say so bother pater i have said it and i wont unsay it besides pater recollect its a french question and in france you would be considered noble at all events it can do no harm i feel too ill to talk obrien but i wish you had not said so they then inquired obriens name which he told them his rank in the service and also whether he was noble i am an obrien replied he and pray whats the meaning of the o before my name if im not noble however mr interpreter you may add that we have dropped our title because its not convanient the french officer burst out into a loud laugh which surprised us very much the interpreter had great difficulty in explaining what obrien said but as obrien told me afterwards the answer was put down doubtful they all left the room except the officer who then to our astonishment addressed us in good english gentlemen i have obtained permission from the governor for you to remain in my house until mr simple is recovered mr obrien it is necessary that i should receive your parole of honour that you will not attempt to escape are you willing to give it obrien was quite amazed murder an irish cried he so you speak english colonel it was not very genteel of you not to say so considering how weve been talking our little secrets together certainly mr obrien not more necessary replied the officer smiling than for you to tell me that you understood french o bother cried obrien how nicely im caught in my own trap youre an irishman sure im of irish descent replied the officer and my name as well as yours is obrien i was brought up in this country not being permitted to serve my own and retain the religion of my forefathers i may now be considered as a frenchman retaining nothing of my original country except the language which my mother taught me and a warm feeling towards the english wherever i meet them but to the question mr obrien will you give your parole the word of an irishman and the hand to boot replied obrien shaking the colonel by the hand and youre more than doubly sure for ill never go away and leave little peter here and as for carrying him on my back ive had enough of that already it is sufficient replied the colonel mr obrien i will make you as comfortable as i can and when you are tired of attending your friend my little daughter shall take your place youll find her a kind little nurse mr simple i could not refrain from tears at the colonels kindness he shook me by the hand and telling obrien that dinner was ready he called up his daughter the little girl who had attended me before and desired her to remain in the room celeste said he you understand a little english quite enough to find out what he is in want of go and fetch your work to amuse yourself when he is asleep celeste went out and returning with her embroidery sat down by the head of the bed the colonel and obrien then quitted the room celeste then commenced her embroidery and as her eyes were cast down upon her work i was able to look at her without her observing it as i said before she was a very beautiful little girl her hair was light brown eyes very large and eyebrows drawn as with a pair of compasses her nose and mouth were also very pretty but it was not so much her features as the expression of her countenance which was so beautiful so modest so sweet and so intelligent when she smiled which she almost always did when she spoke her teeth were like two rows of little pearls i had not looked at her long before she raised her eyes from her work and perceiving that i was looking at her said you wantsomething want drinki speak very little english nothing i thank ye replied i i only want to go to sleep thenshutyoureye replied she smiling and she went to the window and drew down the blinds to darken the room but i could not sleep the remembrance of what had occurredin a few hours wounded and a prisonerthe thought of my father and mothers anxiety with the prospect of going to a prison and close confinement as soon as i was recovered passed in succession in my mind and together with the actual pain of my wound prevented me from obtaining any rest the little girl several times opened the curtain to ascertain whether i slept or wanted anything and then as softly retired in the evening the surgeon called again he felt my pulse and directing cold applications to my leg which had swelled considerably and was becoming very painful told colonel obrien that although i had considerable fever i was doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances but i shall not dwell upon my severe sufferings for a fortnight after which the ball was extracted nor upon how carefully i was watched by obrien the colonel and little celeste during my peevishness and irritation arising from pain and fever i feel grateful to them but partiqularly sic to celeste who seldom quitted me for more than halfanhour and as i gradually recovered tried all she could to amuse me chapter xix we remove to very unpleasant quartersbirds of a feather wont always flock togetherobrien cuts a cutter midshipman and gets a taste of french steelaltogether flat worka walk into the interior as soon as i was well enough to attend to my little nurse we became very intimate as might be expected our chief employment was teaching each other french and english having the advantage of me in knowing a little before we met and also being much quicker of apprehension she very soon began to speak english fluently long before i could make out a short sentence in french however as it was our chief employment and both were anxious to communicate with each other i learnt it very fast in five weeks i was out of bed and could limp about the room and before two months were over i was quite recovered the colonel however would not report me to the governor i remained on a sofa during the day but at dusk i stole out of the house and walked about with celeste i never passed such a happy time as the last fortnight the only drawback was the remembrance that i should soon have to exchange it for a prison i was more easy about my father and mother as obrien had written to them assuring them that i was doing well and besides a few days after our capture the frigate had run in and sent a flag of truce to inquire if we were alive or made prisoners at the same time captain savage sent on shore all our clothes and two hundred dollars in cash for our use i knew that even if obriens letter did not reach them they were sure to hear from captain savage that i was doing well but the idea of parting with celeste towards whom i felt such gratitude and affection was most painful and when i talked about it poor celeste would cry so much that i could not help joining her although i kissed away her tears at the end of twelve weeks the surgeon could no longer withhold his report and we were ordered to be ready in two days to march to toulon where we were to join another party of prisoners to proceed with them into the interior i must pass over our parting which the reader may imagine was very painful i promised to write to celeste and she promised that she would answer my letters if it were permitted we shook hands with colonel obrien thanking him for his kindness and much to his regret we were taken in charge by two french cuirassiers who were waiting at the door as we preferred being continued on parole until our arrival at toulon the soldiers were not at all particular about watching us and we set off on horseback obrien and i going first and the french cuirassiers following us in the rear we trotted or walked along the road very comfortably the weather was delightful we were in high spirits and almost forgot that we were prisoners the cuirassiers followed us at a distance of twenty yards conversing with each other and obrien observed that it was amazingly genteel of the french governor to provide us with two servants in such handsome liveries the evening of the second day we arrived at toulon and as soon as we entered the gates we were delivered into the custody of an officer with a very sinister cast of countenance who after some conversation with the cuirassiers told us in a surly tone that our parole was at an end and gave us in charge of a corporals guard with directions to conduct us to the prison near the arsenal we presented the cuirassiers with four dollars each for their civility and were then hurried away to our place of captivity i observed to obrien that i was afraid that we must now bid farewell to anything like pleasure youre right there peter replied he but theres a certain jewel called hope that somebody found at the bottom of his chest when it was clean empty and so we must not lose sight of it but try and escape as soon as we can but the less we talk about it the better in a few minutes we arrived at our destination the door was opened ourselves and our bundles for we had only selected a few things for our march the colonel promising to forward the remainder as soon as we wrote to inform him to which depot we were consigned were rudely shoved in and as the doors again closed and the heavy bolts were shot i felt a creeping chilly sensation pass through my whole body as soon as we could seefor although the prison was not very dark yet so suddenly thrown in after the glare of a bright sunshiny day at first we could distinguish nothingwe found ourselves in company with about thirty english sailors most of them were sitting down on the pavement or on boxes or bundles containing their clothes that they had secured conversing with each other or playing at cards or draughts our entrance appeared to excite little attention after having raised their eyes to indulge their curiosity they continued their pursuits i have often thought what a feeling of selfishness appeared to pervade the whole of them at the time i was shocked as i expected immediate sympathy and commiseration but afterwards i was not surprised many of these poor fellows had been months in the prison and a short confinement will produce that indifference to the misfortunes of others which i then observed indeed one man who was playing at cards looked up for a moment as we came in and cried out hurrah my lads the more the merrier as if he really was pleased to find that there were others who were as unfortunate as himself we stood looking at the groups for about ten minutes when obrien observed that we might as well come to an anchor foul ground being better than no bottom so we sat down in a corner upon our bundles where we remained for more than an hour surveying the scene without speaking a word to each other i could not speaki felt so very miserable i thought of my father and mother in england of my captain and my messmates who were sailing about so happily in the frigate of the kind colonel obrien and dear little celeste and the tears trickled down my cheeks as these scenes of former happiness passed through my mind in quick succession obrien did not speak but once and then he only said this is dull work peter we had been in the prison about two hours when a lad in a very greasy ragged jacket with a pale emaciated face came up to us and said i perceive by your uniforms that you are both officers as well as myself obrien stared at him for a little while and then answered upon my soul and honour then youve the advantage of us for its more than i could perceive in you but ill take your word for it pray what ship may have had the misfortune of losing such a credit to the service why i belonged to the snapper cutter replied the young lad i was taken in a prize which the commanding officer had given in my charge to take to gibraltar but they wont believe that im an officer i have applied for officers allowance and rations and they wont give them to me well but they know that we are officers replied obrien why do they shove us in here with the common seamen i suppose you are only put in here for the present replied the cutters midshipman but why i cannot tell nor could we until afterwards when we found out as our narrative will show that the officer who received us from the cuirassiers had once quarrelled with colonel obrien who first pulled his nose and afterwards ran him through the body being told by the cuirassiers that we were much esteemed by colonel obrien he resolved to annoy us as much as he could and when he sent up the document announcing our arrival he left out the word officers and put us in confinement with the common seamen its very hard upon me not to have my regular allowance as an officer continued the midshipman they only give me a black loaf and three sous a day if i had had my best uniform on they never would have disputed my being an officer but the scoundrels who retook the prize stole all my traps and i have nothing but this old jacket why then replied obrien youll know the value of dress for the future you cutter and gunbrig midshipmen go about in such a dirty state that you are hardly acknowledged by us who belong to frigates to be officers much less gentlemen you look so dirty and so slovenly when we pass you in the dockyard that we give you a wide berth how then can you suppose strangers to believe that you are either officers or gentlemen upon my conscience i absolve the frenchmen from all prejudice for as to your being an officer we as englishmen have nothing but your bare word for it well its very hard replied the lad to be attacked this way by a brother officer your coat will be as shabby as mine before you have been here long thats very true my darling returned obrien but at least i shall have the pleasant reflection that i came in as a gentleman although i may not exactly go out under the same appearance good night and pleasant dreams to you i thought obrien rather cross in speaking in such a way but he was himself always as remarkably neat and well dressed as he was handsome and well made fortunately we were not destined to remain long in this detestable hole after a night of misery during which we remained sitting on our bundles and sleeping how we could leaning with our backs against the damp wall we were roused at daybreak by the unbarring of the prison doors followed up with an order to go into the prison yard we were huddled out like a flock of sheep by a file of soldiers with loaded muskets and as we went into the yard were ranged two and two the same officer who ordered us into prison commanded the detachment of soldiers who had us in charge obrien stepped out of the ranks and addressing them stated that we were officers and had no right to be treated like common sailors the french officer replied that he had better information and that we wore coats which did not belong to us upon which obrien was in a great rage calling the officer a liar and demanding satisfaction for the insult appealing to the french soldiers and stating that colonel obrien who was at cette was his countryman and had received him for two months into his house upon parole which was quite sufficient to establish his being an officer the french soldiers appeared to side with obrien after they had heard this explanation stating that no common english sailor could speak such good french and that they were present when we were sent in on parole and they asked the officer whether he intended to give satisfaction the officer stormed and drawing his sword out of the scabbard struck obrien with the flat of the blade looking at him with contempt and ordering him into the ranks i could not help observing that during this scene the menofwar sailors who were among the prisoners were very indignant while on the contrary those captured in merchant vessels appeared to be pleased with the insult offered to obrien one of the french soldiers then made a sarcastic remark that the french officer did not much like the name of obrien this so enraged the officer that he flew at obrien pushed him back into the ranks and taking out a pistol threatened to shoot him through the head i must do the justice to the french soldiers that they all cried out shame they did not appear to have the same discipline or the same respect for an officer as the soldiers have in our service or they would not have been so free in their language yet at the same time they obeyed all his orders on service very implicitly when obrien returned to the ranks he looked defiance at the officer telling him that he would pocket the affront very carefully as he intended to bring it out again upon a future and more suitable occasion we were then marched out in ranks two and two being met at the street by two drummers and a crowd of people who had gathered to witness our departure the drums beat and away we went the officer who had charge of us mounted a small horse galloping up and down from one end of the ranks to the other with his sword drawn bullying swearing and striking with the flat of the blade at any one of the prisoners who was not in his proper place when we were close to the gates we were joined by another detachment of prisoners we were then ordered to halt and were informed through an interpreter that any one attempting to escape would immediately be shot after which information we once more proceeded on our route nothing remarkable occurred during our first days march except perhaps a curious conversation between obrien and one of the french soldiers in which they disputed about the comparative bravery of the two nations obrien in his argument told the frenchman that his countrymen could not stand a charge of english bayonets the frenchman replied that there was no doubt but the french were quite as brave as the englisheven more so and that as for not standing the charge of bayonets it was not because they were less brave but the fact was that they were most excessively ticklish we had black bread and sour wine served out to us this day when we halted to refresh obrien persuaded a soldier to purchase something for us more eatable but the french officer heard of it and was very angry ordering the soldier to the rear chapter xx obrien fights a duel with a french officer and proves that the great art of fencing is knowing nothing about itwe arrive at our new quarters which we find very secure at night we arrived at a small town the name of which i forget here we were all put into an old church for the night and a very bad night we passed they did not even give us a little straw to lie down upon the roof of the church had partly fallen in and the moon shone through very brightly this was some comfort for to have been shut up in the dark seventyfive in number would have been very miserable we were afraid to lie down anywhere as like all ruined buildings in france the ground was covered with filth and the smell was shocking obrien was very thoughtful and would hardly answer any question that i put to him it was evident that he was brooding over the affront which he had received from the french officer at daybreak the door of the church was again opened by the french soldiers and we were conducted to the square of the town where we found the troops quartered drawn up with their officers to receive us from the detachment who had escorted us from toulon we were very much pleased with this as we knew that we should be forwarded by another detachment and thus be rid of the brutal officer who had hitherto had charge of the prisoners but we were rid of him in another way as the french officers walked along our ranks to look at us i perceived among them a captain whom we had known very intimately when we were living at cette with colonel obrien i cried out his name immediately he turned round and seeing obrien and me he came up to us shaking us by the hand and expressing his surprise at finding us in such a situation obrien explained to him how we had been treated at which he expressed his indignation as did the other officers who had collected round us the major who commanded the troops in the town turned to the french officer he was only a lieutenant who had conducted us from toulon and demanded of him his reason for behaving to us in such an unworthy manner he denied having treated us ill and said that he had been informed that we had put on officers dresses which did not belong to us at this obrien declared that he was a liar and a cowardly foutre that he had struck him with the back of his sabre which he would not have dared do if he had not been a prisoner adding that all he requested was satisfaction for the insult offered to him and appealed to the officers whether if it were refused the lieutenants epaulets ought not to be cut off his shoulders the major commandant and the officers retired to consult and after a few minutes they agreed that the lieutenant was bound to give the satisfaction required the lieutenant replied that he was ready but at the same time did not appear to be very willing the prisoners were left in charge of the soldiers under a junior officer while the others accompanied by obrien myself and the lieutenant walked to a short distance outside the town as we proceeded there i asked obrien with what weapons they would fight i take it for granted replied he that it will be with the small sword but said i do you know anything about fencing devil a bit peter but thats all in my favour how can that be replied i ill tell you peter if one man fences well and another is but an indifferent hand at it it is clear that the first will run the other through the body but if the other knows nothing at all about it why then peter the case is not quite so clear because the good fencer is almost as much puzzled by your ignorance as you are by his skill and you become on more equal terms now peter ive made up my mind that ill run that fellow through the body and so i will as sure as i am an obrien well i hope you will but pray do not be too sure its feeling sure that will make me able to do it peter by the blood of the obriens didnt he slap me with his sword as if i were a clown in the pantomime peter ill kill the harlequin scoundrel and my words as good as my bond by this time we had arrived at the ground the french lieutenant stripped to his shirt and trousers obrien did the same kicking his boots off and standing upon the wet grass in his stockings the swords were measured and handed to them they took their distance and set to i must say that i was breathless with anxiety the idea of losing obrien struck me with grief and terror i then felt the value of all his kindness to me and would have taken his place and have been run through the body rather than he should have been hurt at first obrien put himself in the correct attitude of defence in imitation of the lieutenant but this was for a very few seconds he suddenly made a spring and rushed on to his adversary stabbing at him with a velocity quite astonishing the lieutenant parrying in his defence until at last he had an opportunity of lungeing at obrien obrien who no longer kept his left arm raised in equipoise caught the sword of the lieutenant at within six inches of the point and directing it under his left arm as he rushed in passed his own through the lieutenants body it was all over in less than a minutethe lieutenant did not live half an hour afterwards the french officers were very much surprised at the result for they perceived at once that obrien knew nothing of fencing obrien gathered a tuft of grass wiped the sword which he presented to the officer to whom it belonged and thanking the major and the whole of them for their impartiality and gentlemanlike conduct led the way to the square where he again took his station in the ranks of the prisoners shortly after the major commandant came up to us and asked whether we would accept of our parole as in that case we might travel as we pleased we consented with many thanks for his civility and kindness but i could not help thinking at the time that the french officers were a little mortified at obriens success although they were too honourable to express the feeling obrien told me after we had quitted the town that had it not been for the handsome conduct of the officers he would not have accepted our parole as he felt convinced that we could have easily made our escape we talked over the matter a long while and at last agreed that there would be a better chance of success by and by when more closely guarded than there would be now under consideration of all circumstances as it required previously concerted arrangements to get out of the country i had almost forgotten to say that on our return after the duel the cutters midshipman called out to obrien requesting him to state to the commandant that he was also an officer but obrien replied that there was no evidence for it but his bare word if he was an officer he must prove it himself as everything in his appearance flatly contradicted his assertion its very hard replied the midshipman that because my jackets a little tarry or so i must lose my rank my dear fellow replied obrien its not because your jackets a little tarry it is because what the frenchmen call your tout ensemble is quite disgraceful in an officer look at your face in the first puddle and youll find that it would dirty the water you look into look at your shoulders above your ears and your back with a bow like a kink in a cable your trowsers sir you have pulled your legs too far through showing a foot and a half of worsted stockings in short look at yourself altogether and then tell me provided you be an officer whether from respect to the service it would not be my duty to contradict it it goes against my conscience my dear fellow but recollect that when we arrive at the depot you will be able to prove it so its only waiting a little while until the captains will pass their word for you which is more than i will well its very hard replied the midshipman that i must go on eating this black rye bread and very unkind of you its very kind of me you spalpeen of the snapper prison will be a paradise to you when you get into good commons how youll relish your grub byandby so now shut your pan or by the tail of jonahs whale ill swear youre a spaniard i could not help thinking that obrien was very severe upon the poor lad and i expostulated with him afterwards he replied peter if as a cutters midshipman he is a bit of an officer the devil a bit is he of a gentleman either born or bred and im not bound to bail every blackguardlooking chap that i meet by the head of st peter i would blush to be seen in his company if i were in the wildest bog in ireland with nothing but an old crow as spectator we were now again permitted to be on our parole and received every attention and kindness from the different officers who commanded the detachments which passed the prisoners from one town to another in a few days we arrived at montpelier where we had orders to remain a short time until directions were received from government as to the depots for prisoners to which we were to be sent at this delightful town we had unlimited parole not even a gendarme accompanying us we lived at the table dhote were permitted to walk about where we pleased and amused ourselves every evening at the theatre during our stay there we wrote to colonel obrien at cette thanking him for his kindness and narrating what had occurred since we parted i also wrote to celeste inclosing my letter unsealed in the one to colonel obrien i told her the history of obriens duel and all i could think would interest her how sorry i was to have parted from her that i never would forget her and trusted that some day as she was only half a frenchwoman we should meet again before we left montpelier we had the pleasure of receiving answers to our letters the colonels letters were very kind particularly the one to me in which he called me his dear boy and hoped that i should soon rejoin my friends and prove an ornament to my country in his letter to obrien he requested him not to run me into useless dangerto recollect that i was not so well able to undergo extreme hardship i have no doubt but that this caution referred to obriens intention to escape from prison which he had not concealed from the colonel and the probability that i would be a partner in the attempt the answer from celeste was written in english but she must have had assistance from her father or she could not have succeeded so well it was like herself very kind and affectionate and also ended with wishing me a speedy return to my friends who must she said be so fond of me that she despaired of ever seeing me more but that she consoled herself as well as she could with the assurance that i should be happy i forgot to say that colonel obrien in his letter to me stated that he expected immediate orders to leave cette and take the command of some military post in the interior or join the army but which he could not tell that they had packed up everything and he was afraid that our correspondence must cease as he could not state to what place we should direct our letters i could not help thinking at the time that it was a delicate way of pointing out to us that it was not right that he should correspond with us in our relative situations but still i was sure that he was about to leave cette for he never would have made use of a subterfuge i must here acquaint the reader with a circumstance which i forgot to mention which was that when captain savage sent in a flag of truce with our clothes and money i thought that it was but justice to obrien that they should know on board of the frigate the gallant manner in which he had behaved i knew that he would never tell himself so ill as i was at the time i sent for colonel obrien and requested him to write down my statement of the affair in which i mentioned how obrien had spiked the last gun and had been taken prisoner by so doing together with his attempting to save me when the colonel had written all down i requested that he would send for the major who first entered the fort with the troops and translate it to him in french this he did in my presence and the major declared every word to be true will he attest it colonel as it may be of great service to obrien the major immediately assented colonel obrien then enclosed my letter with a short note from himself to captain savage paying him a compliment and assuring him that his gallant young officers should be treated with every attention and all the kindness which the rules of war would admit of obrien never knew that i had sent that letter as the colonel at my request kept the secret in ten days we received an order to march on the following morning the sailors among whom was our poor friend the midshipman of the snapper cutter were ordered to verdun obrien and i with eight masters of merchant vessels who joined us at montpelier were directed by the government to be sent to givet a fortified town in the department of ardennes but at the same time orders arrived from government to treat the prisoners with great strictness and not to allow any parole the reason of this we were informed was that accounts had been sent to government of the death of the french officer in the duel with obrien and they had expressed their dissatisfaction at its having been permitted indeed i very much doubt whether it would have been permitted in our country but the french officers are almost romantically chivalrous in their ideas of honour in fact as enemies i have always considered them as worthy antagonists to the english and they appear more respectable in themselves and more demanding our goodwill in that situation than they do when we meet them as friends and are acquainted with the other points of their character which lessen them in our estimation i shall not dwell upon a march of three weeks during which we alternately received kind or unhandsome treatment according to the dispositions of those who had us in charge but i must observe that it was invariably the case that officers who were gentlemen by birth treated us with consideration while those who had sprung from nothing during the revolution were harsh and sometimes even brutal it was exactly four months from the time of our capture that we arrived at our destined prison at givet peter said obrien as he looked hastily at the fortifications and the river which divided the two towns i see no reason either english or french that we should not eat our christmas dinner in england ive a birds eye view of the outside and now have only to find out whereabouts we may be in the inside i must say that when i looked at the ditches and high ramparts i had a different opinion so had a gendarme who was walking by our side and who had observed obriens scrutiny and who quietly said to him in french vous le croyez possible everything is possible to a brave manthe french armies have proved that answered obrien you are right replied the gendarme pleased with the compliment to his nation i wish you success you will deserve it but and he shook his head if i could but obtain a plan of the fortress said obrien i would give five napoleons for one and he looked at the gendarme i cannot see any objection to an officer although a prisoner studying fortification replied the gendarme in two hours you will be within the walls and now i recollect in the map of the two towns the fortress is laid down sufficiently accurately to give you an idea of it but we have conversed too long so saying the gendarme dropped into the rear in a quarter of an hour we arrived at the place darmes where we were met as usual by another detachment of troops and drummers who paraded us through the town previous to our being drawn up before the governors house this i ought to have observed was by order of government done at every town we passed through it was very contemptible but prisoners were so scarce that they made all the display of us that they could as we stopped at the governors house the gendarme who had left us in the square made a sign to obrien as much as to say i have it obrien took out five napoleons which he wrapped in paper and held in his hand in a minute or two the gendarme came up and presented obrien with an old silk handkerchief saying votre mouchoir monsieur merci replied obrien putting the handkerchief which contained the map into his pocket voici a boire mon ami and he slipped the paper with the five napoleons into the hand of the gendarme who immediately retreated this was very fortunate for us as we afterwards discovered that a mark had been put against obriens and my name not to allow parole or permission to leave the fortress even under surveillance indeed even if it had not been so we never should have obtained it as the lieutenant killed by obrien was nearly related to the commandant of the fortress who was as much a mauvais sujet as his kinsman having waited the usual hour before the governors house to answer to our musterroll and to be stared at we were dismissed and in a few minutes found ourselves shut up in one of the strongest fortresses in france chapter xxi obrien receives his commission as lieutenant and then we take french leave of givet if i doubted the practicability of escape when i examined the exterior when we were ushered into the interior of the fortress i felt that it was impossible and i stated my opinion to obrien we were conducted into a yard surrounded by a high wall the buildings appropriated for the prisoners were built with leanto roofs on one side and at each side of the square was a sentry looking down upon us it was very much like the dens which they now build for bears only so much larger obrien answered me with a pish peter its the very security of the place which will enable us to get out of it but dont talk as there are always spies about who understand english we were shown into a room allotted to six of us our baggage was examined and then delivered over to us better and better peter observed obrien theyve not found it out what inquired i oh only a little selection of articles which might be useful to us byandby he then showed me what i never before was aware of that he had a false bottom to his trunk but it was papered over like the rest and very ingeniously concealed and what is there obrien inquired i never mind i had them made at montpelier youll see byandby the others who were lodged in the same room then came in and after staying a quarter of an hour went away at the sound of the dinnerbell now peter said obrien i must get rid of my load turn the key obrien then undressed himself and when he threw off his shirt and drawers showed me a rope of silk with a knot at every two feet about halfaninch in size wound round and round his body there were about sixty feet of it altogether as i unwound it he turning round and round observed peter ive worn this rope ever since i left montpelier and youve no idea of the pain i have suffered but we must go to england thats decided upon when i looked at obrien as the rope was wound off i could easily imagine that he had really been in great pain in several places his flesh was quite raw from the continual friction and after it was all unwound and he had put on his clothes he fainted away i was very much alarmed but i recollected to put the rope into the trunk and take out the key before i called for assistance he soon came to and on being asked what was the matter said that he was subject to fits from his infancy he looked earnestly at me and i showed him the key which was sufficient for some days obrien who really was not very well kept to his room during this time he often examined the map given him by the gendarme one day he said to me peter can you swim no replied i but never mind that but i must mind it peter for observe we shall have to cross the river meuse and boats are not always to be had you observe that this fortress is washed by the river on one side and as it is the strongest side it is the least guardedwe must escape by it i can see my way clear enough till we get to the second rampart on the river but when we drop into the river if you cannot swim i must contrive to hold you up somehow or another are you then determined to escape obrien i cannot perceive how we are even to get up this wall with four sentries staring us in the face never do you mind that peter mind your own business and first tell me do you intend to try your luck with me yes replied i most certainly if you have sufficient confidence in me to take me as your companion to tell you the truth peter i would not give a farthing to escape without you we were taken together and please god well take ourselves off together but that must not be for this month our greatest help will be the dark nights and foul weather the prison was by all accounts very different from verdun and some others we had no parole and but little communication with the townspeople some were permitted to come in and supply us with various articles but their baskets were searched to see that they contained nothing that might lead to an escape on the part of the prisoners without the precautions that obrien had taken any attempt would have been useless still obrien as soon as he left his room did obtain several little articlesespecially balls of twinefor one of the amusements of the prisoners was flying kites this however was put a stop to in consequence of one of the strings whether purposely or not i cannot say catching the lock of the musket carried by one of the sentries who looked down upon us and twitching it out of his hand after which an order was given by the commandant for no kites to be permitted this was fortunate for us as obrien by degrees purchased all the twine belonging to the other prisoners and as we were more than three hundred in number it amounted to sufficient to enable him by stealth to lay it up into very strong cord or rather into a sort of square plait known only to sailors now peter said he one day i want nothing more than an umbrella for you why an umbrella for me to keep you from being drowned with too much water thats all rain wont drown me no no peter but buy a new one as soon as you can i did so obrien boiled up a quantity of bees wax and oil and gave it several coats of this preparation he then put it carefully away in the ticking of his bed i asked him whether he intended to make known his plan to any of the other prisoners he replied in the negative saying that there were so many of them who could not be trusted that he would trust no one we had been now about two months in givet when a steels list was sent to a lieutenant who was confined there the lieutenant came up to obrien and asked him his christian name terence to be sure replied obrien then answered the lieutenant i may congratulate you on your promotion for here you are upon the list of august sure there must be some trifling mistake let me look at it terence obrien sure enough but now the question is has any other fellow robbed me of my name and promotion at the same time bother what can it mane i wont belave itnot a word of it ive no more interest than a dog who drags catsmeat really obrien observed i i cannot see why you should not be made i am sure you deserve your promotion for your conduct when you were taken prisoner and what did i do then you simple peter but put you on my back as the men do their hammocks when they are piped down but barring all claim how could any one know what took place in the battery except you and i and the armourer who lay dead so explain that peter if you can i think i can replied i after the lieutenant had left us and i then told obrien how i had written to captain savage and had had the fact attested by the major who had made us prisoners well peter said obrien after a pause theres a fable about a lion and a mouse if by your means i have obtained my promotion why then the mouse is a finer baste than the lion but instead of being happy i shall now be miserable until the truth is ascertained one way or the other and thats another reason why i must set off to england as fast as i can for a few days after this obrien was very uneasy but fortunately letters arrived by that time one to me from my father in which he requested me to draw for whatever money i might require saying that the whole family would retrench in every way to give me all the comfort which might be obtained in my unfortunate situation i wept at his kindness and more than ever longed to throw myself in his arms and thank him he also told me that my uncle william was dead and that there was only one between him and the title but that my grandfather was in good health and had been very kind to him lately my mother was much afflicted at my having been made a prisoner and requested i would write as often as i could obriens letter was from captain savage the frigate had been sent home with despatches and obriens conduct represented to the admiralty which had in consequence promoted him to the rank of lieutenant obrien came to me with the letter his countenance radiant with joy as he put it into my hands in return i put mine into his and he read it over peter my boy im under great obligations to you when you were wounded and feverish you thought of me at a time when you had quite enough to think of yourself but i never thank in words i see your uncle william is dead how many more uncles have you my uncle john who is married and has already two daughters blessings on him may he stick to the female line of business peter my boy you shall be a lord before you die nonsense obrien i have no chance dont put such foolish ideas in my head what chance had i of being a lieutenant and am i not one well peter youve helped to make a lieutenant of me but ill make a man of you and thats better peter i perceive with all your simplicity that youre not over and above simple and that with all your asking for advice you can think and act for yourself on an emergency now peter these are talents that must not be thrown away in this cursed hole and therefore my boy prepare yourself to quit this place in a week wind and weather permitting that is to say not fair wind and weather but the fouler the better will you be ready at any hour of any night that i call you up yes obrien i will and do my best no man can do much more that ever i heard of but peter do me one favour as i am really a lieutenant just touch your hat to me only once thats all but i wish the compliment just to see how it looks lieutenant obrien said i touching my hat have you any further orders yes sir replied he that you never presume to touch your hat to me again unless we sail together and then thats a different sort of thing about a week afterwards obrien came to me and said the new moons quartered in with foul weather if it holds prepare for a start i have put what is necessary in your little haversack it may be tonight go to bed now and sleep for a week if you can for youll get but little sleep if we succeed for the week to come this was about eight oclock i went to bed and about twelve i was roused by obrien who told me to dress myself carefully and come down to him in the yard i did so without disturbing any body and found the night as dark as pitch it was then november and raining in torrents the wind was high howling round the yard and sweeping in the rain in every direction as it eddied to and fro it was some time before i could find obrien who was hard at work and as i had already been made acquainted with all his plans i will now explain them at montpelier he had procured six large pieces of iron about eighteen inches long with a gimlet at one end of each and a square at the other which fitted to a handle which unshipped for precaution he had a spare handle but each handle fitted to all the irons obrien had screwed one of these pieces of iron between the interstices of the stones of which the wall was built and sitting astride on that was fixing another about three feet above when he had accomplished this he stood upon the lower iron and supporting himself by the second which about met his hip he screwed in a third always fixing them about six inches on one side of the other and not one above the other when he had screwed in his six irons he was about half up the wall and then he fastened his rope which he had carried round his neck to the upper iron and lowering himself down unscrewed the four lower irons then ascending by the rope he stood upon the fifth iron and supporting himself by the upper iron recommenced his task by these means he arrived in the course of an hour and a half to the top of the wall where he fixed his last iron and making his rope fast he came down again now peter said he there is no fear of the sentries seeing us if they had the eyes of cats they could not until we were on the top of the wall but then we arrive at the glacis and we must creep to the ramparts on our bellies i am going up with all the materials give me your haversackyou will go up lighter and recollect should any accident happen to me you run to bed again if on the contrary i pull the rope up and down three or four times you may sheer up it as fast as you can obrien then loaded himself with the other rope the two knapsacks iron crows and other implements he had procured and last of all with the umbrella peter if the rope bears me with all this it is clear it will bear such a creature as you are therefore dont be afraid so whispering he commenced his ascent in about three minutes he was up and the rope pulled i immediately followed him and found the rope very easy to climb from the knots at every two feet which gave me a hold for my feet and i was up in as short a time as he was he caught me by the collar putting his wet hand on my mouth and i lay down beside him while he pulled up the rope we then crawled on our stomachs across the glacis till we arrived at the rampart the wind blew tremendously and the rain pattered down so fast that the sentries did not perceive us indeed it was no fault of theirs for it was impossible to have made us out it was some time before obrien could find out the point exactly above the drawbridge of the first ditch at last he didhe fixed his crowbar in and lowered down the rope now peter i had better go first again when i shake the rope from below alls right obrien descended and in a few minutes the rope again shook i followed him and found myself received in his arms upon the meeting of the drawbridge but the drawbridge itself was up obrien led the way across the chains and i followed him when we had crossed the moat we found a barrier gate locked this puzzled us obrien pulled out his picklocks to pick it but without success here we were fast we must undermine the gate obrien we must pull up the pavement until we can creep under peter you are a fine fellow i never thought of that we worked very hard until the hole was large enough using the crowbar which was left and a little wrench which obrien had with him by these means we got under the gate in the course of an hour or more this gate led to the lower rampart but we had a covered way to pass through before we arrived at it we proceeded very cautiously when we heard a noise we stopped and found that it was a sentry who was fast asleep and snoring little expecting to find one here we were puzzled pass him we could not well as he was stationed on the very spot where we required to place our crowbar to descend the lower rampart into the river obrien thought for a moment peter said he now is the time for you to prove yourself a man he is fast asleep but his noise must be stopped i will stop his mouth but at the very moment that i do so you must throw open the pan of his musket and then he cannot fire it i will obrien dont fear me we crept cautiously up to him and obrien motioning to me to put my thumb upon the pan i did so and the moment that obrien put his hand upon the soldiers mouth i threw open the pan the fellow struggled and snapped his lock as a signal but of course without discharging his musket and in a minute he was not only gagged but bound by obrien with my assistance leaving him there we proceeded to the rampart and fixing the crowbar again obrien descended i followed him and found him in the river hanging on to the rope the umbrella was opened and turned upwards the preparation made it resist the water and as previously explained to me by obrien i had only to hold on at arms length to two beckets which he had affixed to the point of the umbrella which was under water to the same part obrien had a towline which taking in his teeth he towed me down with the stream to about a hundred yards clear of the fortress where we landed obrien was so exhausted that for a few minutes he remained quite motionless i also was benumbed with the cold peter said he thank god we have succeeded so far now must we push on as far as we can for we shall have daylight in two hours obrien took out his flask of spirits and we both drank a half tumbler at least but we should not in our state have been affected with a bottle we now walked along the riverside till we fell in with a small craft with a boat towing astern obrien swam to it and cutting the painter without getting in towed it on shore the oars were fortunately in the boat i got in we shoved off and rowed away down the stream till the dawn of day alls right peter now well land this is the forest of ardennes we landed replaced the oars in the boat and pushed her off into the stream to induce people to suppose that she had broken adrift and then hastened into the thickest of the wood it still rained hard i shivered and my teeth chattered with the cold but there was no help for it we again took a dram of spirits and worn out with fatigue and excitement soon fell fast asleep upon a bed of leaves which we had collected together chapter xxii grave consequences of gravitationobrien enlists himself as a gendarme and takes charge of mewe are discovered and obliged to run for itthe pleasures of a winter bivouac it was not until noon that i awoke when i found that obrien had covered me more than a foot deep with leaves to protect me from the weather i felt quite warm and comfortable my clothes had dried on me but without giving me cold how very kind of you obrien said i not a bit peter you have hard work to go through yet and i must take care of you youre but a bud and im a fullblown rose so saying he put the spiritflask to his mouth and then handed it to me now peter we must make a start for depend upon it they will scour the country for us but this is a large wood and they may as well attempt to find a needle in a bundle of hay if we once get into the heart of it i think said i that this forest is mentioned by shakespeare in one of his plays very likely peter replied obrien but we are at no playwork now and what reads amazing prettily is no joke in reality ive often observed that your writers never take the weather into consideration i beg your pardon obrien in king lear the weather was tremendous very likely but who was the king that went out in such weather king lear did when he was mad so he was thats certain peter but runaway prisoners have some excuse so now for a start we set off forcing our way through the thicket for about three hours obrien looking occasionally at his pocket compass it then was again nearly dark and obrien proposed a halt we made up a bed of leaves for the night and slept much more comfortably than we had the night before all our bread was wet but as we had no water it was rather a relief the meat we had with us was sufficient for a week once more we laid down and fell fast asleep about five oclock in the morning i was roused by obrien who at the same time put his hand gently over my mouth i sat up and perceived a large fire not far from us the philistines are upon us peter said he i have reconnoitred and they are the gendarmes im fearful of going away as we may stumble upon some more of them ive been thinking whats best before i waked you and it appears to me that we had better get up the tree and lie there at that time we were hidden in a copse of underwood with a large oak in the centre covered with ivy i think so too obrien shall we go up now or wait a little now to be sure that theyre eating their prog mount you peter and ill help you obrien shoved me up the tree and then waiting a little while to bury our haversacks among the leaves he followed me he desired me to remain in a very snug position on the first fork of the tree while he took another amongst a bunch of ivy on the largest bough there we remained for about an hour when day dawned we observed the gendarmes mustered at the break of day by the corporal and then they all separated in different directions to scour the wood we were delighted to perceive this as we hoped soon to be able to get away but there was one gendarme who remained he walked to and fro looking everywhere until he came directly under the tree in which we were concealed he poked about until at last he came to the bed of leaves upon which we had slept these he turned over and over with his bayonet until he routed out our haversacks pardi exclaimed he where the nest and eggs are the birds are near he then walked round the tree looking up into every part but we were well concealed and he did not discover us for some time at last he saw me and ordered me to come down i paid no attention to him as i had no signal from obrien he walked round a little farther until he was directly under the branch on which obrien lay taking up this position he had a fairer aim at me and levelled his musket saying descendez ou je tire still i continued immoveable for i knew not what to do i shut my eyes however the musket shortly afterwards was discharged and whether from fear or not i can hardly tell i lost my hold of a sudden and down i came i was stunned with the fall and thought that i must have been wounded and was very much surprised when instead of the gendarme obrien came up to me and asked whether i was hurt i answered i believed not and got upon my legs when i found the gendarme lying on the ground breathing heavily but insensible when obrien perceived the gendarme level his musket at me he immediately dropped from the bough right upon his head this occasioned the musket to go off without hitting me and at the same time the weight of obriens body from such a height killed the gendarme for he expired before we left him now peter said obrien this is the most fortunate thing in the world and will take us half through the country but we have no time to lose he then stripped the gendarme who still breathed heavily and dragging him to our bed of leaves covered him up threw off his own clothes which he tied in a bundle and gave to me to carry and put on those of the gendarme i could not help laughing at the metamorphosis and asked obrien what he intended sure im a gendarme bringing with me a prisoner who has escaped he then tied my hands with a cord shouldered his musket and off we set we now quitted the wood as soon as we could for obrien said that he had no fear for the next ten days and so it proved we had one difficulty which was that we were going the wrong way but that was obviated by travelling mostly at night when no questions were asked except at the cabarets where we lodged and they did not know which way we came when we stopped at night my youth excited a great deal of commiseration especially from the females and in one instance i was offered assistance to escape i consented to it but at the same time informed obrien of the plan proposed obrien kept watchi dressed myself and was at the open window when he rushed in seizing me and declaring that he would inform the government of the conduct of the parties their confusion and distress were very great they offered obrien twenty thirty forty napoleons if he would hush it up for they were aware of the penalty and imprisonment obrien replied that he would not accept of any money in compromise of his duty that after he had given me into the charge of the gendarme of the next post his business was at an end and he must return to flushing where he was stationed i have a sister there replied the hostess who keeps an inn youll want good quarters and a friendly cup do not denounce us and ill give you a letter to her which if it does not prove of service you can then return and give the information obrien consented the letter was delivered and read to him in which the sister was requested by the love she bore to the writer to do all she could for the bearer who had the power of making the whole family miserable but had refused so to do obrien pocketed the letter filled his brandyflask and saluting all the women left the cabaret dragging me after him with a cord the only difference as obrien observed after he went out was that he obrien kissed all the women and all the women kissed me in this way we had proceeded by charleroy and louvain and were within a few miles of malines when a circumstance occurred which embarrassed us not a little we were following our route avoiding malines which was a fortified town and at the time were in a narrow lane with wide ditches full of water on each side at the turning of a sharp corner we met the gendarme who had supplied obrien with a map of the town of givet good morning comrade said he to obrien looking earnestly at him whom have we here a young englishman whom i picked up close by escaped from prison where from he will not say but i suspect from givet there are two who have escaped from givet replied he how they escaped no one can imagine but continued he again looking at obrien avec les braves il ny a rien dimpossible that is true replied obrien i have taken one the other cannot be far off you had better look for him i should like to find him replied the gendarme for you know that to retake a runaway prisoner is certain promotion you will be made a corporal so much the better replied obrien adieu mon ami nay i merely came for a walk and will return with you to malines where of course you are bound we shall not get there tonight said obrien my prisoner is too much fatigued well then we will go as far as we can and i will assist you perhaps we may find the second who i understand obtained a map of the fortress by some means or other we at once perceived that we were discovered he afterwards told us that the body of a gendarme had been found in the wood no doubt murdered by the prisoners and that the body was stripped naked i wonder continued he whether one of the prisoners put on his clothes and passed as a gendarme peter said obrien are we to murder this man or not i should say not pretend to trust him and then we may give him the slip this was said during the time that the gendarme stopped a moment behind us well well try but first ill put him off his guard when the gendarme came up with us obrien observed that the english prisoners were very liberal that he knew that a hundred napoleons were often paid for assistance and he thought that no corporals rank was equal to a sum that would in france make a man happy and independent for life very true replied the gendarme and let me only look upon that sum and i will guarantee a positive safety out of france then we understand each other replied obrien this boy will give two hundredone half shall be yours if you will assist i will think of it replied the gendarme who then talked about indifferent subjects until we arrived at a small town called acarchot where we proceeded to a cabaret the usual curiosity passed over we were left alone obrien telling the gendarme that he would expect his reply that night or tomorrow morning the gendarme said tomorrow morning obrien requesting him to take charge of me he called the woman of the cabaret to show him a room she showed him one or two which he refused as not sufficiently safe for the prisoner the woman laughed at the idea observing what had he to fear from a pauvre enfant like me yet this pauvre enfant escaped from givet replied obrien these englishmen are devils from their birth the last room showed to obrien suited him and he chose itthe woman not presuming to contradict a gendarme as soon as they came down again obrien ordered me to bed and went upstairs with me he bolted the door and pulling me to the large chimney we put our heads up and whispered that our conversation should not be heard this man is not to be trusted said obrien and we must give him the slip i know my way out of the inn and we must return the way we came and then strike off in another direction but will he permit us not if he can help it but i shall soon find out his manoeuvres obrien then went and stopped the keyhole by hanging his handkerchief across it and stripping himself of his gendarme uniform put on his own clothes then he stuffed the blankets and pillow into the gendarmes dress and laid it down on the outside of the bed as if it were a man sleeping in his clothesindeed it was an admirable deception he laid his musket by the side of the image and then did the same to my bed making it appear as if there was a person asleep in it of my size and putting my cap on the pillow now peter well see if he is watching us he will wait till he thinks we are asleep the light still remained in the room and about an hour afterwards we heard a noise of one treading on the stairs upon which as agreed we crept under the bed the latch of our door was tried and finding it open which he did not expect the gendarme entered and looking at both beds went away now said i after the gendarme had gone downstairs obrien ought we not to escape ive been thinking of it peter and i have come to a resolution that we can manage it better he is certain to come again in an hour or two it is only eleven now ill play him a trick obrien then took one of the blankets make it fast to the window which he left wide open and at the same time disarranged the images he had made up so as to let the gendarme perceive that they were counterfeit we again crept under the bed and as obrien foretold in about an hour more the gendarme returned our lamp was still burning but he had a light of his own he looked at the beds perceived at once that he had been duped went to the open window and then exclaimed sacre dieu ils mont echappes et je ne suis plus caporal ftre a la chasse he rushed out of the room and in a minute afterwards we heard him open the street door and go away that will do peter said obrien laughing now well be off also although theres no great hurry obrien then resumed his dress of a gendarme and about an hour afterwards we went down and wishing the hostess all happiness quitted the cabaret returning the same road by which we had come now peter said obrien were in a bit of a puzzle this dress wont do any more still theres a respectability about it which will not allow me to put it off till the last moment we walked on till daylight when we hid ourselves in a copse of trees at night we again started for the forest of ardennes for obrien said our best chance was to return until they supposed that we had had time to effect our escape but we never reached the forest for on the next day a violent snowstorm came on it continued without intermission for four days during which we suffered much our money was not exhausted as i had drawn upon my father for l which with the disadvantageous exchange had given me fifty napoleons occasionally obrien crept into a cabaret and obtained provisions but as we dared not be seen together as before we were always obliged to sleep in the open air the ground being covered more than three feet with snow on the fifth day being then six days from the forest of ardennes we hid ourselves in a small wood about a quarter of a mile from the road i remained there while obrien as a gendarme went to obtain provisions as usual i looked out for the best shelter during his absence and what was my horror at falling in with a man and woman who lay dead in the snow having evidently perished from the weather just as i discovered them obrien returned and i told him he went with me to view the bodies they were dressed in a strange attire ribands pinned upon their clothes and two pairs of very high stilts lying by their sides obrien surveyed them and then said peter this is the very best thing that could have happened to us we may now walk through france without soiling our feet with the cursed country how do you mean i mean said he that these are the people that we met near montpelier who come from the landes walking about on their stilts for the amusement of others to obtain money in their own country they are obliged to walk so now peter it appears to me that the mans clothes will fit me and the girls poor creature how pretty she looks cold in death will fit you all we have to do is to practise a little and then away we start obrien then with some difficulty pulled off the mans jacket and trowsers and having so done buried him in the snow the poor girl was despoiled of her gown and upper petticoat with every decency and also buried we collected the clothes and stilts and removed to another quarter of the wood where we found a wellsheltered spot and took our meal as we did not travel that night as usual we had to prepare our own bed we scraped away the snow and made ourselves as comfortable as we could without a fire but the weather was dreadful peter said obrien im melancholy here drink plenty and he handed me the flask of spirits which had never been empty drink more peter i cannot obrien without being tipsy never mind that drink more see how these two poor devils lost their lives by falling asleep in the snow peter said obrien starting up you shant sleep herefollow me i expostulated in vain it was almost dark and he led me to the village near which he pitched upon a hovel a sort of outhouse peter here is shelter lie down and sleep and ill keep the watch not a word i will have itdown at once i did so and in a very few minutes was fast asleep for i was worn out with cold and fatigue for several days we had walked all night and the rest we gained by day was trifling oh how i longed for a warm bed with four or five blankets just as the day broke obrien roused me he had stood sentry all night and looked very haggard obrien you are ill said i not a bit but ive emptied the brandyflask and thats a bad job however it is to be remedied we then returned to the wood in a mizzling rain and fog for the weather had changed and the frost had broken up the thaw was even worse than the frost and we felt the cold more obrien again insisted upon my sleeping in the outhouse but this time i positively refused without he would also sleep there pointing out to him that we ran no more risk and perhaps not so much as if he stayed outside finding i was positive he at last consented and we both gained it unperceived we lay down but i did not go to sleep for some time i was so anxious to see obrien fast asleep he went in and out several times during which i pretended to be fast asleep at last it rained in torrents and then he lay down again and in a few minutes overpowered by nature he fell fast asleep snoring so loudly that i was afraid some one would hear us i then got up and watched occasionally lying down and slumbering awhile and then going to the door chapter xxiii exalted with our success we march through france without touching the groundi become femininewe are voluntary conscripts at daybreak i called obrien who jumped up in a great hurry sure ive been asleep peter yes you have replied i and i thank heaven that you have for no one could stand such fatigue as you have much longer and if you fall ill what would become of me this was touching him on the right point well peter since theres no harm come of it theres no harm done ive had sleep enough for the next week thats certain we returned to the wood the snow had disappeared and the rain ceased the sun shone out from between the clouds and we felt warm dont pass so near that way said obrien we shall see the poor creatures now that the snow is gone peter we must shift our quarters tonight for i have been to every cabaret in the village and i cannot go there any more without suspicion although i am a gendarme we remained there till the evening and then set off still returning towards givet about an hour before daylight we arrived at a copse of trees close to the roadside and surrounded by a ditch not above a quarter of a mile from a village it appears to me said obrien that this will do i will now put you there and then go boldly to the village and see what i can get for here we must stay at least a week we walked to the copse and the ditch being rather too wide for me to leap obrien laid the four stilts together so as to form a bridge over which i contrived to walk tossing to me all the bundles and desiring me to leave the stilts as a bridge for him on his return he set off to the village with his musket on his shoulder he was away two hours when he returned with a large supply of provisions the best we had ever had french saucissons seasoned with garlic which i thought delightful four bottles of brandy besides his flask a piece of hung beef and six loaves of bread besides half a baked goose and part of a large pie there said he we have enough for a good week and look here peter this is better than all and he showed me two large horserugs excellent replied i now we shall be comfortable i paid honestly for all but these rugs observed obrien but i was afraid to buy them so i stole them however well leave them here for those they belong toits only borrowing after all we now prepared a very comfortable shelter with branches which we wove together and laying the leaves in the sun to dry soon obtained a soft bed to put one horserug on while we covered ourselves up with the other our bridge of stilts we had removed so that we felt ourselves quite secure from surprise that evening we did nothing but carousethe goose the pie the saucissons as big as my arm were alternately attacked and we went to the ditch to drink water and then ate again this was quite happiness to what we had suffered especially with the prospect of a good bed at dark to bed we went and slept soundly i never felt more refreshed during our wanderings at daylight obrien got up now peter a little practice before breakfast what practice do you mean mean why on the stilts i expect in a week that youll be able to dance a gavotte at least for mind me peter you travel out of france upon these stilts depend upon it obrien then took the stilts belonging to the man giving me those of the woman we strapped them to our thighs and by fixing our backs to a tree contrived to get upright upon them but at the first attempt to walk obrien fell to the right and i fell to the left obrien fell against a tree but i fell on my nose and made it bleed very much however we laughed and got up again and although we had several falls at last we made a better hand of them we then had some difficulty in getting down again but we found out how by again resorting to a tree after breakfast we strapped them on again and practised and so we continued to do for the whole day when we again attacked our provisions and fell asleep under our horserug this continued for five days by which time being constantly on the stilts we became very expert and although i could not dance a gavottefor i did not know what that wasi could hop about with them with the greatest ease one days more practice said obrien for our provisions will last one day more and then we start but this time we must rehearse in costume obrien then dressed me in the poor girls clothes and himself in the mans they fitted very well and the last day we practised as man and woman peter you make a very pretty girl said obrien now dont you allow the men to take liberties never fear replied i but obrien as these petticoats are not very warm i mean to cut off my trowsers up to my knees and wear them underneath thats all right said obrien for you may have a tumble and then they may find out that youre not a lady the next morning we made use of our stilts to cross the ditch and carrying them in our hands we boldly set off on the high road to malines we met several people gensdarmes and others but with the exception of some remarks upon my good looks we passed unnoticed towards the evening we arrived at the village where we had slept in the outhouse and as soon as we entered it we put on our stilts and commenced a march when the crowd had gathered we held out our caps and receiving nine or ten sous we entered a cabaret many questions were asked us as to where we came from and obrien answered telling lies innumerable i played the modest girl and obrien who stated i was his sister appeared very careful and jealous of any attention we slept well and the next morning continued our route to malines we very often put on our stilts for practice on the road which detained us very much and it was not until the eighth day without any variety or any interruption that we arrived at malines as we entered the barriers we put on our stilts and marched boldly on the guard at the gate stopped us not from suspicion but to amuse themselves and i was forced to submit to several kisses from their garlic lips before we were allowed to enter the town we again mounted on our stilts for the guard had forced us to dismount or they could not have kissed me every now and then imitating a dance until we arrived at the grande place where we stopped opposite the hotel and commenced a sort of waltz which we had practised the people in the hotel looked out of the window to see our exhibition and when we had finished i went up to the windows with obriens cap to collect money what was my surprise to perceive colonel obrien looking full in my face and staring very hard at mewhat was my greater astonishment at seeing celeste who immediately recognised me and ran back to the sofa in the room putting her hands up to her eyes and crying out cest lui cest lui fortunately obrien was close to me or i should have fallen but he supported me peter ask the crowd for money or you are lost i did so and collecting some pence then asked him what i should do go back to the windowyou can then judge of what will happen i returned to the window colonel obrien had disappeared but celeste was there as if waiting for me i held out the cap to her and she thrust her hand into it the cap sank with the weight i took out a purse which i kept closed in my hand and put it into my bosom celeste then retired from the window and when she had gone to the back of the room kissed her hand to me and went out at the door i remained stupefied for a moment but obrien roused me and we quitted the grande place taking up our quarters at a little cabaret on examining the purse i found fifty napoleons in it these must have been obtained from her father i cried over them with delight obrien was also much affected at the kindness of the colonel hes a real obrien every inch of him said he even this cursed country cant spoil the breed at the cabaret where we stopped we were informed that the officer who was at the hotel had been appointed to the command of the strong fort of bergenopzoom and was proceeding thither we must not chance to meet him again if possible said obrien it would be treading too close upon the heels of his duty neither will it do to appear on stilts among the dikes so peter well just jump on clear of this town and then well trust to our wits we walked out of the town early in the morning after obrien had made purchases of some of the clothes usually worn by the peasantry when within a few miles of st nicholas we threw away our stilts and the clothes which we had on and dressed ourselves in those obrien had purchased obrien had not forgotten to provide us with two large browncoloured blankets which we strapped on to our shoulders as the soldiers do their coats but what are we to pass for now obrien peter i will settle that point before night my wits are working but i like to trust to chance for a stray idea or so we must walk fast or we shall be smothered with the snow it was bitter cold weather and the snow had fallen heavily during the whole day but although nearly dusk there was a bright moon ready for us we walked very fast and soon observed persons ahead of us let us overtake them we may obtain some information as we came up with them one of them they were both lads of seventeen to eighteen said to obrien i thought we were the last but i was mistaken how far is it now to st nicholas how should i know replied obrien i am a stranger in these parts as well as yourself from what part of france do you come demanded the other his teeth chattering with the cold for he was badly clothed and with little defence from the inclement weather from montpelier replied obrien and i from toulouse a sad change comrade from olives and vines to such a climate as this curse the conscription i intended to have taken a little wife next year obrien gave me a push as if to say heres something that will do and then continued and curse the conscription i say too for i had just married and now my wife is left to be annoyed by the attention of the fermier general but it cant be helped cest pour la france et pour la gloire we shall be too late to get a billet replied the other and not a sou have i in my pocket i doubt if i get up with the main body till they are at flushing by our route they are at axel today if we arrive at st nicholas we shall do well replied obrien but i have a little money left and ill not see a comrade want a supper or a bed who is going to serve his country you can repay me when we meet at flushing that i will with thanks replied the frenchman and so will jacques here if you will trust him with pleasure replied obrien who then entered into a long conversation by which he drew out from the frenchmen that a party of conscripts had been ordered to flushing and that they had dropped behind the main body obrien passed himself off as a conscript belonging to the party and me as his brother who had resolved to join the army as a drummer rather than part with him in about an hour we arrived at st nicholas and after some difficulty obtained entrance into a cabaret vive la france said obrien going up to the fire and throwing the snow off his hat in a short time we were seated to a good supper and very tolerable wine the hostess sitting down by us and listening to the true narratives of the real conscripts and the false one of obrien after supper the conscript who first addressed us pulled out his printed paper with the route laid down and observed that we were two days behind the others obrien read it over and laid it on the table at the same time calling for more wine having already pushed it round very freely we did not drink much ourselves but plied them hard and at last the conscript commenced the whole history of his intended marriage and his disappointment tearing his hair and crying now and then never mind interrupted obrien every two or three minutes buvons un autre coup pour la gloire and thus he continued to make them both drink until they reeled away to bed forgetting their printed paper which obrien had some time before slipped away from the table we also retired to our room when obrien observed to me peter this description is as much like me as i am to old nick but thats of no consequence as nobody goes willingly as a conscript and therefore they will never have a doubt but that it is all right we must be off early tomorrow while these good people are in bed and steal a long march upon them i consider that we are now safe as far as flushing chapter xxiv what occurred at flushing and what occurred when we got out of flushing an hour before daybreak we started the snow was thick on the ground but the sky was clear and without any difficulty or interruption we passed through the towns of axel and halst arrived at terneuse on the fourth day and went over to flushing in company with about a dozen more stragglers from the main body as we landed the guard asked us whether we were conscripts obrien replied that he was and held out his paper they took his name or rather that of the person it belonged to down in a book and told him that he must apply to the etat major before three oclock we passed on delighted with our success and then obrien pulled out the letter which had been given to him by the woman of the cabaret who had offered to assist me to escape when obrien passed off as a gendarme and reading the address demanded his way to the street we soon found out the house and entered conscripts said the woman of the house looking at obrien i am billeted full already it must be a mistake where is your order read said obrien handing her the letter she read the letter and putting it into her neckerchief desired him to follow her obrien beckoned me to come and we went into a small room what can i do for you said the woman i will do all in my power but alas you will march from here in two or three days never mind replied obrien we will talk the matter over byandby but at present only oblige us by letting us remain in this little room we do not wish to be seen comment doneyou a conscript and not wish to be seen are you then intending to desert answer me one question you have read that letter do you intend to act up to its purport as your sister requests as i hope for mercy i will if i suffer everything she is a dear sister and would not write so earnestly if she had not strong reason my house and everything you command are yourscan i say more but continued obrien suppose i did intend to desert would you then assist me at my peril replied the woman have you not assisted my family when in difficulty well then i will not at present detain you from your business i have heard you called several times let us have dinner when convenient and we will remain here if i have any knowledge of phizwhat dye call it observed obrien after she left us there is honesty in that woman and i must trust her but not yet we must wait till the conscripts have gone i agreed with obrien and we remained talking until an hour afterwards when the woman brought us our dinner what is your name inquired obrien louise eustache you might have read it on the letter are you married oh yes these six years my husband is seldom at home he is a flushing pilot a hard life harder even than that of a soldier who is this lad he is my brother who if i go as a soldier intends to volunteer as a drummer pauvre enfant cest dommage the cabaret was full of conscripts and other people so that the hostess had enough to do at night we were shown by her into a small bedroom adjoining the room we occupied you are quite alone here the conscripts are to muster tomorrow i find in the place darmes at two oclock do you intend to go no replied obrien they will think that i am behind it is of no consequence well replied the woman do as you please you may trust me but i am so busy without any one to assist me that until they leave the town i can hardly find time to speak to you that will be soon enough my good hostess replied obrien au revoir the next evening the woman came in in some alarm stating that a conscript had arrived whose name had been given in before and that the person who had given it in had not mustered at the place that the conscript had declared that his pass had been stolen from him by a person with whom he had stopped at st nicholas and that there were orders for a strict search to be made through the town as it was known that some english officers had escaped and it was supposed that one of them had obtained the pass surely youre not english inquired the woman looking earnestly at obrien indeed but i am my dear replied obrien and so is this lad with me and the favour which your sister requires is that you help us over the water for which service there are one hundred louis ready to be paid upon delivery of us oh mon dieu mais cest impossible impossible replied obrien was that the answer i gave your sister in her trouble au moins cest fort difficile thats quite another concern but with your husband a pilot i should think a great part of the difficulty removed my husband ive no power over him replied the woman putting the apron up to her eyes but one hundred louis may have replied obrien there is truth in that observed the woman after a pause but what am i to do if they come to search the house send us out of it until you can find an opportunity to send us to england i leave it all to youyour sister expects it from you and she shall not be disappointed if god helps us replied the woman after a short pause but i fear you must leave this house and the town also tonight how are we to leave the town i will arrange that be ready at four oclock for the gates are shut at dusk i must go now for there is no time to be lost we are in a nice mess now obrien observed i after the woman had quitted the room devil a bit peter i feel no anxiety whatever except at leaving such good quarters we packed up all our effects not forgetting our two blankets and waited the return of the hostess in about an hour she entered the room i have spoken to my husbands sister who lives about two miles on the road to middelburg she is in town now for it is marketday and you will be safe where she hides you i told her it was by my husbands request or she would not have consented here boy put on these clothes i will assist you once more i was dressed as a girl and when my clothes were on obrien burst out into laughter at my blue stockings and short petticoats il nest pas mal observed the hostess as she fixed a small cap on my head and then tied a kerchief under my chin which partly hid my face obrien put on a greatcoat which the woman handed to him with a widebrimmed hat now follow me she led us into the street which was thronged till we arrived at the marketplace when she met another woman who joined her at the end of the marketplace stood a small horse and cart into which the strange woman and i mounted while obrien by the directions of the landlady led the horse through the crowd until we arrived at the barriers when she wished us good day in a loud voice before the guard the guard took no notice of us and we passed safely through and found ourselves upon a neatlypaved road as straight as an arrow and lined on each side with high trees and a ditch in about an hour we stopped near to the farmhouse of the woman who was in charge of us do you observe that wood said she to obrien pointing to one about half a mile from the road i dare not take you into the house my husband is so violent against the english who captured his schuyt and made him a poor man that he would inform against you immediately but go you there make yourselves as comfortable as you can tonight and tomorrow i will send you what you want adieu je vous plains pauvre enfant said she looking at me as she drove off in the cart towards her own house peter said obrien i think that her kicking us out of her house is a proof of her sincerity and therefore i say no more about it we have the brandyflask to keep up our spirits now then for the wood though by the powers i shall have no relish for any of your picnic parties as they call them for the next twelve years but obrien how can i get over this ditch in petticoats i could hardly leap it in my own clothes you must tie your petticoats round your waist and make a good run get over as far as you can and i will drag you through the rest but you forget that we are to sleep in the wood and that its no laughing matter to get wet through freezing so hard as it does now very true peter but as the snow lies so deep upon the ditch perhaps the ice may bear ill try if it bears me it will not condescend to bend at your shrimp of a carcass obrien tried the ice which was firm and we both walked over and making all the haste we could arrived at the wood as the woman called it but which was not more than a clump of trees of about half an acre we cleared away the snow for about six feet round a very hollow part and then obrien cut stakes and fixed them in the earth to which we stretched one blanket the snow being about two feet deep there was plenty of room to creep underneath the blanket we then collected all the leaves we could beating the snow off them and laid them at the bottom of the hole over the leaves we spread the other blanket and taking our bundles in we then stopped up with snow every side of the upper blanket except the hole to creep in at it was quite astonishing what a warm place this became in a short time after we had remained in it it was almost too warm although the weather outside was piercingly cold after a good meal and a dose of brandy we both fell fast asleep but not until i had taken off my womans attire and resumed my own clothes we never slept better or more warmly than we did in this hole which we had made on the ground covered with ice and snow chapter xxv obrien parts company to hunt for provisions and i have other company in consequence of another huntobrien pathetically mourns my death and finds me alivewe escape the ensuing morning we looked out anxiously for the promised assistance for we were not very rich in provisions although what we had were of a very good quality it was not until three oclock in the afternoon that we perceived a little girl coming towards us escorted by a large mastiff when she arrived at the copse of trees where we lay concealed she cried out to the dog in dutch who immediately scoured the wood until he came to our hidingplace when he crouched down at the entrance barking furiously and putting us in no small dread lest he should attack us but the little girl spoke to him again and he remained in the same position looking at us wagging his tail with his under jaw lying on the snow she soon came up and looking underneath put a basket in and nodded her head we emptied the basket obrien took out a napoleon and offered it to her she refused it but obrien forced it into her hand upon which she again spoke to the dog who commenced barking so furiously at us that we expected every moment he would fly upon us the girl at the same time presented the napoleon and pointing to the dog i went forward and took the napoleon from her at which she immediately silenced the enormous brute and laughing at us hastened away by the powers thats a fine little girl said obrien ill back her and her dog against any man well i never had a dog set at me for giving money before but we live and learn peter now lets see what she brought in the basket we found hardboiled eggs bread and a smoked mutton ham with a large bottle of gin what a nice little girl i hope she will often favour us with her company ive been thinking peter that were quite as well off here as in a midshipmans berth you forget you are a lieutenant well so i did peter and thats the truth but its the force of habit now lets make our dinner its a newfashioned way though of making a meal lying down but however its economical for it must take longer to swallow the victuals the romans used to eat their meals lying down so i have read obrien i cant say that i ever heard it mentioned in ireland but that dont prove that it was not the case so peter ill take your word for it murder how fast it snows again i wonder what my fathers thinking on just at this moment this observation of obrien induced us to talk about our friends and relations in england and after much conversation we fell fast asleep the next morning we found the snow had fallen about eight inches and weighed down our upper blanket so much that we were obliged to go out and cut stakes to support it up from the inside while we were thus employed we heard a loud noise and shouting and perceived several men apparently armed and accompanied with dogs running straight in the direction of the wood where we were encamped we were much alarmed thinking that they were in search of us but on a sudden they turned off in another direction continuing with the same speed as before what could it be said i to obrien i cant exactly say peter but i should think that they were hunting something and the only game that i think likely to be in such a place as this are otters i was of the same opinion we expected the little girl but she did not come and after looking out for her till dark we crawled into our hole and supped upon the remainder of our provisions the next day as may be supposed we were very anxious for her arrival but she did not appear at the time expected night again came on and we went to bed without having any sustenance except a small piece of bread that was left and some gin which was remaining in the flask peter said obrien if she dont come again tomorrow ill try what i can do for ive no idea of our dying of hunger here like the two babes in the wood and being found covered up with dead leaves if she does not appear at three oclock im off for provisions and i dont see much danger for in this dress i look as much of a boor as any man in holland we passed an uneasy night as we felt convinced either that the danger was so great that they dared not venture to assist us or that being overruled they had betrayed us and left us to manage how we could the next morning i climbed up the only large tree in the copse and looked round especially in the direction of the farmhouse belonging to the woman who had pointed out to us our place of concealment but nothing was to be seen but one vast tract of flat country covered with snow and now and then a vehicle passing at a distance on the middelburg road i descended and found obrien preparing for a start he was very melancholy and said to me peter if i am taken you must at all risks put on your girls clothes and go to flushing to the cabaret the women there i am sure will protect you and send you back to england i only want two napoleons take all the rest you will require them if i am not back by tonight set off for flushing tomorrow morning obrien waited some time longer talking with me and it then being past four oclock he shook me by the hand and without speaking left the wood i never felt more miserable during the whole time since we were first put into prison at toulon till that moment and when he was a hundred yards off i knelt down and prayed he had been absent two hours and it was quite dusk when i heard a noise at a distance it advanced every moment nearer and nearer on a sudden i heard a rustling of the bushes and hastened under the blanket which was covered with snow in hopes that they might not perceive the entrance but i was hardly there before in dashed after me an enormous wolf i cried out expecting to be torn to pieces every moment but the creature lay on his belly his mouth wide open his eyes glaring and his long tongue hanging out of his mouth and although he touched me he was so exhausted that he did not attack me the noise increased and i immediately perceived that it was the hunters in pursuit of him i had crawled in feet first the wolf ran in head foremost so that we lay head and tail i crept out as fast as i could and perceived men and dogs not two hundred yards off in full chase i hastened to the large tree and had not ascended six feet when they came up the dogs flew to the hole and in a very short time the wolf was killed the hunters being too busy to observe me i had in the meantime climbed up the trunk of the tree and hidden myself as well as i could being not fifteen yards from them i heard their expressions of surprise as they lifted up the blanket and dragged out the dead wolf which they carried away with them their conversation being in dutch i could not understand it but i was certain that they made use of the word english the hunters and dogs quitted the copse and i was about to descend when one of them returned and pulling up the blankets rolled them together and walked away with them fortunately he did not perceive our bundles by the little light given by the moon i waited a short time and then came down what to do i knew not if i did not remain and obrien returned what would he think if i did i should be dead with cold before the morning i looked for our bundles and found that in the conflict between the dogs and the wolf they had been buried among the leaves i recollected obriens advice and dressed myself in the girls clothes but i could not make up my mind to go to flushing so i resolved to walk towards the farmhouse which being close to the road would give me a chance of meeting with obrien i soon arrived there and prowled round it for some time but the doors and windows were all fast and i dared not knock after what the woman had said about her husbands inveteracy to the english at last as i looked round and round quite at a loss what to do i thought i saw a figure at a distance proceeding in the direction of the copse i hastened after it and saw it enter i then advanced very cautiously for although i thought it might be obrien yet it was possible that it was one of the men who chased the wolf in search of more plunder but i soon heard obriens voice and i hastened towards him i was close to him without his perceiving me and found him sitting down with his face covered up in his two hands at last he cried o pater my poor pater are you taken at last could i not leave you for one hour in safety ochone why did i leave you my poor poor pater simple you were sure enough and thats why i loved you but pater i would have made a man of you for youd all the materials thats the truthand a fine man too where am i to look for you pater where am i to find you pater youre fast locked up by this time and all my troubles gone for nothing but ill be locked up too pater where you are will i be and if we cant go to england together why then well go back to that blackguard hole at givet together ochone ochone obrien spoke no more but burst into tears i was much affected with this proof of obriens sincere regard and i came to his side and clasped him in my arms obrien stared at me who are you you ugly dutch frow for he had quite forgotten the womans dress at the moment but recollecting himself he hugged me in his arms pater you come as near to an angels shape as you can for you come in that of a woman to comfort me for to tell the truth i was very much distressed at not finding you here and all the blankets gone to boot what has been the matter i explained in as few words as i could well peter im happy to find you all safe and much happier to find that you can be trusted when i leave you for you could not have behaved more prudently now ill tell you what i did which was not much as it happened i knew that there was no cabaret between us and flushing for i took particular notice as i came along so i took the road to middelburg and found but one which was full of soldiers i passed it and found no other as i came back past the same cabaret one of the soldiers came out to me but i walked along the road he quickened his pace and so did i mine for i expected mischief at last he came up to me and spoke to me in dutch to which i gave him no answer he collared me and then i thought it convenient to pretend that i was deaf and dumb i pointed to my mouth with an auauand then to my ears and shook my head but he would not be convinced and i heard him say something about english i then knew that there was no time to be lost so i first burst out into a loud laugh and stopped and on his attempting to force me i kicked up his heels and he fell on the ice with such a rap on the pate that i doubt if he has recovered it by this time there i left him and have run back as hard as i could without anything for peter to fill his little hungry inside with now peter whats your opinion for they say that out of the mouth of babes there is wisdom and although i never saw anything come out of their mouths but sour milk yet perhaps i may be more fortunate this time for peter youre but a baby not a small one obrien although not quite so large as fingals babby that you told me the story of my idea is thislet us at all hazards go to the farmhouse they have assisted us and may be inclined to do so again if they refuse we must push on to flushing and take our chance well observed obrien after a pause i think we can do no better so lets be off we went to the farmhouse and as we approached the door were met by the great mastiff i started back obrien boldly advanced hes a clever dog and may know us again ill go up said obrien not stopping while he spoke and pat his head if he flies at me i shall be no worse than i was before for depend upon it he will not allow us to go back again obrien by this time had advanced to the dog who looked earnestly and angrily at him he patted his head the dog growled but obrien put his arm round his neck and patting him again whistled to him and went to the door of the farmhouse the dog followed him silently but closely obrien knocked and the door was opened by the little girl the mastiff advanced to the girl and then turned round facing obrien as much as to say is he to come in the girl spoke to the dog and went indoors during her absence the mastiff lay down at the threshold in a few seconds the woman who had brought us from flushing came out and desired us to enter she spoke very good french and told us that fortunately her husband was absent that the reason why we had not been supplied was that a wolf had met her little girl returning the other day but had been beaten off by the mastiff and that she was afraid to allow her to go again that she heard the wolf had been killed this evening and had intended her girl to have gone to us early tomorrow morning that wolves were hardly known in that country but that the severe winter had brought them down to the lowlands a very rare circumstance occurring perhaps not once in twenty years but how did you pass the mastiff said she that has surprised my daughter and me obrien told her upon which she said that the english were really des braves no other man had ever done the same so i thought for nothing would have induced me to do it obrien then told the history of the death of the wolf with all particulars and our intention if we could not do better of returning to flushing i heard that pierre eustache came home yesterday replied the woman and i do think that you will be safer there than here for they will never think of looking for you among the casernes which join their cabaret will you lend us your assistance to get in i will see what i can do but are you not hungry about as hungry as men who have eaten nothing for two days mon dieu cest vrai i never thought it was so long but those whose stomachs are filled forget those who are empty god make us better and more charitable she spoke to the little girl in dutch who hastened to load the table which we hastened to empty the little girl stared at our voracity but at last she laughed out and clapped her hands at every fresh mouthful which we took and pressed us to eat more she allowed me to kiss her until her mother told her that i was not a woman when she pouted at me and beat me off before midnight we were fast asleep upon the benches before the kitchen fire and at daybreak were roused up by the woman who offered us some bread and spirits and then we went out to the door where we found the horse and cart all ready and loaded with vegetables for the market the woman the little girl and myself got in obrien leading as before and the mastiff following we had learnt the dogs name which was achille and he seemed to be quite fond of us we passed the dreaded barriers without interruption and in ten minutes entered the cabaret of eustache and immediately walked into the little room through a crowd of soldiers two of whom chucked me under the chin whom should we find there but eustache the pilot himself in conversation with his wife and it appeared that they were talking about us she insisting and he unwilling to have any hand in the business well here they are themselves eustache the soldiers who have seen them come in will never believe that this is their first entry if you give them up i leave them to make their own bargain but mark me eustache i have slaved night and day in this cabaret for your profit if you do not oblige me and my family i no longer keep a cabaret for you madame eustache then quitted the room with her husbands sister and little girl and obrien immediately accosted him i promise you said he to eustache one hundred louis if you put us on shore at any part of england or on board of any english manofwar and if you do it within a week i will make it twenty louis more obrien then pulled out the fifty napoleons given us by celeste for our own were not yet expended and laid them on the table here is this in advance to prove my sincerity say is it a bargain or not i never yet heard of a poor man who could withstand his wifes arguments backed with one hundred and twenty louis said eustache smiling and sweeping the money off the table i presume you have no objection to start tonight that will be ten louis more in your favour replied obrien i shall earn them replied eustache the sooner i am off the better for i could not long conceal you here the young frow with you is i suppose your companion that my wife mentioned he has begun to suffer hardships early come now sit down and talk for nothing can be done till dark obrien narrated the adventures attending our escape at which eustache laughed heartily the more so at the mistake which his wife was under as to the obligations of the family if i did not feel inclined to assist you before i do now just for the laugh i shall have at her when i come back and if she wants any more assistance for the sake of her relations i shall remind her of this anecdote but shes a good woman and a good wife to boot only too fond of her sisters at dusk he equipped us both in sailors jackets and trowsers and desired us to follow him boldly he passed the guard who knew him well what to sea already said one you have quarrelled with your wife at which they all laughed and we joined we gained the beach jumped into his little boat pulled off to his vessel and in a few minutes were under weigh with a strong tide and a fair wind we were soon clear of the scheldt and the next morning a cutter hove in sight we steered for her ran under her lee obrien hailed for a boat and eustache receiving my bill for the remainder of his money wished us success we shook hands and in a few minutes found ourselves once more under the british pennant chapter xxvi adventures at homei am introduced to my grandfatherhe obtains employment for obrien and myself and we join a frigate as soon as we were on the deck of the cutter the lieutenant commanding her inquired of us in a consequential manner who we were obrien replied that we were english prisoners who had escaped oh midshipmen i presume replied the lieutenant i heard that some had contrived to get away my name sir said obrien is lieutenant obrien and if youll send for a steels list i will have the honour of pointing it out to you this young gentleman is mr peter simple midshipman and grandson to the right honourable lord viscount privilege the lieutenant who was a little snubnosed man with a pimply face then altered his manner towards us and begged we would step down into the cabin where he offered what perhaps was the greatest of all luxuries to us some english cheese and bottled porter pray said he did you see anything of one of my officers who was taken prisoner when i was sent with despatches to the mediterranean fleet may i first ask the name of your lively little craft said obrien the snapper replied the lieutenant och murder sure enough we met him he was sent to verdun but we had the pleasure of his company en route as far as montpelier a remarkably genteel welldressed young man was he not why i cant say much about his gentility indeed i am not much of a judge as for his dress he ought to have dressed well but he never did when on board of me his father is my tailor and i took him as midshipman just to square an account between us thats exactly what i thought replied obrien he did not say any more which i was glad of as the lieutenant might not have been pleased at what had occurred when do you expect to run into port demanded obrien for we were rather anxious to put our feet ashore again in old england the lieutenant replied that his cruise was nearly up and he considered our arrival quite sufficient reason for him to run in directly and that he intended to put his helm up after the people had had their dinner we were much delighted with this intelligence and still more to see the intention put into execution half an hour afterwards in three days we anchored at spithead and went on shore with the lieutenant to report ourselves to the admiral oh with what joy did i first put my foot on the shingle beach at sallyport and then hasten to the postoffice to put in a long letter which i had written to my mother we did not go to the admirals but merely reported ourselves at the admirals office for we had no clothes fit to appear in but we called at merediths the tailor and he promised that by the next morning we should be fitted complete we then ordered new hats and everything we required and went to the fountain inn obrien refused to go to the blue posts as being only a receptacle for midshipmen by eleven oclock the next morning we were fit to appear before the admiral who received us very kindly and requested our company to dinner as i did not intend setting off for home until i had received an answer from my mother we of course accepted the invitation there was a large party of naval officers and ladies and obrien amused them very much during dinner when the ladies left the room the admirals wife told me to come up with them and when we arrived at the drawingroom the ladies all gathered round me and i had to narrate the whole of my adventures which very much entertained and interested them the next morning i received a letter from my mothersuch a kind one entreating me to come home as fast as i could and bring my preserver obrien with me i showed it to obrien and asked him whether he would accompany me why peter my boy i have a little business of some importance to transact which is to obtain my arrears of pay and some prizemoney which i find due when i have settled that point i will go to town to pay my respects to the first lord of the admiralty and then i think i will go and see your father and mother for until i know how matters stand and whether i shall be able to go with spare cash in my pocket i do not wish to see my own family so write down your address here and youll be sure ill come if it is only to square my accounts with you for i am not a little in your debt i cashed a cheque sent by my father and set off in the mail that night the next evening i arrived safe home but i shall leave the reader to imagine the scene to my mother i was always dear and circumstances had rendered me of some importance to my father for i was now an only son and his prospects were very different from what they were when i left home about a week afterwards obrien joined us having got through all his business his first act was to account with my father for his share of the expenses and he even insisted upon paying his half of the fifty napoleons given me by celeste which had been remitted to a banker at paris before obriens arrival with a guarded letter of thanks from my father to colonel obrien and another from me to dear little celeste when obrien had remained with us about a week he told me that he had about one hundred and sixty pounds in his pocket and that he intended to go and see his friends as he was sure that he would be welcome even to father mgrath i mean to stay with them about a fortnight and shall then return and apply for employment now peter will you like to be again under my protection obrien i will never quit you or your ship if i can help it spoken like a sensible peter well then i was promised immediate employment and i will let you know as soon as the promise is performed obrien took his leave of my family who were already very partial to him and left that afternoon for holyhead my father no longer treated me as a child indeed it would have been an injustice if he had i do not mean to say that i was a clever boy but i had seen much of the world in a short time and could act and think for myself he often talked to me about his prospects which were very different from what they were when i left him my two uncles his elder brothers had died the third was married and had two daughters if he had no son my father would succeed to the title the death of my elder brother tom had brought me next in succession my grandfather lord privilege who had taken no more notice of my father than occasionally sending him a basket of game had latterly often invited him to the house and had even requested some day or another to see his wife and family he had also made a handsome addition to my fathers income which the death of my two uncles had enabled him to do against all this my uncles wife was reported to be again in the family way i cannot say that i was pleased when my father used to speculate upon these chances so often as he did i thought not only as a man but more particularly as a clergyman he was much to blame but i did not know then so much of the world we had not heard from obrien for two months when a letter arrived stating that he had seen his family and bought a few acres of land which had made them all quite happy and had quitted with father mgraths double blessing with unlimited absolution that he had now been a month in town trying for employment but found that he could not obtain it although one promise was backed up by another a few days after this my father received a note from lord privilege requesting he would come and spend a few days with him and bring his son peter who had escaped from the french prison of course this was an invitation not to be neglected and we accepted it forthwith i must say i felt rather in awe of my grandfather he had kept the family at such a distance that i had always heard his name mentioned more with reverence than with any feeling of kindred but i was a little wiser now we arrived at eagle park a splendid estate where he resided and were received by a dozen servants in and out of livery and ushered into his presence he was in his library a large room surrounded with handsome bookcases sitting on an easy chair a more venerable placid old gentleman i never beheld his grey hairs hung down on each side of his temples and were collected in a small queue behind he rose and bowed as we were announced to my father he held out two fingers in salutation to me only one but there was an elegance in the manner in which it was done which was indescribable he waved his hand to chairs placed by the gentleman out of livery and requested we would be seated i could not at the time help thinking of mr chucks the boatswain and his remarks upon high breeding which were so true and i laughed to myself when i recollected that mr chucks had once dined with him as soon as the servants had quitted the room the distance on the part of my grandfather appeared to wear off he interrogated me on several points and seemed pleased with my replies but he always called me child after a conversation of half an hour my father rose saying that his lordship must be busy and that we would go over the grounds till dinnertime my grandfather rose and we took a sort of formal leave but it was not a formal leave after all it was high breeding respecting yourself and respecting others for my part i was pleased with the first interview and so i told my father after we had left the room my dear peter replied he your grandfather has one idea which absorbs most othersthe peerage the estate and the descent of it in the right line as long as your uncles were alive we were not thought of as not being in the line of descent nor should we now but that your uncle william has only daughters still we are not looked upon as actual but only contingent inheritors of the title were your uncle to die tomorrow the difference in his behaviour would be manifested immediately that is to say instead of two fingers you would receive the whole hand and instead of one finger i should obtain promotion to two at this my father laughed heartily saying peter you have exactly hit the mark i cannot imagine how we ever could have been so blind as to call you the fool of the family to this i made no reply for it was difficult so to do without depreciating others or depreciating myself but i changed the subject by commenting on the beauties of the park and the splendid timber with which it was adorned yes peter replied my father with a sigh thirtyfive thousand a year in land money in the funds and timber worth at least forty thousand more are not to be despised but god wills everything after this remark my father appeared to be in deep thought and i did not interrupt him we stayed ten days with my grandfather during which he would often detain me for two hours after breakfast listening to my adventures and i really believe was very partial to me the day before i went away he said child you are going tomorrow now tell me what you would like as i wish to give you a token of regard dont be afraid what shall it bea watch and seals oranything you most fancy my lord replied i if you wish to do me a favour it is that you will apply to the first lord of the admiralty to appoint lieutenant obrien to a fine frigate and at the same time ask for a vacancy as midshipman for me obrien replied his lordship i recollect it was he who accompanied you from france and appears by your account to have been a true friend i am pleased with your request my child and it shall be granted his lordship then desired me to hand him the paper and inkstandish wrote by my directions sealed the letter and told me he would send me the answer the next day we quitted eagle park his lordship wishing my father goodbye with two fingers and to me extending one as before but he said i am pleased with you child you may write occasionally when we were on our route home my father observed that i had made more progress with my grandfather than he had known anyone to do since he could recollect his saying that you might write to him is at least ten thousand pounds to you in his will for he never deceives any one or changes his mind my reply was that i should like to see the ten thousand pounds but that i was not so sanguine a few days after our return home i received a letter and enclosure from lord privilege the contents of which were as follow my dear childi send you lords answer which i trust will prove satisfactory my compliments to your familyyours c privilege the inclosure was a handsome letter from the first lord stating that he had appointed obrien to the sanglier frigate and had ordered me to be received on board as midshipman i was delighted to forward this letter to obriens address who in a few days sent me an answer thanking me and stating that he had received his appointment and that i need not join for a month which was quite time enough as the ship was refitting but that if my family were tired of me which was sometimes the case in the best regulated families why then i should learn something of my duty by coming to portsmouth he concluded by sending his kind regards to all the family and his love to my grandfather which last i certainly did not forward in my letter of thanks about a month afterwards i received a letter from obrien stating that the ship was ready to go out of harbour and would be anchored off spithead in a few days chapter xxvii captain and mrs toporkwe go to plymouth and fall in with our old captain i immediately took leave of my family and set off for portsmouth and in two days arrived at the fountain inn where obrien was waiting to receive me peter my boy i feel so much obliged to you that if your uncle wont go out of the world by fair means ill pick a quarrel with him and shoot him on purpose that you may be a lord as i am determined you shall be now come up into my room where well be all alone and ill tell you all about the ship and our new captain in the first place well begin with the ship as the most important personage of the two shes a beauty i forget her name before she was taken but the french know how to build ships better than keep them shes now called the sanglier which means a wild pig and by the powers a pig ship she is as you will hear directly the captains name is a very short one and wouldnt please mr chucks consisting only of two letters t and o which makes to his whole title is captain john to it would almost appear as if somebody had broken off the better half of his name and only left him the commencement of it but however its a handy name to sign when he pays off his ship and now ill tell you what sort of a looking craft he is hes built like a dutch schuyt great breadth of beam and very square tuck he applied to have the quarter galleries enlarged in the two last ships he commanded he weighs about eighteen stone rather more than less he is a goodnatured sort of a chap amazingly ungenteel not much of an officer not much of a sailor but a devilish good hand at the trencher but hes only part of the concern he has his wife on board who is a redherring sort of a lady and very troublesome to boot what makes her still more annoying is that she has a piano on board very much out of tune on which she plays very much out of time holystoning is music compared with her playing even the captains spaniel howls when she comes to the high notes but she affects the fine lady and always treats the officers with music when they dine in the cabin which makes them very glad to get out of it but obrien i thought wives were not permitted on board very true but theres the worst part in the mans character he knows that he is not allowed to take his wife to sea and in consequence he never says she is his wife or presents her on shore to anybody if any of the other captains ask how mrs to is today why he replies pretty well i thank you but at the same time he gives a kind of smirk as if to say she is not my wife and although everybody knows that she is yet he prefers that they should think otherwise rather than be at the expense of keeping her on shore for you know peter that although there are regulations about wives there are none with regard to other women but does his wife know this inquired i i believe from my heart she is a party to the whole transaction for report says that she would skin a flint if she could shes always trying for presents from the officers and in fact she commands the ship really obrien this is not a very pleasant prospect whist wait a little now i come to the windup this captain to is very partial to pigs mate and we have as many live pigs on board as we have pigs of ballast the first lieutenant is right mad about them at the same time he allows no pigs but his own on board that there may be no confusion the manger is full of pigs there are two cowpens between the maindeck guns drawn from the dockyard and converted into pigpens the two sheeppens amidships are full of pigs and the geese and turkeycoops are divided off into apartments for four sows in the family way now peter you see theres little or no expense in keeping pigs on board of a large frigate with so much paysoup and whole peas for them to eat and this is the reason why he keeps them for the devil a bit of any other stock has he on board i presume he means to milk one of the old sows for breakfast when the ship sails the first thing that he does in the morning is to go round to his pigs with the butcher feeling one scratching the dirty ears of another and then he classes themhis bacon pigs his porkers his breeding sows and so on the old boar is still at the stables of this inn but i hear he is to come on board with the sailing orders but he is very savage and is therefore left on shore to the very last moment now really peter what with the squealing of the pigs and his wifes piano we are almost driven mad i dont know which is the worse of the two if you go aft you hear the one if you go forward you hear the other by way of variety and that they say is charming but is it not shocking that such a beautiful frigate should be turned into a pigsty and that her maindeck should smell worse than a muckheap but how does his wife like the idea of living only upon hogs flesh she lord bless you peter why she looks as spare as a shark and she has just the appetite of one for shell bolt a fourpound piece of pork before its well put on her plate have you any more such pleasant intelligence to communicate obrien no peter you have the worst of it the lieutenants are good officers and pleasant messmates the doctor is a little queer and the purser thinks himself a wag the master an old northcountryman who knows his duty and takes his glass of grog the midshipmen are a very genteel set of young men and full of fun and frolic ill bet a wager therell be a bobbery in the pigsty before long for they are ripe for mischief now peter i hardly need say that my cabin and everything i have is at your service and i think if we could only have a devil of a gale of wind or a hardfought action to send the pigs overboard and smash the piano we should do very well the next day i went on board and was shown down into the cabin to report my having joined mrs to a tall thin woman was at her piano she rose and asked me several questionswho my friends werehow much they allowed me a year and many other questions which i thought impertinent but a captains wife is allowed to take liberties she then asked me if i was fond of music that was a difficult question as if i said that i was i should in all probability be obliged to hear it if i said that i was not i might have created a dislike in her so i replied that i was very fond of music on shore when it was not interrupted by other noise ah then i perceive you are a real amateur mr simple replied the lady captain to then came out of the aftercabin halfdressed well youngster so youve joined us at last come and dine with us today and as you go down to your berth desire the sentry to pass the word for the butcher i want to speak with him i bowed and retired i was met in the most friendly manner by the officers and by my own messmates who had been prepossessed in my favour by obrien previous to my arrival in our service you always find young men of the best families on board large frigates they being considered the most eligible class of vessels i found my messmates to be gentlemen with one or two exceptions but i never met so many wild young lads together i sat down and ate some dinner with them although i was to dine in the cabin for the sea air made me hungry dont you dine in the cabin simple said the caterer yes replied i then dont eat any pork my boy now for youll have plenty there come gentlemen fill your glasses well drink happiness to our new messmate and pledging him we pledge ourselves to try to promote it ill just join you in that toast said obrien walking into the midshipmens berth what is it youre drinking it in some of colliers port sir boy bring a glass for mr obrien heres your health peter and wishing you may keep out of a french prison this cruise mr montague as caterer i will beg you will order another candle that i may see whats on the table and then perhaps i may find something i should like to pick a bit off heres the fag end of a leg of mutton mr obrien and theres a piece of boiled pork then ill just trouble you for a bit close to the knuckle peter you dine in the cabin so do ithe doctor refused have you heard when we sail mr obrien inquired one of my messmates i heard at the admirals office that we were expected to be ordered round to plymouth and receive our orders there either for the east or west indies they thought and indeed the stores we have taken on board indicate that we are going foreign but the captains signal is just made and probably the admiral has intelligence to communicate in about an hour afterwards the captain returned looking very red and hot he called the first lieutenant aside from the rest of the officers who were on deck to receive him and told him that we were to start for plymouth next morning and the admiral had told him confidentially that we were to proceed to the west indies with a convoy which was then collecting he appeared to be very much alarmed at the idea of going to make a feast for the land crabs and certainly his gross habit of body rendered him very unfit for the climate this news was soon spread through the ship and there was of course no little bustle and preparation the doctor who had refused to dine in the cabin upon plea of being unwell sent up to say that he felt himself so much better that he should have great pleasure to attend the summons and he joined the first lieutenant obrien and me as we walked in we sat down to table the covers were removed and as the midshipmen prophesied there was plenty of porkmockturtle soup made out of a pigs heada boiled leg of pork and peaspuddinga roast sparerib with the crackling onsausages and potatoes and pigs pettitoes i cannot say that i disliked my dinner and i ate very heartily but a roast suckingpig came on as a second course which rather surprised me but what surprised me more was the quantity devoured by mrs to she handed her plate from the boiled pork to the roast asked for some pettitoes tried the sausages and finished with a whole plateful of suckingpig and stuffing we had an apple pie at the end but as we had already eaten apple sauce with the roast pork we did not care for it the doctor who abominated pork ate pretty well and was excessively attentive to mrs to will you not take a piece of the roast pig doctor said the captain why really captain to as we are bound by all reports to a station where we must not venture upon pork i think i will not refuse to take a piece for i am very fond of it how do you mean inquired the captain and his lady both in a breath perhaps i may be wrongly informed replied the doctor but i have heard that we were ordered to the west indies now if so everyone knows that although you may eat salt pork there occasionally without danger in all tropical climates and especially the west indies two or three days living upon this meat will immediately produce dysentery which is always fatal in that climate indeed exclaimed the captain you dont say so rejoined the lady i do indeed and have always avoided the west indies for that very reasoni am so fond of pork the doctor then proceeded to give nearly one hundred instances of messmates and shipmen who had been attacked with dysentery from the eating of fresh pork in the west indies and obrien perceiving the doctors drift joined him telling some most astonishing accounts of the dreadful effects of pork in a hot country i think he said that when the french were blockaded previous to the surrender of martinique that having nothing but pigs to eat thirteen hundred out of seventeen hundred soldiers and officers died in the course of three weeks and the others were so reduced by disease that they were obliged to capitulate the doctor then changed the subject and talked about the yellow fever and other diseases of the climate so that by his account the west india islands were but hospitals to die in those most likely to be attacked were men in full strong health the spare men stood a better chance this conversation was carried on until it was time to leavemrs to at last quite silent and the captain gulping down his wine with a sigh when we rose from the table mrs to did not ask us as usual to stay and hear a little music she was like her piano not a little out of tune by the powers doctor you did that nately said obrien as we left the cabin obrien said the doctor oblige me and you mr simple oblige me also by not saying a word in the ship about what i have said if it once gets wind i shall have done no good but if you both hold your tongues for a short time i think i may promise you to get rid of captain to his wife and his pigs we perceived the justice of his observation and promised secrecy the next morning the ship sailed for plymouth and mrs to sent for the doctor not being very well the doctor prescribed for her and i believe on my conscience made her worse on purpose the illness of his wife and his own fears brought captain to more than usual in contact with the doctor of whom he frequently asked his candid opinion as to his own chance in a hot country captain to said the doctor i never would have given my opinion if you had not asked it for i am aware that as an officer you would never flinch from your duty to whatever quarter of the globe you may be ordered but as you have asked the question i must say with your full habit of body i think you would not stand a chance of living for more than two months at the same time sir i may be mistaken but at all events i must point out that mrs to is of a very bilious habit and i trust you will not do such an injustice to an amiable woman as to permit her to accompany you thanky doctor im much obliged to you replied the captain turning round and going down the ladder to his cabin we were then beating down the channel for although we ran through the needles with a fair wind it fell calm and shifted to the westward when we were abreast of portland the next day the captain gave an order for a very fine pig to be killed for he was out of provisions mrs to still kept her bed and he therefore directed that a part should be salted as he could have no company i was in the midshipmans berth when some of them proposed that we should get possession of the pig and the plan they agreed upon was as followsthey were to go to the pen that night and with a needle stuck in a piece of wood to prick the pig all over and then rub gunpowder into the parts wounded this was done and although the butcher was up a dozen times during the night to ascertain what made the pigs so uneasy the midshipmen passed the needle from watch to watch until the pig was well tattooed in all parts in the morning watch it was killed and when it had been scalded in the tub and the hair taken off it appeared covered with blue spots the midshipman of the morning watch who was on the maindeck took care to point out to the butcher that the pork was measly to which the man unwillingly assented stating at the same time that he could not imagine how it could be for a finer pig he had never put a knife into the circumstance was reported to the captain who was much astonished the doctor came in to visit mrs to and the captain requested the doctor to examine the pig and give his opinion although this was not the doctors province yet as he had great reason for keeping intimate with the captain he immediately consented going forward he met me and i told him the secret that will do replied he it all tends to what we wish the doctor returned to the captain and said that there was no doubt but that the pig was measly which was a complaint very frequent on board ships particularly in hot climates where all pork became measlyone great reason for its there proving so unwholesome the captain sent for the first lieutenant and with a deep sigh ordered him to throw the pig overboard but the first lieutenant who knew what had been done from obrien ordered the masters mate to throw it overboard the masters mate touching his hat said ay ay sir and took it down into the berth where we cut it up salted one half and the other we finished before we arrived at plymouth which was six days from the time we left portsmouth on our arrival we found part of the convoy lying there but no orders for us and to my great delight on the following day the diomede arrived from a cruise off the western islands i obtained permission to go on board with obrien and we once more greeted our messmates mr falcon the first lieutenant went down to captain savage to say we were on board and he requested us to come into the cabin he greeted us warmly and gave us great credit for the manner in which we had effected our escape when we left the cabin i found mr chucks the boatswain waiting outside my dear mr simple extend your flapper to me for im delighted to see you i long to have a long talk with you and i should like it also mr chucks but im afraid we have not time i dine with captain savage today and it only wants an hour of dinnertime well mr simple ive been looking at your frigate and shes a beauty much larger than the diomede and she behaves quite as well replied i i think we are two hundred tons larger youve no idea of her size until you are on her decks i should like to be boatswain of her mr simple that is with captain savage for i will not part with him i had some more conversation with mr chucks but i was obliged to attend to others who interrupted us we had a very pleasant dinner with our old captain to whom we gave a history of our adventures and then we returned on board chapter xxviii we get rid of the pigs and pianofortethe last boat on shore before sailingthe first lieutenant too hasty and the consequences to me we waited three days at the expiration of which we heard that captain to was about to exchange with captain savage we could not believe such good news to be true and we could not ascertain the truth of the report as the captain had gone on shore with mrs to who recovered fast after she was out of our doctors hands so fast indeed that a week afterwards on questioning the steward upon his return on board how mrs to was he replied o charming well again sir she has eaten a whole pig since she left the ship but the report was true captain to afraid to go to the west indies had effected an exchange with captain savage captain savage was permitted as was the custom of the service to bring his first lieutenant his boatswain and his barges crew with him he joined a day or two before we sailed and never was there more joy on board the only people miserable were the first lieutenant and those belonging to the sanglier who were obliged to follow captain to who with his wife his pigs and her piano were all got rid of in the course of one forenoon i have already described payday on board of a manofwar but i think that the two days before sailing are even more unpleasant although generally speaking all our money being spent we are not sorry when we once are fairly out of harbour and find ourselves in blue water the men never work well on those days they are thinking of their wives and sweethearts of the pleasure they had when at liberty on shore where they might get drunk without punishment and many of them are either half drunk at the time or suffering from the effects of previous intoxication the ship is in disorder and crowded with the variety of stock and spare stores which are obliged to be taken on board in a hurry and have not yet been properly secured in their places the first lieutenant is cross the officers are grave and the poor midshipmen with all their own little comforts to attend to are harassed and driven about like posthorses mr simple inquired the first lieutenant where do you come from from the gun wharf sir with the gunners spare blocks and breechings very wellsend the marines aft to clear the boat and pipe away the first putter mr simple jump into the first cutter and go to mount wise for the officers be careful that none of your men leave the boat come be smart now i had been away the whole morning and it was then halfpast one and i had had no dinner but i said nothing and went into the boat as soon as i was off obrien who stood by mr falcon said peter was thinking of his dinner poor fellow i really quite forgot it replied the first lieutenant there is so much to do he is a willing boy and he shall dine in the gunroom when he comes back and so i didso i lost nothing by not expostulating and gained more of the favour of the first lieutenant who never forgot what he called zeal but the hardest trial of the whole is to the midshipman who is sent with the boat to purchase the supplies for the cabin and gunroom on the day before the ships sailing it was my misfortune to be ordered upon that service this time and that very unexpectedly i had been ordered to dress myself to take the gig on shore for the captains orders and was walking the deck with my very best uniform and side arms when the marine officer who was the gunroom caterer came up to the first lieutenant and asked him for a boat the boat was manned and a midshipman ordered to take charge of it but when he came up the first lieutenant recollecting that he had come off two days before with only half his boats crew would not trust him and called out to me here mr simple i must send you in this boat mind you are careful that none of the men leave it and bring off the sergeant of marines who is on shore looking for the men who have broken their liberty although i could not but feel proud of the compliment yet i did not much like going in my very best uniform and would have run down and changed it but the marine officer and all the people were in the boat and i could not keep it waiting so down the side i went and we shoved off we had besides the boats crew the marine officer the purser the gunroom steward the captains steward and the pursers steward so that we were pretty full it blew hard from the se and there was a sea running but as the tide was flowing into the harbour there was not much bubble we hoisted the foresail flew before the wind and tide and in a quarter of an hour we were at mutton cove when the marine officer expressed his wish to land the landingplace was crowded with boats and it was not without sundry exchanges of foul words and oaths and the bowmen dashing the point of their boathooks into the shoreboats to make them keep clear of us that we forced our way to the beach the marine officer and all the stewards then left the boat and i had to look after the men i had not been there three minutes before the bowman said that his wife was on the wharf with his clothes from the wash and begged leave to go and fetch them i refused telling him that she could bring them to him vy now mr simple said the woman arnt you a nice ladys man to go for to ax me to muddle my way through all the dead dogs cabbagestalks and stinking hakes heads with my bran new shoes and clean stockings i looked at her and sure enough she was as they say in france bien chaussee come mr simple let him out to come for his clothes and youll see that hes back in a moment i did not like to refuse her as it was very dirty and wet and the shingle was strewed with all that she had mentioned the bowman made a spring out with his boathook threw it back went up to his wife and commenced talking with her while i watched him if you please sir theres my young woman come down maynt i speak to her said another of the men i turned round and refused him he expostulated and begged very hard but i was resolute however when i again turned my eyes to watch the bowman he and his wife were gone there says i to the coxswain i knew it would be so you see hickman is off only gone to take a parting glass sir replied the coxswain hell be here directly i hope so but im afraid not after this i refused all the solicitations of the men to be allowed to leave the boat but i permitted them to have some beer brought down to them the gunroom steward then came back with a basket of softtack ie loaves of bread and told me that the marine officer requested i would allow two of the men to go up with him to glencrosss shop to bring down some of the stores of course i sent two of the men and told the steward if he saw hickman to bring him down to the boat by this time many of the women belonging to the ship had assembled and commenced a noisy conversation with the boats crew one brought an article for jim another some clothes for bill some of them climbed into the boat and sat with the men others came and went bringing beer and tobacco which the men desired them to purchase the crowd the noise and confusion were so great that it was with the utmost difficulty that i could keep my eyes on all my men who one after another made an attempt to leave the boat just at that time came down the sergeant of the marines with three of our men whom he had picked up roaring drunk they were tumbled into the boat and increased the difficulty as in looking after those who were riotous and would try to leave the boat by force i was not so well able to keep my eyes on those who were sober the sergeant then went up after another man and i told him also about hickman about half an hour afterwards the steward came down with the two men loaded with cabbages baskets of eggs strings of onions crockery of all descriptions paper parcels of groceries legs and shoulders of mutton which were crowded in until not only the sternsheets but all under the thwarts of the boat were also crammed full they told me that they had a few more things to bring down and that the marine officer had gone to stonehouse to see his wife so that they should be down long before him in half an hour more during which i had the greatest difficulty to manage the boats crew they returned with a dozen geese and two ducks tied by the legs but without the two men who had given them the slip so that there were now three men gone and i knew mr falcon would be very angry for they were three of the smartest men in the ship i was now determined not to run the risk of losing more men and i ordered the boats crew to shove off that i might lie at the wharf where they could not climb up they were very mutinous grumbled very much and would hardly obey me the fact is they had drunk a great deal and some of them were more than half tipsy however at last i was obeyed but not without being saluted with a shower of invectives from the women and the execrations of the men belonging to the wherries and shore boats which were washed against our sides by the swell the weather had become much worse and looked very threatening i waited an hour more when the sergeant of marines came down with two more men one of whom to my great joy was hickman this made me more comfortable as i was not answerable for the other two still i was in great trouble from the riotous and insolent behaviour of the boats crew and the other men brought down by the sergeant of marines one of them fell back into a basket of eggs and smashed them all to atoms still the marine officer did not come down and it was getting late the tide being now at the ebb running out against the wind there was a heavy sea and i had to go off to the ship with a boat deeply laden and most of the people in her in a state of intoxication the coxswain who was the only one who was sober recommended our shoving off as it would soon be dark and some accident would happen i reflected a minute and agreeing with him i ordered the oars to be got out and we shoved off the sergeant of marines and the gunroom steward perched up in the bowsdrunken men ducks and geese lying together at the bottom of the boatthe stern sheets loaded up to the gunwale and the other passengers and myself sitting how we could among the crockery and a variety of other articles with which the boat was crowded it was a scene of much confusionthe halfdrunken boats crew catching crabs and falling forward upon the othersthose who were quite drunk swearing they would pull lay on your oar sullivan you are doing more harm than good you drunken rascal ill report you as soon as we get on board how the divil can i pull your honour when theres that fellow jones breaking the very back o me with his oar and he never touching the water all the while you lie cried jones im pulling the boat by myself against the whole of the larbard oars hes rowing dry your honouronly making bilave do you call this rowing dry cried another as a sea swept over the boat fore and aft wetting everybody to the skin now your honour just look and see if i aint pulling the very arms off me cried sullivan is there water enough to cross the bridge swinburne said i to the coxswain plenty mr simple it is but quarter ebb and the sooner we are on board the better we were now past devils point and the sea was very heavy the boat plunged in the trough so that i was afraid that she would break her back she was soon half full of water and the two afteroars were laid in for the men to bale plase your honour hadnt i better cut free the legs of them ducks and geese and allow them to swim for their lives cried sullivan resting on his oar the poor birds will be drowned else in their own iliment no nopull away as hard as you can by this time the drunken men in the bottom of the boat began to be very uneasy from the quantity of water which washed about them and made several staggering attempts to get on their legs they fell down again upon the ducks and geese the major part of which were saved from being drowned by being suffocated the sea on the bridge was very heavy and although the tide swept us out we were nearly swamped soft bread was washing about the bottom of the boat the parcels of sugar pepper and salt were wet through with the salt water and a sudden jerk threw the captains steward who was seated upon the gunwale close to the afteroar right upon the whole of the crockery and eggs which added to the mass of destruction a few more seas shipped completed the job and the gunroom steward was in despair thats a darling cried sullivan the politest boat in the whole fleet she makes more bows and curtseys than the finest couple in the land give way my lads and work the crater stuff out of your elbows and the first lieutenant will see us all so sober and so wet in the bargain and think were all so dry that perhaps hell be after giving us a raw nip when we get on board in a quarter of an hour we were nearly alongside but the men pulled so badly and the sea was so great that we missed the ship and went astern they veered out a buoy with a line which we got hold of and were hauled up by the marines and afterguard the boat plunging bows under and drenching us through and through at last we got under the counter and i climbed up by the stern ladder mr falcon was on deck and very angry at the boat not coming alongside properly i thought mr simple that you knew by this time how to bring a boat alongside so i do sir i hope replied i but the boat was so full of water and the men would not give way what men has the sergeant brought on board three sir replied i shivering with the cold and unhappy at my very best uniform being spoiled are all your boats crew with you sir no sir there are two left on shore they not a word sir up to the masthead and stay there till i call you down if it were not so late i would send you on shore and not receive you on board again without the men up sir immediately i did not venture to explain but up i went it was very cold blowing hard from the se with heavy squalls i was so wet that the wind appeared to blow through me and it was now nearly dark i reached the crosstrees and when i was seated there i felt that i had done my duty and had not been fairly treated during this time the boat had been hauled up alongside to clear and a pretty clearance there was all the ducks and geese were dead the eggs and crockery all broke the grocery almost all washed away in short as obrien observed there was a very pretty general average mr falcon was still very angry who are the men missing inquired he of swinburne the coxswain as he came up the side williams and sweetman sir two of the smartest topmen i am told it really is too provoking there is not a midshipman in the ship i can trust i must work all day and get no assistance the service is really going to the devil now with the young men who are sent on board to be brought up as officers and who are above doing their duty what made you so late swinburne waiting for the marine officer who went to stonehouse to see his wife but mr simple would not wait any longer as it was getting dark and we had so many drunken men in the boat mr simple did right i wish mr harrison would stay on shore with his wife altogetherits really trifling with the service pray mr swinburne why had you not your eyes about you if mr simple was so careless how came you to allow these men to leave the boat the men were ordered up by the marine officer to bring down your stores sir and they gave the steward the slip it was no fault of mr simples nor of mine either we lay off at the wharf for two hours before we started or we should have lost more for what can a poor lad do when he has charge of drunken men who will not obey orders and the coxswain looked up at the masthead as much as to say why is he sent there ill take my oath sir continued swinburne that mr simple never put his foot out of the boat from the time that he went over the side until he came on board and that no young gentleman could have done his duty more strictly mr falcon looked very angry at first at the coxswain speaking so freely but he said nothing he took one or two turns on the deck and then hailing the masthead desired me to come down but i could not my limbs were so cramped with the wind blowing upon my wet clothes that i could not move he hailed again i heard him but was not able to answer one of the topmen then came up and perceiving my condition hailed the deck and said he believed i was dying for i could not move and that he dared not leave me for fear i should fall obrien who had been on deck all the while jumped up the rigging and was soon at the crosstrees where i was he sent the topman down into the top for a tailblock and the studdingsail haulyards made a whip and lowered me on deck i was immediately put into my hammock and the surgeon ordering me some hot brandyandwater and plenty of blankets in a few hours i was quite restored obrien who was at my bedside said never mind peter and dont be angry with mr falcon for he is very sorry i am not angry obrien for mr falcon has been too kind to me not to make me forgive him for being once hasty the surgeon came to my hammock gave me some more hot drink desired me to go to sleep and i woke the next morning quite well when i came into the berth my messmates asked me how i was and many of them railed against the tyranny of mr falcon but i took his part saying that he was hasty in this instance perhaps but that generally speaking he was an excellent and very just officer some agreed with me but others did not one of them who was always in disgrace sneered at me and said peter reads the bible and knows that if you smite one cheek he must offer the other now ill answer for it if i pull his right ear he will offer me his left so saying he lugged me by the ear upon which i knocked him down for his trouble the berth was then cleared away for a fight and in a quarter of an hour my opponent gave in but i suffered a little and had a very black eye i had hardly time to wash myself and change my shirt which was bloody when i was summoned on the quarterdeck when i arrived i found mr falcon walking up and down he looked very hard at me but did not ask me any questions as to the cause of my unusual appearance mr simple said he i sent for you to beg your pardon for my behaviour to you last night which was not only very hasty but very unjust i find that you were not to blame for the loss of the men i felt very sorry for him when i heard him speak so handsomely and to make his mind more easy i told him that although i certainly was not to blame for the loss of those two men still i had done wrong in permitting hickman to leave the boat and that had not the sergeant picked him up i should have come off without him and therefore i did deserve the punishment which i had received mr simple replied mr falcon i respect you and admire your feelings still i was to blame and it is my duty to apologise now go down below i would have requested the pleasure of your company to dinner but i perceive that something else has occurred which under any other circumstances i would have inquired into but at present i shall not i touched my hat and went below in the meantime obrien had been made acquainted with the occasion of the quarrel which he did not fail to explain to mr falcon who obrien declared was not the least bit in the world angry with me for what had occurred indeed after that mr falcon always treated me with the greatest kindness and employed me on every duty which he considered of consequence he was a sincere friend for he did not allow me to neglect my duty but at the same time treated me with consideration and confidence the marine officer came on board very angry at being left behind and talked about a courtmartial on me for disrespect and neglect of stores entrusted to my charge but obrien told me not to mind him or what he said its my opinion peter that the gentleman has eaten no small quantity of flapdoodle in his lifetime whats that obrien replied i i never heard of it why peter rejoined he its the stuff they feed fools on chapter xxix a long conversation with mr chucksthe advantage of having a prayerbook in your pocketwe run down the tradesswinburne the quartermaster and his yarnsthe captain falls sick the next day the captain came on board with sealed orders with directions not to open them until off ushant in the afternoon we weighed and made sail it was a fine northerly wind and the bay of biscay was smooth we bore up set all the studdingsails and ran along at the rate of eleven miles an hour as i could not appear on the quarterdeck i was put down on the sicklist captain savage who was very particular asked what was the matter with me the surgeon replied an inflamed eye the captain asked no more questions and i took care to keep out of his way i walked in the evening on the forecastle when i renewed my intimacy with mr chucks the boatswain to whom i gave a full narrative of all my adventures in france i have been ruminating mr simple said he how such a stripling as you could have gone through so much fatigue and now i know how it is it is blood mr simpleall bloodyou are descended from good blood and theres as much difference between nobility and the lower classes as there is between a racer and a carthorse i cannot agree with you mr chucks common people are quite as brave as those who are wellborn you do not mean to say that you are not brave that the seamen on board this ship are not brave no no mr simple but as i observed about myself my mother was a woman who could not be trusted and there is no saying who was my father and she was a very pretty woman to boot which levels all distinctions for the moment as for the seamen god knows i should do them an injustice if i did not acknowledge that they were as brave as lions but there are two kinds of bravery mr simplethe bravery of the moment and the courage of bearing up for a long while do you understand me i think i do but still do not agree with you who will bear more fatigue than our sailors yes yes mr simple that is because they are endured to it from their hard life but if the common sailors were all such little threadpapers as you and had been brought up so carefully they would not have gone through all you have thats my opinion mr simple theres nothing like blood i think mr chucks you carry your ideas on that subject too far i do not mr simple and i think moreover that he who has more to lose than another will always strive more now a common man only fights for his own credit but when a man is descended from a long line of people famous in history and has a coat in arms crisscrossed and stuck all over with lions and unicorns to support the dignity ofwhy has he not to fight for the credit of all his ancestors whose names would be disgraced if he didnt behave well i agree with you mr chucks in the latter remark to a certain extent ah mr simple we never know the value of good descent when we have it but its when we cannot get it that we can preciate it i wish i had been born a noblemani do by heavens and mr chucks slapped his fist against the funnel so as to make it ring again well mr simple continued he after a pause it is however a great comfort to me that i have parted company with that fool mr muddle with his twentysix thousand and odd years and that old woman dispart the gunner you dont know how those two men used to fret me it was very silly but i couldnt help it now the warrant officers of this ship appear to be very respectable quiet men who know their duty and attend to it and are not too familiar which i hate and detest you went home to your friends of course when you arrived in england i did mr chucks and spent some days with my grandfather lord privilege whom you say you once met at dinner well and how was the old gentleman inquired the boatswain with a sigh very well considering his age now do pray mr simple tell me all about it from the time that the servants met you at the door until you went away describe to me the house and all the rooms for i like to hear of all these things although i can never see them again to please mr chucks i entered into a full detail which he listened to very attentively until it was late and then with difficulty would he permit me to leave off and go down to my hammock the next day rather a singular circumstance occurred one of the midshipmen was mastheaded by the second lieutenant for not waiting on deck until he was relieved he was down below when he was sent for and expecting to be punished from what the quartermaster told him he thrust the first book into his jacketpocket which he could lay his hand on to amuse himself at the masthead and then ran on deck as he surmised he was immediately ordered aloft he had not been there more than five minutes when a sudden squall carried away the maintopgallant mast and away he went flying over to leeward for the wind had shifted and the yards were now braced up had he gone overboard as he could not swim he would in all probability have been drowned but the book in his pocket brought him up in the jaws of the forebrace block where he hung until taken out by the maintopmen now it so happened that it was a prayerbook which he had laid hold of in his hurry and those who were superstitious declared it was all owing to his having taken a religious book with him i did not think so as any other book would have answered the purpose quite as well still the midshipman himself thought so and it was productive of good as he was a sad scamp and behaved much better afterwards but i had nearly forgotten to mention a circumstance which occurred on the day of our sailing which will be eventually found to have had a great influence upon my after life it was this i received a letter from my father evidently written in great vexation and annoyance informing me that my uncle whose wife i have already mentioned had two daughters and was again expected to be confined had suddenly broken up his housekeeping discharged every servant and proceeded to ireland under an assumed name no reason had been given for this unaccountable proceeding and not even my grandfather or any of the members of the family had had notice of his intention indeed it was by mere accident that his departure was discovered about a fortnight after it had taken place my father had taken a great deal of pains to find out where he was residing but although my uncle was traced to cork from that town all clue was lost but still it was supposed from inquiries that he was not very far from thence now observed my father in his letter i cannot help surmising that my brother in his anxiety to retain the advantages of the title to his own family has resolved to produce to the world a spurious child as his own by some contrivance or other his wifes health is very bad and she is not likely to have a large family should the one now expected prove a daughter there is little chance of his ever having another and i have no hesitation in declaring my conviction that the measure has been taken with a view of defrauding you of your chance of eventually being called to the house of lords i showed this letter to obrien who after reading it over two or three times gave his opinion that my father was right in his conjectures depend upon it peter theres foul play intended that is if foul play is rendered necessary but obrien i cannot imagine why if my uncle has no son of his own he should prefer acknowledging a son of any other persons instead of his own nephew but i can peter your uncle is not a man likely to live very long as you know the doctors say that with his short neck his life is not worth two years purchase now if he had a son consider that his daughters would be much better off and much more likely to get married besides there are many reasons which i wont talk about now because its no use making you think your uncle to be a scoundrel but ill tell you what ill do ill go down to my cabin directly and write to father mgrath telling him the whole affair and desiring him to ferret him out and watch him narrowly and ill bet you a dozen of claret that in less than a week hell find him out and will dog him to the last hell get hold of his irish servants and you little know the power that a priest has in our country now give the description as well as you can of your uncles appearance also of that of his wife and the number of their family and their ages father mgrath must have all particulars and then let him alone for doing what is needful i complied with obriens directions as well as i could and he wrote a very long letter to father mgrath which was sent on shore by a careful hand i answered my fathers letter and then thought no more about the matter our sealed orders were opened and proved our destination to be the west indies as we expected we touched at madeira to take in some wine for the ships company but as we only remained one day we were not permitted to go on shore fortunate indeed would it have been if we had never gone there for the day after our captain who had dined with the consul was taken alarmingly ill from the symptoms the surgeon dreaded that he had been poisoned by something which he had eaten and which most probably had been cooked in a copper vessel not properly tinned we were all very anxious that he should recover but on the contrary he appeared to grow worse and worse every day wasting away and dying as they say by inches at last he was put into his cot and never rose from it again this melancholy circumstance added to the knowledge that we were proceeding to an unhealthy climate caused a gloom throughout the ship and although the trade wind carried us along bounding over the bright blue seaalthough the weather was now warm yet not too warmalthough the sun rose in splendour and all was beautiful and cheering the state of the captains health was a check to all mirth every one trod the deck softly and spoke in a low voice that he might not be disturbed all were anxious to have the morning report of the surgeon and our conversation was generally upon the sickly climate the yellow fever of death and the palisades where they buried us swinburne the quartermaster was in my watch and as he had been long in the west indies i used to obtain all the information from him that i could the old fellow had a secret pleasure in frightening me as much as he could really mr simple you ax so many questions he would say as i accosted him while he was at his station at the conn i wish you wouldnt ax so many questions and make yourself uncomfortable steady sosteady it iswith regard to yellow jack as we calls the yellow fever its a devil incarnate thats sartainyoure well and able to take your allowance in the morning and dead as a herring fore night first comes a bit of a headacheyou goes to the doctor who bleeds you like a pigthen you go out of your sensesthen up comes the black vomit and then its all over with you and you go to the land crabs who pick your bones as clean and as white as a sea elephants tooth but there be one thing to be said in favour of yellow jack ater all you dies straight like a gentlemannot cribbled up like a snowfish chucked out on the ice of the river st lawrence with your knees up to your nose or your toes stuck into your armpits as does take place in some of your foreign complaints but straight quite straight and limber like a gentleman still jack is a little mischievous thats sartain in the euridiscy we had as fine a ships company as was ever piped aloftsteady starboard my man youre halfapint off your coursewe dropped our anchor in port royal and we thought that there was mischief brewing for thirtyeight sharks followed the ship into the harbour and played about us day and night i used to watch them during the night watch as their fins above water skimmed along leaving a trail of light behind them and the second night i said to the sentry abaft as i was looking at them smelling under the countersoldier says i them sharks are mustering under the orders of yellow jack and i no sooner mentioned yellow jack than the sharks gave a frisky plunge every one of them as much as to say yes so we are dn your eyes the soldier was so frightened that he would have fallen overboard if i hadnt caught him by the scruff of the neck for he was standing on the top of the taffrail as it was he dropped his musket over the stern which the sharks dashed at from every quarter making the sea look like fireand he had it charged to his wages l s i think however the fate of his musket gave him an idea of what would have happened to him if he had fallen in instead of it and he never got on the taffrail again steady portmind your helm smithyou can listen to my yarn all the same well mr simple yellow jack came sure enough first the purser was called to account for all his roguery we didnt care much about the land crabs eating him who had made so many poor dead men chew tobacco cheating their wives and relations or greenwich hospital as it might happen then went two of the middies just about your age mr simple they poor fellows went off in a sad hurry then went the masterand so it went on till at last we had no more nor sixty men left in the ship the captain died last and then yellow jack had filled his maw and left the rest of us alone as soon as the captain died all the sharks left the ship and we never saw any more of them such were the yarns told to me and the other midshipmen during the night watches and i can assure the reader that they gave us no small alarm every day that we worked our days work and found ourselves so much nearer to the islands did we feel as if we were so much nearer to our graves i once spoke to obrien about it and he laughed peter says he fear kills more people than the yellow fever or any other complaint in the west indies swinburne is an old rogue and only laughing at you the devils not half so black as hes paintednor the yellow fever half so yellow i presume we were now fast nearing the island of barbadoes the weather was beautiful the wind always fair the flying fish rose in shoals startled by the foaming seas which rolled away and roared from the bows as our swift frigate cleaved through the water the porpoises played about us in thousandsthe bonetas and dolphins at one time chased the flying fish and at others appeared to be delighted in keeping company with the rapid vessel everything was beautiful and we all should have been happy had it not been for the state of captain savage in the first place who daily became worse and worse and from the dread of the hell which we were about to enter through such a watery paradise mr falcon who was in command was grave and thoughtful he appeared indeed to be quite miserable at the chance which would insure his own promotion in every attention and every care that could be taken to insure quiet and afford relief to the captain he was unremitting the offence of making a noise was now with him a greater crime than drunkenness or even mutiny when within three days sail of barbadoes it fell almost calm and the captain became much worse and now for the first time did we behold the great white shark of the atlantic there are several kinds of sharks but the most dangerous are the great white shark and the ground shark the former grows to an enormous lengththe latter is seldom very long not more than twelve feet but spreads to a great breadth we could not hook the sharks as they played around us for mr falcon would not permit it lest the noise of hauling them on board should disturb the captain a breeze again sprang up in two days we were close to the island and the men were desired to look out for the land chapter xxx death of captain savagehis funeralspecimen of true barbadian born sucking the monkeyeffects of a hurricane the next morning having hoveto part of the night land was discovered on the bow and was reported by the masthead man at the same moment that the surgeon came up and announced the death of our noble captain although it had been expected for the last two or three days the intelligence created a heavy gloom throughout the ship the men worked in silence and spoke to one another in whispers mr falcon was deeply affected and so were we all in the course of the morning we ran in to the island and unhappy as i was i never can forget the sensation of admiration which i felt on closing with needham point to enter carlisle bay the beach of such a pure dazzling white backed by the tall green cocoanut trees waving their spreading heads to the fresh breeze the dark blue of the sky and the deeper blue of the transparent sea occasionally varied into green as we passed by the coral rocks which threw their branches out from the bottomthe town opening to our view by degrees houses after houses so neat with their green jalousies dotting the landscape the fort with the colours flying troops of officers riding down a busy population of all colours relieved by the whiteness of their dress altogether the scene realised my first ideas of fairyland for i thought i had never witnessed anything so beautiful and can this be such a dreadful place as it is described thought i the sails were clewed up the anchor was dropped to the bottom and a salute from the ship answered by the forts added to the effect of the scene the sails were furled the boats lowered down the boatswain squared the yards from the jollyboat ahead mr falcon dressed and his boat being manned went on shore with the despatches then as soon as the work was over a new scene of delight presented itself to the sight of midshipmen who had been so long upon his majestys allowance these were the boats which crowded round the ship loaded with baskets of bananas oranges shaddocks soursops and every other kind of tropical fruit fried flying fish eggs fowls milk and everything which could tempt a poor boy after a long sea voyage the watch being called down we all hastened into the boats and returned loaded with treasures which we soon contrived to make disappear after stowing away as much fruit as would have sufficed for a dessert to a dinner given to twenty people in england i returned on deck there was no other manofwar in the bay but my attention was directed to a beautiful little vessel a schooner whose fairy form contrasted strongly with a west india trader which lay close to her all of a sudden as i was looking at her beautiful outline a yell rose from her which quite startled me and immediately afterwards her deck was covered with nearly two hundred naked figures with woolly heads chattering and grinning at each other she was a spanish slaver which had been captured and had arrived the evening before the slaves were still on board waiting the orders of the governor they had been on deck about ten minutes when three or four men with large panama straw hats on their heads and long rattans in their hands jumped upon the gunnel and in a few seconds drove them all down below i then turned round and observed a black woman who had just climbed up the side of the frigate obrien was on deck and she walked up to him in the most consequential manner how do you do sar very happy you com back again said she to obrien im very well i thank you maam replied obrien and i hope to go back the same but never having put my foot into this bay before you have the advantage of me nebber here before so help me gad me tink i know youme tink i recollect your handsome facei lady rodney sar ah piccaninny buccra how you do said she turning round to me me hope to hab the honour to wash for you sar courtesying to obrien what do you charge in this place all the same price one bit a piece what do you call a bit inquired i a bit lilly massawhat you call um bit dem four sharp shins to a pictareen our deck was now enlivened by several army officers besides gentlemen residents who came off to hear the news invitations to the mess and to the houses of the gentlemen followed and as they departed mr falcon returned on board he told obrien and the other officers that the admiral and squadron were expected in a few days and that we were to remain in carlisle bay and refit immediately but although the fright about the yellow fever had considerably subsided in our breasts the remembrance that our poor captain was lying dead in the cabin was constantly obtruding all that night the carpenters were up making up his coffin for he was to be buried the next day the body is never allowed to remain many hours unburied in the tropical climates where putrefaction is so rapid the following morning the men were up at daylight washing the decks and putting the ship in order they worked willingly and yet with a silent decorum which showed what their feelings were never were the decks better cleaned never were the ropes more carefully flemished down the hammocks were stowed in their white cloths the yards carefully squared and the ropes hauled taut at eight oclock the colours and pennant were hoisted halfmast high the men were then ordered down to breakfast and to clean themselves during the time that the men were at breakfast all the officers went into the cabin to take a last farewell look at our gallant captain he appeared to have died without pain and there was a beautiful tranquillity in his face but even already a change had taken place and we perceived the necessity of his being buried so soon we saw him placed in his coffin and then quitted the cabin without speaking to each other when the coffin was nailed down it was brought up by the barges crew to the quarterdeck and laid upon the gratings amidships covered over with the union jack the men came up from below without waiting for the pipe and a solemnity appeared to pervade every motion order and quiet were universal out of respect to the deceased when the boats were ordered to be manned the men almost appeared to steal into them the barge received the coffin which was placed in the stern sheets the other boats then hauled up and received the officers marines and sailors who were to follow the procession when all was ready the barge was shoved off by the bowmen the crew dropped their oars into the water without a splash and pulled the minute stroke the other boats followed and as soon as they were clear of the ship the minute guns boomed along the smooth surface of the bay from the opposite side of the ship while the yards were topped to starboard and to port the ropes were slackened and hung in bights so as to give the idea of distress and neglect at the same time a dozen or more of the men who had been ready dropped over the sides of the ship in differents sic parts and with their cans of paint and brushes in a few minutes effaced the whole of the broad white riband which marked the beautiful run of the frigate and left her all black and in deep mourning the guns from the forts now responded to our own the merchant ships lowered their colours and the men stood up respectfully with their hats off as the procession moved slowly to the landingplace the coffin was borne to the burialground by the crew of the barge followed by mr falcon as chief mourner all the officers of the ship who could be spared one hundred of the seamen walking two and two and the marines with their arms reversed the cortege was joined by the army officers while the troops lined the streets and the bands played the dead march the service was read the volleys were fired over the grave and with oppressed feelings we returned to the boats and pulled on board it then appeared to me and to a certain degree i was correct that as soon as we had paid our last respect to his remains we had also forgotten our grief the yards were again squared the ropes hauled taut working dresses resumed and all was activity and bustle the fact is that sailors and soldiers have no time for lamentation and running as they do from clime to clime so does scene follow scene in the same variety and quickness in a day or two the captain appeared to be although he was not forgotten our first business was to water the ship by rafting and towing off the casks i was in charge of the boat again with swinburne as coxswain as we pulled in there were a number of negroes bathing in the surf bobbing their woolly heads under it as it rolled into the beach now mr simple said swinburne see how ill make them niggers scamper he then stood up in the stern sheets and pointing with his finger roared out a shark a shark away started all the bathers for the beach puffing and blowing from their dreaded enemy nor did they stop to look for him until they were high and dry out of his reach then when we all laughed they called us all the hangman tiefs and every other opprobrious name which they could select from their vocabulary i was very much amused with this scene and as much afterwards with the negroes who crowded round us when we landed they appeared such merry fellows always laughing chattering singing and showing their white teeth one fellow danced round us snapping his fingers and singing songs without beginning or end eh massa what you say now me no slavetrue barbadian born sir eh nebba see de day dat rodney run away nebba see um night dat rodney cannot fight massa me free man sar suppose you give me pictareen drink massa health nebba see de day boy pompey lickum de caesar eh and you nebba see de day dat de grasshopper run on de warrington out

negro who continued close to me notwithstanding swinburnes stick eh call him sam slack massa he ab um tic tic fit and such was apparently the case stop me cure him and he snatched the stick out of swinburnes hand and running up to the man who continued to roll on the beach commenced belabouring him without mercy eh sambo cried he at last quite out of breath you no better yettry again he recommenced until at last the man got up and ran away as fast as he could now whether the man was shamming or whether it was real tic tic or epileptic fit i know not but i never heard of such a cure for it before i threw the fellow half a pictareen as much for the amusement he had afforded me as to get rid of him tanky massa now manofwar man here de tick for you again to keep off all the dam niggers so saying he handed the stick to swinburne made a polite bow and departed we were however soon surrounded by others particularly some dingy ladies with baskets of fruit and who as they said sell ebery ting i perceived that my sailors were very fond of cocoanut milk which being a harmless beverage i did not object to their purchasing from these ladies who had chiefly cocoanuts in their baskets as i had never tasted it i asked them what it was and bought a cocoanut i selected the largest no massa dat not good for you better one for buccra officer i then selected another but the same objection was made no massa dis very fine milk very good for de tomac i drank off the milk from the holes on the top of the cocoanut and found it very refreshing as for the sailors they appeared very fond of it indeed but i very soon found that if good for de tomac it was not very good for the head as my men instead of rolling the casks began to roll themselves in all directions and when it was time to go off to dinner most of them were dead drunk at the bottom of the boat they insisted that it was the sun which affected them very hot it certainly was and i believed them at first when they were only giddy but i was convinced to the contrary when i found that they became insensible yet how they had procured the liquor was to me a mystery when i came on board mr falcon who although acting captain continued his duties as first lieutenant almost as punctually as before asked how it was that i had allowed my men to get so tipsy i assured him that i could not tell that i had never allowed one to leave the wateringplace or to buy any liquor the only thing that they had to drink was a little cocoanut milk which as it was so very hot i thought there could be no objection to mr falcon smiled and said mr simple im an old stager in the west indies and ill let you into a secret do you know what sucking the monkey means no sir well then ill tell you it is a term used among seamen for drinking rum out of cocoanuts the milk having been poured out and the liquor substituted now do you comprehend why your men are tipsy i stared with all my eyes for it never would have entered into my head and i then perceived why it was that the black woman would not give me the first cocoanuts which i selected i told mr falcon of this circumstance who replied well it was not your fault only you must not forget it another time it was my first watch that night and swinburne was quartermaster on deck swinburne said i you have often been in the west indies before why did you not tell me that the men were sucking the monkey when i thought that they were only drinking cocoanut milk swinburne chuckled and answered why mr simple dye see it didnt become me as a shipmate to peach its but seldom that a poor fellow has an opportunity of making himself a little happy and it would not be fair to take away the chance i suppose youll never let them have cocoanut milk again no that i will not but i cannot imagine what pleasure they can find in getting so tipsy its merely because they are not allowed to be so sir thats the whole story in few words well i think i could cure them if i were permitted to try i should like to hear how youd manage that mr simple why i would oblige a man to drink off a half pint of liquor and then put him by himself i would not allow him companions to make merry with so as to make a pleasure of intoxication i would then wait until next morning when he was sober and leave him alone with a racking headache until the evening when i would give him another dose and so on forcing him to get drunk until he hated the smell of liquor well mr simple it might do with some but many of our chaps would require the dose you mention to be repeated pretty often before it would effect a cure and whats more theyd be very willing patients and make no wry faces at their physic well that might be but it would cure them at last but tell me swinburne were you ever in a hurricane ive been in everything mr simple i believe except at school and i never had no time to go there do you see that battery at needham point well in the hurricane of them same guns were whirled away by the wind right over to this point here on the opposite side the sentries in their sentryboxes after them some of the soldiers who faced the wind had their teeth blown down their throats like broken baccypipes others had their heads turned round like dog vanes cause they waited for orders to the right about face and the whole air was full of young niggers blowing about like peelings of ingons you dont suppose i believe all this swinburne thats as may be mr simple but ive told the story so often that i believe it myself what ship were you in in the blanche captain faulkner who was as fine a fellow as poor captain savage whom we buried yesterday there could not be a finer than either of them i was at the taking of the pique and carried him down below after he had received his mortal wound we did a pretty thing out here when we took fort royal by a coupdemain which means boarding from the mainyard of the frigate and dropping from it into the fort but whats that under the moontheres a sail in the offing swinburne fetched the glass and directed it to the spot one two three four its the admiral sir and the squadron hoveto for the night ones a lineofbattle ship ill swear i examined the vessels and agreeing with swinburne reported them to mr falcon my watch was then over and as soon as i was released i went to my hammock end of vol i turnbull and spears

at daylight we exchanged numbers and saluted the flag and by eight oclock they all anchored mr falcon went on board the admirals ship with despatches and to report the death of captain savage in about half an hour he returned and we were glad to perceive with a smile upon his face from which we argued that he would receive his acting order as commander which was a question of some doubt as the admiral had the power to give the vacancy to whom he pleased although it would not have been fair if he had not given it to mr falcon not that mr falcon would not have received his commission as captain savage dying when the ship was under no admirals command he made himself but still the admiral might have sent him home and not have given him a ship but this he did the captain of the minerve being appointed to the sanglier the captain of the opossum to the minerve and captain falcon taking command of the opossum he received his commission that evening and the next day the exchanges were made captain falcon would have taken me with him and offered so to do but i could not leave obrien so i preferred remaining in the sanglier we were all anxious to know what sort of a person our new captain was whose name was kearney but we had no time to ask the midshipmen except when they came in charge of the boats which brought his luggage they replied generally that he was a very good sort of fellow and there was no harm in him but when i had the night watch with swinburne he came up to me and said well mr simple so we have a new captain i sailed with him for two years in a brig and pray swinburne what sort of a person is he why ill tell you mr simple hes a goodtempered kind fellow enough but but what such a bouncer how do you mean hes not a very stout man bless you mr simple why you dont understand english i mean that hes the greatest liar that ever walked a deck now mr simple you know i can spin a yarn occasionally yes that you can witness the hurricane the other night well mr simple i cannot hold a candle to him it ant that i might not stretch now and then just for fun as far as he can but dn it hes always on the stretch in fact mr simple he never tells the truth except by mistake hes as poor as a rat and has nothing but his pay yet to believe him he is worth at least as much as greenwich hospital but youll soon find him out and hell sarve to laugh at behind his back you know mr simple for thats no go before his face captain kearney made his appearance on board the next day the men were mustered to receive him and all the officers were on the quarterdeck youve a fine set of marines here captain falcon observed he those i left on board of the minerve were only fit to be hung and you have a good show of reefers toothose i left in the minerve were not worth hanging if you please ill read my commission if youll order the men aft his commission was read all hands with their hats off from respect to the authority from which it proceeded now my lads said captain kearney addressing the ships company ive but few words to say to you i am appointed to command this ship and you appear to have a very good character from your late first lieutenant all i request of you is this be smart keep sober and always tell the truththats enough pipe down gentlemen continued he addressing the officers i trust that we shall be good friends and i see no reason that it should be otherwise he then turned away with a bow and called his coxswainwilliams youll go on board and tell my steward that i have promised to dine with the governor today and that he must come to dress me and coxswain recollect to put the sheepskin mat on the stern gratings of my gignot the one i used to have when i was on shore in my carriage but the blue one which was used for the chariotyou know which i mean i happened to look swinburne in the face who cocked his eye at me as much as to saythere he goes we afterwards met the officers of the minerve who corroborated all that swinburne had said although it was quite unnecessary as we had the captains own words every minute to satisfy us of the fact dinner parties were now very numerous and the hospitality of the island is but too well known the invitations extended to the midshipmen and many was the good dinner and kind reception which i had during my stay there was however one thing i had heard so much of that i was anxious to witness it which was a dignity ball but i must enter a little into explanation or my readers will not understand me the coloured people of barbadoes for reasons best known to themselves are immoderately proud and look upon all the negroes who are born on other islands as niggers they have also an extraordinary idea of their own bravery although i never heard that it has ever been put to the proof the free barbadians are most of them very rich and hold up their heads as they walk with an air quite ridiculous they ape the manners of the europeans at the same time that they appear to consider them as almost their inferiors now a dignity ball is a ball given by the most consequential of their coloured people and from the amusement and various other reasons is generally well attended by the officers both on shore and afloat the price of the tickets of admission was highi think they were half a joe or eight dollars each the governor sent out cards for a grand ball and supper for the ensuing week and miss betsy austin a quadroon woman ascertaining the fact sent out her cards for the same evening this was not altogether in rivalry but for another reason which was that she was aware that most of the officers and midshipmen of the ships would obtain permission to go to the governors ball and preferring hers would slip away and join the party by which means she ensured a full attendance on the day of invitation our captain came on board and told our new first lieutenant of whom i shall say more hereafter that the governor insisted that all his officers should gothat he would take no denial and therefore he presumed go they must that the fact was that the governor was a relation of his wife and under some trifling obligations to him in obtaining for him his present command he certainly had spoken to the prime minister and he thought it not impossible considering the intimate terms which the minister and he had been on from childhood that his solicitation might have had some effect at all events it was pleasant to find that there was some little gratitude left in this world after this of course every officer went with the exception of the master who said that hed as soon have two round turns in his hawse as go to see people kick their legs about like fools and that hed take care of the ship the governors ball was very splendid but the ladies were rather sallow from the effects of the climate however there were exceptions and on the whole it was a very gay affair but we were all anxious to go to the dignity ball of miss betsy austin i slipped away with three other midshipmen and we soon arrived there a crowd of negroes were outside of the house but the ball had not yet commenced from the want of gentlemen the ball being very correct nothing under mulatto in colour being admitted perhaps i ought to say here that the progeny of a white and a negro is a mulatto or half and halfof a white and mulatto a quadroon or onequarter black and of this class the company were chiefly composed i believe a quadroon and white make the mustee or oneeighth black and the mustee and white the mustafina or onesixteenth black after that they are whitewashed and considered as europeans the pride of colour is very great in the west indies and they have as many quarterings as a german prince in his coat of arms a quadroon looks down upon a mulatto while a mulatto looks down upon a sambo that is half mulatto half negro while a sambo in his turn looks down upon a nigger the quadroons are certainly the handsomest race of the whole some of the women are really beautiful their hair is long and perfectly straight their eyes large and black their figures perfection and you can see the colour mantle in their cheeks quite as plainly and with as much effect as in those of a european we found the door of miss austins house open and ornamented with orange branches and on our presenting ourselves were accosted by a mulatto gentleman who was we presumed usher of the black rod his head was well powdered he was dressed in white jean trousers a waistcoat not six inches long and a halfworn postcaptains coat on as a livery with a low bow he took de liberty to trouble de gentlemen for de card for de ball which being produced we were ushered on by him to the ballroom at the door of which miss austin was waiting to receive her company she made us a low courtesy observing she really happy to see de gentlemen of de ship but hoped to see de officers also at her dignity this remark touched our dignity and one of my companions replied that we midshipmen considered ourselves officers and no small ones either and that if she waited for the lieutenants she must wait until they were tired of the governors ball we having given the preference to hers this remark set all to rights sangaree was handed about and i looked around at the company i must acknowledge at the risk of losing the good opinion of my fair countrywomen that i never saw before so many pretty figures and faces the officers not having yet arrived we received all the attention and i was successively presented to miss eurydice miss minerva miss sylvia miss aspasia miss euterpe and many others evidently borrowed from the different menofwar which had been on the station all these young ladies gave themselves all the airs of almacks their dresses i cannot pretend to describejewels of value were not wanting but their drapery was slight they appeared neither to wear nor to require stays and on the whole their figures were so perfect that they could only be ill dressed by having on too much dress a few more midshipmen and some lieutenants obrien among the number having made their appearance miss austin directed that the ball should commence i requested the honour of miss eurydices hand in a cotillon which was to open the ball at this moment stepped forth the premier violin master of the ceremonies and balletmaster massa johnson really a very smart man who gave lessons in dancing to all the badian ladies he was a dark quadroon his hair slightly powdered dressed in a light blue coat thrown well back to show his lilywhite waistcoat only one button of which he could afford to button to make full room for the pride of his heart the frill of his shirt which really was un jabot superb four inches wide and extending from his collar to the waistband of his nankeen tights which were finished off at his knees with huge bunches of ribbon his legs were encased in silk stockings which however was not very good taste on his part as they showed the manifest advantage which an european has over a coloured man in the formation of the leg instead of being straight his shins curved like a cheeseknife and moreover his leg was planted into his foot like the handle into a broom or scrubbingbrush there being quite as much of the foot on the heel side as on the toe side such was the appearance of mr apollo johnson whom the ladies considered as the ne plus ultra of fashion and the arbiter elegantiarum his bowtick or fiddlestick was his wand whose magic rap on the fiddle produced immediate obedience to his mandates ladies and gentle take your seats all started up miss eurydice you open de ball miss eurydice had but a sorry partner but she undertook to instruct me obrien was our visavis with miss euterpe the other gentlemen were officers from the ships and we stood up twelve checkered brown and white like a chessboard all eyes were fixed upon mr apollo johnson who first looked at the couples then at his fiddle and lastly at the other musicians to see if all was right and then with a wave of his bowtick the music began massa lieutenant cried apollo to obrien cross over to opposite lady right hand and left den figure to miss eurydicedat right now four hand round you lilly midshipman set your partner sir den twist her round dat do now stop first figure all over at this time i thought i might venture to talk a little with my partner and i ventured a remark to my surprise she answered very sharply i come here for dance sar and not for chatter look massa johnson he tap um bowtick the second figure commenced and i made a sad bungle so i did of the third and fourth and fifth for i never had danced a cotillon when i handed my partner to her place who certainly was the prettiest girl in the room she looked rather contemptuously at me and observed to a neighbour i really pity de gentleman as come from england dat no know how to dance nor nothing at all until em hab instruction at barbadoes a country dance was now called for which was more acceptable to all parties as none of mr apollo johnsons pupils were very perfect in their cotillon and none of the officers except obrien knew anything about them obriens superior education on this point added to his lieutenants epaulet and handsome person made him much courted but he took up with miss eurydice after i had left her and remained with her the whole evening thereby exciting the jealousy of mr apollo johnson who it appears was amorous in that direction our party increased every minute all the officers of the garrison and finally as soon as they could get away the governors aiddecamps all dressed in mufti ie plain clothes the dancing continued until three oclock in the morning when it was quite a squeeze from the constant arrival of fresh recruits from all the houses of barbadoes i must say that a few bottles of eau de cologne thrown about the room would have improved the atmosphere by this time the heat was terrible and the mopping of the ladies faces everlasting i would recommend a dignity ball to all stout gentlemen who wish to be reduced a stone or two supper was now announced and having danced the last country dance with miss minerva i of course had the pleasure of handing her into the supperroom it was my fate to sit opposite to a fine turkey and i asked my partner if i should have the pleasure of helping her to a piece of the breast she looked at me very indignantly and said curse your impudence sar i wonder where you larn manners sar i take a lilly turkey bosom if you please talk of breast to a lady sarreally quite horrid i made two or three more barbarous mistakes before the supper was finished at last the eating was over and i must say a better supper i never sat down to silence gentlemen and ladies cried mr apollo johnson wid the permission of our amiable hostess i will propose a toast gentlemen and ladiesyou all know and if be so you dont i say that there no place in the world like barbadoes all de world fight against england but england nebber fear king george nebber fear while barbadoes tand tiff badian fight for king george to last drop of him blood nebber see the day badian run away you all know dem frenchmans at san lucee give up morne fortunee when he hear de badian volunteer come against him i hope no fence present company but um sorry to say english come here too jealous of badians gentlemen and ladybarbadian born ab only one faulthe really too brave i propose health of island of barbadoes acclamations from all quarters followed this truly modest speech and the toast was drunk with rapture the ladies were delighted with mr apollos eloquence and the lead which he took in the company obrien then rose and addressed the company as follows ladies and gentlemenmr poll has spoken better than the best parrot i ever met with in this country but as he has thought proper to drink the island of barbadoes i mean to be a little more particular i wish with him all good health to the island but there is a charm without which the island would be a desertthat is the society of the lovely girls which now surround us and take our hearts by storm here obrien put his arm gently round miss eurydices waist and mr apollo ground his teeth so as to be heard at the furthest end of the room therefore gentlemen with your permission i will propose the health of the badian ladies this speech of obriens was declared by the females at least to be infinitely superior to mr apollo johnsons miss eurydice was even more gracious and the other ladies were more envious many other toasts and much more wine was drunk until the male part of the company appeared to be rather riotous mr apollo however had to regain his superiority and after some hems and hahs begged permission to give a sentiment gentlemen and ladies i beg then to say heres to de cock who make lub to de hen crow till he hoarse and make lub again this sentiment was received with rapture and after silence was obtained miss betsy austin rose and saidunaccustomed as she was to public peaking she must not sit till and not tank de gentleman for his very fine toast and in de name of de ladies she begged to propose another sentimen which was here to de hen what nebber refuses let cock pay compliment whenebber he chooses if the first toast was received with applause this was with enthusiasm but we received a damper after it was subsided by the lady of the house getting up and sayingnow gentlemen and ladies me tink it right to say dat it time to go home i nebber allow people get drunk or kick up bobbery in my house so now i tink we better take partingglass and very much obliged to you for your company as obrien said this was a broad hint to be off so we all now took our partingglass in compliance with her request and our own wishes and proceeded to escort our partners on their way home while i was assisting miss minerva to her red crape shawl a storm was brewing in another quarter to wit between mr apollo johnson and obrien obrien was assiduously attending to miss eurydice whispering what he called soft blarney in her ear when mr apollo who was above spiritboiling heat with jealousy came up and told miss eurydice that he would have the honour of escorting her home you may save yourself the trouble you dingy gutscraper replied obrien the lady is under my protection so take your ugly black face out of the way or ill show you how i treat a badian who is really too brave so elp me gad massa lieutenant pose you put finger on me i show you what badian can do apollo then attempted to insert himself between obrien and his lady upon which obrien shoved him back with great violence and continued his course towards the door they were in the passage when i came up for hearing obriens voice in anger i left miss minerva to shift for herself miss eurydice had now left obriens arm at his request and he and mr apollo were standing in the passage obrien close to the door which was shut and apollo swaggering up to him obrien who knew the tender part of a black saluted apollo with a kick on the shins which would have broken my leg massa johnson roared with pain and recoiled two or three paces parting the crowd away behind him the blacks never fight with fists but butt with their heads like rams and with quite as much force when mr apollo had retreated he gave his shin one more rub uttered a loud yell and started at obrien with his head aimed at obriens chest like a batteringram obrien who was aware of this plan of fighting stepped dexterously on one side and allowed mr apollo to pass by him which he did with such force that his head went clean through the panel of the door behind obrien and there he stuck as fast as if in a pillory squeaking like a pig for assistance and foaming with rage after some difficulty he was released and presented a very melancholy figure his face was much cut and his superb jabot all in tatters he appeared however to have had quite enough of it as he retreated to the supperroom followed by some of his admirers without asking or looking after obrien but if mr apollo had had enough of it his friends were too indignant to allow us to go off scot free a large mob was collected in the street vowing vengeance on us for our treatment of their flash man and a row was to be expected miss eurydice had escaped so that obrien had his hands free cam out you hangman tiefs cam out only wish had rock stones to mash your heads with cried the mob of negroes the officers now sallied out in a body and were saluted with every variety of missile such as rotten oranges cabbagestalks mud and cocoanut shells we fought our way manfully but as we neared the beach the mob increased to hundreds and at last we could proceed no further being completely jammed up by the niggers upon whose heads we could make no more impression than upon blocks of marble we must draw our swords observed an officer no no replied obrien that will not do if once we shed blood they will never let us get on board with our lives the boats crew by this time must be aware that there is a row obrien was right he had hardly spoken before a lane was observed to be made through the crowd in the distance which in two minutes was open to us swinburne appeared in the middle of it followed by the rest of the boats crew armed with the boats stretchers which they did not aim at the heads of the blacks but swept them like scythes against their shins this they continued to do right and left of us as we walked through and went down to the boats the seamen closing up the rear with their stretchers with which they ever and anon made a sweep at the black fellows if they approached too near it was now broad daylight and in a few minutes we were again safely on board the frigate thus ended the first and last dignity ball that i attended chapter xxxii i am claimed by captain kearney as a relationtrial of skill between first lieutenant and captain with the long bowthe shark the pugdog and the willa quarterdeck picture as the admiral was not one who would permit the ships under his command to lie idle in port in a very few days after the dignity ball which i have described all the squadron sailed on their various destinations i was not sorry to leave the bay for one soon becomes tired of profusion and cared nothing for either oranges bananas or shaddocks nor even for the good dinners and claret at the tables of the army mess and gentlemen of the island the sea breeze soon became more precious to us than anything else and if we could have bathed without the fear of a shark we should have equally appreciated that most refreshing of all luxuries under the torrid zone it was therefore with pleasure that we received the information that we were to sail the next day to cruise off the french island of martinique captain kearney had been so much on shore that we saw but little of him and the ship was entirely under the control of the first lieutenant of whom i have hitherto not spoken he was a very short pockmarked man with red hair and whiskers a good sailor and not a bad officer that is he was a practical sailor and could show any foremast man his duty in any departmentand this seamen very much appreciate as it is not very common but i never yet knew an officer who prided himself upon his practical knowledge who was at the same time a good navigator and too often by assuming the jack tar they lower the respect due to them and become coarse and vulgar in their manners and language this was the case with mr phillott who prided himself upon his slang and who was at one time hail fellow well met with the seamen talking to them and being answered as familiarly as if they were equals and at another knocking the very same men down with a handspike if he was displeased he was not badtempered but very hasty and his language to the officers was occasionally very incorrect to the midshipmen invariably so however on the whole he was not disliked although he was certainly not respected as a first lieutenant should have been it is but fair to say that he was the same to his superiors as he was to his inferiors and the bluntness with which he used to contradict and assert his disbelief of captain kearneys narratives often produced a coolness between them for some days the day after we sailed from carlisle bay i was asked to dine in the cabin the dinner was served upon plated dishes which looked very grand but there was not much in them this plate observed the captain was presented to me by some merchants for my exertions in saving their property from the danes when i was cruising off heligoland why that lying steward of yours told me that you bought it at portsmouth replied the first lieutenant i asked him in the galley this morning how came you to assert such a confounded falsehood sir said the captain to the man who stood behind his chair i only said that i thought so replied the steward why didnt you say that the bill had been sent in through you seven or eight times and that the captain had paid it with a flowing sheet did you dare say that sir interrogated the captain very angrily mr phillott mistook me sir replied the steward he was so busy damning the sweepers that he did not hear me right i said the midshipmen had paid their crockery bill with the foretopsail ay ay replied the captain thats much more likely well mr steward replied mr phillott ill be dd if you arnt as big a liar as your master he was going to plump out but fortunately the first lieutenant checked himself and addedas your father was before you the captain changed the conversation by asking me whether i would take a slice of ham its real westphalia mr simple i have them sent me direct by count troningsken an intimate friend of mine who kills his own wild boars in the hartz mountains how the devil do you get them over captain kearney there are ways and means of doing everything mr phillott and the first consul is not quite so bad as he is represented the first batch was sent over with a very handsome letter to me written in his own hand which i will show you some of these days i wrote to him in return and sent to him two cheshire cheeses by a smuggler and since that they came regularly did you ever eat westphalia ham mr simple yes replied i once i partook of one at lord privileges lord privilege why hes a distant relation of mine a sort of fifth cousin replied captain kearney indeed sir replied i then you must allow me to introduce you to a relation captain kearney said the first lieutenant for mr simple is his grandson is it possible i can only say mr simple that i shall be most happy to show you every attention and am very glad that i have you as one of my officers now although this was all false for captain kearney was not in the remotest manner connected with my family yet having once asserted it he could not retract and the consequence was that i was much the gainer by his falsehood as he treated me very kindly afterwards always calling me cousin the first lieutenant smiled and gave me a wink when the captain had finished his speech to me as much as to say youre in luck and then the conversation changed captain kearney certainly dealt in the marvellous to admiration and really told his stories with such earnestness that i actually believe that he thought he was telling the truth never was there such an instance of confirmed habit telling a story of a cuttingout expedition he said the french captain would have fallen by my hand but just as i levelled my musket a ball came and cut off the cock of the lock as clean as if it was done with a knifea very remarkable instance observed he not equal to what occurred in a ship i was in replied the first lieutenant when the second lieutenant was grazed by a grapeshot which cut off one of his whiskers and turning round his head to ascertain what was the matter another grapeshot came and took off the other now thats what i call a close shave yes replied captain kearney very close indeed if it were true but youll excuse me mr phillott but you sometimes tell strange stories i do not mind it myself but the example is not good to my young relation here mr simple captain kearney replied the first lieutenant laughing very immoderately do you know what the pot called the kettle no sir i do not retorted the captain with offended dignity mr simple will you take a glass of wine i thought that this little brouillerie would have checked the captain it did so but only for a few minutes when he again commenced the first lieutenant observed that it would be necessary to let water into the ship every morning and pump it out to avoid the smell of the bilgewater there are worse smells than bilgewater replied the captain what do you think of a whole ships company being nearly poisoned with otto of roses yet that occurred to me when in the mediterranean i was off smyrna cruising for a french ship that was to sail to france with a pasha on board as an ambassador i knew she would be a good prize and was looking sharp out when one morning we discovered her on the lee bow we made all sail but she walked away from us bearing away gradually till we were both before the wind and at night we lost sight of her as i knew that she was bound to marseilles i made all sail to fall in with her again the wind was light and variable but five days afterwards as i lay in my cot just before daylight i smelt a very strong smell blowing in at the weather port and coming down the skylight which was open and after sniffing at it two or three times i knew it to be otto of roses i sent for the officer of the watch and asked him if there was anything in sight he replied that there was not and i ordered him to sweep the horizon with his glass and look well out to windward as the wind freshened the smell became more powerful i ordered him to get the royal yards across and all ready to make sail for i knew that the turk must be near us at daylight there he was just three miles ahead in the winds eye but although he beat us going free he was no match for us on a wind and before noon we had possession of him and all his harem bytheby i could tell you a good story about the ladies she was a very valuable prize and among other things she had a puncheon of otto of roses on board whew cried the first lieutenant what a whole puncheon yes replied the captain a turkish puncheonnot quite so large perhaps as ours on board their weights and measures are different i took out most of the valuables into the brig i commandedabout sequinscarpetsand among the rest this cask of otto of roses which we had smelt three miles off we had it safe on board when the mate of the hold not slinging it properly it fell into the spiritroom with a run and was stove to pieces never was such a scene my first lieutenant and several men on deck fainted and the men in the hold were brought up lifeless it was some time before they were recovered we let the water into the brig and pumped it out but nothing would take away the smell which was so overpowering that before i could get to malta i had forty men on the sick list when i arrived there i turned the mate out of the service for his carelessness it was not until after having smoked the brig and finding that of little use after having sunk her for three weeks that the smell was at all bearable but even then it could never be eradicated and the admiral sent the brig home and she was sold out of the service they could do nothing with her at the dockyards she was broken up and bought by the people at brighton and tunbridge wells who used her timbers for turning fancy articles which smelling as they did so strongly of otto of roses proved very profitable were you ever at brighton mr simple never sir just at this moment the officer of the watch came down to say that there was a very large shark under the counter and wished to know if the captain had any objection to the officers attempting to catch it by no means replied captain kearney i hate sharks as i do the devil i nearly lost l by one when i was in the mediterranean may i inquire how captain kearney said the first lieutenant with a demure face im very anxious to know why the story is simply this replied the captain i had an old relation at malta whom i found out by accidentan old maid of sixty who had lived all her life on the island it was by mere accident that i knew of her existence i was walking upon strada reale when i saw a large baboon that was kept there who had a little fat pugdog by the tail which he was pulling away with him while an old lady was screaming out for help for whenever she ran to assist her dog the baboon made at her as if he would have ravished her and caught her by the petticoats with one hand while he held the pugdog fast by the other i owed that brute a spite for having attacked me one night when i passed him and perceiving what was going on i drew my sword and gave mr jacko such a clip as sent him away howling and bleeding like a pig leaving me in possession of the little pug which i took up and handed to his mistress the old lady trembled very much and begged me to see her safe home she had a very fine house and after she was seated on the sofa thanked me very much for my gallant assistance as she termed it and told me her name was kearney upon this i very soon proved my relationship with her at which she was much delighted requesting me to consider her house as my home i was for two years afterwards on that station and played my cards very well and the old lady gave me a hint that i should be her heir as she had no other relations that she knew anything of at last i was ordered home and not wishing to leave her i begged her to accompany me offering her my cabin she was taken very ill a fortnight before we sailed and made a will leaving me her sole heir but she recovered and got as fat as ever mr simple the wine stands with you i doubt if lord privilege gave you better claret than there is in that bottle i imported it myself ten years ago when i commanded the coquette very odd observed the first lieutenantwe bought some at barbadoes with the same mark on the bottles and cork that may be replied the captain oldestablished houses all keep up the same marks but i doubt if your wine can be compared to this as mr phillott wished to hear the end of the captains story he would not contradict him this time by stating what he knew to be the case that the captain had sent it on board at barbadoes and the captain proceeded well i gave up my cabin to the old lady and hung up my cot in the gunroom during the passage home we were becalmed abreast of ceuta for two days the old lady was very particular about her pugdog and i superintended the washing of the little brute twice a week but at last i was tired of it and gave him to my coxswain to bathe my coxswain who was a lazy fellow without my knowledge used to put the little beast into the bight of a rope and tow him overboard for a minute or so it was during this calm that he had him overboard in this way when a confounded shark rose from under the counter and took in the pugdog at one mouthful the coxswain reported the loss as a thing of no consequence but i knew better and put the fellow in irons i then went down and broke the melancholy fact to miss kearney stating that i had put the man in irons and would flog him well the old lady broke out into a most violent passion at the intelligence declared that it was my fault that i was jealous of the dog and had done it on purpose the more i protested the more she raved and at last i was obliged to go on deck to avoid her abuse and keep my temper i had not been on deck five minutes before she came up that is was shoved upfor she was so heavy that she could not get up without assistance you know how elephants in india push the cannon through a morass with their heads from behind well my steward used to shove her up the companionladder just in the same way with his head completely buried in her petticoats as soon as she was up he used to pull his head out looking as red and hot as a freshboiled lobster well up she came with her will in her hand and looking at me very fiercely she said since the shark has taken my dear dog he may have my will also and throwing it overboard she plumped down on the carronade slide its very well madam said i but youll be cool byandby and then youll make another will i swear by all the hopes that i have of going to heaven that i never will she replied yes you will madam replied i never so help me god captain kearney my money may now go to my next heir and that you know will not be you now as i knew very well that the old lady was very positive and as good as her word my object was to recover the will which was floating about fifty yards astern without her knowledge i thought a moment and then i called the boatswains mate to pipe all hands to bathe youll excuse me miss kearney said i but the men are going to bathe and i do not think you would like to see them all naked if you would you can stay on deck she looked daggers at me and rising from the carronade slide hobbled to the ladder saying that the insult was another proof of how little i deserved any kindness from her as soon as she was below the quarterboats were lowered down and i went in one of them and picked up the will which still floated brigs having no sternwindows of course she could not see my manoeuvre but thought that the will was lost for ever we had very bad weather after that owing to which with the loss of her favourite pug and constant quarrelling with mefor i did all i could to annoy her afterwardsshe fell ill and was buried a fortnight after she was landed at plymouth the old lady kept her word she never made another will i proved the one i had recovered at doctors commons and touched the whole of her money as neither the first lieutenant nor i could prove whether the story was true or not of course we expressed our congratulations at his good fortune and soon afterwards left the cabin to report his marvellous story to our messmates when i went on deck i found that the shark had just been hooked and was hauling on board mr phillott had also come on deck the officers were all eager about the shark and were looking over the side calling to each other and giving directions to the men now although certainly there was a want of decorum on the quarterdeck still the captain having given permission it was to be excused but mr phillott thought otherwise and commenced in his usual style beginning with the marine officer mr westley ill trouble you not to be getting upon the hammocks youll get off directly sir if one of your fellows were to do so id stop his grog for a month and i dont see why you are to set a bad example youve been too long in barracks sir by half who is that mr williams and mr mooreboth on the hammocks too up to the foretopmast head both of you directly mr thomas up to the main and i say you youngster stealing off perch yourself upon the spankerboom and let me know when youve rode to london by god the service is going to hell i dont know what officers are made of nowadays ill marry some of you young gentlemen to the gunners daughter before long quarterdecks no better than a beargarden no wonder when lieutenants set the example this latter remark could only be applied to obrien who stood in the quarterboat giving directions before the tirade of mr phillott stopped the amusement of the party obrien immediately stepped out of the boat and going up to mr phillott touched his hat and said mr phillott we had the captains permission to catch the shark and a shark is not to be got on board by walking up and down on the quarterdeck as regards myself as long as the captain is on board i hold myself responsible to him alone for my conduct and if you think i have done wrong forward your complaint but if you pretend to use such language to me as you have to others i shall hold you responsible i am here sir as an officer and a gentleman and will be treated as such and allow me to observe that i consider the quarterdeck more disgraced by foul and ungentlemanly language than i do by an officer accidentally standing upon the hammocks however as you have thought proper to interfere you may now get the shark on board yourself mr phillott turned very red for he never had come in contact in this way with obrien all the other officers had submitted quietly to his unpleasant manner of speaking to them very well mr obrien i shall hold you answerable for this language replied he and shall most certainly report your conduct to the captain i will save you the trouble captain kearney is now coming up and i will report it myself this obrien did upon the captains putting his foot on the quarterdeck well observed the captain to mr phillott what is it you complain of mr obriens language sir am i to be addressed on the quarterdeck in that manner i really must say mr phillott replied captain kearney that i do not perceive anything in what mr obrien said but what is correct i command here and if an officer so nearly equal in rank to yourself has committed himself you are not to take the law into your own hands the fact is mr phillott your language is not quite so correct as i could wish it i overheard every word that passed and i consider that you have treated your superior officer with disrespectthat is me i gave permission that the shark should be caught and with that permission i consequently allowed those little deviations from the discipline of the service which must inevitably take place yet you have thought proper to interfere with my permission which is tantamount to an order and have made use of harsh language and punished the young gentlemen for obeying my injunctions you will oblige me sir by calling them all down and in restraining your petulance for the future i will always support your authority when you are correct but i regret that in this instance you have necessitated me to weaken it this was a most severe check to mr phillott who immediately went below after hailing the mastheads and calling down the midshipmen as soon as he was gone we were all on the hammocks again the shark was hauled forward hoisted on board and every fryingpan in the ship was in requisition we were all much pleased with captain kearneys conduct on this occasion and as obrien observed to me he really is a good fellow and clever officer what a thousand pities it is that he is such a confounded liar i must do mr phillott the justice to say that he bore no malice on this occasion but treated us as before which is saying a great deal in his favour when it is considered what power a first lieutenant has of annoying and punishing his inferiors chapter xxxiii another setto between the captain and first lieutenantcuttingout expeditionmr chucks mistakenhe dies like a gentlemanswinburne begins his account of the battle off st vincent we had not been more than a week under the danish island of st thomas when we discovered a brig close inshore we made all sail in chase and soon came within a mile and a half of the shore when she anchored under a battery which opened its fire upon us their elevation was too great and several shots passed over us and between our masts i once met with a very remarkable circumstance observed captain kearney three guns were fired at a frigate i was on board of from a battery all at the same time the three shots cut away the three topsail ties and down came all our topsail yards upon the cap at the same time that the frenchmen might not suppose that they had taken such good aim we turned up our hands to reef topsails and by the time that the men were off the yards the ties were spliced and the topsails run up again mr phillott could not stand this most enormous fib and he replied very odd indeed captain kearney but i have known a stranger circumstance we had put in the powder to the four guns on the main deck when we were fighting the danish gunboats in a frigate i was in and as the men withdrew the rammer a shot from the enemy entered the muzzle and completed the loading of each gun we fired their own shot back upon them and this occurred three times running upon my word replied captain kearney who had his glass upon the battery i think you must have dreamt that circumstance mr phillott not more than you did about the topsail ties captain kearney captain kearney at that time had the long glass in his hand holding it up over his shoulder a shot from the battery whizzed over his head and took the glass out of his hand shivering it to pieces thats once said captain kearney very coolly but will you pretend that that could ever happen three times running they might take my head off or my arm next time but not another glass whereas the topsail ties might be cut by three different shot but give me another glass mr simple i am certain that this vessel is a privateer what think you mr obrien i am every bit of your opinion captain kearney replied obrien and i think it would be a very pretty bit of practice to the ships company to take her out from under that footy battery starboard the helm mr phillott keep away four points and then we will think of it tonight the frigate was now kept away and ran out of the fire of the battery it was then about an hour before sunset and in the west indies the sun does not set as it does in the northern latitudes there is no twilight he descends in glory surrounded with clouds of gold and rubies in their gorgeous tints and once below the horizon all is dark as soon as it was dark we hauled our wind off shore and a consultation being held between the captain mr phillott and obrien the captain at last decided that the attempt should be made indeed although cuttingout is a very serious affair as you combat under every disadvantage still the mischief done to our trade by the fastsailing privateers was so great in the west indies that almost every sacrifice was warrantable for the interests of the country still captain kearney although a brave and prudent officerone who calculated chances and who would not risk his men without he deemed that necessity imperiously demanded that such should be donewas averse to this attack from his knowledge of the bay in which the brig was anchored and although mr phillott and obrien both were of opinion that it should be a night attack captain kearney decided otherwise he considered that although the risk might be greater yet the force employed would be more consolidated and that those who would hold back in the night dare not do so during the day moreover that the people on shore in the battery as well as those in the privateer would be on the alert all night and not expecting an attack during the day would be taken off their guard it was therefore directed that everything should be in preparation during the night and that the boats should shove off before daylight and row inshore concealing themselves behind some rocks under the cliffs which formed the cape upon one side of the harbour and if not discovered remain there till noon at which time it was probable that the privateers men would be on shore and the vessel might be captured without difficulty it is always a scene of much interest on board a manofwar when preparations are made for an expedition of this description and as the reader may not have been witness to them it may perhaps be interesting to describe them the boats of menofwar have generally two crews the common boats crews which are selected so as not to take away the most useful men from the ship and the service or fighting boats crews which are selected from the very best men on board the coxswains of the boats are the most trustworthy men in the ship and on this occasion have to see that their boats are properly equipped the launch yawl first and second cutters were the boats appointed for the expedition they all carried guns mounted upon slides which ran fore and aft between the men after the boats were hoisted out the guns were lowered down into them and shipped in the bows of the boats the armchests were next handed in which contain the cartridges and ammunition the shot were put into the bottom of the boats and so far they were all ready the oars of the boats were fitted to pull with grummets upon iron tholepins that they might make little noise and might swing fore and aft without falling overboard when the boats pulled alongside the privateer a breaker or two that is small casks holding about seven gallons each of water was put into each boat and also the mens allowance of spirits in case they should be detained by any unforeseen circumstances the men belonging to the boats were fully employed in looking after their arms some fitting their flints to their pistols others and the major part of them sharpening their cutlasses at the grindstone or with a file borrowed from the armourerall were busy and all merry the very idea of going into action is a source of joy to an english sailor and more jokes are made more merriment excited at that time than at any other then as it often happens that one or two of the service boats crews may be on the sick list urgent solicitations are made by others that they may supply their places the only parties who appear at all grave are those who are to remain in the frigate and not share in the expedition there is no occasion to order the boats to be manned for the men are generally in long before they are piped away indeed one would think that it was a party of pleasure instead of danger and of death upon which they were about to proceed captain kearney selected the officers who were to have the charge of the boats he would not trust any of the midshipmen on so dangerous a service he said that he had known so many occasions in which their rashness and foolhardiness had spoilt an expedition he therefore appointed mr phillott the first lieutenant to the launch obrien to the yawl the master to the first and mr chucks the boatswain to the second cutter mr chucks was much pleased with the idea of having the command of a boat and asked me to come with him to which i consented although i had intended as usual to have gone with obrien about an hour before daylight we ran the frigate to within a mile and a half of the shore and the boats shoved off the frigate then wore round and stood out in the offing that she might at daylight be at such a distance as not to excite any suspicion that our boats were sent away while we in the boats pulled quietly inshore we were not a quarter of an hour before we arrived at the cape forming one side of the bay and were well secreted among the cluster of rocks which were underneath our oars were laid in the boats painters made fast and orders given for the strictest silence the rocks were very high and the boats were not to be seen without any one should come to the edge of the precipice and even then they would in all probability have been supposed to have been rocks the water was as smooth as glass and when it was broad daylight the men hung listlessly over the sides of the boats looking at the corals below and watching the fish as they glided between i cant say mr simple said mr chucks to me in an under tone that i think well of this expedition and i have an idea that some of us will lose the number of our mess after a calm comes a storm and how quiet is everything now but ill take off my great coat for the sun is hot already coxswain give me my jacket mr chucks had put on his great coat but not his jacket underneath which he had left on one of the guns on the main deck all ready to change as soon as the heavy dew had gone off the coxswain handed him the jacket and mr chucks threw off his great coat to put it on but when it was opened it proved that by mistake he had taken away the jacket surmounted by two small epaulettes belonging to captain kearney which the captains steward who had taken it out to brush had also laid upon the same gun by all the nobility of england cried mr chucks i have taken away the captains jacket by mistake heres a pretty mess if i put on my great coat i shall be dead with sweating if i put on no jacket i shall be roasted brown but if i put on the captains jacket i shall be considered disrespectful the men in the boats tittered and mr phillott who was in the launch next to us turned round to see what was the matter obrien was sitting in the sternsheets of the launch with the first lieutenant and i leaned over and told them by the powers i dont see why the captains jacket will be at all hurt by mr chucks putting it on replied obrien unless indeed a bullet were to go through it and then it wont be any fault of mr chucks no replied the first lieutenant and if one did the captain might keep the jacket and swear that the bullet went round his body without wounding him hell have a good yarn to spin so put it on mr chucks youll make a good mark for the enemy that i will stand the risk of with pleasure observed the boatswain to me for the sake of being considered a gentleman so heres on with it there was a general laugh when mr chucks pulled on the captains jacket and sank down in the sternsheets of the cutter with great complacency of countenance one of the men in the boat that we were in thought proper however to continue his laugh a little longer than mr chucks considered necessary who leaning forward thus addressed him i say mr webber i beg leave to observe to you in the most delicate manner in the worldjust to hint to youthat it is not the custom to laugh at your superior officer i mean just to insinuate that you are a dd impudent son of a sea cook and if we both live and do well i will prove to you that if i am to be laughed at in a boat with the captains jacket on that i am not to be laughed at on board the frigate with the boatswains rattan in my fist and so look out my hearty for squalls when you come on the forecastle for ill be dd if i dont make you see more stars than god almighty ever made and cut more capers than all the dancingmasters in france mark my words you burgooeating peasoupswilling trowsersscrubbing son of a bitch mr chucks having at the end of this oration raised his voice above the pitch required by the exigency of the service was called to order by the first lieutenant and again sank back into the sternsheets with all the importance and authoritative show peculiarly appertaining to a pair of epaulettes we waited behind the rocks until noonday without being discovered by the enemy so well were we concealed we had already sent an officer who carefully hiding himself by lying down on the rocks had several times reconnoitred the enemy boats were passing and repassing continually from the privateer to the shore and it appeared that they went on shore full of men and returned with only one or two so that we were in great hopes that we should find but few men to defend the vessel mr phillott looked at his watch held it up to obrien to prove that he had complied exactly with the orders he had received from the captain and then gave the word to get the boats under weigh the painters were cast off by the bowmen the guns were loaded and primed the men seized their oars and in two minutes we were clear of the rocks and drawn up in a line within a quarter of a mile from the harbours mouth and not half a mile from the privateer brig we rowed as quickly as possible but we did not cheer until the enemy fired the first gun which he did from a quarter unexpected as we entered the mouth of the harbour with our union jack trailing in the water over our stern for it was a dead calm it appeared that at the low point under the cliffs at each side of the little bay they had raised a water battery of two guns each one of these guns laden with grape shot was now fired at the boats but the elevation was too low and although the water was ploughed up to within five yards of the launch no injury was received we were equally fortunate in the discharge of the other three guns two of which we passed so quickly that they were not aimed sufficiently forward so that their shot fell astern and the other although the shot fell among us did no further injury than cutting in half two of the oars of the first cutter in the meantime we had observed that the boats had shoved off from the privateer as soon as they had perceived us and had returned to her laden with men the boats had been despatched a second time but had not yet returned they were now about the same distance from the privateer as were our boats and it was quite undecided which of us would be first on board obrien perceiving this painted out to mr phillott that we should first attack the boats and afterwards board on the side to which they pulled as in all probability there would be an opening left in the boarding nettings which were tied up to the yardarms and presented a formidable obstacle to our success mr phillott agreed with obrien he ordered the bowmen to lay in their oars and keep the guns pointed ready to fire at the word given and desiring the other men to pull their best every nerve every muscle was brought into play by our anxious and intrepid seamen when within about twenty yards of the vessel and also of the boats the orders were given to firethe carronade of the launch poured out round and grape so well directed that one of the french boats sunk immediately and the musket balls with which our other smaller guns were loaded did great execution among their men in one minute more with three cheers from our sailors we were all alongside together english and french boats pellmell and a most determined close conflict took place the french fought desperately and as they were overpowered they were reinforced by those from the privateer who could not look on and behold their companions requiring their assistance without coming to their aid some jumped down into our boats from the chains into the midst of our men others darted cold shot at us either to kill us or to sink our boats and thus did one of the most desperate handtohand conflicts take place that ever was witnessed but it was soon decided in our favour for we were the stronger party and the better armed and when all opposition was over we jumped into the privateer and found not a man left on board only a large dog who flew at obriens throat as he entered the port dont kill him said obrien as the sailors hastened to his assistance only take away his gripe the sailors disengaged the dog and obrien led him up to a gun saying by jasus my boy you are my prisoner but although we had possession of the privateer our difficulties as it will prove were by no means over we were now exposed not only to the fire of the two batteries at the harbourmouth which we had to pass but also to that of the battery at the bottom of the bay which had fired at the frigate in the meantime we were very busy in cutting the cable lowering the topsails and taking the wounded men on board the privateer from out of the boats all this was however but the work of a few minutes most of the frenchmen were killed our own wounded amounted to only nine seamen and mr chucks the boatswain who was shot through the body apparently with little chance of surviving as mr phillott observed the captains epaulettes had made him a mark for the enemy and he had fallen in his borrowed plumes as soon as they were all on board and laid on the deckfor there were as near as i can recollect about fourteen wounded frenchmen as well as our owntowropes were got out forwards the boats were manned and we proceeded to tow the brig out of the harbour it was a dead calm and we made but little way but our boats crew flushed with victory cheered and rallied and pulled with all their strength the enemy perceiving that the privateer was taken and the french boats drifting empty up the harbour now opened their fire upon us and with great effect before we had towed abreast of the two water batteries we had received threeshots between wind and water from the other batteries and the sea was pouring fast into the vessel i had been attending to poor mr chucks who lay on the starboard side near the wheel the blood flowing from his wound and tracing its course down the planks of the deck to a distance of some feet from where he lay he appeared very faint and i tied my handkerchief round his body so as to stop the effusion of blood and brought him some water with which i bathed his face and poured some into his mouth he opened his eyes wide and looked at me ah mr simple said he faintly is it you its all over with me but it could not be bettercould it how do you mean inquired i why have i not fallen dressed like an officer and a gentleman said he referring to the captains jacket and epaulettes id sooner die now with this dress on than recover to put on the boatswains uniform i feel quite happy he pressed my hand and then closed his eyes again from weakness we were now nearly abreast of the two batteries on the points the guns of which had been trained so as to bear upon our boats that were towing out the brig the first shot went through the bottom of the launch and sank her fortunately all the men were saved but as she was the boat that towed next to the brig great delay occurred in getting the others clear of her and taking the brig again in tow the shot now poured in thick and the grape became very annoying still our men gave way cheering at every shot fired and we had nearly passed the batteries with trifling loss when we perceived that the brig was so full of water that she could not swim many minutes longer and that it would be impossible to tow her alongside of the frigate mr phillott under these circumstances decided that it would be useless to risk more lives and that the wounded should be taken out of the brig and the boats should pull away for the ship he desired me to get the wounded men into the cutter which he sent alongside and then to follow the other boats i made all the haste i could not wishing to be left behind and as soon as all our wounded men were in the boats i went to mr chucks to remove him he appeared somewhat revived but would not allow us to remove him my dear mr simple said he it is of no use i never can recover it and i prefer dying here i entreat you not to move me if the enemy take possession of the brig before she sinks i shall be buried with military honours if they do not i shall at least die in the dress of a gentleman hasten away as fast as you can before you lose more men here i staythats decided i expostulated with him but at that time two boats full of men appeared pulling out of the harbour to the brig the enemy had perceived that our boats had deserted her and were coming to take possession i had therefore no time to urge mr chucks to change his resolution and not wishing to force a dying man i shook his hand and left him it was with some difficulty i escaped for the boats had come up close to the brig they chased me a little while but the yawl and the cutter turning back to my assistance they gave up the pursuit on the whole this was a very well arranged and well conducted expedition the only man lost was mr chucks for the wounds of the others were none of them mortal captain kearney was quite satisfied with our conduct and so was the admiral when it was reported to him captain kearney did indeed grumble a little about his jacket and sent for me to inquire why i had not taken it off mr chucks and brought it on board as i did not choose to tell him the exact truth i replied that i could not disturb a dying man and that the jacket was so saturated with blood that he never could have worn it again which was the case at all events you might have brought away my epaulettes replied he but you youngsters think of nothing but gormandizing i had the first watch that night when swinburne the quartermaster came up to me and asked me all the particulars of the affair for he was not in the boats well said he that mr chucks appeared to be a very good boatswain in his way if he could only have kept his rattan a little quiet he was a smart fellow and knew his duty we had just such another killed in our ship in the action off cape st vincent what were you in that action replied i yes i was and belonged to the captain lord nelsons ship well then suppose you tell me all about it why mr simple dye see ive no objection to spin you a yarn now and then replied swinburne but as mr chucks used to say allow me to observe in the most delicate manner in the world that i perceive that the man who has charge of your hammock and slings you a clean one now and then has very often a good glass of grog for his yarns and i do not see but that mine are as well worth a glass of grog as his so they are swinburne and better too and i promise you a good stiff one tomorrow evening that will do sir now then ill tell you all about it and more about it too than most can for i know how the action was brought about i have the log marked the board and then sat down abaft on the signal chest with swinburne who commenced his narrative as follows you must know mr simple that when the english fleet came down the mediterranean after the vackyation of corsica they did not muster more than seventeen sail of the line while the spanish fleet from ferrol and carthagena had joined company at cadiz and mounted to near thirty sir john jervis had the command of our fleet at the time but as the dons did not seem at all inclined to come out and have a brush with us almost two to one sir john left sir hyde parker with six sail of the line to watch the spanish beggars while he went in to lisbon with the remainder of the fleet to water and refit now you see mr simple portugal was at that time what they calls neutral that is to say she didnt meddle at all in the affair being friends with both parties and just as willing to supply fresh beef and water to the spaniards as to the english if so be the spaniards had come out to ax for it which they darnt the portuguese and the english have always been the best of friends because we cant get no port wine anywhere else and they cant get nobody else to buy it of them so the portuguese gave up their arsenal at lisbon for the use of the english and there we kept all our stores under the charge of that old daredevil sir isaac coffin now it so happened that one of the clerks in old sir isaacs office a portuguese chap had been some time before that in the office of the spanish ambassador he was a very smart sort of a chap and sarved as interpreter and the old commissioner put great faith in him but how did you learn all this swinburne why ill tell you mr simple i steered the yawl as coxswain and when admirals and captains talk in the sternsheets they very often forget that the coxswain is close behind them i only learnt half of it that way the rest i put together when i compared logs with the admirals steward who of course heard a great deal now and then the first i heard of it was when old sir john called out to sir isaac after the second bottle i say sir isaac who killed the spanish messenger not i by god replied sir isaac i only left him for dead and then they both laughed and so did nelson who was sitting with them well mr simple it was reported to sir isaac that his clerk was often seen taking memorandums of the different orders given to the fleet particularly those as to there being no wasteful expenditure of his majestys stores upon which sir isaac goes to the admiral and requests that the man might be discharged now old sir john was a sly old fox and he answered not so commissioner perhaps we may catch them in their own trap so the admiral sits down and calls for pen and ink and he flourishes out a long letter to the commissioner stating that all the stores of the fleet were expended representing as how it would be impossible to go to sea without a supply and wishing to know when the commissioner expected more transports from england he also said that if the spanish fleet were now to come out from cadiz it would be impossible for him to protect sir h parker with his six sail of the line who was watching the spanish fleet as he could not quit the port in his present condition to this letter the commissioner answered that from the last accounts he thought that in the course of six weeks or two months they might receive supplies from england but that sooner than that was impossible these letters were put in the way of the dd portuguese spyclerk who copied them and was seen that evening to go into the house of the spanish ambassador sir john then sent a message to ferrothats a small town on the portuguese coast to the southwardwith a despatch to sir hyde parker desiring him to run away to cape st vincent and decoy the spanish fleet there in case they should come out after him well mr simple so far dye see the train was well laid the next thing to do was to watch the spanish ambassadors house and see if he sent away any despatches two days after the letters had been taken to him by this rascal of a clerk the spanish ambassador sent away two messengersone for cadiz and the other for madrid which is the town where the king of spain lives the one to cadiz was permitted to go but the one to madrid was stopped by the directions of the admiral and this job was confided to the commissioner sir isaac who settled it somehow or another and this was the reason why the admiral called out to him i say sir isaac who killed the messenger they brought back his despatches by which they found out that advice had been sent to the spanish admirali forget his name something like magazineinforming him of the supposed crippled state of our squadron sir john taking it for granted that the spaniards would not lose an opportunity of taking six sail of the line more english ships than they have ever taken in their liveswaited a few days to give them time and then sailed from lisbon for cape st vincent where he joined sir hyde parker and fell in with the spaniards sure enough and a pretty drubbing we gave them now its not everybody that could tell you all that mr simple well but now for the action swinburne lord bless you mr simple its now past seven bells and i cant fight the battle of st vincent in half an hour besides which its well worth another glass of grog to hear all about that battle well you shall have one swinburne only dont forget to tell it to me swinburne and i then separated and in less than an hour afterwards i was dreaming of despatchessir john jervissir isaac coffinand spanish messengers chapter xxxiv obriens good advicecaptain kearney again deals in the marvellous i do not remember any circumstance in my life which at that time lay so heavily on my mind as the loss of poor mr chucks the boatswain who of course i took it for granted i should never see again i believe that the chief cause was that at the time i entered the service and every one considered me to be the fool of the family mr chucks and obrien were the only two who thought of and treated me differently and it was their conduct which induced me to apply myself and encouraged me to exertion i believe that many a boy who if properly patronized would turn out well is by the injudicious system of browbeating and ridicule forced into the wrong path and in his despair throws away all selfconfidence and allows himself to be carried away by the stream to perdition obrien was not very partial to reading himself he played the german flute remarkably well and had a very good voice his chief amusement was practising or rather playing which is a very different thing but although he did not study himself he always made me come into his cabin for an hour or two every day and after i had read repeat to him the contents of the book by this method he not only instructed me but gained a great deal of information himself for he made so many remarks upon what i had read that it was impressed upon both our memories well peter he would say as he came into the cabin what have you to tell me this morning sure its you thats the schoolmaster and not mefor i learn from you every day i have not read much obrien today for i have been thinking of poor mr chucks very right for you so to do peter never forget your friends in a hurry youll not find too many of them as you trot along the highway of life i wonder whether he is dead why thats a question i cannot answer a bullet through the chest dont lengthen a mans days thats certain but this i know that hell not die if he can help it now that hes got the captains jacket on yes he always aspired to be a gentleman which was absurd enough in a boatswain not at all absurd peter but very absurd of you to talk without thinking when did any one of his shipmates ever know mr chucks to do an unhandsome or mean action never and why because he aspired to be a gentleman and that feeling kept him above it vanitys a confounded donkey very apt to put his head between his legs and chuck us over but prides a fine horse who will carry us over the ground and enable us to distance our fellowtravellers mr chucks has pride and thats always commendable even in a boatswain how often have you read of people rising from nothing and becoming great men this was from talent sure enough but it was talent with pride to force it onward not talent with vanity to check it you are very right obrien i spoke foolishly never mind peter nobody heard you but me so its of no consequence dont you dine in the cabin today yes so do i the captain is in a most marvellous humour this morning he told me one or two yarns that quite staggered my politeness and my respect for him on the quarterdeck what a pity it is that a man should have gained such a bad habit hes quite incurable im afraid replied i but certainly his fibs do no harm they are what they call white lies i do not think he would really tell a liethat is a lie which would be considered to disgrace a gentleman peter all lies disgrace a gentleman white or black although i grant there is a difference to say the least of it it is a dangerous habit for white lies are but the gentlemen ushers to black ones i know but of one point on which a lie is excusable and that is when you wish to deceive the enemy then your duty to your country warrants your lying till youre black in the face and for the very reason that it goes against your grain it becomes as it were a sort of virtue what was the difference between the marine officer and mr phillott that occurred this morning nothing at all in itself the marine officer is a bit of a gaby and takes offence where none is meant mr phillott has a foul tongue but he has a good heart what a pity it is it is a pity for hes a smart officer but the fact is peter that junior officers are too apt to copy their superiors and that makes it very important that a young gentleman should sail with a captain who is a gentleman now phillott served the best of his time with captain ballover who is notorious in the service for foul and abusive language what is the consequence that phillott and many others who have served under him have learnt his bad habit i should think obrien that the very circumstance of having had your feelings so often wounded by such language when you were a junior officer would make you doubly careful not to make use of it to others when you had advanced in the service peter thats just the first feeling which wears away after a time but at last your own sense of indignation becomes blunted and becoming indifferent to it you forget also that you wound the feelings of others and carry the habit with you to the great injury and disgrace of the service but its time to dress for dinner so youd better make yourself scarce peter while i tidivate myself off a little according to the rules and regulations of his majestys service when you are asked to dine with the skipper we met at the captains table where we found as usual a great display of plate but very little else except the ships allowance we certainly had now been cruising some time and there was some excuse for it but still few captains would have been so unprovided im afraid gentlemen you will not have a very grand dinner observed the captain as the steward removed the plated covers of the dishes but when on service we must rough it out how we can mr obrien peasoup i recollect faring harder than this through one cruise in a flush vessel we were thirteen weeks up to our knees in water and living the whole time upon raw porknot being able to light a fire during the cruise pray captain kearney may i ask where this happened to be sure it was off bermudas we cruised for seven weeks before we could find the islands and began verily to think that the bermudas were themselves on a cruise i presume sir you were not so sorry to have a fire to cook your provisions when you came to an anchor said obrien i beg your pardon replied captain kearney we had become so accustomed to raw provisions and wet feet that we could not eat our meals cooked or help dipping our legs over the side for a long while afterwards i saw one of the boatkeepers astern catch a large barracouta and eat it aliveindeed if i had not given the strictest orders and flogged halfadozen of them i doubt whether they would not have eaten their victuals raw to this day the force of habit is tremendous it is indeed observed mr phillott drily and winking to us referring to the captains incredible stories it is indeed repeated obrien we see the ditch in our neighbours eye and cannot observe the log of wood in our own and obrien winked at me referring to phillotts habit of bad language i once knew a married man observed the captain who had been always accustomed to go to sleep with his hand upon his wifes head and would not allow her to wear a nightcap in consequence well she caught cold and died and he never could sleep at night until he took a clothesbrush to bed with him and laid his hand upon that which answered the purposesuch was the force of habit i once saw a dead body galvanized observed mr phillott it was the body of a man who had taken a great deal of snuff during his lifetime and as soon as the battery was applied to his spine the body very gently raised its arm and put its fingers to its nose as if it was taking a pinch you saw that yourself mr phillott observed the captain looking at the first lieutenant earnestly in the face yes sir replied mr phillott coolly have you told that story often very often sir because i know that some people by constantly telling a story at last believe it to be true not that i refer to you mr phillott but still i should recommend you not to tell that story where you are not well known or people may doubt your credibility i make it a rule to believe everything myself observed mr phillott out of politeness and i expect the same courtesy from others then upon my soul when you tell that story you trespass very much upon our good manners talking of courtesy you must meet a friend of mine who has been a courtier all his life he cannot help bowing i have seen him bow to his horse and thank him after he had dismounted beg pardon of a puppy for treading on his tail and one day when he fell over a scraper he took his hat off and made it a thousand apologies for his inattention force of habit again said obrien exactly so mr simple will you take a slice of this pork and perhaps youll do me the honour to take a glass of wine lord privilege would not much admire our dinner today would he mr simple as a variety he might sir but not for a continuance very truly said variety is charming the negroes here get so tired of salt fish and occra broth that they eat dirt by way of a relish mr obrien how remarkably well you played that sonata of pleydels this morning i am happy that i did not annoy you captain kearney at all events replied obrien on the contrary i am very partial to good music my mother was a great performer i recollect once she was performing a piece on the piano in which she had to imitate a thunderstorm so admirably did she hit it off that when we went to tea all the cream was turned sour as well as three casks of beer in the cellar at this assertion mr phillott could contain himself no longer he burst out into a loud laugh and having a glass of wine to his lips spattered it all over the table and over me who unfortunately was opposite to him i really beg pardon captain kearney but the idea of such an expensive talent was too amusing will you permit me to ask you a question as there could not have been thunder without lightning were any people killed at the same time by the electric fluid of the piano no sir replied captain kearney very angrily but her performance electrified us which was something like it perhaps mr phillott as you lost your last glass of wine you will allow me to take another with you with great pleasure replied the first lieutenant who perceived that he had gone far enough well gentlemen said the captain we shall soon be in the land of plenty i shall cruise a fortnight more and then join the admiral at jamaica we must make out our despatch relative to the cutting out of the sylvia that was the name of the privateer brig and i am happy to say that i shall feel it my duty to make honourable mention of all the party present steward coffee the first lieutenant obrien and i bowed to this flattering avowal on the part of the captain as for me i felt delighted the idea of my name being mentioned in the gazette and the pleasure that it would give to my father and mother mantled the blood in my cheeks till i was as red as a turkeycock cousin simple said the captain goodnaturedly you have no occasion to blush your conduct deserves it and you are indebted to mr phillott for having made me acquainted with your gallantry coffee was soon over and i was glad to leave the cabin and be alone that i might compose my perturbed mind i felt too happy i did not however say a word to my messmates as it might have created feelings of envy or illwill obrien gave me a caution not to do so when i met him afterwards so that i was very glad that i had been so circumspect chapter xxxv swinburne continues his narrative of the battle off cape st vincent the second night after this we had the middle watch and i claimed swinburnes promise that he would spin his yarn relative to the battle of st vincent well mr simple so i will but i require a little priming or i shall never go off will you have your glass of grog before or after before by all means if you please sir run down and get it and ill heave the log for you in the meantime when we shall have a good hour without interruption for the seabreeze will be steady and we are under easy sail i brought up a stiff glass of grog which swinburne tossed off and as he finished it sighed deeply as if in sorrow that there was no more having stowed away the tumbler in one of the capstern holes for the present we sat down upon a coil of ropes under the weather bulwarks and swinburne replacing his quid of tobacco commenced as follows well mr simple as i told you before old jervis started with all his fleet for cape st vincent we lost one of our fleetand a threedecker toothe st george she took the ground and was obliged to go back to lisbon but we soon afterwards were joined by five sail of the line sent out from england so that we mustered fifteen sail in all we had like to lose another of our mess for dye see the old culloden and colossus fell foul of each other and the culloden had the worst on it but troubridge who commanded her was not a man to shy his work and ax to go in to refit when there was a chance of meeting the enemy so he patched her up somehow or another and reported himself ready for action the very next day ready for action he always was thats sure enough but whether his ship was in a fit state to go into action is quite another thing but as the sailors used to say in joking he was a true bridge and you might trust to him which meant as much as to say that he knew how to take his ship into action and how to fight her when he was fairly in it i think it was the next day that cockburn joined us in the minerve and he brought nelson along with him with the intelligence that the dons had chased him and that the whole spanish fleet was out in pursuit of us well mr simple you may guess we were not a little happy in the captain when nelson joined us as we knew that if he fell in with the spaniards our ship would cut a figureand so she did sure enough that was on the morning of the th and old jervis made the signal to prepare for action and keep close order which means to have your flying jibboom in at the starn windows of the ship ahead of you and we did keep close order for a man might have walked right round from one ship to the other either lee or weather line of the fleet i shant forget that night mr simple as long as i live and breathe every now and then we heard the signal guns of the spanish fleet booming at a distance to windward of us and you may guess how our hearts leaped at the sound and how we watched with all our ears for the next gun that was fired trying to make out their bearings and distance as we assembled in little knots upon the booms and weathergangway it was my middle watch and i was signalman at the time so of course i had no time to take a caulk if i was inclined when my watch was over i could not go down to my hammock so i kept the morning watch too as did most of the men on board as for nelson he walked the deck the whole night quite in a fever at daylight it was thick and hazy weather and we could not make them out but about five bells the old culloden who if she had broke her nose had not lost the use of her eyes made the signal for a part of the spanish fleet in sight old jervis repeated the signal to prepare for action but he might have saved the wear and tear of the bunting for we were all ready bulkheads down screens up guns shotted tackles rove yards slung powder filled shot on deck and fire outand whats more mr simple ill be dd if we werent all willing too about six bells in the forenoon the fog and haze all cleared away at once just like the raising of the foresail that they lower down at the portsmouth theatre and discovered the whole of the spanish fleet i counted them all how many swinburne cries nelson twentysix sail sir answered i nelson walked the quarterdeck backwards and forwards rubbing his hands and laughing to himself and then he called for his glass and went to the gangway with captain miller swinburne keep a good look upon the admiral says he ay ay sir says i now you see mr simple twentysix sail against fifteen were great odds upon paper but we didnt think so because we knowd the difference between the two fleets there was our fifteen sail of the line all in applepie order packed up as close as dominoes and every man on board of them longing to come to the scratch while there was their twentysix all somehow nohow two lines here and no lines there with a great gap of water in the middle of them for this gap between their ships we all steered with all the sail we could carry because dye see mr simple by getting them on both sides of us we had the advantage of fighting both broadsides which is just as easy as fighting one and makes shorter work of it just as it struck seven bells troubridge opened the ball setting to half a dozen of the spaniards and making them reel tom collins whether or no bangbangbang bang oh mr simple its a beautiful sight to see the first guns fired that are to bring on a general action hes the luckiest dog that troubridge said nelson stamping with impatience our ships were soon hard at it hammer and tongs my eyes how they did pelt it in and old sir john in the victory smashed the cabin windows of the spanish admiral with such a hell of a raking broadside that the fellow bore up as if the devil kicked him lord a mercy you might have drove a portsmouth waggon into his starnthe broadside of the victory had made room enough however they were soon all smothered up in smoke and we could not make out how things were going onbut we made a pretty good guess well mr simple as they say at the play that was act the first scene the first and now we had to make our appearance and ill leave you to judge after ive told my tale whether the old captain wasnt principal performer and top sawyer over them all but stop a moment ill just look at the binnacle for that young topmans nodding at the wheeli say mr smith are you shutting your eyes to keep them warm and letting the ship run half a point out of her course take care i dont send for another helmsman thats all and give the reason why youll make a wry face upon sixwater grog tomorrow at seven bells dn your eyes keep them opencant you swinburne after this genteel admonition to the man at the wheel reseated himself and continued his narrative all this while mr simple we in the captain had not fired a gun but were ranging up as fast as we could to where the enemy lay in a heap there were plenty to pick and choose from and nelson looked out sharp for a big one as little boys do when they have to choose an apple and by the piper that played before moses it was a big one that he ordered the master to put him alongside of she was a fourdecker called the santissima trinidad we had to pass some whoppers which would have satisfied any reasonable man for there was the san josef and salvador del mondo and san nicolas but nothing would suit nelson but this fourdecked ship so we crossed the hawse of about six of them and as soon as we were abreast of her and at the word fire every gun went off at once slap into her and the old captain reeled at the discharge as if she was drunk i wish youd only seen how we pitched it into this holy trinity she was holy enough before we had done with her riddled like a sieve several of her ports knocked into one and every scupper of her running blood and water not but what she stood to it as bold as brass and gave us nearly gun for gun and made a very pretty general average in our ships company many of the old captains went to kingdomcome in that business and many more were obliged to bear up for greenwich hospital fire away my ladssteady aim cries nelson jump down there mr thomas pass the word to reduce the cartridges the shot go clean through her double shot the guns there fore and aft so we were at it for about half an hour when our guns became so hot from quick firing that they bounced up to the beams overhead tearing away their ringbolts and snapping their breechings like ropeyarns by this time we were almost as much unrigged as if we had been two days paying off in portsmouth harbour the fourdecker forged ahead and troubridge in the jolly old culloden came between us and two other spanish ships who were playing into us she was as fresh as a daisy and gave them a dose which quite astonished them they shook their ears and fell astern when the blenheim laid hold of them and mauled them so that they went astern again but it was out of the fryingpan into the fire for the orion prince george and one or two others were coming up and knocked the very guts out of them ill be dd if they forget the th of april and sarve them right too wasnt a fourdecker enough for any twodecker without any more coming on us and couldnt the beggars have matched themselves like gentlemen well mr simple this gave us a minute or two to fetch our breath let the guns cool and repair damages and swab the blood from the decks but we lost our fourdecker for we could not get near her again what odd names the spaniards give to their ships swinburne why yes they do it would almost appear wicked to belabour the holy trinity as we did but why they should call a fourdecked ship the holy trinity seeing as how theres only three of them father son and holy ghost i cant tell bill saunders said that the fourth deck was for the pope who was as great a personage as the others but i cant understand how that can be well mr simple as i was head signalman i was perched on the poop and didnt serve at a gun i had to report all i could see which was not much the smoke was so thick but now and then i could get a peep as it were through the holes in the blanket of course i was obliged to keep my eye as much as possible upon the admiral not to make out his signals for commodore nelson wouldnt thank me for that i knew he hated a signal when in action so i never took no notice of the bunting but just watched to see what he was about so while we are repairing damages ill just tell you what i saw of the rest of the fleet as soon as old jervis had done for the spanish admiral he hauled his wind on the larboard tack and followed by four or five other ships weathered the spanish line and joined collingwood in the excellent then they all dashed through the line the excellent was the leading ship and she first took the shine out of the salvador del mondo and then left her to be picked up by the other ships while she attacked a twodecker who hauled down her coloursi forget her name just now as soon as the victory ran alongside of the salvador del mondo down went her colours and excellent reasons had she for striking her flag and now mr simple the old captain comes into play again having parted company with the fourdecker we had recommenced action with the san nicolas a spanish eighty and while we were hard at it old collingwood comes up in the excellent the san nicolas knowing that the excellents broadside would send her to old nick put her helm up to avoid being raked in so doing she fell foul of the san josef a spanish threedecker and we being all cut to pieces and unmanageableall of us indeed reeling about like drunken mennelson ordered his helm astarboard and in a jiffy there we were all three hugging each other running in one anothers guns smashing our chainplates and poking our yardarms through each others canvas all hands to board roared nelson leaping on the hammocks and waving his sword hurrah hurrah echoed through the decks and up flew the men like as many angry bees out of a beehive in a moment pikes tomahawks cutlasses and pistols were seized for it was quite unexpected mr simple and our men poured into the eightygun ship and in two minutes the decks were cleared and all the dons pitched below i joined the boarders and was on the main deck when captain miller came down and cried out on deck again immediately up we went and what do you think it was for mr simple why to board a second time for nelson having taken the twodecker swore that hed have the threedecker as well so away we went again clambering up her lofty sides how we could and dropping down on her decks like hailstones we all made for the quarterdeck beat down every spanish beggar that showed fight and in five minutes more we had hauled down the colours of two of the finest ships in the spanish navy if that wasnt taking the shine out of the dons i should like to know what is and didnt the old captains cheer and shake hands as commodore nelson stood on the deck of the san josef and received the swords of the spanish officers there was enough of them to go right round the capstern and plenty to spare now mr simple what do you think of that for a spree why swinburne i can only say that i wish i had been there so did every man in the fleet mr simple i can tell you but what became of the santissima trinidad upon my word she behaved one deck better than all the others she held out against four of our ships for a long while and then hauled down her colours and no disgrace to her considering what a precious hammering she had taken first but the lee division of the spanish weather fleet if i may so call it consisting of eleven sail of the line came up to her assistance and surrounded her so that they got her off our ships were too much cut up to commence a new action and the admiral made the signal to secure the prizes the spanish fleet then did what they should have done beforegot into line and we lost no time in doing the same but we both had had fighting enough but do you think swinburne that the spaniards fought well theyd have fought better if theyd only have known how theres no want of courage in the dons mr simple but they did not support each other only observe how troubridge supported us by god mr simple he was the real fellow and nelson knew it well he was nelsons righthand man but you know there wasnt room for two nelsons their ships engaged held out well it must be acknowledged but why werent they all in their proper berths had they kept close order of sailing and had all fought as well as those who were captured it would not have been a very easy matter for fifteen ships to gain a victory over twentysix thats long odds even when backed with british seamen well how did you separate why the next morning the spaniards had the weathergage so they had the option whether to fight or not at one time they had half a mind for they bore down to us upon which we hauled our wind to show them we were all ready to meet them and then they thought better of it and roundedto again so as they wouldnt fight and we didnt wish it we parted company in the night and two days afterwards we anchored with our four prizes in lagos bay so now you have the whole of it mr simple and ive talked till im quite hoarse you havent by chance another drop of the stuff left to clear my throat it would be quite a charity i think i have swinburne and as you deserve it i will go and fetch it chapter xxxvi a letter from father mgrath who diplomatizeswhen priest meets priest then comes the tug of warfather otoole not to be made a tool of we continued our cruise for a fortnight and then made sail for jamaica where we found the admiral at anchor at port royal but our signal was made to keep under weigh and captain kearney having paid his respects to the admiral received orders to carry despatches to halifax water and provisions were sent on board by the boats of the admirals ships and to our great disappointment as the evening closed in we were again standing out to sea instead of as we had anticipated enjoying ourselves on shore but the fact was that orders had arrived from england to send a frigate immediately up to the admiral at halifax to be at his disposal i had however the satisfaction to know that captain kearney had been true to his word in making mention of my name in the despatch for the clerk showed me a copy of it nothing occurred worth mentioning during our passage except that captain kearney was very unwell nearly the whole of the time and seldom quitted his cabin it was in october that we anchored in halifax harbour and the admiralty expecting our arrival there had forwarded our letters there were none for me but there was one for obrien from father mgrath the contents of which were as follows my dear sonand a good son you are and thats the truth on it or devil a bit should you be a son of mine youve made your family quite contented and peaceable and they never fight for the praties now good reason why they shouldnt seeing that theres a plenty for all of them and the pig craturs into the bargain your father and your mother and your brother and your three sisters send their duty to you and their blessings tooand you may add my blessing terence which is worth them all for wont i get you out of purgatory in the twinkling of a bedpost make yourself quite aisy on that score and lave it all to me only just say a pater now and then that when st peter lets you in he maynt throw it in your teeth that youve saved your soul by contract which is the only way by which emperors and kings ever get to heaven your letter from plymouth came safe to hand barney the postboy having dropped it under foot close to our door the big pig took it into his mouth and ran away with it but i caught sight of him and speaking to him he let it go knowing the cute cratur that i could read it better than him as soon as i had digested the contents which it was lucky the pig did not instead of me i just took my meal and my big stick and then set off for ballycleuch now you know terence if you havent forgotand if you have ill just remind youthat theres a flaunty sort of young woman at the poteen shop there who calls herself mrs orourke wife to a corporal orourke who was kilt or died one day i dont know which but thats not of much consequence the devil a bit do i think the priest ever gave the marriageblessing to that same although she swears that she was married on the rock of gibraltarit may be a strong rock fore i know but its not the rock of salvation like the seven sacraments of which marriage is one benedicite mrs orourke is a little too apt to fleer and jeer at the priests and if it were not that she softens down her pertinent remarks with a glass or two of the real poteen which proves some respect for the church id excommunicate her body and soul and every body and every soul that put their lips to the cratur at her door but she must leave that off as i tell her when she gets old and ugly for then all the whisky in the world shant save her but shes a fine woman now and it goes agin my conscience to help the devil to a fine woman now this mrs orourke knows everybody and everything thats going on in the country about and she has a tongue which has never had a holiday since it was let loose good morning to ye mrs orourke says i an the top of the morning to you father mgrath says she with a smile what brings you here is it a journey that youre taking to buy the true wood of the cross or is it a purty girl that you wish to confess father mgrath or is it only that youre come for a drop of poteen and a little bit of chat with mrs orourke sure its i whod be glad to find the same true wood of the cross mrs orourke but its not grown i suspect at your town of ballycleuch and its no objection id have to confess a purty girl like yourself mrs orourke wholl only tell me half her sins and give me no trouble but its the truth that im here for nothing else but to have a bit of chat with yourself dainty dear and taste your poteen just by way of keeping my mouth nate and clane so mrs orourke poured out the real stuff which i drank to her health and then says i putting down the bit of a glass so youve a stranger come i find in your parts mrs orourke ive heard the same replied she so you observe terence i came to the fact all at once by a guess i am tould says i that hes a scotchman and spakes what nobody can understand devil a bit says she hes an englishman and speaks plain enough but what can a man mane to come here and sit down all alone says i all alone father mgrath replied she is a man all alone when hes got his wife and childer and more coming with the blessing of god but those boys are not his own childer i believe says i there again youre all in a mistake father mgrath rejoins she the childer are all his own and all girls to boot it appears that its just as well that you come down now and then for information to our town of ballycleuch very true mrs orourke says i and who is it that knows everything so well as yourself you observe terence that i just said everything contrary and arce versa as they call it to the contents of your letter for always recollect my son that if you would worm a secret out of a woman youll do more by contradiction than you ever will by coaxingso i went on anyhow i think its a burning shame mrs orourke for a gentleman to bring over with him here from england a parcel of lazy english servants when theres so many nice boys and girls here to attind upon them now there youre all wrong again father mgrath says she devil a soul has he brought from the other country but has hired them all here arnt there ella flanagan for one maid and terence driscol for a footman and its well that he looks in his new uniform when he comes down for the newspapers and arnt moggy cala there to cook the dinner and pretty mary sullivan for a nurse for the babby as soon as it comes into the world is it mary sullivan you mane says i she that was married about three months back and is so quick in childgetting that shes all but ready to fall to pieces in this same time its exactly she says mrs orourke and do you know the reason devil a bit says i how should i then its just that she may send her own child away and give her milk to the english babby thats coming because the lady is too much of a lady to have a child hanging to her breast but suppose mary sullivans child arnt born till afterwards how then says i speak mrs orourke for youre a sensible woman how then says she och thats all arranged for mary says that shell be in bed a week before the lady so thats all right youll perceive father mgrath but dont you perceive sensible woman as you are that a young woman who is so much out of her reckoning as to have a child three months after her marriage may make a little mistake in her lyingin arithmetic mrs orourke never fear father mgrath mary sullivan will keep her word and sooner than disappoint the lady and lose her place shell just tumble downstairs and wont that put her to bed fast enough well thats what i call a faithful good servant that earns her wages says i so now ill just take another glass mrs orourke and thank you too sure youre the woman that knows everything and a mighty pretty woman into the bargain let me alone now father mgrath and dont be pinching me that way anyhow it was only a big flea that i perceived hopping on your gown my darling devil anything else many thanks to you father for that same but the next time youd kill my fleas just wait until theyre in a more dacent situation fleas are fleas mrs orourke and we must catch em when we can and how we can and as we can so no offence a good nights rest to you mrs orourkewhen do you mean to confess ive an idea that ive too many fleas about me to confess to you just now father mgrath and thats the truth on it so a pleasant walk back to you so youll perceive my son that having got all the information from mrs orourke its back i went to ballyhinch till i heard it whispered that there were doings down at the old house at ballycleuch off i set and went to the house itself as priests always ought to be welcomed at births and marriages and deaths being as you know of great use on such occasionswhen who should open the door but father otoole the biggest rapparee of a priest in the whole of ireland didnt he steal a horse and only save his neck by benefit of clergy and did he ever give absolution to a young woman without making her sin over again what may be your pleasure here father mgrath says he holding the door with his hand only just to call and hear whats going on for the matter of that says he ill just tell you that were all going on very well but arnt you ashamed of yourself father mgrath to come here to interfere with my flock knowing that i confess the house altogether thats as may be says i but i only wanted to know what the lady had brought into the world its a child says he indeed says i many thanks for the information and pray what is it that mary sullivan has brought into the world thats a child too says he and now that you know all about it good evening to you father mgrath and the ugly brute slammed the door right in my face who stole a horse cries i but he didnt hear memores the pity so youll perceive my dear boy that i have found out something at all events but not so much as i intended for ill prove to father otoole that hes no match for father mgrath but what i find out must be reserved for another letter seeing that its not possible to tell it to you in this same praties look well but somehow or another clothes dont grow upon trees in ould ireland and one of your halfquarterly bills or a little prizemoney if it found its way here would add not a little to the respectability of the family appearance even my cassock is becoming too holy for a parish priest not that i care about it so much only father otoole the baste had on a bran new onenot that i believe that he ever came honestly by it as i have by minebut get it how you may a new gown always looks better than an old one thats certain so no more at present from your loving friend and confessor urtagh mgrath now youll observe peter said obrien after i had read the letter that as i supposed your uncle meant mischief when he went over to ireland whether the children are both boys or both girls or your uncles is a boy and the other is a girl there is no knowing at present if an exchange was required its made thats certain but i will write again to father mgrath and insist upon his finding out the truth if possible have you any letter from your father none i am sorry to say i wish i had for he would not have failed to speak on the subject well never mind its no use dreaming over the matter we must do our best when we get to england ourselves and in the meantime trust to father mgrath ill go and write to him while my minds full of it obrien wrote his letter and the subject was not started again chapter xxxvii captain kearneys illnesshe makes his will and devises sundry chateaux en espagne for the benefit of those concernedthe legacy duty in this instance not ruinoushe signs seals and dies the captain as was his custom went on shore and took up his quarters at a friends house that is to say the house of an acquaintance or any polite gentleman who would ask him to take a dinner and a bed this was quite sufficient for captain kearney who would fill his portmanteau and take up his quarters without thinking of leaving them until the ship sailed or some more advantageous invitation was given this conduct in england would have very much trespassed on our ideas of hospitality but in our foreign settlements and colonies where the society is confined and novelty is desirable a person who could amuse like captain kearney was generally welcome let him stay as long as he pleased all sailors agree in asserting that halifax is one of the most delightful ports in which a ship can anchor everybody is hospitable cheerful and willing to amuse and be amused it is therefore a very bad place to send a ship to if you wish her to refit in a hurry unless indeed the admiral is there to watch over your daily progress and a sharp commissioner to expedite your motions in the dockyard the admiral was there when we arrived and we should not have lain there long had not the health of captain kearney by the time that we were ready for sea been so seriously affected that the doctor was of opinion that he could not sail another frigate was sent to our intended cruisingground and we lay idle in port but we consoled ourselves if we did not make prizemoney at all events we were very happy and the major part of the officers very much in love we had remained in halifax harbour about three weeks when a very great change for the worse took place in captain kearneys disease disease indeed it could hardly be called he had been long suffering from the insidious attacks of a hot climate and though repeatedly advised to invalid he never would consent his constitution appeared now to be breaking up in a few days he was so ill that at the request of the naval surgeons he consented to be removed to the hospital where he could command more comforts than in any private house he had not been at the hospital more than two days when he sent for me and stated his wish that i should remain with him you know peter that you are a cousin of mine and one likes to have ones relations near one when we are sick so bring your traps on shore the doctor has promised me a nice little room for yourself and you shall come and sit with me all day i certainly had no objection to remain with him because i considered it my duty so to do and i must say that there was no occasion for me to make any effort to entertain him as he always entertained me but i could not help seriously reflecting and feeling much shocked at a man lying in so dangerous a statefor the doctors had pronounced his recovery to be impossiblestill continuing a system of falsehood during the whole day without intermission but it really appeared in him to be innate and as swinburne said if he told truth it was entirely by mistake peter said he one day theres a great draught shut the door and put on some more coals the fire does not draw well sir replied i without the door is open its astonishing how little people understand the nature of these things when i built my house called walcot abbey there was not a chimney would draw i sent for the architect and abused him but he could not manage it i was obliged to do it myself did you manage it sir manage iti think i did the first time i lighted the fire i opened the door and the draught was so great that my little boy william who was standing in the current of air would have gone right up the chimney if i had not caught him by the petticoats as it was his frock was on fire why sir it must have been as bad as a hurricane no no not quite so badbut it showed what a little knowledge of philosophical arrangement could effect we have no hurricanes in england peter but i have seen a very pretty whirlwind when i was at walcot abbey indeed sir yes it cut four square haystacks quite round and i lost twenty tons of hay it twisted the iron lamppost at the entrance just as a porpoise twists a harpoon and took up a sow and her litter of pigs that were about a hundred yards from the back of the house and landed them safe over the house to the front with the exception of the old sow putting her shoulder out indeed sir yes but what was strange there were a great many rats in the hayrick and up they went with the hay now peter by the laws of gravitation they naturally come down before the hay and i was walking with my greyhound or rather terrier and after one coming down close to her which she killed it was quite ridiculous to witness her looking up in the air and watching for the others a greyhound did you say sir or a terrier both peter the fact is she had been a greyhound but breaking her foreleg against a stump when coursing i had the other three amputated as well and then she made a capital terrier she was a great favourite of mine well observed i i have read something like that in baron munchausen mr simple said the captain turning on his elbow and looking me severely in the face what do you mean to imply oh nothing sir but i have read a story of that kind most probably the great art of invention is to found it upon facts there are some people who out of a molehill will make a mountain and facts and fiction become so blended nowadays that even truth becomes a matter of doubt very true sir replied i and as he did not speak for some minutes i ventured to bring my bible to his bedside as if i was reading it to myself what are you reading peter said he only a chapter in the bible sir said i would you like that i should read aloud yes im very fond of the bibleits the book of truth peter read me about jacob and his weathering esau with a mess of pottage and obtaining his fathers blessing i could not help thinking it singular that he should select a portion in which for divine reasons a lie was crowned with success and reward when i had finished it he asked me to read something more i turned over to the acts of the apostles and commenced the chapter in which ananias and sapphira were struck dead when i had finished he observed very seriously that is a very good lesson for young people peter and points out that you never should swerve from the truth recollect as your motto peter to tell truth and shame the devil after this observation i laid down the book as it appeared to me that he was quite unaware of his propensity and without a sense of your fault how can repentance and amendment be expected he became more feeble and exhausted every day and at last was so weak that he could scarcely raise himself in his bed one afternoon he said peter i shall make my will not that i am going to kick the bucket just yet but still it is every mans duty to set his house in order and it will amuse me so fetch pen and paper and come and sit down by me i did as he requested write peter that i anthony george william charles huskisson kearney my fathers name was anthony peter i was christened george after the present regent william and charles after mr pitt and mr fox who were my sponsors huskisson is the name of my great uncle whose property devolves to me hes eightythree now so he cant last longhave you written down that yes sir being in sound mind do hereby make my last will and testament revoking all former wills yes sir i bequeath to my dearly beloved wife augusta charlotte kearney she was named after the queen and princess augusta who held her at the baptismal font all my household furniture books pictures plate and houses for her own free use and will and to dispose of at her pleasure upon her demise is that down yes sir also the interest of all my money in the three percents reduced and in the long annuities and the balance in my agents hands for her natural life at her death to be divided into equal portions between my two children william mohamed potemkin kearney and caroline anastasia kearney is that down yes sir well then peter now for my real property my estate in kent let me see what is the name of itwalcot abbey my three farms in the vale of aylesbury and the marsh lands in norfolk i bequeath to my two children aforenamed the proceeds of the same to be laid up deducting all necessary expenses for their education for their sole use and benefit is that down not yet siruse and benefit now it is sir until they come to the age of twentyone years or in case of my daughter until she marries with the consent of my executors then to be equally and fairly valued and divided between them you observe peter i never make any difference between girls and boysa good father will leave one child as much as another now ill take my breath a little i was really astonished it was well known that captain kearney had nothing but his pay and that it was the hopes of prizemoney to support his family which had induced him to stay out so long in the west indies it was laughable yet i could not laugh there was a melancholy feeling at such a specimen of insanity which prevented me now peter well go on said captain kearney after a pause of a few minutes i have a few legacies to bequeath first to all my servants l each and two suits of mourning to my nephew thomas kearney of kearney hall yorkshire i bequeath the sword presented me by the grand sultan i promised it to him and although we have quarrelled and not spoken for years i always keep my word the plate presented me by the merchants and underwriters of lloyds i leave to my worthy friend the duke of newcastle is that down yes sir well my snuffbox presented me by prince potemkin i bequeath to admiral sir isaac coffin and also i release him from the mortgage which i hold over his property of the madeline islands in north america bythebye say and further i bequeath to him the bag of snuff presented to me by the dey of algiers he may as well have the snuff as he has the snuffbox is that down yes sir well then now peter i must leave you something oh never mind me replied i no no peter i must not forget my cousin let me see you shall have my fighting sword a real good one i can tell you i once fought a duel with it at palermo and ran a sicilian prince so clean through the body and it held so tight that we were obliged to send for a pair of posthorses to pull it out again put that down as a legacy for my cousin peter simple i believe that is all now for my executors and i request my particular friends the earl of londonderry the marquis of chandos and mr john lubbock banker to be my executors and leave each of them the sum of one thousand pounds for their trouble and in token of regard that will do peter now as i have left so much real property it is necessary that there should be three witnesses so call in two more and let me sign in your presence this order was obeyed and this strange will duly attested for i hardly need say that even the presents he had pretended to receive were purchased by himself at different times but such was the force of his ruling passion even to the last mr phillott and obrien used to come and see him as did occasionally some of the other officers and he was always cheerful and merry and seemed to be quite indifferent about his situation although fully aware of it his stories if anything became more marvellous as no one ventured to express a doubt as to their credibility i had remained in the hospital about a week when captain kearney was evidently dying the doctor came felt his pulse and gave it as his opinion that he could not outlive the day this was on a friday and there certainly was every symptom of dissolution he was so exhausted that he could scarcely articulate his feet were cold and his eyes appeared glazed and turned upwards the doctor remained an hour felt his pulse again shook his head and said to me in a low voice he is quite gone as soon as the doctor quitted the room captain kearney opened his eyes and beckoned me to him hes a confounded fool peter said he he thinks i am slipping my wind nowbut i know better going i am tis truebut i shant die till next thursday strange to say from that moment he rallied and although it was reported that he was dead and the admiral had signed the acting order for his successor the next morning to the astonishment of everybody captain kearney was still alive he continued in this state between life and death until the thursday next the day on which he asserted that he would dieand on that morning he was evidently sinking fast towards noon his breathing became much oppressed and irregular and he was evidently dying the rattle in his throat commenced and i watched at his bedside waiting for his last gasp when he again opened his eyes and beckoning me with an effort to put my head close to him to hear what he had to say he contrived in a sort of gurgling whisper and with much difficulty to utterpeter im going nownot that the rattlein my throatis a sign of death for i once knew a manto live withthe rattle in his throatfor six weeks he fell back and expired having perhaps at his last gasp told the greatest lie of his whole life thus died this most extraordinary character who in most other points commanded respect he was a kind man and a good officer but from the idiosyncrasy of his disposition whether from habit or from nature could not speak the truth i say from nature because i have witnessed the vice of stealing equally strong and never to be eradicated it was in a young messmate of good family and who was supplied with money to almost any extent he was one of the most generous openhearted lads that i ever knew he would offer his purse or the contents of his chest to any of his messmates and at the same time would steal everything that he could lay his hands upon i have known him watch for hours to steal what could be of no use to him as for instance an odd shoe and that much too small for his foot what he stole he would give away the very next day but to check it was impossible it was so well known that if anything was missed we used first to apply to his chest to see if it was there and usually found the article in question he appeared to be wholly insensible to shame upon this subject though in every other he showed no want of feeling or of honour and strange to say he never covered his theft with a lie after vain attempts to cure him of this propensity he was dismissed the service as incorrigible captain kearney was buried in the churchyard with the usual military honours in his desk we found directions in his own hand relative to his funeral and the engraving on his tombstone in these he stated his aged to be thirtyone years if this was correct captain kearney from the time that he had been in the service of his country must have entered the navy just four months before he was born it was unfortunate that he commenced the inscription with here lies captain kearney c c his tombstone had not been set up twentyfour hours before somebody who knew his character put a dash under one word as emphatic as it was true of the living man here lies captain chapter xxxviii captain hortongloomy news from homeget over head and ears in the water and find myself afterwards growing one way and my clothes anotherthough neither as rich as a jew nor as large as a camel i pass through my examination which my brother candidates think passing strange the day after captain kearneys decease his acting successor made his appearance on board the character of captain horton was well known to us from the complaints made by the officers belonging to his ship of his apathy and indolence indeed he went by the soubriquet of the sloth it certainly was very annoying to his officers to witness so many opportunities of prizemoney and distinction thrown away through the indolence of his disposition captain horton was a young man of family who had advanced rapidly in the service from interest and from occasionally distinguishing himself in the several cuttingout expeditions on which he had not volunteered but had been ordered he had shown not only courage but a remarkable degree of coolness in danger and difficulty which had gained him much approbation but it was said that this coolness arose from his very faultan unaccountable laziness he would walk away as it were from the enemys fire when others would hasten merely because he was so apathetic that he would not exert himself to run in one cuttingout expedition in which he distinguished himself it is said that having to board a very high vessel and that in a shower of grape and musketry when the boat dashed alongside and the men were springing up he looked up at the height of the vessels sides and exclaimed with a look of despair my god must we really climb up that vessels decks when he had gained the deck and became excited he then proved how little fear had to do with the remark the captain of the ship falling by his hand as he fought in advance on his own men but this peculiarity which in a junior officer was of little consequence and a subject of mirth in a captain became of a very serious nature the admiral was aware how often he had neglected to annoy or capture the enemy when he might have done it and by such neglect captain horton infringed one of the articles of war the punishment awarded to which infringement is death his appointment therefore to the sanglier was as annoying to us as his quitting his former ship was agreeable to those on board of her as it happened it proved of little consequence the admiral had instructions from home to advance captain horton to the first vacancy which of course he was obliged to comply with but not wishing to keep on the station an officer who would not exert himself he resolved to send her to england with despatches and retain the other frigate which had been ordered home and which we had been sent up to replace we therefore heard it announced with feelings of joy mingled with regret that we were immediately to proceed to england for my part i was glad of it i had now served my time as midshipman to within five months and i thought that i had a better chance of being made in england than abroad i was also very anxious to go home for family reasons which i have already explained in a fortnight we sailed with several vessels and directions to take charge of a large convoy from quebec which was to meet us off the island of st johns in a few days we joined our convoy and with a fair wind bore up for england the weather soon became very bad and we were scudding before a heavy gale under bare poles our captain seldom quitted the cabin but remained there on a sofa stretched at his length reading a novel or dozing as he found most agreeable i recollect a circumstance which occurred which will prove the apathy of his disposition and how unfit he was to command so fine a frigate we had been scudding three days when the weather became much worse obrien who had the middle watch went down to report that it blew very hard very well said the captain let me know if it blows harder in about an hour more the gale increased and obrien went down again it blows much harder captain horton very well answered captain horton turning in his cot you may call me again when it blows harder at about six bells the gale was at its height and the wind roared in its fury down went obrien again it blows tremendous hard now captain horton well well if the weather becomes worse it cant be worse interrupted obrien its impossible to blow harder indeed well then replied the captain let me know when it lulls in the morning watch a similar circumstance took place mr phillott went down and said that several of the convoy were out of sight astern shall we heaveto captain horton oh no replied he she will be so uneasy let me know if you lose sight of any more in another hour the first lieutenant reported that there were very few to be seen very well mr phillott replied the captain turning round to sleep let me know if you lose any more some time elapsed and the first lieutenant reported that they were all out of sight very well then said the captain call me when you see them again this was not very likely to take place as we were going twelve knots an hour and running away from them as fast as we could so the captain remained undisturbed until he thought proper to get up to breakfast indeed we never saw any more of our convoy but taking the gale with us in fifteen days anchored in plymouth sound the orders came down for the frigate to be paid off all standing and recommissioned i received letters from my father in which he congratulated me at my name being mentioned in captain kearneys despatches and requested me to come home as soon as i could the admiral allowed my name to be put down on the books of the guardship that i might not lose my time and then gave me two months leave of absence i bade farewell to my shipmates shook hands with obrien who proposed to go over to ireland previous to his applying for another ship and with my pay in my pocket set off in the plymouth mail and in three days was once more in the arms of my affectionate mother and warmly greeted by my father and the remainder of my family once more with my family i must acquaint the reader with what had occurred since my departure my eldest sister lucy had married an officer in the army a captain fielding and his regiment having been ordered out to india had accompanied her husband and letters had been received just before my return announcing their safe arrival at ceylon my second sister mary had also been engaged to be married and from her infancy was of extremely delicate health she was very handsome and much admired her intended husband was a baronet of good family but unfortunately she caught a cold at the assize ball and went off in a decline she died about two months before my arrival and the family were in deep mourning my third sister ellen was still unmarried she also was a very beautiful girl and now seventeen my mothers constitution was much shaken by the loss of my sister mary and the separation from her eldest child as for my father even the loss of his daughter appeared to be wholly forgotten in the unwelcome intelligence which he had received that my uncles wife had been safely delivered of a son which threw him out of the anticipated titles and estates of my grandfather it was indeed a house of mourning my mothers grief i respected and tried all i could to console her that of my father was so evidently worldly and so at variance with his clerical profession that i must acknowledge i felt more of anger at it than sorrow he had become morose and sullen harsh to those around him and not so kind to my mother as her state of mind and health made it his duty to be even if inclination were wanted he seldom passed any portion of the day with her and in the evening she went to bed very early so that there was little communication between them my sister was a great consolation to her and so i hope was i she often said so as she embraced me and the tears rolled down her cheeks and i could not help surmising that those tears were doubled from the coolness and indifference if not unkindness with which my father behaved to her as for my sister she was an angel and as i witnessed her considerate attentions to my mother and the total forgetfulness of self which she displayed so different from my father who was all self i often thought what a treasure she would prove to any man who was fortunate enough to win her love such was the state of my family when i returned to it i had been at home about a week when one evening after dinner i submitted to my father the propriety of trying to obtain my promotion i can do nothing for you peter i have no interest whatever replied he moodily i do not think that much is required sir replied i my time will be served on the th of next month if i pass which i trust i shall be able to do my name having been mentioned in the public despatches will render it a point of no very great difficulty to obtain my commission at the request of my grandfather yes your grandfather might succeed i have no doubt but i think you have little chance now in that quarter my brother has a son and we are thrown out you are not aware peter how selfish people are and how little they will exert themselves for their relations your grandfather has never invited me since the announcement of my brothers increase to his family indeed i have never been near him for i know that it is of no use i must think otherwise of lord privilege my dear father until your opinion is confirmed by his own conduct that i am not so much an object of interest i grant but still he was very kind and appeared to be partial to me well well you can try all you can but youll soon see of what stuff this world is made i am sure i hope it will be so for what is to become of you children if i die i do not knowi have saved little or nothing and now all my prospects are blasted by this and my father dashed his fist upon the table in a manner by no means clerical and with a look very unworthy of an apostle i am sorry that i must thus speak of my father but i must not disguise the truth still i must say there was much in extenuation of his conduct he had always a dislike to the profession of the church his ambition as a young man had been to enter the army for which service he was much better qualified but as it has been the custom for centuries to entail all the property of the aristocracy upon the eldest son and leave the other brothers to be supported by the state or rather by the people who are taxed for their provision my father was not permitted to follow the bent of his own inclination an elder brother had already selected the army as his profession and it was therefore decided that my father should enter the church and thus it is that we have had and still have so many people in that profession who are not only totally unfit for but who actually disgrace their calling the law of primogeniture is beset with evils and injustice yet without it the aristocracy of a country must sink into insignificance it appears to me that as long as the people of a country are content to support the younger sons of the nobility it is well that the aristocracy should be held up as a third estate and a link between the sovereign and the people but that if the people are either too poor or are unwilling to be so taxed they have a right to refuse taxation for such purposes and to demand that the law of primogeniture should be abolished i remained at home until my time was complete and then set off for plymouth to undergo my examination the passingday had been fixed by the admiral for the friday and as i arrived on wednesday i amused myself during the day walking about the dockyard and trying all i could to obtain further information in my profession on the thursday a party of soldiers from the depot were embarking at the landingplace in menofwar boats and as i understood were about to proceed to india i witnessed the embarkation and waited till they shoved off and then walked to the anchor wharf to ascertain the weights of the respective anchors of the different classes of vessels in the kings service i had not been there long when i was attracted by the squabbling created by a soldier who it appeared had quitted the ranks to run up to the tap in the dockyard to obtain liquor he was very drunk and was followed by a young woman with a child in her arms who was endeavouring to pacify him now be quiet patrick jewel said she clinging to him sure its enough that youve left the ranks and will come to disgrace when you get on board now be quiet patrick and let us ask for a boat and then perhaps the officer will think it was all a mistake and let you off aisy and sure ill speak to mr orourke and hes a kind man out wid you you cratur it is mr orourke youd be having a conversation wid and he be chucking you under that chin of yours out wid you mary and lave me to find my way on board is it a boat i want when i can swim like st patrick wid my head under my arm if it wasnt on my shoulders at all events i can wid my nappersack and musket to boot the young woman cried and tried to restrain him but he broke from her and running down to the wharf dashed off into the water the young woman ran to the edge of the wharf perceived him sinking and shrieking with despair threw up her arms in her agony the child fell struck on the edge of the piles turned over and before i could catch hold of it sank into the sea the child the child burst forth in another wild scream and the poor creature lay at my feet in violent fits i looked over the child had disappeared but the soldier was still struggling with his head above water he sank and rose againa boat was pulling towards him but he was quite exhausted he threw back his arms as if in despair and was about disappearing under a wave when no longer able to restrain myself i leaped off the high wharf and swam to his assistance just in time to lay hold of him as he was sinking for the last time i had not been in the water a quarter of a minute before the boat came up to us and dragged us on board the soldier was exhausted and speechless i of course was only very wet the boat rowed to the landingplace at my request and we were both put on shore the knapsack which was fixed on the soldiers back and his regimentals indicated that he belonged to the regiment just embarked and i stated my opinion that as soon as he was a little recovered he had better be taken on board as the boat which picked us up was one of the menofwar boats the officer who had been embarking the troops and had been sent on shore again to know if there were any yet left behind consented in a few minutes the soldier recovered and was able to sit up and speak and i only waited to ascertain the state of the poor young woman whom i had left on the wharf in a few minutes she was led to us by the warder and the scene between her and her husband was most affecting when she had become a little composed she turned round to me where i stood dripping wet and intermingled with lamentation for the child showering down emphatic blessings on my head inquired my name give it to me she cried give it to me on paper in writing that i may wear it next my heart read and kiss it every day of my life and never forget to pray for you and to bless you ill tell it you my name nay write it down for mewrite it down sure youll not refuse me all the saints bless you dear young man for saving a poor woman from despair the officer commanding the boat handed me a pencil and a card i wrote my name and gave it to the poor woman she took my hand as i gave it kissed the card repeatedly and put it into her bosom the officer impatient to shove off ordered her husband into the boatshe followed clinging to him wet as he wasthe boat shoved off and i hastened up to the inn to dry my clothes i could not help observing at the time how the fear of a greater evil will absorb all consideration for a minor satisfied that her husband had not perished she had hardly once appeared to remember that she had lost her child i had only brought one suit of clothes with me they were in very good condition when i arrived but salt water plays the devil with a uniform i laid in bed until they were dry but when i put them on again not being before too large for me for i grew very fast they were now shrunk and shrivelled up so as to be much too small my wrists appeared below the sleeves of my coatmy trousers had shrunk half way up to my kneesthe buttons were all tarnished and altogether i certainly did not wear the appearance of a gentlemanly smart midshipman i would have ordered another suit but the examination was to take place at ten oclock the next morning and there was no time i was therefore obliged to appear as i was on the quarterdeck of the lineofbattle ship on board of which the passing was to take place many others were there to undergo the same ordeal all strangers to me and as i perceived by their nods and winks to each other as they walked up and down in their smart clothes not at all inclined to make my acquaintance there were many before me on the list and our hearts beat every time that a name was called and the owner of it walked aft into the cabin some returned with jocund faces and our hopes mounted with the anticipation of similar good fortune others came out melancholy and crestfallen and then the expression of their countenances was communicated to our own and we quailed with fear and apprehension i have no hesitation in asserting that although passing may be a proof of being qualified not passing is certainly no proof to the contrary i have known many of the cleverest young men turned back while others of inferior abilities have succeeded merely from the feeling of awe occasioned by the peculiarity of the situation and it is not to be wondered at when it is considered that all the labour and exertion of six years are at stake at this appalling moment at last my name was called and almost breathless from anxiety i entered the cabin where i found myself in presence of the three captains who were to decide whether i were fit to hold a commission in his majestys service my logs and certificates were examined and approved my time calculated and allowed to be correct the questions in navigation which were put to me were very few for the best of all possible reasons that most captains in his majestys service know little or nothing of navigation during their servitude as midshipmen they learn it by rote without being aware of the principles upon which the calculations they use are founded as lieutenants their services as to navigation are seldom required and they rapidly forget all about it as captains their whole remnant of mathematical knowledge consists in being able to set down the ships position on the chart as for navigating the ship the master is answerable and the captains not being responsible themselves they trust entirely to his reckoning of course there are exceptions but what i state is the fact and if an order from the admiralty was given that all captains should pass again although they might acquit themselves very well in seamanship nineteen out of twenty would be turned back when they were questioned in navigation it is from the knowledge of this fact that i think the service is injured by the present system and the captain should be held wholly responsible for the navigation of his ship it has been long known that the officers of every other maritime state are more scientific than our own which is easily explained from the responsibility not being invested in our captains the origin of masters in our service is singular when england first became a maritime power ships for the kings service were found by the cinque ports and other partiesthe fighting part of the crew was composed of soldiers sent on board all the vessels at that time had a crew of sailors with a master to navigate the vessel during our bloody naval engagements with the dutch the same system was acted upon i think it was the earl of sandwich of whom it is stated that his ship being in a sinking state he took a boat to hoist his flag on board of another vessel in the fleet but a shot cutting the boat in two and the weight of his armour bearing him down the earl of sandwich perished but to proceed as soon as i had answered several questions satisfactorily i was desired to stand up the captain who had interrogated me on navigation was very grave in his demeanour towards me but at the same time not uncivil during his examination he was not interfered with by the other two who only undertook the examination in seamanship the captain who now desired me to stand up spoke in a very harsh tone and quite frightened me i stood up pale and trembling for i augured no good from this commencement several questions in seamanship were put to me which i have no doubt i answered in a very lame way for i cannot even now recollect what i said i thought so observed the captain i judged as much from your appearance an officer who is so careless of his dress as not even to put on a decent coat when he appears at his examination generally turns out an idle fellow and no seaman one would think you had served all your time in a cutter or a tengun brig instead of dashing frigates come sir ill give you one more chance i was so hurt at what the captain said that i could not control my feelings i replied with a quivering lip that i had had no time to order another uniformand i burst into tears indeed burrows you are rather too harsh said the third captain the lad is frightened let him sit down and compose himself for a little while sit down mr simple and we will try you again directly i sat down checking my grief and trying to recall my scattered senses the captains in the meantime turning over the logs to pass away the time the one who had questioned me in navigation reading the plymouth newspaper which had a few minutes before been brought on board and sent into the cabin heh whats this i say burrowskeats look here and he pointed to a paragraph mr simple may i ask whether it was you who saved the soldier who leaped off the wharf yesterday yes sir replied i and thats the reason why my uniforms are so shabby i spoilt them then and had no time to order others i did not like to say why they were spoilt i saw a change in the countenances of all the three and it gave me courage indeed now that my feelings had found vent i was no longer under any apprehension come mr simple stand up again said the captain kindly that is if you feel sufficiently composed if not we will wait a little longer dont be afraid we wish to pass you i was not afraid and stood up immediately i answered every question satisfactorily and finding that i did so they put more difficult ones very good very good indeed mr simple now let me ask you one more its seldom done in the service and perhaps you may not be able to answer it do you know how to clubhaul a ship yes sir replied i having as the reader may recollect witnessed the manoeuvre when serving under poor captain savage and i immediately stated how it was to be done that is sufficient mr simple i wish to ask you no more questions i thought at first you were a careless officer and no seaman i now find that you are a good seaman and a gallant young man do you wish to ask any more questions continued he turning to the two others they replied in the negative my passing certificate was signed and the captains did me the honour to shake hands with me and wish me speedy promotion thus ended happily this severe trial to my poor nerves and as i came out of the cabin no one could have imagined that i had been in such distress within when they beheld the joy that irradiated my countenance chapter xxxix is a chapter of plotscatholic casuistry in a new cassockplotting promotes promotiona peasants love and a peers peevishnessprospects of prosperity as soon as i arrived at the hotel i sent for a plymouth paper and cut out the paragraph which had been of such importance to me in my emergency and the next morning returned home to receive the congratulations of my family i found a letter from obrien which had arrived the day before it was as follows my dear petersome people they say are lucky to have a father born before them because they are helped on in the worldupon which principle mine was born after me thats certain however that cant be helped i found all my family well and hearty but they all shook a cloth in the wind with respect to toggery as for father mgraths cassock he didnt complain of it without reason it was the ghost of a garment but however with the blessing of god my last quarterly bill and the help of a tailor we have had a regular refit and the ancient family of the obriens of ballyhinch are now rigged from stem to starn my two sisters are both to be spliced to young squireens in the neighbourhood it appears that they only wanted for a dacent town gown to go to the church in they will be turned off next friday and i only wish peter you were here to dance at the weddings never mind ill dance for you and for myself too in the meantime ill just tell you what father mgrath and i have been doing all about and consarning that thief of an uncle of yours its very little or nothing at all that father mgrath did before i came back seeing as how father otoole had a new cassock and father mgraths was so shabby that he couldnt face him under such a disadvantage but still father mgrath spied about him and had several hints from here and from there all of which when i came to add them up amounted to just nothing at all but since i came home we have been busy father mgrath went down to ballycleuch as bold as a lion in his new clothing swearing that hed lead father otoole by the nose for slamming the door in his face and so he would have done if he could have found him but as he wasnt to be found father mgrath came back again just as wise and quite as brave as he went out so peter i just took a walk that way myself and as i surrounded the old house where your uncle had taken up his quarters who should i meet but the little girl ella flanagan who was in his service and i said to myself theres two ways of obtaining things in this world one is for love and the other is for money the obriens are better off in the first article than in the last as most of their countrymen are so ive been spending it very freely in your service peter sure says i you are the little girl that my eyes were ever looking upon when last i was in this way and who are you says she lieutenant obrien of his majestys service just come home for a minute to look out for a wife says i and its one about your make and shape and discretion that would please my fancy and then i praised her eyes and her nose and her forehead and so downwards until i came to the soles of her feet and asked her leave to see her again and when she would meet me in the wood and tell me her mind at first she thought sure enough that i couldnt be in earnest but i swore by all the saints that she was the prettiest girl in the partsand so she is altogetherand then she listened to my blarney the devil a word did i say about your uncle or your aunt or father mgrath that she might not suspect for ive an idea that theyre all in the story i only talked about my love for her pretty self and that blinded her as it will all women cute as they may be and now peter its three weeks last sunday that ive been bespeaking this poor girl for your sake and my conscience tells me that its not right to make the poor crature fond of me seeing as how that i dont care a fig for her in the way of a wife and in any other way it would be the ruin of the poor thing i have spoken to father mgrath on the subject who says that we may do evil that good may come and that if she has been a party to the deceit its nothing but proper that she should be punished in this world and that will perhaps save her in the next still i dont like it peter and its only for you among the living that id do such a thing for the poor creature now hangs upon me so fondly and talks about the weddingday and tells me long stories about the connections which have taken place between the oflanagans and the obriens times bygone when they were all in their glory yesterday as we sat in the wood with her arm round my waist ella dear says i who are these people that you stay with and then she told me all she knew about their history and how mary sullivan was a nurse to the baby and what is the baby says i a boy sure says she and sullivans baby thats a girl and is mary sullivan there now no says she its yestreen she left with her husband and baby to join the regiment thats going out to ingy yesterday she left says i starting up yes replies she and what do you care about them its very much i care replied i for a little bird has whispered a secret to me and what may that be says she only that the childer were changed and you know it as well as i do but she swore that she knew nothing about it and that she was not there when either of the children was born and i believe that she told the truth well says i who tended the lady my own mother says ella and if it was so who can know but she then says i ella jewel ive made a vow that ill never marry till i find out the truth of this matter so the sooner you get it out of your mother the better then she cried very much and i was almost ready to cry too to see how the poor thing was vexed at the idea of not being married after a while she swabbed up her cheeks and kissing me wished me goodby swearing by all the saints that the truth should come out somehow or another its this morning that i saw her again as agreed upon yesterday and red her eyes were with weeping poor thing and she clung to me and begged me to forgive her and not to leave her and then she told me that her mother was startled when she put the question to her and chewed it and cursed her when she insisted upon the truth and how she had fallen on her knees and begged her mother not to stand in the way of her happiness as she would die if she did i leave you to guess if my heart didnt smite me when she said that peter but the mischief was done and how her mother had talked about her oath and father otoole and said that she would speak to him now peter im sure that the childer have been changed and that the nurse has been sent to the indies to be out of the way they say they were to go to plymouth the husbands name is of course osullivan so id recommend you to take a coach and see what you can do in that quarter in the meantime ill try all i can for the truth in this and will write again as soon as i can find out anything more all i want to do is to get father mgrath to go to the old devil of a mother and ill answer for it hell frighten her into swearing anything god bless you peter and give my love to all the family yours ever terence obrien this letter of obrien was the subject of much meditation the advice to go to plymouth was too late the troops having sailed some time and i had no doubt but that mary sullivan and her husband were among those who had embarked at the time that i was at that port to pass my examination show the letter to my father i would not as it would only have put him in a fever and his interference would in all probability have done more harm than good i therefore waited quietly for more intelligence and resolved to apply to my grandfather to obtain my promotion a few days afterwards i set off for eagle park and arrived about eleven oclock in the morning i sent in my name and was admitted into the library where i found lord privilege in his easy chair as usual well child said he remaining on his chair and not offering even one finger to me what do you want that you come here without an invitation only my lord to inquire after your health and to thank you for your kindness to me in procuring me and mr obrien the appointment to a fine frigate yes replied his lordship i recollecti think i did so at your request and i think i heard some one say that you have behaved well and had been mentioned in the despatches yes my lord replied i and i have since passed my examination for lieutenant well child im glad to hear it remember me to your father and family and his lordship cast his eyes down upon the book which he had been reading my fathers observations appeared to be well grounded but i would not leave the room until i had made some further attempt has your lordship heard from my uncle yes replied he i had a letter from him yesterday the child is quite well i expect them all here in a fortnight or three weeks to live with me altogether i am oldgetting very old and i shall have much to arrange with your uncle before i die if i might request a favour of your lordship it would be to beg that you would interest yourself a little in obtaining my promotion a letter from your lordship to the first lordonly a few lines well child i see no objectiononlyi am very old too old to write now and his lordship again commenced reading i must do lord privilege the justice to state that he evidently was fast verging to a state of second childhood he was much bowed down since i had last seen him and appeared infirm in body as well as mind i waited at least a quarter of an hour before his lordship looked up what not gone yet child i thought you had gone home your lordship was kind enough to say that you had no objection to write a few lines to the first lord in my behalf i trust your lordship will not refuse me well replied he peevishly so i didbut i am too old too old to writei cannot seei can hardly hold a pen will your lordship allow me the honour of writing the letter for your lordships signature well childyesive no objection write as followsnowrite anything you pleaseand ill sign it i wish your uncle william were come this was more than i did i had a great mind to show him obriens letter but i thought it would be cruel to raise doubts and harass the mind of a person so close to the brink of the grave the truth would never be ascertained during his life i thought and why therefore should i give him pain at all events although i had the letter in my pocket i resolved not to make use of it except as a dernier resort i went to another table and sat down to write the letter as his lordship had said that i might write what i pleased it occurred to me that i might assist obrien and i felt sure that his lordship would not take the trouble to read the letter i therefore wrote as follows while lord privilege continued to read his book my lordyou will confer a very great favour upon me if you will hasten the commission which i have no doubt is in preparation for my nephew mr simple who has passed his examination and has been mentioned in the public despatches and also that you will not lose sight of lieutenant obrien who has so distinguished himself by his gallantry in the various cuttingout expeditions in the west indies trusting that your lordship will not fail to comply with my earnest request i have the honour to be your lordships very obedient humble servant i brought this letter with a pen full of ink and the noise of my approach induced his lordship to look up he stared at first as having forgotten the whole circumstancethen saidoh yes i recollect so i didgive me the pen with a trembling hand he signed his name and gave me back the letter without reading it as i expected there child dont tease me any more goodbye remember me to your father i wished his lordship a good morning and went away well satisfied with the result of my expedition on my arrival i showed the letter to my father who was much surprised at my success and he assured me that my grandfathers interest was so great with the administration that i might consider my promotion as certain that no accident might happen i immediately set off for london and delivered the letter at the door of the first lord with my own hands leaving my address with the porter chapter xl obrien and myself take a step each pari passua family reunion productive of anything but unitymy uncle not always the best friend a few days afterwards i left my card with my address with the first lord and the next day received a letter from his secretary which to my delight informed me that my commission had been made out some days before i hardly need say that i hastened to take it up and when paying my fee to the clerk i ventured at a hazard to inquire whether he knew the address of lieutenant obrien no replied he i wish to find it out for he has this day been promoted to the rank of commander i almost leaped with joy when i heard this good news i gave obriens address to the clerk hastened away with my invaluable piece of parchment in my hand and set off immediately for my fathers house but i was met with sorrow my mother had been taken severely ill and i found the house in commotiondoctors and apothecaries and nurses running to and fro my father in a state of excitement and my dear sister in tears spasm succeeded spasm and although every remedy was applied the next evening she breathed her last i will not attempt to describe the grief of my father who appeared to feel remorse at his late unkind treatment of her my sister and myself these scenes must be imagined by those who have suffered under similar bereavements i exerted myself to console my poor sister who appeared to cling to me as to her only support and after the funeral was over we recovered our tranquillity although the mourning was still deeper in our hearts than in our outward dress i had written to obrien to announce the mournful intelligence and like a true friend he immediately made his appearance to console me obrien had received the letter from the admiralty acquainting him with his promotion and two days after he arrived went to take up his commission i told him frankly by what means he had obtained it and he again concluded his thanks by a reference to the mistake of the former supposition that of my being the fool of the family by the powers it would be well for any man if he had a few of such foolish friends about him continued he but i wont blarney you peter you know what my opinion always has been so well say no more about it when he came back we had a long consultation as to the best method of proceeding to obtain employment for obrien was anxious to be again afloat and so was i i regretted parting with my sister but my father was so morose and illtempered that i had no pleasure at home except in her company indeed my sister was of opinion that it would be better if i were away as my fathers misanthropy now unchecked by my mother appeared to have increased and he seemed to view me with positive dislike it was therefore agreed unanimously between my sister and me and obrien who was always of our councils that it would be advisable that i should be again afloat i can manage him much better when alone peter i shall have nothing to occupy me and take me away from him as your presence does now and painful as it is to part with you my duty to my father and my wish for your advancement induce me to request that you will if possible find some means of obtaining employment spoken like a hero as ye are miss ellen notwithstanding your pretty face and soft eyes said obrien and now peter for the means to bring it about if i can get a ship there is no fear for you as i shall choose you for my lieutenant but how is that to be managed do you think that you can come over the old gentleman at eagle park at all events ill try replied i i can but be floored obrien accordingly the next day i set off for my grandfathers and was put down at the lodge at the usual hour about eleven oclock i walked up the avenue and knocked at the door when it was opened i perceived a hesitation among the servants and a constrained air which i did not like i inquired after lord privilegethe answer was that he was pretty well but did not see any body is my uncle here said i yes sir replied the servant with a significant look and all his family are here too are you sure that i cannot see my grandfather said i laying a stress upon the word i will tell him that you are here sir replied the man but even that is against orders i had never seen my uncle since i was a child and could not even recollect himmy cousins or my aunt i had never met with in a minute an answer was brought requesting that i would walk into the library when i was ushered in i found myself in the presence of lord privilege who sat in his usual place and a tall gentleman whom i knew at once to be my uncle from his likeness to my father here is the young gentleman my lord said my uncle looking at me sternly heh whatoh i recollect well child so youve been behaving very illsorry to hear it goodbye behaving ill my lord replied i i am not aware of having so done reports are certainly very much against you nephew observed my uncle drily some one has told your grandfather what has much displeased him i know nothing about it myself then some rascal has slandered me sir replied i my uncle started at the word rascal and then recovering himself replied well nephew what is it that you require of lord privilege for i presume this visit is not without a cause sir replied i my visit to lord privilege was first to thank him for having procured me my commission as lieutenant and to request the favour that he would obtain me active employment which a line from him will effect immediately i was not aware nephew that you had been made lieutenant but i agree with you that the more you are at sea the better his lordship shall sign the letter sit down shall i write it sir said i to my uncle i know what to say yes and bring it to me when it is written i felt convinced that the only reason which induced my uncle to obtain me employment was the idea that i should be better out of the way and that there was more risk at sea than on shore i took a sheet of paper and wrote as follows my lordmay i request that your lordship will be pleased to appoint the bearer of this to a ship as soon as convenient as i wish him to be actively employed i am my lord c c why not mention your name it is of no consequence replied i as it will be delivered in person and that will insure my speedy appointment the letter was placed before his lordship for signature it was with some difficulty that he was made to understand that he was to sign it the old gentleman appeared much more imbecile than when i last saw him i thanked him folded up the letter and put it in my pocket at last he looked at me and a sudden flash of recollection appeared to come across his mind well child so you escaped from the french prisonheh and hows your friendwhat is his name heh obrien my lord obrien cried my uncle he is your friend then sir i presume it is to you that i am indebted for all the inquiries and reports which are so industriously circulated in irelandthe tampering with my servants and other impertinences i did not choose to deny the truth although i was a little fluttered by the sudden manner in which it came to light i replied i never tamper with any peoples servants sir no said he but you employ others so to do i discovered the whole of your proceedings after the scoundrel left for england if you apply the word scoundrel to captain obrien sir in his name i contradict it as you please sir replied my uncle in a passion but you will oblige me by quitting this house immediately and expect nothing more either from the present or the future lord privilege except that retaliation which your infamous conduct has deserved i felt much irritated and replied very sharply from the present lord privilege i certainly expect nothing more neither do i from his successor but after your death uncle i expect that the person who succeeds to the title will do all he can for your humble servant i wish you a good morning uncle my uncles eyes flashed fire as i finished my speech which indeed was a very bold and a very foolish one too as it afterwards proved i hastened out of the room not only from the fear of being turned out of the house before all the servants but also from the dread that my letter to the first lord might be taken from me by force but i shall never forget the scowl of vengeance which crossed my uncles brows as i turned round and looked at him as i shut the door i found my way out without the assistance of the servants and hastened home as fast as i could obrien said i on my return there is no time to be lost the sooner you hasten to town with this letter of introduction the better it will be for depend upon it my uncle will do me all the harm that he can i then repeated to him all that had passed and it was agreed that obrien should take the letter which having reference to the bearer would do as well for him as for me and if obrien obtained an appointment i was sure not only of being one of his lieutenants but also of sailing with a dear friend the next morning obrien set off for london and fortunately saw the first lord the day after his arrival which was a levee day the first lord received the letter from obrien and requested him to sit down he then read it inquired after his lordship asked whether his health was good c obrien replied that with the blessing of god his lordship might live many years that he had never heard him complain of ill health all which was not false if not true i could not help observing to obrien when he returned home and told me what had passed that i thought considering what he had expressed with respect to white lies and black lies that he had not latterly adhered to his own creed thats very true peter and ive thought of it myself but it is my creed nevertheless we all know whats right but we dont always follow it the fact is i begin to think that it is absolutely necessary to fight the world with its own weapons i spoke to father mgrath on the subject and he repliedthat if anyone by doing wrong necessitated another to do wrong to circumvent him that the first party was answerable not only for his own sin but also for the sin committed in selfdefence but obrien i do not fix my faith so implicitly upon father mgrath and i do not much admire many of his directions no more do i peter when i think upon them but how am i to puzzle my head upon these points all i know is that when you are divided between your inclination and your duty its mighty convenient to have a priest like father mgrath to decide for you and to look after your soul into the bargain it occurred to me that i myself when finding fault with obrien had in the instance of both the letters from lord privilege been also guilty of deceit i was therefore blaming him for the same fault committed by myself and i am afraid that i was too ready in consoling myself with father mgraths maxim that one might do evil that good might come but to return to obriens interview after some little conversation the first lord said captain obrien i am always very ready to oblige lord privilege and the more so as his recommendation is of an officer of your merit in a day or two if you call at the admiralty you will hear further obrien wrote to us immediately and we waited with impatience for his next letter but instead of the letter he made his appearance on the third day and first hugged me in his arms he then came to my sister embraced her and skipped and danced about the room what is the matter obrien said i while ellen retreated in confusion obrien pulled a parchment out of his pocket here peter my dear peter now for honour and glory an eighteengun brig peter the rattlesnakecaptain obrienwest india station by the holy father my hearts bursting with joy and down he sank into an easy chair ant i almost beside myself inquired he after a short pause ellen thinks so i dare say replied i looking at my sister who stood in the corner of the room thinking obrien was really out of his senses and still red with confusion obrien who then called to mind what a slip of decorum he had been guilty of immediately rose and resuming his usual unsophisticated politeness as he walked up to my sister took her hand and said excuse me my dear miss ellen i must apologize for my rudeness but my delight was so great and my gratitude to your brother so intense that i am afraid that in my warmth i allowed the expression of my feelings to extend to one so dear to him and so like him in person and in mind will you only consider that you received the overflowings of a grateful heart towards your brother and for his sake pardon my indiscretion ellen smiled and held out her hand to obrien who led her to the sofa where we all three sat down and he then commenced a more intelligible narrative of what had passed he had called on the day appointed and sent up his card the first lord could not see him but referred him to the private secretary who presented him with his commission to the rattlesnake eighteengun brig the secretary smiled most graciously and told obrien in confidence that he would proceed to the west india station as soon as his vessel was manned and ready for sea he inquired of obrien whom he wished as his first lieutenant obrien replied that he wished for me but as in all probability i should not be of sufficient standing to be first lieutenant that the admiralty might appoint any other to the duty provided i joined the ship the secretary made a minute of obriens wish and requested him if he had a vacancy to spare as midshipman to allow him to send one on board to which obrien willingly acceded shook hands with him and obrien quitted the admiralty to hasten down to us with the pleasing intelligence and now said obrien i have made up my mind how to proceed i shall first run down to plymouth and hoist my pennant then i shall ask for a fortnights leave and go to ireland to see how they get on and what father mgrath may be about so peter lets pass this evening as happily as we can for though you and i shall soon meet again yet it may be years or perhaps never that we three shall sit down on the same sofa as we do now ellen who was still nervous from the late death of my mother looked down and i perceived the tears start in her eyes at the remark of obrien that perhaps we should never meet again and i did pass a happy evening i had a dear sister on one side of me and a sincere friend on the other how few situations more enviable obrien left us early the next morning and at breakfasttime a letter was handed to my father it was from my uncle coldly communicating to him that lord privilege had died the night before very suddenly and informing him that the burial would take place on that day week and that the will would be opened immediately after the funeral my father handed the letter over to me without saying a word and sipped his tea with his teaspoon i cannot say that i felt very much on the occasion but i did feel because he had been kind to me at one time as for my fathers feelings i could notor rather i should say i did not wish to analyze them as soon as he had finished his cup of tea he left the breakfasttable and went into his study i then communicated the intelligence to my sister ellen my god said she after a pause putting her hand up to her eyes what a strange unnatural state of society must we have arrived at when my father can thus receive the intelligence of a parents death is it not dreadful it is my dearest girl replied i but every feeling has been sacrificed to worldly considerations and an empty name the younger sons have been neglected if not deserted virtue talent everything set at naughtintrinsic value despisedand the only claim to consideration admitted that of being the heir entail when all the ties of nature are cast loose by the parents can you be surprised if the children are no longer bound by them most truly do you observe that it is a detestable state of society i did not say detestable brother i said strange and unnatural had you said what i said ellen you would not have been wrong i would not for the title and wealth which it brings be the heartless isolated i may say neglected being that my grandfather was were it offered now i would not barter for it ellens love ellen threw herself in my arms we then walked into the garden where we had a long conversation relative to our future wishes hopes and prospects chapter xli pompous obsequiesthe reading of the will not exactly after wilkiei am left a legacywhat becomes of itmy father very warm writes a sermon to cool himselfi join obriens brig and fall in with swinburne on that day week i accompanied my father to eagle park to assist at the burial of lord privilege we were ushered into the room where the body had laid in state for three days the black hangings the lofty plumes the rich ornaments on the coffin and the number of wax candles with which the room was lighted produced a solemn and grand effect i could not help as i leaned against the balustrade before the coffin and thought of its contents calling to mind when my poor grandfathers feelings seemed as it were inclined to thaw in my favour when he called me his child and in all probability had not my uncle had a son would have died in my arms fond and attached to me for my own sake independently of worldly considerations i felt that had i known him longer i could have loved him and that he would have loved me and i thought to myself how little all these empty honours after his decease could compensate for the loss of those reciprocal feelings which would have so added to his happiness during his existence but he had lived for pomp and vanity and pomp and vanity attended him to his grave i thought of my sister ellen and of obrien and walked away with the conviction that peter simple might have been an object of envy to the late right honourable lord viscount privilege baron corston lord lieutenant of the county and one of his majestys most honourable privy councillors when the funeral which was very tedious and very splendid was over we all returned in the carriages to eagle park when my uncle who had of course assumed the title and who had attended as chief mourner was in waiting to receive us we were shown into the library and in the chair so lately and constantly occupied by my grandfather sat the new lord near to him were the lawyers with parchments lying before them as we severally entered he waved his hand to unoccupied chairs intimating to us to sit down but no words were exchanged except an occasional whisper between him and the lawyers when all the branches of the family were present down to the fourth and fifth cousins the lawyer on the right of my uncle put on his spectacles and unrolling the parchment commenced reading the will i paid attention to it at first but the legal technicalities puzzled me and i was soon thinking of other matters until after half an hours reading i was startled at the sound of my own name it was a bequest by codicil to me of the sum of ten thousand pounds my father who sat by me gave me a slight push to attract my attention and i perceived that his face was not quite so mournful as before i was rejoicing at this unexpected intelligence i called to mind what my father had said to me when we were returning from eagle park that my grandfathers attentions to me were as good as ten thousand pounds in his will and was reflecting how strange it was that he had hit upon the exact sum i also thought of what my father had said of his own affairs and his not having saved anything for his children and congratulated myself that i should now be able to support my dear sister ellen in case of any accident happening to my father when i was roused by another mention of my name it was a codicil dated about a week back in which my grandfather not pleased at my conduct revoked the former codicil and left me nothing i knew where the blow came from and i looked my uncle in the face a gleam of malignant pleasure was in his eyes which had been fixed on me waiting to receive my glance i returned it with a smile expressive of scorn and contempt and then looked at my father who appeared to be in a state of misery his head had fallen upon his breast and his hands were clasped although i was shocked at the blow for i knew how much the money was required i felt too proud to show it indeed i felt that i would not for worlds have exchanged situations with my uncle much less feelings for when those who remain meet to ascertain the disposition made by one who is summoned away to the tribunal of his maker of those worldly and perishable things which he must leave behind him feelings of rancour and illwill might for the time be permitted to subside and the memory of a departed brother be productive of charity and goodwill after a little reflection i felt that i could forgive my uncle not so my father the codicil which deprived me of my inheritance was the last of the will and the lawyer rolled up the parchment and took off his spectacles everybody rose my father seized his hat and telling me in a harsh voice to follow him tore off the crape weepers and then threw them on the floor as he walked away i also took off mine and laid them on the table and followed him my father called his carriage waited in the hall till it was driven up and jumped into it i followed him he drew up the blind and desired them to drive home not a sixpence by the god of heaven not a sixpence my name not even mentioned except for a paltry mourning ring and yourspray sir what have you been about after having such a sum left you to forfeit your grandfathers good opinion heh sirtell me directly continued he turning round to me in a rage nothing my dear father that im aware of my uncle is evidently my enemy and why should he be particularly your enemy peter there must be some reason for his having induced your grandfather to alter his bequest in your favour i insist upon it sir that you tell me immediately my dear father when you are more calm i will talk this matter over with you i hope i shall not be considered wanting in respect when i say that as a clergyman of the church of england dn the church of england and those that put me into it replied my father maddened with rage i was shocked and held my tongue my father appeared also to be confused at his hasty expressions he sank back in his carriage and preserved a gloomy silence until we arrived at our own door as soon as we entered my father hastened to his own room and i went up to my sister ellen who was in her bed room i revealed to her all that had passed and advised with her on the propriety of my communicating to my father the reasons which had occasioned my uncles extreme aversion towards me after much argument she agreed with me that the disclosure had now become necessary after the dinnercloth had been removed i then communicated to my father the circumstances which had come to our knowledge relative to my uncles establishment in ireland he heard me very attentively took out tablets and made notes well peter said he after a few minutes silence when i had finished i see clearly through this whole business i have no doubt but that a child has been substituted to defraud you and me of our just inheritance of the title and estates but i will now set to work and try if i cannot find out the secret and with the help of captain obrien and father mgrath i think it is not at all impossible obrien will do all that he can sir replied i and i expect soon to hear from him he must have now been a week in ireland i shall go there myself replied my father and there are no means that i will not resort to to discover this infamous plot no exclaimed he striking his fist on the table so as to shiver two of the wineglasses into fragmentsno means but i will resort to that is replied i my dear father no means which may be legitimately employed by one of your profession i tell you no means that can be used by man to recover his defrauded rights tell me not of legitimate means when i am to lose a title and property by a spurious and illegitimate substitution by the god of heaven i will meet them with fraud for fraud with false swearing for false swearing and with blood for blood if it should be necessary my brother has dissolved all ties and i will have my right even if i demand it with a pistol at his ear for heavens sake my dear father do not be so violentrecollect your profession i do replied he bitterly and how i was forced into it against my will i recollect my fathers words the solemn coolness with which he told me i had my choice of the church orto starvebut i have my sermon to prepare for tomorrow and i can sit here no longer tell ellen to send me in some tea i did not think my father was in a very fit state of mind to write a sermon but i held my tongue my sister joined me and we saw no more of him till breakfast the next day before we met i received a letter from obrien my dear peteri ran down to plymouth hoisted my pennant drew my jollies from the dockyard and set my first lieutenant to work getting in the ballast and watertanks i then set off for ireland and was very well received as captain obrien by my family who were all flourishing now that my two sisters are so well married off my father and mother are very comfortable but rather lonely for i believe i told you long before that it had pleased heaven to take all the rest of my brothers and sisters except the two now married and one who bore up for a nunnery dedicating her service to god after she was scarred with the smallpox and no man would look at her ever since the family have been grown up my father and mother have been lamenting and sorrowing that none of them would go off and now that theyre all gone off one way or another they cry all day because they are left all alone with no one to keep company with them except father mgrath and the pigs we never are to be contented in this world thats sartain and now that they are comfortable in every respect they find that they are very uncomfortable and having obtained all their wishes they wish everything back again but as old maddocks used to say a good growl is better than a bad dinner with some people and the greatest pleasure that they now have is to grumble and if that makes them happy they must be happy all day longfor the devil a bit do they leave off from morning till night the first thing that i did was to send for father mgrath who had been more away from home than usuali presume not finding things quite so comfortable as they used to be he told me that he had met with father otoole and had a bit of a dialogue with him which had ended in a bit of a row and that he had cudgelled father otoole well and tore his gown off his back and then tore it into shivers that father otoole had referred the case to the bishop and that was how the matter stood just then but says he the spalpeen has left this part of the country and what is more has taken ella and her mother with him and what is still worse no one could find out where they were gone but it was believed that they had all been sent over the water so you see peter that this is a bad job in one point which is that we have no chance of getting the truth out of the old woman for now that we have war with france who is to follow them on the other hand it is good news for it prevents me from decoying that poor young girl and making her believe what will never come to pass and i am not a little glad on that score for father mgrath was told by those who were about her that she did nothing but weep and moan for two days before she went away scolded as she was by her mother and threatened by that blackguard otoole it appears to me that all our hopes now are in finding out the soldier and his wife the wetnurse who were sent to indiano doubt with the hope that the climate and the fevers may carry them off that uncle of yours is a great blackguard every bit of him i shall leave here in three days and you must join me at plymouth make my compliments to your father and my regards to your sister whom may all the saints preserve god bless her for ever and ever amen yours ever terence obrien i put this letter into my fathers hands when he came out of his room this is a deeplaid plot said he and i think we must immediately do as obrien stateslook after the nurse who was sent to india do you know the regiment to which her husband belongs yes sir replied i it is the rd and she sailed for india about three months back the name you say i think is osullivan said he pulling out his tablets well i will write immediately to captain fielding and beg him to make the minutest inquiries i will also write to your sister lucy for women are much keener than men in affairs of this sort if the regiment is ordered to ceylon all the better if not he must obtain furlough to prosecute his inquiries when that is done i will go myself to ireland and try if we cannot trace the other parties my father then left the room and i retired with ellen to make preparations for joining my ship at plymouth a letter announcing my appointment had come down and i had written to request my commission to be forwarded to the clerk of the cheque at plymouth that i might save a useless journey to london on the following day i parted with my father and my dear sister and without any adventure arrived at plymouth dock where i met with obrien the same day i reported myself to the admiral and joined my brig which was lying alongside the hulk with her topmasts pointed through returning from the brig as i was walking up forestreet i observed a fine stout sailor whose back was turned to me reading the handbill which had been posted up everywhere announcing that the rattlesnake captain obrien about to proceed to the west india station where doubloons were so plentiful that dollars were only used for ballast was in want of a few stout hands it might have been said of a great many for we had not entered six men and were doing all the work with the marines and riggers of the dockyard but it is not the custom to show your poverty in this world either with regard to men or money i stopped and overheard him say ay as for the doubloons that cock wont fight ive served long enough in the west indies not to be humbugged but i wonder whether captain obrien was the second lieutenant of the sanglier if so i shouldnt mind trying a cruise with him i thought that i recollected the voice and touching him on the shoulder he turned round and it proved to be swinburne what swinburne said i shaking him by the hand for i was delighted to see him is it you why mr simple well then i expect that im right and that mr obrien is made and commands this craft when you meet the pilotfish the shark arnt far off you know youre very right swinburne said i in all except calling captain obrien a shark hes no shark no that he arnt except in one way that is that i expect hell soon show his teeth to the frenchmen but i beg your pardon sir and swinburne took off his hat oh i understand you did not perceive before that i had shipped the swab yes im lieutenant of the rattlesnake swinburne and hope youll join us theres my hand upon it mr simple said he smacking his great fist into mine so as to make it tingle im content if i know that the captains a good officer but when theres two i think myself lucky ill just take a boat and put my name on the books and then ill be on shore again to spend the rest of my money and try if i cant pick up a few hands as volunteers for i know where they all be stowed away i was looking at the craft this morning and rather took a fancy to her she has a dd pretty run but i hope captain obrien will take off her fiddlehead and get one carved i never knew a vessel do much with a fiddlehead i rather think that captain obrien has already applied to the commissioner on the subject replied i at all events it wont be very difficult to make the alteration ourselves to be sure not replied swinburne a coil of fourinch will make the body of the snake i can carve out the head and as for a rattle i be blessed if i dont rob one of those beggars of watchmen this very night so goodbye mr simple till we meet again swinburne kept his word he joined the ship that afternoon and the next day came off with six good hands who had been induced from his representations to join the brig tell captain obrien said he to me not to be in too great a hurry to man his ship i know where there are plenty to be had but ill try fair means first this he did and every day almost he brought off a man and all he did bring off were good able seamen others volunteered and we were now more than halfmanned and ready for sea the admiral then gave us permission to send pressgangs on shore mr simple said swinburne ive tried all i can to persuade a lot of fine chaps to enter but they wont now im resolved that my brig shall be well manned and if they dont know whats good for them i do and im sure that they will thank me for it afterwards so im determined to take every mothers son of them the same night we mustered all swinburnes men and went on shore to a crimps house which they knew surrounded it with our marines in blue jackets and took out of it twentythree fine able seamen which nearly filled up our complement the remainder we obtained by a draft from the admirals ship and i do not believe that there was a vessel that left plymouth harbour and anchored in the sound better manned than the rattlesnake so much for good character which is never lost upon seamen obrien was universally liked by those who had sailed with him and swinburne who knew him well persuaded many and forced the others to enter with him whether they liked it or not this they in the event did and with the exception of those drafted from the flagship we had no desertions indeed none deserted whom we would have wished to retain and their vacancies were soon filled up with better men chapter xlii we sail for the west indiesa volunteer for the ship refused and set on shore again for reasons which the chapter will satisfactorily explain to the reader we were very glad when the masterattendant came on board to take us into the sound and still more glad to perceive that the brig which had just been launched before obrien was appointed to her appeared to sail very fast as she ran out so it proved after we went to sea she sailed wonderfully well beating every vessel that she met and overhauling in a very short time everything that we chased turning to windward like magic and tacking in a moment three days after we anchored in the sound the ships company were paid and our sailing orders came down to proceed with despatches by next evenings post to the island of jamaica we started with a fair wind and were soon clear of the channel our whole time was now occupied in training our new ships company at the guns and learning them to pull together and by the time that we had run down the trades we were in a very fair state of discipline the first lieutenant was rather an odd character his brother was a sporting man of large property and he had contracted from his example a great partiality for such pursuits he knew the winning horses of the derby and the oaks for twenty years back was an adept at all athletic exercises a capital shot and had his pointer on board in other respects he was a great dandy in his person always wore gloves even on service very gentlemanlike and handsome and not a very bad sailor that is he knew enough to carry on his duty very creditably and evidently now that he was the first lieutenant and obliged to work learnt more of his duty every day i never met a more pleasant messmate or a more honourable young man a brig is only allowed two lieutenants the master was a rough kindhearted intelligent young man always in good humour the surgeon and purser completed our mess they were men of no character at all except perhaps that the surgeon was too much of a courtier and the purser too much of a skinflint but pursers are generally speaking more sinned against than sinning but i have been led away while talking of the brig and the officers and had almost forgotten to narrate a circumstance which occurred two days before we sailed i was with obrien in the cabin when mr osbaldistone the first lieutenant came in and reported that a boy had come on board to volunteer for the ship what sort of a lad is he said obrien a very nice ladvery slight sir replied the first lieutenant we have two vacancies well see what you make of him and if you think he will do you may put him on the books i have tried him sir he says that he has been a short time at sea i made him mount the mainrigging but he did not much like it well do as you please osbaldistone replied obrien and the first lieutenant quitted the cabin in about a quarter of an hour he returned if you please sir said he laughing i sent the boy down to the surgeon to be examined and he refused to strip the surgeon says that he thinks she is a woman i have had her up on the quarterdeck and she refuses to answer any questions and requires to speak with you with me said obrien with surprise oh one of the mens wives i suppose trying to steal a march upon us well send her down here osbaldistone and ill prove to her the moral impossibility of her sailing in his majestys brig rattlesnake in a few minutes the first lieutenant sent her down to the cabin door and i was about to retire as she entered but obrien stopped me stay peter my reputation will be at stake if im left all alone said he laughing the sentry opened the door and whether boy or girl a more interesting face i never beheld the hair was cut close and i could not tell whether the surgeons suspicions were correct you wish to speakholy st patrick cried obrien looking earnestly at her features and obrien covered his face and bent over the table exclaiming my god my god in the meantime the colour of the young person fled from her countenance and then rushed into it again alternately leaving it pale and suffused with blushes i perceived a trembling over the frame the knees shook and knocked together and had i not hastened shefor a female it waswould have fallen on the deck i perceived that she had fainted i therefore laid her down on the deck and hastened to obtain some water obrien ran up and went to her my poor poor girl said he sorrowfully oh peter this is all your fault all my fault how could she have come here by all the saints who pray for usdearly as i prize them i would give up my ship and my commission that this could be undone as obrien hung over her the tears from his eyes fell upon her face while i bathed it with the water i had brought from the dressingroom i knew who it must be although i had never seen her it was the girl to whom obrien had professed love to worm out the secret of the exchange of my uncles child and as i beheld the scene i could not help saying to myself who now will assert that evil may be done that good may come the poor girl showed symptoms of recovering and obrien waved his hand to me saying leave us peter and see that no one comes in i remained nearly an hour at the cabindoor by the sentry and prevented many from entering when obrien opened the door and requested me to order his gig to be manned and then to come in the poor girl had evidently been weeping bitterly and obrien was much affected all is arranged peter you must go on shore with her and not leave her till you see her safe off by the night coach do me that favour peteryou ought indeed continued he in a low voice for you have been partly the occasion of this i shook obriens hand and made no answerthe boat was reported ready and the girl followed me with a firm step i pulled on shore saw her safe in the coach without asking her any question and then returned on board come on board sir said i entering the cabin with my hat in my hand and reporting myself according to the regulations of the service thank you replied obrien shut the door peter tell me how did she behave what did she say she never spoke and i never asked her a question she seemed to be willing to do as you had arranged sit down peter i never felt more unhappy or more disgusted with myself in all my life i feel as if i never could be happy again a sailors life mixes him up with the worst part of the female sex and we do not know the real value of the better i little thought when i was talking nonsense to that poor girl that i was breaking one of the kindest hearts in the world and sacrificing the happiness of one who would lay down her existence for me peter since you have been gone its twenty times that ive looked in the glass just to see whether i dont look like a villain but by the blood of st patrick i thought womans love was just like our own and that a three months cruise would set all to rights again i thought she had gone over to france so did i but now she has told me all about it father mdermot and her mother brought her down to the coast near here to embark in a smuggling boat for dieppe when the boat pulled inshore in the night to take them in the mother and the rascally priest got in but she felt as if it was leaving the whole world to leave the country i was in and she held back the officers came down one or two pistols were fired and the boat shoved off without her and she with their luggage was left on the beach she went back to the next town with the officers where she told the truth of the story and they let her go in father mdermots luggage she found letters which she read and found out that she and her mother were to have been placed in a convent at dieppe and as the convent was named in the letterswhich she says are very important but i have not had courage to read them yetshe went to the people from whose house they had embarked requesting them to forward the luggage and a letter to her mothersending everything but the letters which she reserved for me she has since received a letter from her mother telling her that she is safe and well in the convent and begging her to come over to her as soon as possible the mother took the vows a week after she arrived there so we know where to find her peter and where is the poor girl going to stay now obrien thats all the worst part of it it appears that she hoped not to be found out till after we had sailed and then to have as she said poor thing to have laid at my feet and watched over me in the storms but i pointed out to her that it was not permitted and that i would not be allowed to marry her o peter this is a very sad business continued obrien passing his hand across his eyes well but obrien what is to become of the poor girl she is going home to be with my father and mother hoping one day that i shall come back and marry her i have written to father mgrath to see what he can do have you then not undeceived her father mgrath must do that i could not it would have been the death of her it would have stabbed her to the heart and its not for me to give that blow id sooner have diedsooner have married her than have done it peter perhaps when im far away shell bear it better father mgrath will manage it obrien i dont like that father mgrath well peter you may be right i dont exactly like all he says myself but what is a man to doeither he is a catholic and believes as a catholic or he is not one will i abandon my religion now that it is persecuted never peter i hope not without i find a much better at all events still i do not like to feel that this advice of my confessor is at variance with my own conscience father mgrath is a worldly man but that only proves that he is wrong not that our religion isand i dont mind speaking to you on this subject no one knows that im a catholic except yourself and at the admiralty they never asked me to take that oath which i never would have taken although father mgrath says i may take any oath i please with what he calls heretics and he will grant me absolution peter my dear fellow say no more about it i did not but i may as well end the history of poor ella flanagan at once as she will not appear again about three months afterwards we received a letter from father mgrath stating that the girl had arrived safe and had been a great comfort to obriens father and mother who wished her to remain with them altogether that father mgrath had told her that when a man took his commission as captain it was all the same as going into a monastery as a monk for he never could marry the poor girl believed him and thinking that obrien was lost to her for ever with the advice of father mgrath had entered as a nun in one of the religious houses in ireland that as she said she might pray for him night and day many years afterwards we heard of hershe was well and not unhappy but obrien never forgot his behaviour to this poor girl it was a source of continual regret and i believe until the last day of his existence his heart smote him for his inconsiderate conduct towards her but i must leave this distressing topic and return to the rattlesnake which had now arrived at the west indies and joined the admiral at jamaica footnote the worthy priest formerly called father otooleed chapter xliii description of the coast of martiniquepopped at for peepingno heroism in making oneself a targetboard a miniature noahs ark under yankee colourscapture a french slaverparrot soup in lieu of mock turtle we found orders at barbadoes to cruise off martinique to prevent supplies being furnished to the garrison of the island and we proceeded there immediately i do not know anything more picturesque than running down the east side of this beautiful islandthe ridges of hill spreading down to the waters edge covered with the freshest verdure divided at the base by small bays with the beach of dazzling white sand and where the little coasting vessels employed to bring the sugar from the neighbouring estates were riding at anchor each hill at its adjutment towards the sea crowned with a fort on which waved the tricolourcertainly in appearance one of the most warlike flags in the world on the third morning we had rounded the diamond rock and were scudding along the leeside of the island just opening fort royal bay when hauling rather too close round its eastern entrance formed by a promontory called solomons point which was covered with brushwood we found ourselves nearer than agreeable to a newly constructed battery a column of smoke was poured along the blue water and it was followed by the whizzing of a shot which passed through our boom main sail first cutting away the dogvane which was close to old swinburnes head as he stood on the carronade conning the brig i was at dinner in the cabin with obrien and the first lieutenant where the devil have they got the brig now said obrien rising from his chair and going on deck we both followed but before we were on deck three or four more shot passed between the masts if you please sir said the masters mate in charge of the deck whose name was ofarrell the battery has opened upon us thank you very much for your information mr ofarrell replied obrien but the french have reported it before you may i ask if youve any particular fancy to be made a target of or if you think that his majestys brig rattlesnake was sent here to be riddled for nothing at all starboard the helm quartermaster the helm was put up and the brig was soon run out of the fire not however until a few more shot were pitched close to us and one carried away the foretopmast backstay now mr ofarrell replied obrien i only wish to point out to you that i trust neither i nor any one in this ship cares a fig about the whizzing of a shot or two about our ears when there is anything to be gained for it either for ourselves or for our country but i do care a great deal about losing even the leg or the arm much more the life of any of my men when theres no occasion for it so in future recollect its no disgrace to keep out of the way of a battery when all the advantage is on their side ive always observed that chance shots pick out the best men lower down the mainsail and send the sailmakers aft to repair it when obrien returned to the cabin i remained on deck for it was my afternoon watch and although ofarrell had permission to look out for me i did not choose to go down again the bay of fort royal was now opened and the view was extremely beautiful swinburne was still on the carronade and as i knew he had been there before i applied to him for information as to the locale he told me the names of the batteries above the town pointed out fort edward and negro point and particularly pigeon island the battery at the top of which wore the appearance of a mural crown its well i remember that place mr simple said he it was in when i was last here the sodgers had sieged it for a whole month and were about to give it up cause they couldnt get a gun up on that ere hill you see there so poor captain faulkner says theres many a clear head under a tarpaulin hat and ill give any chap five doubloons that will hitch up a twentyfour pounder to the top of that hill not quite so easy a matter as you may perceive from here mr simple it certainly appears to me to have been almost impossible swinburne replied i and so it did to most of us mr simple but there was one dick smith mate of a transport who had come on shore and he steps out saying ive been looking at your men handling that gun and my opinion is that if you gets a butt crams in a carronade well woulded up and fill it with old junk and rope yarns you might parbuckle it up to the very top so captain faulkner pulls out five doubloons and gives them to him saying you deserve the money for the hint even if it dont succeed but it did succeed mr simple and the next day to their surprise we opened fire on the french beggars and soon brought their boasting down one of the french officers after he was taken prisoner axed me how we had managed to get the gun up there but i wasnt going to blow the gaff so i told him as a great secret that we got it up with a kite upon which he opened all his eyes and crying sacre bleu walked away believing all i said was true but ant that a sail we have opened with the point mr simple it was so and i reported it to obrien who came up and gave chase in half an hour we were alongside of her when she hoisted american colours and proved to be a brigantine laden up to her gunwale which was not above a foot out of the water her cargo consisted of what the americans called notions that is in english an assorted cargo halfway up her masts down to the deck were hung up baskets containing apples potatoes onions and nuts of various kinds her deck was crowded with cattle sheep pigs and donkeys below was full of shingle lumber and a variety of different articles too numerous to mention i boarded her and asked the master whither he was bound why replied he i am bound for a marketnowise particular and i guess you wont stop me not if alls right replied i but i must look at your log well ive a notion theres no great objection to that replied he and he brought it up on deck i had no great time to examine it but i could not help being amused at the little i did read such ashorse latitudeswater very short

might be the seaserpentstood on to see him plain and nearly ran on barbuda hauled off againmet a britishertreated politely having overhauled his log i then begged to overhaul his men to ascertain if there were any englishmen among his crew this was not pleasing and he grumbled very much but they were ordered aft one man i was satisfied was an englishman and told him so but the man as well as the master persisted to the contrary nevertheless i resolved to take him on board for obrien to decide and ordered him into the boat well if you will use force i cant help it my decks ant clear as you see or elsei tell you what mr lieutenant your vessel there will be another hermione ive a notion if you presses trueblooded yankees and whats more the states will take it up as sure as theres snakes in virginny notwithstanding this remonstrance i took them on board to obrien who had a long conversation with the american in the cabin when they returned on deck he was allowed to depart with his man and we again made sail i had the first watch that night and as we ran along the coast i perceived a vessel under the high land in what the sailors called the doldrums that is almost becalmed or her sails flapping about in every direction with the eddying winds we steered for her and were very soon in the same situation not more than a quarter of a mile from her the quarterboat was lowered down and i proceeded to board her but as she was large and rakish obrien desired me to be careful and if there was the least show of resistance to return as i pulled up to her bows they hailed me in french and desired me to keep off or they would fire this was quite sufficient and in obedience to my orders i returned to the brig and reported to obrien we lowered down all the quarterboats and towed round the brigs broadside to her and then gave her half a dozen carronades of round and grape hearing great noise and confusion on board after we had ceased firing obrien again sent me to know if they had surrendered they replied in the affirmative and i boarded her she proved to be the commerce de bordeaux with three hundred and thirty slaves on board out of five hundred embarked from the coast bound to martinique the crew were very sickly and were most of them in their hammocks latterly they had been killing parrots to make soup for them a few that were left of the grey species spoke remarkably well when they left the coast they had nearly one thousand parrots on board obrien perceiving that i had taken possession sent another boat to know what the vessel was i desired the surgeon to be sent on board as some of the men and many of the poor slaves were wounded by our shot of all the miserable objects i know of none to be compared to the poor devils of slaves on board of a slave vessel the state of suffocation between decksthe dreadful stench arising from their filth which is hardly ever cleared awaythe sick lying without help and looked upon by those who are stronger with the utmost indifferencemen women and children all huddled and crowded together in a state of nudity worn to skin and bone from stench starvation and living in an atmosphere that none but a negro could exist in if all that occurs in a slaveship were really known i think it would be acknowledged that to make the slavetrade piracy would be nothing more than a just retribution and this is certain that unless it be made piracy it never will be discontinued by daylight the vessel was ready and obrien determined to take her to dominica so that the poor devils might be immediately sent on shore we anchored with her in a few days in prince ruperts bay where we only had twentyfour hours to obtain some refreshments and arrange about our prize which i hardly need say was of some value during the short time that i was on shore purchasing some fowls and vegetables for obrien and our own mess i was amused at witnessing a black serjeant drilling some of his regiment of free negroes and mulattoes he appeared resolved to make the best appearance that he could for he began by saying you hab shoe and tocking stand in frontyou hab shoe no tocking stand in centreyou hab no shoe no tocking stand in um rear face to mountainback to seabeach why you no tep out saryou hangman i was curious to count the numbers qualified for the front rank there were only two mulattoes in the second rank there were also only two no shoe and no tocking appeared to be the fashion as usual we were surrounded by the negroes and although we had been there but a few hours they had a song composed for us which they constantly repeated dont you see the rattlesnake coming under sail dont you see the rattlesnake with prizes at um tail rattlesnake hab all the moneyding ding she shall have all thats funny ding ding chapter xliv money can purchase anything in the new countryamerican information not always to be depended upona night attack we are beaten offit proves a cut up instead of a cut outafter all we save something out of the fire the next morning we weighed anchor and returned to our station off martinique we had run within three miles of st pierres when we discovered a vessel coming out under jurymasts she steered directly for us and we made her out to be the american brigantine which we had boarded some time before obrien sent a boat to bring the master of her on board well captain said he so you met with a squall i calculate not replied he why then what the devil have you been about why i guess i sold all my cargo and whats more ive sold my masts sold your masts who did you sell them to to an almighty pretty french privateer lying in st pierres which had lost her spars when she was chased by one of your brassbottomed sarpents and ive a notion they paid pretty handsomely too but how do you mean to get home again i calculate to get into the stream and then ill do very well if i meet a norwester why then ill make a signal of distress and some one will tow me in i guess well replied obrien but step down into the cabin and take something captain with particular pleasure replied this strange mortal and down they went in about half an hour they returned on deck and the boat took the american on board soon afterwards obrien desired osbaldistone and myself to step down into the cabin the chart of the harbour of st pierres lay on the table and obrien said i have had a long conversation with the american and he states that the privateer is at anchor in this spot pointing to a pencilmark on the chart if so she is well out and i see no difficulty in capturing her you see that she lays in four fathoms water and so close under the outer battery that the guns could not be pointed down upon the boats i have also inquired if they keep a good lookout and the american says that they feel so secure that they keep no lookout at all that the captain and officers belonging to her are on shore all night drinking smoking and boasting of what they will do now the question is whether this report be correct the american has been welltreated by us and i see no reason to doubt him indeed he gave the information voluntarily as if he wished to serve us i allowed osbaldistone to speak first he coincided with obrien i did not the very circumstance of her requiring new masts made me doubt the truth of his assertion as to where she lay and if one part of his story was false why not the whole obrien appeared struck with my argument and it was agreed that if the boats did go away it should be for a reconnoissance and that the attempt should only be made provided it was found that the privateer laid in the same spot pointed out by the american master it was however decided that the reconnoissance should take place that very night as allowing the privateer to be anchored on the spot supposed there was every probability that she would not remain there but haul further in to take in her new masts the news that an expedition was at hand was soon circulated through the ship and all the men had taken their cutlasses from the capstern to get them ready for action the lighting boats crews without orders were busy with their boats some cutting up old blankets to muffle the oars other making new grummets the ships company were as busy as bees bustling and buzzing about the decks and reminding you of the agitation which takes place in a hive previous to a swarm at last osbaldistone came on deck and ordered the boats crews to be piped away and prepare for service he was to have the command of the expedition in the launchi had charge of the first cutterofarrell of the second and swinburne had the charge of the jollyboat at dusk the head of the brig was again turned towards st pierres and we ran slowly in at ten we hoveto and about eleven the boats were ordered to haul up obrien repeating his orders to mr osbaldistone not to make the attempt if the privateer were found to be anchored close to the town the men were all mustered on the quarterdeck to ascertain if they had the distinguishing mark on their jackets that is square patches of canvas sewed on the left arm so that we might recognize friend from foea very necessary precaution in a night expedition and then they were manned and ordered to shove off the oars were dropped in the water throwing out a phosphorescent light so common in that climate and away we went after an hours pulling osbaldistone lay on his oars in the launch and we closed with him we are now at the mouth of the harbour said he and the most perfect silence must be observed at the mouth of the harbour sir said swinburne i reckon we are more than half way in we passed the point at least ten minutes ago and this is the second battery we are now abreast of to this osbaldistone did not agree nor indeed did i think that swinburne was right but he persisted in it and pointed out to us the lights in the town which were now all open to us and which would not be the case if we were only at the mouth of the harbour still we were of a different opinion and swinburne out of respect to his officers said no more we resumed our oars pulling with the greatest caution the night was intensely dark and we could distinguish nothing after pulling ten minutes more we appeared to be close to the lights in the town still we could see no privateer or any other vessel again we lay upon our oars and held a consultation swinburne declared that if the privateer laid where we supposed we had passed her long ago but while we were debating ofarrell cried out i see her and he was rightshe was not more than a cables length from us without waiting for orders ofarrell desired his men to give way and dashed alongside of the privateer before he was halfway on board of her lights flew about in every direction and a dozen muskets were discharged we had nothing to do but to follow him and in a few seconds we were all alongside of her but she was well prepared and on the alert boarding nettings were triced up all round every gun had been depressed as much as possible and she appeared to be full of men a scene of confusion and slaughter now occurred which i trust never again to witness all our attempts to get on board were unavailing if we tried at a port a dozen pikes thrust us back if we attempted the boarding nettings we were thrown down killed or wounded into the boats from every port and from the decks of the privateer the discharge of musketry was incessant pistols were protruded and fired in our faces while occasionally her carronades went off stunning us with their deafening noise and rocking the boats in the disturbed water if they had no other effect for ten minutes our exertions never ceased at last with half our numbers lying killed and wounded in the bottom of the boats the men worn out and dispirited at their unavailing attempts sat down most of them on the boats thwarts loading their muskets and discharging them into the ports osbaldistone was among the wounded and perceiving that he was not in the launch of whose crew not six remained i called to swinburne who was alongside of me and desired him to tell the other boats to make the best of their way out of the harbour this was soon communicated to the survivors who would have continued the unequal contest to the last man if i had not given the order the launch and second cutter shoved offofarrell also having fallen and as soon as they were clear of the privateer and had got their oars to pass i proceeded to do the same amidst the shouts and yells of the frenchmen who now jumped on their gunwale and pelted us with their musketry cheering and mocking us stop sir cried swinburne well have a bit of revenge so saying he hauledto the launch and wending her bow to the privateer directed her carronadewhich they had no idea that we had on board as we had not fired itto where the frenchmen were crowded the thickest stop one moment swinburne put another dose of canister in we did so and then discharged the gun which had the most murderous effect bringing the major part of them down upon the deck i feel convinced from the cries and groans which followed that if we had had a few more men we might have returned and captured the privateer but it was too late the batteries were all lighted up and although they could not see the boats fired in the direction where they supposed us to be for they were aware from the shouting on board the vessel that we had been beaten off the launch had but six hands capable of taking an oar the first cutter had but four in my own boat i had five swinburne had two besides himself in the jollyboat this is a sorry business sir said swinburne now whats best to be done my idea is that we had better put all the wounded men into the launch man the two cutters and jollyboat and tow her off and mr simple instead of keeping on this side as they will expect in the batteries let us keep close inshore upon the near side and their shot will pass over us this advice was too good not to be followed it was now two oclock and we had a long pull before us and no time to lose we lifted the dead bodies and the wounded men out of the two cutters and jollyboat into the launch i had no time for examination but i perceived that ofarrell was quite dead and also a youngster of the name of pepper who must have smuggled himself into the boats i did however look for osbaldistone and found him in the stern sheets of the launch he had received a deep wound in the breast apparently with a pike he was sensible and asked me for a little water which i procured from the breaker which was in the launch and gave it to him at the word water and hearing it poured out from the breaker many of the wounded men faintly called out for some having no time to spare i left two men in the launch one to steer and the other to give them water and then taking her in tow pulled directly in for the batteries as advised by swinburne who now sat alongside of me as soon as we were well inshore i pulled out of the harbour with feelings not by any means enviable swinburne said to me in a low voice this will be a hard blow for the captain mr simple ive always been told that a young captain losing his men without bringing any dollars to his admiral is not very well received i am more sorry for him than i can well express swinburne replied i butwhat is that aheada vessel under weigh swinburne stood up in the stern of the cutter and looked for a few seconds yes a large ship standing in under royalsshe must be a frenchman nows our time sir so long as we dont go out emptyhanded all will be well oars all of you shall we cast off the launch sir yes replied i and now my lads let us only have the vessel and we shall do she is a merchantman thats clear not that i was sure of it swinburne i think it will be better to let her pass us inshore they will all be looking out of the other side for they must have seen the firing well thought of sir replied swinburne we laid on our oars and let her pass us which she did creeping in at the rate of two miles an hour we then pulled for her quarter in the three boats leaving the launch behind us and boarded as we premised the crew were on deck and all on the other side of the vessel so anxiously looking at the batteries which were still firing occasional random shot that they did not perceive us until we were close to them and then they had no time to seize their arms there were several ladies on board some of the people protected them others ran below in two minutes we had possession of her and had put her head the other way to our surprise we found that she mounted fourteen guns one hatch we left open for the ladies some of whom had fainted to be taken down below the others were fastened down by swinburne as soon as we had the deck to ourselves we manned one of the cutters and sent it for the launch and as soon as she was made fast alongside we had time to look about us the breeze freshened and in half an hour we were out of gunshot of all the batteries i then had the wounded men taken out of the launch and swinburne and the other men bound up their wounds and made them as comfortable as they could chapter xlv some remarkable occurrences take place in the letter of marqueold friends with improved facesthe captor a captive but not carried away though the captive is by the ships boatthe whole chapter a mixture of love war and merchandise we had had possession of the vessel about an hour when the man who was sentry over the hatchway told me that one or the prisoners wished to speak with the english commanding officer and asked leave to come on deck i gave permission and a gentleman came up stating that he was a passenger that the ship was a letter of marque from bordeaux that there were seven lady passengers on board who had come out to join their husbands and families and that he trusted i would have no objection to put them on shore as women could hardly be considered as objects of warfare as i knew that obrien would have done so and that he would be glad to get rid of both women and prisoners if he could i replied most certainly that i would heaveto that they might not have so far to pull on shore and that i would permit the ladies and other passengers to go on shore i begged that they would be as quick as possible in getting their packages ready and that i would give them two of the boats belonging to the ship with a sufficient number of french seamen belonging to her to man the boats the frenchman was very grateful thanked me in the name of the ladies and went down below to impart the intelligence i then hoveto lowered down the boats from the quarters and waited for them to come up it was daylight before they were ready but that i did not care about i saw the brig in the offing about seven miles off and i was well clear of the batteries at last they made their appearance one by one coming up the ladder escorted by french gentlemen they had to wait while the packages and bundles were put into the boats the first sight which struck them with horror was the many dead and wounded englishmen lying on the decks expressing their commiseration i told them that we had attempted to take the privateer and had been repulsed and that it was coming out of the harbour that i had fallen in with their ship and captured it all the ladies had severally thanked me for my kindness in giving them their liberty except one whose eyes were fixed upon the wounded men when the french gentleman went up to her and reminded her that she had not expressed her thanks to the commanding officer she turned round to mei started back i certainly had seen that face beforei could not be mistaken yet she had now grown up into a beautiful young woman celeste said i trembling are you not celeste yes replied she looking earnestly at me as if she would discover who i was but which it was not very easy to do begrimed as my face was with dust and gunpowder have you forgotten peter simple oh nononever forgot you cried celeste bursting into tears and holding out her hands this scene occasioned no small astonishment to the parties on deck who could not comprehend it she smiled through her tears as i told her how happy i was to have the means of being of service to her and where is the colonel said i there replied she pointing to the island he is now general and commands the force in the garrison and where is mr obrien interrogated celeste there replied i he commands that manofwar of which i am the second lieutenant a rapid exchange of inquiries took place and the boats were stopped while we were in conversation swinburne reported that the brig was standing in for us and i felt that in justice to the wounded i could no longer delay still i found time to press her hand to thank her for the purse she had given me when i was on the stilts and to tell her that i had never forgotten her and never would with many remembrances to her father i was handing her into the boat when she said i dont know whether i am right to ask it but you could do me such a favour what is it celeste you have allowed more than onehalf of the men to pull us on shore some must remain and they are so miserableindeed it is hardly yet decided which of them are to go could you let them all go that i will for your sake celeste as soon as your two boats have shoved off i will lower down the boat astern and send the rest after you but i must make sail nowgod bless you the boats then shoved off the passengers waving their handkerchiefs to us and i made sail for the brig as soon as the sternboat was alongside the rest of the crew were called up and put into her and followed their companions i felt that obrien would not be angry with me for letting them all go and especially when i told him who begged for them the vessels name was the victorine mounting fourteen guns and twentyfour men with eleven passengers she was chiefly laden with silks and wine and was a very valuable prize celeste had time to tell me that her father had been four years in martinique and had left her at home for her education and that she was then coming out to join him the other ladies were all wives or daughters of officers of the french garrison on the island and the gentlemen passengers were some of them french officers but as this was told me in secrecy of course i was not bound to know it as they were not in uniform as soon as we had closed with the brig i hastened on board to obrien and as soon as a fresh supply of hands to man the boats and the surgeon had been despatched on board of the prize to superintend the removal of the wounded i went down with him into the cabin and narrated what had occurred well said obrien alls well that ends well but this is not the luckiest hit in the world your taking the ship has saved me peter and i must make as flourishing a despatch as i can by the powers but its very lucky that she has fourteen gunsit sounds grand i must muddle it all up together so that the admiral must think we intended to cut them both outand so we did sure enough if we had known she had been there but i am most anxious to hear the surgeons report and whether poor osbaldistone will do well peter oblige me by going on board and put two marines sentry over the hatchway so that no one goes down and pulls the traps about for ill send on shore everything belonging to the passengers for colonel obriens sake the surgeons report was madesix killed and sixteen wounded the killed were ofarren and pepper midshipmen two seamen and two marines the first lieutenant osbaldistone was severely wounded in three places but likely to do well five other men were dangerously wounded the other ten would in all probability return to their duty in less than a month as soon as the wounded were on board obrien returned with me to the prize and we went down into the cabin all the passengers effects were collected the trunks which had been left open were nailed down and obrien wrote a handsome letter to general obrien containing a list of the packages sent on shore we sent the launch with a flag of truce to the nearest battery after some demur it was accepted and effects landed we did not wait for an answer but made all sail to join the admiral at barbadoes the next morning we buried those who had fallen ofarrell was a fine young man brave as a lion but very hot in his temper he would have made a good officer had he been spared poor little pepper was also much regretted he was but twelve years old he had bribed the bowman of the second cutter to allow him to conceal himself under the foresheets of the boat his days allowance of spirits had purchased him this object of his ambition which ended so fatally but as soon as the bodies had disappeared under the wave and the service was over we all felt happier there is something very unpleasant particularly to sailors in having a corpse on board we now sailed merrily along the prize keeping company with us and before we reached barbadoes most of the men were convalescent osbaldistones wounds were however very severe and he was recommended to return home which he did and obtained his promotion as soon as he arrived he was a pleasant messmate and i was sorry to lose him although the lieutenant appointed in his room being junior to me i was promoted to be first lieutenant of the brig soon after osbaldistone went home his brother broke his neck when hunting and osbaldistone came into the property he then quitted the service we found the admiral at barbadoes who received obrien and his despatch very well obrien had taken two good prizes and that was sufficient to cover a multitude of sins even if he had committed any but the despatch was admirably written and the admiral in his letter to the admiralty commented upon captain obriens successful and daring attack whereas if the truth had been known it was swinburnes advice of pulling up the weather shore which was the occasion of our capturing the victorine but it is very hard to come at the real truth of these sort of things as i found out during the time that i was in his majestys service chapter xlvi obrien tells his crew that one englishman is as good as three frenchmen on salt waterthey prove itwe fall in with an old acquaintance although she could not be considered as a friend our next cruise was on the coast of guinea and gulf of mexico where we were running up and down for three months without falling in with anything but west indiamen bound to demerara berbice and surinam and occasionally chasing a privateer but in the light winds they were too fast for us still we were useful in protecting the trade and obrien had a letter of thanks from the merchants and a handsome piece of plate upon his quitting the station we had made sail for barbadoes two days and were within sight of the island of trinidad when we perceived six sail on the leebow we soon made them out to be three large ships and three schooners and immediately guessed which afterwards proved to be correct that they were three privateers with west india ships which they had captured we made all sail and at first the three privateers did the same but afterwards having made out our force and not liking to abandon their prizes they resolved to fight the west indiamen hauled to the wind on the other tack and the three privateers shortened sail and awaited our coming we beat to quarters and when everything was ready and we were within a mile of the enemy who had now thrown out the tricoloured flag obrien ordered all the men aft on the quarterdeck and addressed them now my men you see that there are three privateers and you also see that there are three west indiamen which they have captured as for the privateers its just a fair match for you one englishman can always beat three frenchmen we must lick the privateers for honour and glory and we must recapture the ships for profit because youll all want some money when you get on shore again so youve just halfadozen things to do and then well pipe to dinner this harangue suited the sailors very well and they returned to their guns now peter said obrien just call away the sailtrimmers from the guns for i mean to fight these fellows under sail and outmanoeuvre them if i can tell mr webster i want to speak with him mr webster was the second lieutenant a very steady quiet young man and a good officer mr webster said obrien remember that all the foremost guns must be very much depressed i prefer that the shot should strike the water before it reaches them rather than it should go over them see that your screws are run up at once and i will take care that no broadside is thrown away starboard swinburne starboard it is sir steady sothats right for the stern of the leeward vessel we were within two cable lengths of the privateers who still remained hoveto within half a cables length of each other they were very large schooners full of men with their boarding netting triced up and showing a very good set of teeth as it afterwards proved one mounted sixteen and the other two fourteen guns now my lads over to the lee guns and fire as they bear when we round to hands by the lee headbraces and jibsheet stretch along the weather braces quartermaster abaft tend the boomsheet port hard swinburne port it is sir replied swinburne and the brig rounded up on the wind shooting up under the sterns of the two weathermost schooners and discharging the broadsides into them as the guns bore be smart and load my lads and stand by the same guns round in the weather headbraces peter i dont want her to go about stand by to haul over the boomsheet when she pays off swinburne helm amidships by this time another broadside was poured into the schooner who had not yet returned our fire which having foolishly remained hove to the wind they could not do the brig had now stern way and obrien then executed a very skilful manoeuvre he shifted the helm and made a stern board so as to back in between the two weather schooners and the one to leeward bracing round at the same time on the other tack man both sides my lads and give them your broadsides as we pass the men stationed at the starboard guns flew over and the other side being again loaded we exchanged broadsides with the leeward and one of the windward schooners the brig continuing her stern way until we passed ahead of them by the time that we had reloaded the brig had gathered headway and again passed between the same two schooners exchanging broadsides and then passing astern of them capital my ladscapital said obrien this is what i call good fighting and so it was for obrien had given two raking broadsides and four others receiving only two in return for the schooners were not ready for us when we passed between them the last time the smoke had now rolled away to leeward and we were able to see the effect of our broadsides the middle schooner had lost her mainboom and appeared very much cut up in the hull the schooner to leeward did not appear to have suffered much but they now perceived their error and made sail they had expected that we should have run in between them and fought broadside to broadside by which means the weathermost schooner would have taken a raking position while the others engaged us to windward and to leeward our own damages were triflingtwo men slightly wounded and one main shroud cut away we ran about half a mile astern from them then with both broadsides ready we tacked and found that as we expected we could weather the whole of them this we did obrien running the brig within biscuitthrow of the weather schooner engaging him broadside to broadside with the advantage that the other two could not fire a shot into us without standing a chance of striking their consort if he made more sail so did we if he shortened so did we so as to keep our position with little variation the schooner fought well but her metal was not to be compared with our thirtytwo pound carronades which ploughed up her sides at so short a distance driving two ports into one at last her foremast went by the board and she dropped astern in the meantime the other schooners had both tacked and were coming up under our stern to rake us but the accident which happened to the one we had engaged left us at liberty we knew that she could not escape so we tacked and engaged the other two nearing them as fast as we could the breeze now sprang up fast and obrien put up the helm and passed between them giving them both a raking broadside of grape and cannister which brought the sticks about their ears this sickened them the smallest schooner which had been the leewardmost at the commencement of the action made all sail on a wind we clapped on the royals to follow her when we perceived that the other schooner which had been in the middle and whose mainboom we had shot away had put her helm up and was crowding all sail before the wind obrien then said must not try for too much or we shall lose all put her about peter we must be content with the one that is left us we went about and ranged up to the schooner which had lost her foremast but she finding that her consort had deserted her hauled down her colours just as we were about to pour in our broadside our men gave three cheers and it was pleasant to see them all shaking hands with each other congratulating and laughing at the successful result of our action now my lads be smartweve done enough for honour now for profit peter take the two cutters full of men and go on board of the schooner while i get hold of the three west indiamen rig something jury forward and follow me in a minute the cutters were down and full of men i took possession of the schooner while the brig again tacked and crowding all sail stood after the captured vessels the schooner which was the largest of the three was called the jean d arc mounting sixteen guns and had fiftythree men on board the remainder being away in the prizes the captain was wounded very badly and one officer killed out of her ships company she had but eight killed and five wounded they informed me that they had sailed three months ago from st pierres martinique and had fallen in with the other two privateers and cruised in company having taken nine west indiamen since they had come out pray said i to the officer who gave the information were you ever attacked by boats when you laid at st pierres he replied yes and that they had beaten them off did you purchase these masts of an american he replied in the affirmative so that we had captured the very vessel in attempting to cut out which we had lost so many men we were all very glad of this and swinburne said well hang me if i didnt think that i had seen that porthole before there it was that i wrenched a pike out of one of the rascals hands who tried to stab me and into that porthole i fired at least a dozen muskets well im dd glad weve got hold of the beggar at last we secured the prisoners below and commenced putting the schooner in order in half an hour we had completed our knotting and splicing and having two of the carpenters with us in an hour we had got up a small jury mast forward sufficient for the present we lowered the mainsail put trysails on her and stood after the brig which was now close to the prizes but they separated and it was not till dark that she had possession of two the third was then hull down on the other tack with the brig in chase we followed the brig as did the two recaptured vessels and even with our jury up we found that we could sail as fast as they the next morning we saw the brig hoveto and about three miles ahead with the three vessels in her possession we closed and i went on board webster was put in charge of the privateer and after lyingto for that day to send our prizemasters and men on board to remove the prisoners we got up a proper jurymast and all made sail together for barbadoes on my return on board i found that we had but one man and one boy killed and six wounded which i was not aware of i forgot to say that the names of the other two privateers were letoile and la madeleine in a fortnight we arrived with all our prizes safe in carlisle bay where we found the admiral who had anchored but two days before i hardly need say that obrien was well received and gained a great deal of credit for the action i found several letters from my sister the contents of which gave me much pain my father had been some months in ireland and returned without gaining any information my sister said that he was very unhappy paid no attention to his clerical duties and would sit for days without speaking that he was very much altered in his appearance and had grown thin and careworn in short said she my dear peter i am afraid that he is fretting himself to death of course i am very lonely and melancholy i cannot help reflecting upon what will be my situation if any accident should happen to my father accept my uncles protection i will not yet how am i to live for my father has saved nothing i have been very busy lately trying to qualify myself for a governess and practise the harp and piano for several hours every day i shall be very very glad when you come home again i showed the letters to obrien who read them with much attention i perceived the colour mount into his cheeks when he read those parts of her letters in which she mentioned his name and expressed her gratitude for his kindness towards me never mind peter said obrien returning me the letters to whom is it that i am indebted for my promotion and this brig but to youand for all the prizemoney which i have made and which by the head of st patrick comes to a very dacent sum but to you make yourself quite easy about your dear little sister well club your prizemoney and mine together and she shall marry a duke if there is one in england deserving her and its the french that shall furnish her dowry as sure as the rattlesnake carries a tail chapter xlvii i am sent away after prizes and meet with a hurricaneam driven on shore with the loss of more than half my menwhere is the rattlesnake in three weeks we were again ready for sea and the admiral ordered us to our old station off martinique we had cruised about a fortnight off st pierres and as i walked the deck at night often did i look at the lights in the town and wonder whether any of them were in the presence of celeste when one evening being about six miles off shore we observed two vessels rounding negro point close inshore it was quite calm and the boats were towing ahead it will be dark in halfanhour peter said obrien and i think we might get them before they anchor or if they do anchor it will be well outside what do you think i agreed with him for in fact i always seemed to be happier when the brig was close inshore as i felt as if i was nearer to celeste and the further we were off the more melancholy i became continually thinking of her and the sight of her after so many years separation had changed my youthful attachment into strong affection i may say that i was deeply in love the very idea of going into the harbour therefore gave me pleasure and there was no mad or foolish thing that i would not have done only to gaze upon the walls which contained the constant object of my thoughts these were wild and visionary notions and with little chance of ever arriving to any successful issue but at one or twoandtwenty we are fond of building castles and very apt to fall in love without considering our prospect of success i replied that i thought it very possible and wished he would permit me to make the attempt as if i found there was much risk i would return i know that i can trust you peter replied obrien and its a great pleasure to know that you have an officer you can trust but havent i brought you up myself and made a man of you as i promised i would when you were a little spalpeen with a sniffling nose and legs in the shape of two carrots so hoist out the launch and get the boats ready the sooner the better what a hot day this has beennot a catspaw on the water and the sky all of a mist only look at the sun how he goes down puffed out to three times his size as if he were in a terrible passion i suspect we shall have the land breeze off strong in half an hour i shoved off with the boats it was now quite dark and i pulled towards the harbour of st pierre the heat was excessive and unaccountable not the slightest breath of wind moved in the heavens or below no clouds to be seen and the stars were obscured by a sort of mist there appeared a total stagnation in the elements the men in the boats pulled off their jackets for after a few moments pulling they could bear them no longer as we pulled in the atmosphere became more opaque and the darkness more intense we supposed ourselves to be at the mouth of the harbour but could see nothingnot three yards ahead of the boat swinburne who always went with me was steering the boat and i observed to him the unusual appearance of the night ive been watching it sir replied swinburne and i tell you mr simple that if we only know how to find the brig that i would advise you to get on board of her immediately shell want all her hands this night or im much mistaken why do you say so replied i because i think nay i may say that im sartin well have a hurricane afore morning its not the first time ive cruised in these latitudes i recollect in but i interrupted him swinburne i believe that you are right at all events ill turn back perhaps we may reach the brig before it comes on she carries a light and we can find her out i then turned the boat round and steered as near as i could guess for where the brig was lying but we had not pulled out more than two minutes before a low moaning was heard in the atmospherenow here now thereand we appeared to be pulling through solid darkness if i may use the expression swinburne looked around him and pointed out on the starboard bow its acoming mr simple sure enough manys the living being that will not rise on its legs tomorrow see sir i looked and dark as it was it appeared as if a sort of black wall was sweeping along the water right towards us the moaning gradually increased to a stunning roar and then at once it broke upon us with a noise to which no thunder can bear a comparison the oars were caught by the wind with such force that the men were dashed forward under the thwarts many of them severely hurt fortunately we pulled with tholes and pins or the gunwale and planks of the boat would have been wrenched off and we should have foundered the wind soon caught the boat on her broadside and had there been the least sea would have inevitably thrown her over but swinburne put the helm down and she fell off before the hurricane darting through the boiling water at the rate of ten miles an hour all hands were aghast they had recovered their seats but were obliged to relinquish them and sit down at the bottom holding on by the thwarts the terrific roaring of the hurricane prevented any communication except by gesture the other boats had disappeared lighter than ours they had flown away faster before the sweeping element but we had not been a minute before the wind before the sea rose in a most unaccountable mannerit appeared to be by magic of all the horrors that ever i witnessed nothing could be compared to the scene of this night we could see nothing and heard only the wind before which we were darting like an arrowto where we knew not unless it was to certain death swinburne steered the boat every now and then looking back as the waves increased in a few minutes we were in a heavy swell that at one minute bore us all aloft and at the next almost sheltered us from the hurricane and now the atmosphere was charged with showers of spray the wind cutting off the summits of the waves as if with a knife and carrying them along with it as it were in its arms the boat was filling with water and appeared to settle down fast the men baled with their hats in silence when a large wave culminated over the stern filling us up to our thwarts the next moment we all received a shock so violent that we were jerked from our seats swinburne was thrown over my head every timber of the boat separated at once and she appeared to crumble from under us leaving us floating on the raging waters we all struck out for our lives but with little hope of preserving them but the next wave dashed us on the rocks against which the boat had already been hurled that wave gave life to some and death to others me in heavens mercy it preserved i was thrown so high up that i merely scraped against the top of the rock breaking two of my ribs swinburne and eight more escaped with me but not unhurt two had their legs broken three had broken arms and the others were more or less contused swinburne miraculously received no injury we had been eighteen in the boat of which ten escaped the others were hurled up at our feet and the next morning we found them dreadfully mangled one or two had their skulls literally shattered to pieces against the rocks i felt that i was saved and was grateful but still the hurricane howled still the waves were washing over us i crawled further up upon the beach and found swinburne sitting down with his eyes directed seaward he knew me took my hand squeezed it and then held it in his for some moments we remained in this position when the waves which every moment increased in volume washed up to us and obliged us to crawl further up i then looked around me the hurricane continued in its fury but the atmosphere was not so dark i could trace for some distance the line of the harbour from the ridge of foam upon the shore and for the first time i thought of obrien and the brig i put my mouth close to swinburnes ear and cried out obrien swinburne shook his head and looked up again at the offing i thought whether there was any chance of the brigs escape she was certainly six if not seven miles off and the hurricane was not direct on the shore she might have a drift of ten miles perhaps but what was that against such tremendous power i prayed for those on board of the brig and returned thanks for my own preservation i was or soon should be a prisoner no doubt but what was that i thought of celeste and felt almost happy in about three hours the force of the wind subsided it still blew a heavy gale but the sky cleared up the stars again twinkled in the heavens and we could see to a considerable distance its breaking now sir said swinburne at last satisfied with the injury it has doneand thats no little this is worse than now id give all my pay and prizemoney if it were only daylight and i could know the fate of the poor rattlesnake what do you think swinburne all depends upon whether they were taken unprepared sir captain obrien is as good a seaman as ever trod a plank but he never has been in a hurricane and may not have known the signs and warnings which god in his mercy has vouchsafed to us your flush vessels fill easilybut we must hope for the best most anxiously did we look out for the day which appeared to us as if it never would break at last the dawn appeared and we stretched our eyes to every part of the offing as it was lighted up but we could not see the brig the sun rose and all was bright and clear but we looked not around us our eyes were directed to where we had left the brig the sea was still running high but the wind abated fast thank god ejaculated swinburne when he had directed his eyes along the coast she is above water at all events and looking in the direction where he pointed i perceived the brig within two miles of the shore dismantled and tossing in the waves i see her replied i catching my breath with joy butstilli think she must go on shore all depends upon whether she can get a little bit of sail up to weather the point replied swinburne and depend upon it captain obrien knows that as well as we do we were now joined by the other men who were saved we all shook hands they pointed out to me the bodies of our shipmates who had perished i directed them to haul them further up and put them all together and continued with swinburne to watch the brig in about half an hour we perceived a triangle raised and in ten minutes afterwards a jurymast abafta trysail was hoisted and set then the shears were seen forward and in as short a time another trysail and a stormjib were expanded to the wind thats all he can do now mr simple observed swinburne he must trust to them and providence they are not more than a mile from the beachit will be touch and go anxiously did we watch for more than half an hour the other men returned to us and joined in our speculations at one time we thought it impossibleat another we were certain that she would weather the point at last as she neared us she warped ahead my anxiety became almost insupportable i stood first on one leg and then on the other breathless with suspense she appeared to be on the pointactually touching the rocksgod shes struck said i no replied swinburneand then we saw her pass on the other side of the outermost rock and disappear safe mr simpleweathered by god cried swinburne waving his hat with joy god be thanked replied i overcome with delight chapter xlviii the devastation of the hurricanepeter makes friendsat destroying or saving nothing like british seamenpeter meets with general obrien much to his satisfactionhas another meeting still more soa great deal of pressing of hands and all that as pope says now that the brig was safe we thought of ourselves my first attention was directed to the dead bodies and as i looked at their mangled limbs i felt grateful to heaven that i had been so miraculously spared we then cast our eyes along the beach to see if we could trace any remnants of the other boats but in vain we were about three miles from the town which we could perceive had received considerable damage and the beach below it was strewed with wrecks and fragments i told the men that we might as well walk into the town and deliver ourselves up as prisoners to which they agreed and we set forward promising to send for the poor fellows who were too much hurt to accompany us as soon as we climbed up the rocks and gained the inland what a sight presented itself to us trees torn up by the roots in every direction cattle lying deadhere and there the remains of a house of which the other parts had been swept away for miles everything not built of solid masonry had disappeared we passed what had been a range of negro huts but they were levelled to the ground the negroes were busily searching for their property among the ruins while the women held their infants in their arms and the other children by their sides here and there was the mother wailing over the dead body of some poor little thing which had been crushed to death they took no notice of us about half a mile further on to our great delight we fell in with the crews of the other boats who were sitting by the side of the road they had all escaped unhurt their boats being so much more buoyant than ours had been thrown up high and dry they joined us and we proceeded on our way on our road we fell in with a cart blown over under the wheel of which was the leg of the negro who conducted it we released the poor fellow his leg was fractured we laid him by the side of the road in the shade and continued our march our whole route was one scene of desolation and distress but when we arrived at the town we found that there it was indeed accumulated there was not one house in three standing entire the beach was covered with remnants of bodies and fragments of vessels whose masts lay forced several feet into the sand and broken into four or five pieces parties of soldiers were busy taking away the bodies and removing what few valuables had been saved we turned up into the town for no one accosted us or even noticed us and here the scene was even more dreadful in some streets they were digging out those who were still alive and whose cries were heard among the ruins in others they were carrying away the dead bodies the lamentations of the relatives the howling of the negroesthe cries of the woundedthe cursing and swearing of the french soldiers and the orders delivered continually by officers on horseback with all the confusion arising from crowds of spectators mingling their voices together formed a scene as dreadful as it was novel after surveying it for a few minutes i went up to an officer on horseback and told him in french that i wished to surrender myself as a prisoner we have no time to take prisoners now replied he hundreds are buried in the ruins and we must try to save them we must now attend to the claims of humanity will you allow my men to assist you sir replied i they are active and strong fellows sir said he taking off his hat i thank you in the name of my unfortunate countrymen show us then where we may be most useful he turned and pointed to a house higher up the offices of which were blown down there are living beings under those ruins come my lads said i and sore as they were my men hastened with alacrity to perform their task i could not help them myself my side was so painful but i stood by giving them directions in half an hour we had cleared away so as to arrive at a poor negro girl whose cries we had distinctly heard we released her and laid her down in the street but she fainted her left hand was dreadfully shattered i was giving what assistance i could and the men were busy clearing away throwing on one side the beams and rafters when an officer on horseback rode up he stood and asked me who we were i told him that we belonged to the brig and had been wrecked and that we were giving what assistance we could until they were at leisure to send us to prison you english are fine brave fellows replied he and he rode on another unfortunate object had been recovered by our men an old whiteheaded negro but he was too much mangled to live we brought him out and were laying him beside the negro girl when several officers on horseback rode down the street the one who was foremost in a generals uniform i immediately recognized as my former friend then colonel obrien they all stopped and looked at us i told who we were general obrien took off his hat to the sailors and thanked them he did not recognize me and he was passing on when i said to him in english general obrien you have forgotten me but i shall never forget your kindness my god said he is it you my dear fellow and he sprang from his horse and shook me warmly by the hand no wonder that i did not know you you are a very different person from little peter simple who dressed up as a girl and danced on stilts but i have to thank you and so has celeste for your kindness to her i will not ask you to leave your work of charity and kindness but when you have done what you can come up to my house anyone will show it to you and if you do not find me you will find celeste as you must be aware cannot leave this melancholy employment god bless you he then rode off followed by his staff come my lads said i depend upon it we shall not be very cruelly treated let us work hard and do all the good we can and the frenchmen wont forget it we had cleared that house and went back to where the other people were working under the orders of the officer on horseback i went up to him and told him we had saved two and if he had no objection would assist his party he thankfully accepted our services and now my lads said swinburne let us forget all our bruises and show these french fellows how to work and they did so they tossed away the beams and rafters right and left with a quickness and dexterity which quite astonished the officer and other inhabitants who were looking on and in half an hour had done more work than could have been possibly expected several lives were saved and the french expressed their admiration at our sailors conduct and brought them something to drink which they stood much in need of poor fellows after that they worked double tides as we say and certainly were the means of saving many lives which otherwise would have been sacrificed the disasters occasioned by this hurricane were very great owing to its having taken place at night when the chief of the inhabitants were in bed and asleep i was told that most of the wood houses were down five minutes after the hurricane burst upon them about noon there was no more work for us to do and i was not sorry that it was over my side was very painful and the burning heat of the sun made me feel giddy and sick at the stomach i inquired of a respectable looking old frenchman which was the generals house he directed me to it and i proceeded there followed by my men when i arrived i found the orderly leading away the horse of general obrien who had just returned i desired a sergeant who was in attendance at the door to acquaint the general that i was below he returned and desired me to follow him i was conducted into a large room where i found him in company with several officers he again greeted me warmly and introduced me to the company as the officer who had permitted the ladies who had been taken prisoners to come on shore i have to thank you then for my wife said an officer coming up and offering his hand another came up and told me that i had also released his we then entered into a conversation in which i stated the occasion of my having been wrecked and all the particulars also that i had seen the brig in the morning dismasted but that she had weathered the point and was safe that brig of yours i must pay you the compliment to say has been very troublesome and my namesake keeps the batteries more upon the alert than ever i could have done said general obrien i dont believe there is a negro five years old upon the island who does not know your brig we then talked over the attack of the privateer in which we were beaten off ah replied the aidedecamp you made a mess of that he has been gone these four months captain carnot swears that hell fight you if he falls in with you he has kept his word replied i and then i narrated our action with the three french privateers and the capture of the vessel which surprised and i think annoyed them very much well my friend said general obrien you must stay with me while you are on the island if you want anything let me know i am afraid that i want a surgeon replied i for my side is so painful that i can scarcely breathe are you hurt then said general obrien with an anxious look not dangerously i believe said i but rather painfully let me see said an officer who stepped forward i am surgeon to the forces here and perhaps you will trust yourself in my hands take off your coat i did so with difficulty you have two ribs broken said he and a very severe contusion you must go to bed or lie on a sofa for a few days in a quarter of an hour i will come and dress you and promise you to make you all well in ten days in return for your having given me my daughter who was on board of the victorine with the other ladies the officers now made their bows and left me alone with general obrien recollect said he that i tell it you once for all that my purse and everything is at your command if you do not accept them freely i shall think you do not love us it is not the first time peter and you repaid me honourably however of course i was no party to that affair it was celestes doing continued he laughing of course i could not imagine that it was you who was dressed up as a woman and so impudently danced through france on stilts but i must hear all your adventures byandby celeste is most anxious to see you will you go now or wait till after the surgeon comes oh now if you please general may i first beg that some care may be taken of my poor men they have had nothing to eat since yesterday are very much bruised and have worked hard and that a cart may be sent for those who lie maimed on the beach i should have thought of them before replied he and i will also order the same party to bury the other poor fellows who are lying on the beach come nowwill take you to celeste chapter xlix broken ribs not likely to produce broken heartsobrien makes something very like a declaration of peacepeter simple actually makes a declaration of loverash proceedings on all sides i followed the general into a handsomely furnished apartment where i found celeste waiting to receive me she ran to me as soon as i entered and with what pleasure did i take her hand and look on her beautiful expressive countenance i could not say a wordneither did celeste for a minute i held her hand in mine looking at her the general stood by regarding us alternately he then turned round and walked to the window i lifted the hand to my lips and then released it it appears to be a dream almost said celeste i could not make any reply but continued to gaze upon hershe had grown up into such a beautiful creature her figure was perfect and the expression of her countenance was so variedso full of intellect and feelingit was angelic her eyes suffused with tears beamed so softly so kindly on me i could have fallen down and worshipped her come said general obrien come my dear friend now that you have seen celeste the surgeon must see you the surgeon cried celeste with alarm yes my love it is of no consequenceonly a couple of ribs broken i followed general obrien out of the room and as i came to the door i turned round to look at celeste she had retreated to the sofa and her handkerchief was up to her eyes the surgeon was waiting for me he bandaged me and applied some cooling lotion to my side which made me feel quite comfortable i must now leave you said general obrien you had better lie down for an hour or two and then if i am not back you know your way to celeste i lay down as he requested but as soon as i heard the clatter of the horses hoofs as he rode off i left the room and hurried to the drawingroom celeste was there and hastened to inquire if i was much hurt i replied in the negative and told her that i had come down to prove it to her and we then sat down on the sofa together i have the misfortune never to appear before you celeste except in a very unprepossessing state when you first saw me i was wounded at our next meeting i was in womans clothes the last time we met i was covered with dirt and gunpowder and now i return to you wounded and in rags i wonder whether i shall ever appear before you as a gentleman it is not the clothes which make the gentleman peter i am too happy to see you to think of how you are dressed i have never yet thanked you for your kindness to us when we last met my father will never forget it nor have i thanked you celeste for your kindness in dropping the purse into the hat when you met me trying to escape from france i have never forgotten you and since we met the last time you have hardly ever been out of my thoughts you dont know how thankful i am to the hurricane for having blown me into your presence when we cruised in the brig i have often examined the town with my glass trying to fancy that i had my eye upon the house you were in and have felt so happy when we were close in shore because i knew that i was nearer to you and peter i have often watched the brig and have been so glad to see it come nearer and then so afraid that the batteries would fire at you what a pity it is that my father and you should be opposed to each otherwe might be so happy and may be yet celeste replied i we conversed for two hours which appeared to be but ten minutes i felt that i was in love but i do not think that celeste had any idea at the time that she wasbut i leave the reader to judge from the little conversation i have quoted whether she was not or something very much approaching to it the next morning i went out early to look for the brig and to my great delight saw her about six miles off the harbours mouth standing in for the land she had now got up very respectable jurymasts with topgallants for topsails and appeared to be well under command when she was within three miles of the harbour she lowered the jollyboat the only one she had left and it pulled inshore with a flag of truce hoisted at the bows i immediately returned to my room and wrote a detailed account of what had taken place ready to send to obrien when the boat returned and i of course requested him to send me my effects as i had nothing but what i stood in i had just completed my letter when general obrien came in my dear friend said he i have just received a flag of truce from captain obrien requesting to know the fate of his boats crews and permission to send in return the clothes and effects of the survivors i have written down the whole circumstances for him and made the same request to him replied i and i handed him my letter he read it over and returned it but my dear lad you must think very poorly of us frenchmen if you imagine that we intend to detain you here as a prisoner in the first place your liberation of so many french subjects when you captured the victorine would entitle you to a similar act of kindness and in the next place you have not been fairly captured but by a visitation of providence which by the means of the late storm must destroy all national antipathies and promote that universal philanthropy between all men which your brave fellows proved that they possess you are therefore free to depart with all your men and we shall still hold ourselves your debtors how is your side today oh very bad indeed replied i for i could not bear the idea of returning to the brig so soon for i had been obliged to quit celeste very soon after dinner the day before and go to bed i had not yet had much conversation with her nor had i told general obrien how it was that we escaped from france i dont think i can possibly go on board today but i feel very grateful to you for your kindness well well replied the general who observed my feelings i do not think it is necessary that you should go on board today i will send the men and your letter and i will write to captain obrien to say that you are in bed and will not bear moving until the day after tomorrow will that do i thought it but a very short time but i saw that the general looked as if he expected me to consent so i did the boat can come and return again with some of your clothes continued the general and i will tell captain obrien that if he comes off the mouth of the harbour the day after tomorrow i will send you on board in one of our boats he then took my letter and quitted the room as soon as he was gone i found myself quite well enough to go to celeste who waited for me and i told her what had passed that morning i sat with her and the general and narrated all my adventures which amused the general very much i did not conceal the conduct of my uncle and the hopes which i faintly entertained of being able some day or another to discover the fraud which had been practised or how very unfavourable were my future prospects if i did not succeed at this portion of my narrative the general appeared very thoughtful and grave when i had finished it was near dinner time and i found that my clothes had arrived with a letter from obrien who stated how miserable he had been at the supposition of my loss and his delight at my escape he stated that on going down into the cabin after i had shoved off he by chance cast his eyes on the barometer and to his surprise found that it had fallen two inches which he had been told was the case previous to a hurricane this combined with the peculiar state of the atmosphere had induced him to make every preparation and that they had just completed their work when it came on the brig was thrown on her beam ends and lay there for half an hour when they were forced to cut away the masts to right her that they did not weather the point the next morning by more than half a cables length and concluded by saying that the idea of my death had made him so unhappy that if it had not been for the sake of the men it was almost a matter of indifference to him whether he had been lost or not he had written to general obrien thanking him for his kindness and that if fifty vessels should pass the brig he would not capture one of them until i was on board again even if he were dismissed the service for neglect of duty he said that the brig sailed almost as fast under jurymasts as she did before and that as soon as i came on board he should go back to barbadoes as for your ribs being so bad peter thats all bother continued he i know that you are making arrangements for another sort of rib as soon as you can manage it but you must stop a little my boy you shall be a lord yet as i always promised you that you should its a long lane that has no turningso goodbye when i was alone with celeste i showed her obriens letter i had read the part of it relative to his not intending to make any capture while i was on shore to general obrien who replied that under such circumstances he thought he should do right to detain me a little longer but said he obrien is a man of honour and worthy of his name when celeste came to that part of the letter in which obrien stated that i was looking after another rib and which i had quite forgotten she asked me to explain it for although she could read and speak english very well she had not been sufficiently accustomed to it to comprehend the play upon words i translated and then said indeed celeste i had forgotten that observation of obriens or i should not have shown you the letter but he has stated the truth after all your kindness to me how can i help being in love with you and need i add that i should consider it the greatest blessing which heaven could grant me if you could feel so much regard for me as one day to become my wife dont be angry with me for telling you the truth continued i for celeste coloured up as i spoke to her oh no i am not angry with you peter far from it it is very complimentary to mewhat you have just said i am aware continued i that at present i have little to offer you indeed nothing i am not even such a match as your father might approve of but you know my whole history and what my desires are my dear father loves me peter and he loves you too very muchhe always did from the hour he saw youhe was so pleased with your candour and honesty of character he has often told me so and very often talked of you well celeste tell memay i when far away be permitted to think of you and indulge a hope that some day we may meet never to part again and i took celeste by the hand and put my arm round her waist i dont know what to say replied she i will speak to my father or perhaps you will but i will never marry anybody else if i can help it i drew her close to me and kissed her celeste burst into tears and laid her head upon my shoulder when general obrien came i did not attempt to move nor did celeste general said i you may think me to blame but i have not been able to conceal what i feel for celeste you may think that i am imprudent and that i am wrong in thus divulging what i ought to have concealed until i was in a situation to warrant my aspiring to your daughters hand but the short time allowed me to be in her company the fear of losing her and my devoted attachment will i trust plead my excuse the general took one or two turns up and down the room and then replied what says celeste celeste will never do anything to make her father unhappy replied she going up to him and hiding her face in his breast with her arm round his neck the general kissed his daughter and then said i will be frank with you mr simple i do not know any man whom i would prefer to you as a soninlaw but there are many considerations which young people are very apt to forget i do not interfere in your attachment which appears to be mutual but at the same time i will have no promise and no engagement you may never meet again however celeste is very young and i shall not put any constraint upon her and at the same time you are equally free if time and circumstances should alter your present feelings i can ask no more my dear sir replied i taking the general by the hand it is candidmore than i had any reason to expect i shall now leave you with a contented mind and the hopes of one day claiming celeste shall spur me to exertion now if you please we will drop the subject said the general celeste my dear we have a large party to dinner as you know you had better retire to your room and get ready i have asked all the ladies that you liberated peter and all their husbands and fathers so you will have the pleasure of witnessing how many people you made happy by your gallantry now that celeste has left the room peter i must beg that as a man of honour you do not exact from her any more promises or induce her to tie herself down to you by oaths her attachment to you has grown up with her unaccountably and she is already too fond of you for her peace of mind should accident or circumstances part you for ever let us hope for the best and depend upon it that it shall be no trifling obstacle which will hinder me from seeing you one day united i thanked the general with tears he shook me warmly by the hand as i gave my promise and we separated how happy did i feel when i went into my room and sat down to compose my mind and think over what had happened true at one moment the thought of my dependent situation threw a damp over my joy but in the next i was building castles inventing a discovery of my uncles plot fancying myself in possession of the title and property and laying it at the feet of my dear celeste hope sustained my spirits and i felt satisfied for the present with the consideration that celeste returned my love i decked myself carefully and went down where i found all the company assembled we had a very pleasant happy party and the ladies entreated general obrien to detain me as a prisonervery kind of them and i felt very much disposed to join in their request chapter l peter simple first takes a command then three west indiamen and twenty prisonersone good turn deserves anotherthe prisoners endeavour to take him but are themselves taken in the next day i was very unhappy the brig was in the offing waiting for me to come on hoard i pointed her out to celeste as we were at the window and her eyes met mine an hours conversation could not have said more general obrien showed that he had perfect confidence in me for he left us together celeste said i i have promised your father i know what has passed interrupted she he told me everything how kind he is but i did not say that i would not bind myself celeste no but my father made me promise that you should notthat if you attempted i was immediately to prevent youand so i shall then you shall keep your word celeste imagine everything that can be said in this and i kissed her dont think me forward peter but i wish you to go away happy said celeste and therefore in return imagine all i could say in this and she returned my salute after this we had a conversation of two hours but what lovers say is very silly except to themselves and the reader need not be troubled with it general obrien came in and told me the boat was ready i rose upi was satisfied with what had passed and with a firm voice i said goodbye celeste god bless you and followed the general who with some of his officers walked down with me to the beach i thanked the general who embraced me paid my adieus to the officers and stepped into the boat in half an hour i was on board of the brig and in obriens arms we put the helm up and in a short time the town of st pierre was shut out from my longing sight and we were on our way to barbadoes that day was passed in the cabin with obrien giving him a minute detail of all that had passed when we anchored once more in carlisle bay we found that the hurricane had been much more extensive in the windward islands than we had imagined several men of war were lying there having lost one or more of their masts and there was great difficulty in supplying the wants of so many as we arrived the last of course we were last served and there being no boats left in store there was no chance of our being ready for sea under two or three months the joan d arc schooner privateer was still lying there but had not been fitted out for want of men and the admiral proposed to obrien that he should man her with a part of his ships company and send one of his lieutenants out to cruise in her this was gladly assented to by obrien who came on board and asked me whether i should like to have her which i agreed to as i was quite tired of barbadoes and fried flying fish i selected two midshipmen swinburne and twenty men and having taken on board provisions and water for three months i received my written instructions from obrien and made sail we soon discovered that the masts which the american had sold to the schooner were much too large for her she was considerably overmasted and we were obliged to be very careful i stood for trinidad off which island was to be my cruising ground and in three weeks had recaptured three west indiamen when i found myself so short of hands that i was obliged to return to barbadoes i had put four hands into the first vessel which with the englishmen prisoners were sufficient and three hands into the two others but i was very much embarrassed with my prisoners who amounted to nearly double my ships company remaining on board both the midshipmen i had sent away and i consulted with swinburne as to what was best to be done why the fact is mr simple captain obrien ought to have given us more hands twenty men are little enough for a vessel with a boom mainsail like the one we have here and now we have only ten left but i suppose he did not expect us to be so lucky and its true enough that he has plenty of work for the ships company now that he has to turn everything in afresh as for the prisoners i think we had better run close in and give them two of our boats to take them on shore at all events we must be rid of them and not be obliged to have one eye aloft and the other down the hatchway as we must now this advice corresponded with my own ideas and i ran inshore gave them the stern boat and one of the larger ones which held them all and sent them away leaving only one boat for the schooner which we hoisted up in the starboard chesstree it fell a dead calm as we sent away the prisoners we saw them land and disappear over the rocks and thought ourselves well rid of them as they were twentytwo in number most of them spaniards and very stout ferociouslooking fellows it continued calm during the whole day much to our annoyance as i was very anxious to get away as soon as i could still i could not help admiring the beauty of the scenerythe lofty mountains rising abruptly from the ocean and towering in the clouds reflected on the smooth water as clear as in a lookingglass every colour every tint beautifully distinct the schooner gradually drifted close inshore and we could perceive the rocks at the bottom many fathoms deep not a breath of wind was to be seen on the surface of the water for several miles round although the horizon in the offing showed that there was a smart breeze outside night came on and we still lay becalmed i gave my orders to swinburne who had the first watch and retired to my standing bedplace in the cabin i was dreaming and i hardly need say who was the object of my visions i thought i was in eagle park sitting down with her under one of the large chestnut trees which formed the avenue when i felt my shoulder roughly pushed i started upwhat is the matter whos that swinburne yes sir on with your clothes immediately as we have work on hand i expect and swinburne left the cabin and i heard him calling the other men who were below i knew that swinburne would not give a false alarm in a minute i was on deck and was looking at the stern of the schooner what is that swinburne said i silence sir hark dont you hear them yes replied i the sound of oars exactly sir depend upon it those spaniards have got more help and are coming back to take the vessel they know we have only ten hands on board by this time the men were all on deck i directed swinburne to see all the muskets loaded and ran down for my own sword and pistols the water was so smooth and the silence so profound that swinburne had heard the sound of the oars at a considerable distance fortunate it was that i had such a trusty follower another might have slumbered and the schooner have been boarded and captured without our being prepared when i came on deck again i spoke to the men exhorted them to do their duty and pointed out to them that these cutthroat villains would certainly murder us all if we were taken which i firmly believe would have been the case the men declared that they would sell their lives as dearly as they could we had twenty muskets and the same number of pistols all of which were now loaded our guns were also ready but of no use now that the schooner had not steerageway the boats were in sight about a quarter of a mile astern when swinburne said theres a catspaw flying along the water mr simple if we could only have a little wind how we would laugh at them but im afraid theres no such luck shall we let them know that we are ready let every one of us take two muskets said i when the first boat is under the counter take good aim and discharge into one of the boats then seize the other musket and discharge it at the other boat after that we must trust to our cutlasses and pistols for if they come on there will be no time to load again keep silence all of you the boats now came up full of men but as we remained perfectly quiet they pulled up gently hoping to surprise us fortunately one was a little in advance of the other upon which i altered my directions and desired my men to fire their second musket into the first boat as if we could disable her we were an equal match for those in the other when the boat was within six yards of the schooners counter now said i and all the muskets were discharged at once and my men cheered several of the oars dropped and i was sure we had done great execution but they were laid hold of by the other men who had not been pulling and again the boat advanced to the counter good aim my lads this time cried swinburne the other boat will be alongside as soon as you have fired mr simple the schooner has headway and theres a strong breeze coming up again we discharged our ten muskets into the boat but this time we waited until the bowman had hooked on the planeshear with his boathook and our fire was very effective i was surprised to find that the other boat was not on board of us but a light breeze had come up and the schooner glided through the water still she was close under our counter and would have been aboard in a minute in the meantime the spaniards who were in the first boat were climbing up the side and were repulsed by my men with great success the breeze freshened and swinburne ran to the helm i perceived the schooner was going fast through the water and the second boat could hardly hold her course i ran to where the boathook was fixed on the planeshear and unhooked it the boat fell astern leaving two spaniards clinging to the side who were cut down and they fell into the water hurrah all safe cried swinburne and now to punish them the schooner was now darting along at the rate of five miles with an increasing breeze we stood in for two minutes then tacked and ran for the boats swinburne steered and i continued standing in the bows surrounded by the rest of the men starboard a little swinburne starboard it is steadysteady i see the first boat she is close under our bows steadyportportport a littleport look out my lads and cut down all who climb up crash went the schooner on to the boat the men in her in vain endeavouring to escape us for a second or two she appeared to right until her further gunwale was borne down under the water she turned up and the schooner went over her sending every soul in her to their account one man clung on to a rope and was towed for a few seconds but a cutlass divided the rope at the gunwale and with a faint shriek he disappeared the other boat was close to us and perceived what had been done they remained with their oars poised all ready to pull so as to evade the schooner we steered for her and the schooner was now running at the rate of seven miles an hour when close under our bows by very dexterously pulling short round with their starboard oars we only struck her with our bow and before she went down many of the spaniards had gained the deck or were clinging to the side of the vessel they fought with desperation but we were too strong for them it was only those who had gained the deck which we had to contend with the others clung for a time and unable to get up the sides one by one dropped into the water and went astern in a minute those on deck were lying at our feet and in a minute more they were tossed overboard after their companions not however until one of them struck me through the calf of the leg with his knife as we were lifting him over the gunwale i do not mean to say that the spaniards were not justified in attempting to take the schooner but still as we had liberated them but a few hours before we felt that it was unhandsome and treacherous on their part and therefore showed them no quarter there were two of my men wounded as well as myself but not severely which was fortunate as we had no surgeon on board and only about half a yard of a diachylum plaster in the vessel well out of that sir said swinburne as i limped aft by the lord harry it might have been a pretty go having shaped our course for barbadoes i dressed my leg and went down to sleep this time i did not dream of celeste but fought the spaniards over again thought i was wounded and awoke with the pain of my leg chapter li peter turned out of his command by his vessel turning bottom upa cruise on a mainboom with sharks en attendantself and crew with several flying fish taken on board a negro boatpeter regenerates by putting on a new outward man we made barbadoes without any further adventure and were about ten miles off the bay steering with a very light breeze and i went down into the cabin expecting to be at anchor before breakfast the next morning it was just daylight when i found myself thrown out of my bedplace on the deck on the other side of the cabin and heard the rushing of water i sprang up i knew the schooner was on her beam ends and gained the deck i was correct in my supposition she had been upset by what is called a white squall and in two minutes would be down all the men were up on deck some dressed others like myself in their shirts swinburne was aft he had an axe in his hand cutting away the rigging of the mainboom i saw what he was about i seized another and disengaged the jawrope and small gear about the mast we had no other chance our boat was under the water being hoisted up on the side to leeward all this however was but the work of two minutes and i could not help observing by what trifles lives are lost or saved had the axe not been fortunately at the capstern i should not have been able to cut the jawrope swinburne would not have had time and the mainboom would have gone down with the schooner fortunately we had cleared it the schooner filled righted a little and then sank dragging us and the mainboom for a few seconds down in its vortex and then we rose to the surface the squall still continued but the water was smooth it soon passed over and again it was nearly calm i counted the men clinging to the boom and found that they were all there swinburne was next to me he was holding with one hand while with the other he felt in his pocket for a quid of tobacco which he thrust into his cheek i wasnt on deck at the time mr simple said he or this wouldnt have happened i had just been relieved and i told collins to look out sharp for squalls i only mention it that if you are saved and i am not you maynt think i was neglectful of my duty we arnt far from the land but still we are more likely to fall in with a shark than a friend im thinking these indeed had been my thoughts but i had concealed them but after swinburne had mentioned the shark i very often looked along the water for their fins and down below to see if they were coming up to tear us to pieces it was a dreadful feeling it was not your fault swinburne i am sure i ought to have relieved you myself but i kept the first watch and was tired we must put our trust in god perhaps we may yet be spared it was now almost calm and the sun had mounted in the heavens the scorching rays were intolerable upon our heads for we had not the defence of hats i felt my brain on fire and was inclined to drop into the water to screen myself from the intolerable heat as the day advanced so did our sufferings increase it was a dead calm the sun perpendicular over us actually burning that part of our bodies which rose clear of the water i could have welcomed even a shark to relieve me of my torment but i thought of celeste and i clung to life towards the afternoon i felt sick and dizzy my resolution failed me my vision was imperfect but i was roused by swinburne who cried out a boat by all thats gracious hang on a little longer my men and you are saved it was a boat full of negroes who had come out to catch flyingfish they had perceived the spar on the water and hastened to secure the prize they dragged us all in gave us water which appeared like nectar and restored us to our fleeting senses they made fast the boom and towed it inshore we had not been ten minutes on our way when swinburne pointed to the fin of a large shark above the water look there mr simple i shuddered and made no answer but i thanked god in my heart in two hours we were landed but were too ill to walk we were carried up to the hospital bled and put into cots i had a brain fever which lasted six or seven days during which obrien never left my bedside my head was shaved all the skin came off my face like a mask as well as off my back and shoulders we were put into baths of brandy and water and in three weeks were all recovered that was but an unlucky schooner from beginning to end observed obrien after i had narrated the events of my cruise we had a bad beginning with her and we had a bad ending shes gone to the bottom and the devil go with her however alls well that ends well and peter youre worth a dozen dead men yet but you occasion me a great deal of trouble and anxiety thats the truth of it and i doubt if i shall ever rear you after all i returned to my duty on board of the brig which was now nearly ready for sea one morning obrien came on board and said peter ive a piece of news for you our gunner is appointed to the araxes and the admiral has given me a gunners warrant for old swinburne send for him on deck swinburne was summoned and came rolling up the hatchway swinburne said obrien you have done your duty well and you are now gunner of the rattlesnake here is your warrant and ive great pleasure in getting it for you swinburne turned the quid in his cheek and then replied may i be so bold as to ax captain obrien whether i must wear one of them long tog swallowtailed coatsbecause if so id prefer being a quartermaster a gunner may wear a jacket swinburne if he likes when you go on shore you may bend the swallowtail if you please well sir then if thats the case ill take the warrant because i know it will please the old woman so saying swinburne hitched up his trousers and went down below i may here observe that swinburne kept his round jacket until our arrival in england when the old woman his wife who thought her dignity at stake soon made him ship the swallowtail and after it was once on swinburne took a fancy to it and always wore it except when he was at sea the same evening as i was coming with obrien from the governors house where i had dined we passed a building lighted up what can that be observed obrien not a dignity ballthere is no music our curiosity induced us to enter and we found it to be fitted up as a temporary chapel filled with black and coloured people who were ranged on the forms and waiting for the preacher it is a methodist meeting said i to obrien never mind said he let us hear what is going on in a moment afterwards the pulpit was filled not by a white man as we had anticipated but by a tall negro he was dressed in black and his hair which it was impossible to comb down straight was plaited into fifty little tails well tied at the end of them like you sometimes see the mane of a horse this produced a somewhat more clerical appearance his throat was open and collar laid back the wristbands of his shirt very large and white and he flourished a white cambric handkerchief what a dandy he is whispered obrien i thought it almost too absurd when he said he would take the liberty to praise god in the th hymn and beg all the company to join chorus he then gave out the stanzas in the most strange pronunciation gentle jesus god um lub c when the hymn was finished which was sung by the whole congregation in the most delightful discordeveryone chose his own keyhe gave an extempore prayer which was most unfortunately incomprehensible and then commenced his discourse which was on faith i shall omit the head and front of his offending which would perhaps hardly be gratifying although ludicrous he reminded me of a monkey imitating a man but what amused me most was his finale in which he told his audience that there could be no faith without charity for a little while he descanted upon this generally and at last became personal his words were as well as i can recollect nearly as follows and now you see my dear bredren how unpossible to go to heaven with all the faith in the world without charity charity mean give away suppose you no giveyou no ab charity suppose you no ab charityyou no ab faith suppose you no ab faithyou all go to hell and be damned now den let me see if you ab charity here you see i come to save all your soul from hellfire and hellfire dam hot i can

my dear bredren we go down on our knees and thank god for all this and more especially that i save all your souls from going to the debil who run about barbadoes like one roaring lion seeking what he may lay hold of and cram into his dam fiery jaw that will do peter said obrien we have the cream of it i think we left the house and walked down to the boat surely obrien said i this should not be permitted hes no worse than his neighbours replied obrien and perhaps does less harm i admire the rascals ingenuity he gave his flock what in ireland we should call a pretty broad hint yes there was no mistaking him but is he a licensed preacher very little licence in his preaching i take it no i suppose he has had a call a callwhat do you mean i mean that he wants to fill his belly hunger is a call of nature peter he seems to want a good many things if we were to judge by his catalogue what a pity it is that these poor people are not better instructed that they never will be peter while there is what may be called free trade in religion you speak like a catholic obrien i am one replied he and here our conversation ended for we were close to the boat which was waiting for us on the beach the next day a manofwar brig arrived from england bringing letters for the squadron on the station i had two from my sister ellen which made me very uncomfortable she stated that my father had seen my uncle lord privilege and had had high words with him indeed as far as she could ascertain of the facts my father had struck my uncle and had been turned out of the house by the servants that he had returned in a state of great excitement and was very ill ever since that there was a great deal of talk in the neighbourhood on the subject people generally highly blaming my fathers conduct thinking that he was deranged in his intellecta supposition very much encouraged by my uncle she again expressed her hopes of my speedy return i had now been absent nearly three years and she had been so uncomfortable that she felt as if it had been at least ten obrien also received a letter from father mgrath which i shall lay before the reader my dear sonlong life and all the blessings of all the saints be upon you now and for evermore amen and may you live to be married and may i dance at your wedding and may you never want children and may they grow up as handsome as their father and their mother whoever she may hereafter be and may you die of a good old age and in the true faith and be waked handsomely as your own father was last friday sennight seeing as how he took it into his head to leave this world for a better it was a very dacent funeralprocession my dear terence and your father must have been delighted to see himself so well attinded no man ever made a more handsome corpse considering how old and thin and haggard he had grown of late and how gray his hair had turned he held the nosegay between his fingers across his breast as natural as life and reminded us all of the blessed saint pope gregory who was called to glory some hundred years before either you or i was born your mothers quite comfortable and there she sits in her ould chair rocking to and fro all day long and never speaking a word to nobody thinking about heaven i dare to say which is just what she ought to do seeing that she stands a very pretty chance of going there in the course of a month or so divil a word has she ever said since your fathers departure but then she screamed and yelled enough to last for seven years at the least she screamed away all her senses anyhow for she has done nothing since but cough cough and fumble at her paternostersa very blessed way to pass the remainder of her days seeing that i expect her to drop every minute like an overripe sleepy pear so dont think any more about her my son for without you are back in a jiffy her body will be laid in consecrated ground and her happy blessed soul in purgatory pax vobiscum amen amen and now having disposed of your father and your mother so much to your satisfaction ill just tell you that ellas mother died in the convent at dieppe but whether she kept her secret or not i do not know but this i do know that if she didnt relieve her soul by confession shes damned to all eternity thanks be to god for all his mercies amen ella flanagan is still alive and for a nun is as well as can be expected i find that she knows nothing at all about the matter of the exchanging the genders of the babbiesonly that her mother was on oath to father mdermot who ought to be hanged drawn and quartered instead of those poor fellows whom the government called rebels but who were no more rebels than father mgrath himself wholl uphold the pretender as they call our true catholic king as long as theres life in his body or a drop of whiskey left in ould ireland to drink his health wid talking about father mdermot puts me in mind that the bishop has not yet decided our little bit of a dispute saying that he must take time to think about it now considering that its just three years since the row took place the old gentleman must be a very slow thinker not to have found out by this time that i was in the right and that father mdermot the baste is not good enough to be hanged your two married sisters are steady and diligent young women having each made three children since you last saw them fine boys every mothers son of them with elegant spacious features and famous mouths for taking in whole potatoes by the powers but the offsets of the tree of the obriens begin to make a noise in the land anyhow as you would say if you only heard them roaring for their bit of suppers and now my dear son terence the real purport of this letter which is just to put to your souls conscience as a dutiful son whether you ought not to send me a small matter of money to save your poor fathers soul from pain and anguishfor its no joke that being in purgatory i can tell you and you wouldnt care how soon you were tripped out of it yourself i only wish you had but your little toe in it and then youd burn with impatience to have it out again but youre a dutiful son so ill say no more about ita nods as good as a wink to a blind horse when your mother goes which with the blessing of god will be in a very little while seeing that she has only to follow her senses which are gone already ill take upon myself to sell everything as worldly goods and chattels are of no use to dead people and i have no doubt but that what with the furniture and the two cows and the pigs and the crops in the ground there will be enough to save her soul from the flames and bury her dacently into the bargain however as you are the heiratlaw seeing that the property is all your own ill keep a debtor and creditor account of the whole and should there be any over ill use it all out in masses so as to send her up to heaven by express and if theres not sufficient she must remain where she is till you come back and make up the deficiency in the meanwhile i am your loving father in the faith urtagh mgrath chapter lii good sense in swinburneno man a hero to his valet de chambre or a prophet in his own countryobrien takes a step by strategyobrien parts with his friend and peters star no longer in the ascendant obrien was sorry for the death of his father but he could not feel as most people would have done as his father had certainly never been a father to him he was sent to sea to be got rid of and ever since he had been there had been the chief support of his family his father was very fond of whiskey and not very fond of exertion he was too proud of the true milesian blood in his veins to do anything to support himself but not too proud to live upon his sons hardearned gains for his mother obrien felt very much she had always been kind and affectionate and was very fond of him sailors however are so estranged from their families when they have been long in their profession and so accustomed to vicissitudes that no grief for the loss of a relation lasts very long and in a week obrien had recovered his usual spirits when a vessel brought us the intelligence that a french squadron had been seen off st domingo this put us all on the qui vive obrien was sent for by the admiral and ordered to hasten his brig for sea with all possible despatch as he was to proceed with despatches to england forthwith in three days we were reported ready received our orders and at eight oclock in the evening made sail from carlisle bay well mr swinburne said i how do you like your new situation why mr simple i like it well enough and its not disagreeable to be an officer and sit in your own cabin but still i feel that i should get on better if i were in another ship ive been hailfellow well met with the ships company so long that i cant top the officer over them and we cant get the duty done as smart as i could wish and then at night i find it very lonely stuck up in my cabin like a parsons clerk and nobody to talk to for the other warrants are particular and say that im only acting and may not be confirmed so they hold aloof i dont much like being answerable for all that lot of gunpowderits queer stuff to handle very true swinburne but still if there were no responsibility we should require no officers you recollect that you are now provided for life and will have halfpay thats what made me bite mr simple i thought of the old woman and how comfortable it would make her in her old age and so dye see i sacrificed myself how long have you been married swinburne ever since christmas i wasnt going to be hooked carelessly so i nibbled afore i took the bait had four years trial of her first and finding that she had plenty of ballast i sailed her as my own how do you mean by plenty of ballast i dont mean mr simple a broad bow and square hulk you know very well that if a vessel has not ballast shes bottom up in no time now what keeps a woman stiff under her canvas is her modesty very true but its a rare commodity on the beach and why mr simple because liquor is more valued many a good man has found it to be his bane and as for a woman when once she takes to it shes like a ship without a rudder and goes right before the wind to the devil not that i think a man ought not to take a norwester or two when he can get them rum was not given by god almighty only to make the niggers dance but to make all our hearts glad neither do i see why a woman is to stand out neither whats good for jack cant hurt poll only there is a medium as they say in all things and halfanhalf is quite strong enough i should think it was replied i laughing but dont be letting me prevent you from keeping a lookout mr simpleyou hoskins youre half a point off the wind luff you may i think mr simple that captain obrien didnt pick out the best man when he made tom alsop a quartermaster in my place why he is a very steady good man swinburne yes so he is but he has natural defects which shouldnt be overlooked i doubt if he can see so far as the head of the mainsail i was not aware of that no but i was alsop wants to sarve out his time for his pension and when he has sarved you see if when the surgeons examine him they dont invalid him as blind as a bat i should like to have him as gunners mate and thats just what hes fit for but mr simple i think we shall have some bad weather the moon looks greasy and the stars want snuffing youll have two reefs in the topsails afore morning theres five bells striking now ill turn in if i didnt keep half the first and half the morning watch i shouldnt sleep all the night i miss my regular watch very much mr simplehabits everything and i dont much fancy a standing bedplace its so large and i feel so cold of my sides nothing like a hammock after all goodnight mr simple our orders were to proceed with all possible despatch and obrien carried on day and night generally remaining up himself till one or two oclock in the morning we had very favourable weather and in a little more than a month we passed the lizard the wind being fair we passed plymouth ran up channel and anchored at spithead after calling upon the admiral obrien set off for town with his despatches and left me in command of the ship in three days i received a letter from him informing me that he had seen the first lord who had asked him a great many questions concerning the station he had quitted that he had also complimented obrien on his services on that hint i spake continued obrien i ventured to insinuate to his lordship that i had hoped i had earned my promotion and as there is nothing like quartering on the enemy i observed that i had not applied to lord privilege as i considered my services would have been sufficient without any application on his part his lordship returned a very gracious answer said that my lord privilege was a great ally of his and very friendly to the government and inquired when i was going to see him i replied that i certainly should not pay my respects to his lordship at present unless there was occasion for it as i must take a more favourable opportunity so i hope that good may come from the great lords error which of course i shall not correct as i feel i deserve my promotionand you know peter if you cant gain it by hook you must by crook he then concluded his letter but there was a postscript as follows wish me joy my dear peter i have this moment received a letter from the private secretary to say that i am posted and appointed to the semiramis frigate about to set sail for the east indies she is all ready to start and now i must try to get you with me of which i have no doubt as although her officers have been long appointed there will be little difficulty of success when i mention your relationship to lord privilege and while they remain in error as to his taking an interest in my behalf i rejoiced at obriens good fortune his promotion i had considered certain as his services had entitled him to it but the command of so fine a frigate must have been given upon the supposition that it would be agreeable to my uncle who was not only a prime supporter but a very useful member of the tory government i could not help laughing to myself at the idea of obrien obtaining his wishes from the influence of a person who probably detested him as much as one man could detest another and i impatiently waited for obriens next letter by which i hoped to find myself appointed to the semiramis but a sad contretemps took place obrien did not write but came down two days afterwards hastened on board the semiramis read his commission and assumed the command before even he had seen me he then sent his gig on board of the rattlesnake to desire me to come to him directly i did so and we went down into the cabin of the frigate peter said he i was obliged to hasten down and read myself captain of this ship as i am in fear that things are not going on well i had called to pay my respects at the admiralty previous to joining and was kicking my heels in the waitingroom when who should walk up the passage as if he were a captain on his own quarterdeck but your uncle lord privilege his eye met minehe recognised me immediatelyand if it did not flash fire it did something very like it he asked a few questions of one of the porters and was giving his card when my name was called for i passed him and up i went to the first lord thanked him for the frigate and having received a great many compliments upon my exertions in the west india station made my bow and retired i had intended to have requested your appointment but i knew that your name would bring up lord privileges and moreover your uncles card was brought up and laid upon the table while i was sitting there the first lord i presume thought that his lordship was come to thank him for his kindness to me which only made him more civil i made my bow and went down when i met the eye of lord privilege who looked daggers at me as he walked up stairsfor of course he was admitted immediately after my audience was finished instead of waiting to hear the result of the explanation i took a postchaise and have come down here as fast as four horses can bring me and have read myself infor peter i feel sure that if not on board my commission will be cancelled and i know that if once in command as i am now i can call for a courtmartial to clear my character if i am superseded i know that the admiralty can do anything but still they will be cautious in departing from the rules of the service to please even lord privilege i looked up at the sky as soon as i left the admiralty portico and was glad to see that the weather was so thick and the telegraph not at work or i might have been too late now ill go on shore and report myself to the admiral as having taken the command of the semiramis obrien went on shore to report himself was well received by the admiral who informed him that if he had any arrangements to make he could not be too soon as he should not be surprised if his sailing orders came down the next morning this was very annoying as i could not see how i should be able to join obriens ship even if i could effect an exchange in so short a time i therefore hastened on board of the semiramis and applied to the officers to know if any of them were willing to exchange into the rattlesnake but although they did not much like going to the east indies they would not exchange into a brig and i returned disappointed the next morning the admiral sent for obrien and told him confidentially for he was the same admiral who had received obrien when he had escaped from prison with me and was very kind to him that there was some hitch about his having the semiramis and that orders had come down to pay her off all standing and examine her bottom if captain obrien had not joined her do you understand what this means said the admiral who was anxious to know the reason obrien answered frankly that lord privilege by whose interest he had obtained his former command was displeased with him and that as he saw him go up to the first lord he had no doubt but that his lordship had said something to his disadvantage as he was a very vindictive man well said the admiral its lucky that you have taken the command as they cannot well displace you or send her into dock without a survey and upon your representation and so it proved the first lord when he found that obrien had joined took no further steps but allowed the frigate to proceed to her intended destination but all chance of my sailing with him was done away and now for the first time i had to part with obrien i remained with him the whole time that i could be spared from my duties obrien was very much annoyed but there was no help never mind peter said he ive been thinking that perhaps its all for the best you will see more of the world and be no longer in leadingstrings you are now a fine man grown up big enough and ugly enough as they say to take care of yourself we shall meet again and if we dont why then god bless you my boy and dont forget obrien three days afterwards obriens orders came down i accompanied him on board and it was not until the ship was under weigh and running towards the needles with a fair wind that i shook hands with him and shoved off parting with obrien was a heavy blow to me but i little knew how much i was to suffer before i saw him again chapter liii i am pleased with my new captainobtain leave to go homefind my father afflicted with a very strange disease and prove myself a very good doctor although the disorder always breaks out in a fresh place the day after obrien had sailed for the east indies the dockyard men came on board to survey the brig and she was found so defective as to be ordered into dock i had received letters from my sister who was overjoyed at the intelligence of my safe return and the anticipation of seeing me the accounts of my father were however very unsatisfactory my sister wrote that disappointment and anxiety had had such an effect upon him that he was deranged in his intellects our new captain came down to join us he was a very young man and had never before commanded a ship his character as lieutenant was well known and not very satisfactory being that of a harsh unpleasant officer but as he had never been first lieutenant it was impossible to say what he might prove when in command of a ship still we were a little anxious about it and severely regretted the loss of obrien he came on board the hulk to which the ships companys had been turned over and read his commission he proved to be all affability condescension and goodnature to me he was particularly polite stating that he should not interfere with me in carrying on the duty as i must be so well acquainted with the ships company we thought that those who gave us the information must have been prejudiced or mistaken in his character during the half hour that he remained on board i stated that now that the brig was in dock i should like very much to have an opportunity of seeing my friends if he would sanction my asking for leave to this he cheerfully consented adding that he would extend it upon his own responsibility my letter to the admiralty was therefore forwarded through him and was answered in the affirmative the day afterwards i set off by the coach and once more embraced my dear sister after the first congratulations were over i inquired about my father she replied that he was so wild that nobody could manage him that he was melancholy and irritable at the same time and was certainly deranged fancying himself to be made of various substances or to be in a certain trade or capacity that he generally remained in this way four or five days when he went to bed and slept for twentyfour hours or more and awoke with some new strange imagination in his head his language was violent but that in other respects he seemed to be more afraid of other people than inclined to be mischievous and that every day he was getting more strange and ridiculous he had now just risen from one of his long naps and was in his study that before he had fallen asleep he had fancied himself to be a carpenter and had sawed and chopped up several articles of furniture in the house i quitted my sister to see my father whom i found in his easychair i was much shocked at his appearance he was thin and haggard his eye was wild and he remained with his mouth constantly open a sicknurse who had been hired by my sister was standing by him pish pish pish pish cried my father what can you a stupid old woman know about my inside i tell you the gas is generating fast and even now i can hardly keep on my chair im liftinglifting now and if you dont tie me down with cords i shall go up like a balloon indeed sir replied the woman its only the wind in your stomach youll break it off directly its inflammable gas you old hecatei know it is tell me will you get a cord or will you not hah whos thatpeter why youve dropped from the clouds just in time to see me mount up to them i hope you feel yourself better sir said i i feel myself a great deal lighter every minute get a cord peter and tie me to the leg of the table i tried to persuade him that he was under a mistake but it was useless he became excessively violent and said i wished him in heaven as i had heard that it was better to humour people afflicted with hypochondriacism which was evidently the disease under which my father laboured i tried that method it appears to me sir said i that if we could remove the gas every ten minutes it would be a good plan yesbut how replied he shaking his head mournfully why with a syringe sir said i which will if empty of course draw out the gas when inserted into your mouth my dear peter you have saved my life be quick though or i shall go up right through the ceiling fortunately there was an instrument of that description in the house i applied it to his mouth drew up the piston and then ejected the air and reapplied it in two minutes he pronounced himself better and i left the old nurse hard at work and my father very considerably pacified i returned to my sister to whom i recounted what had passed but it was no source of mirth to us although had it happened to an indifferent person i might have been amused the idea of leaving her as i must soon dohaving only a fortnights leaveto be worried by my fathers unfortunate malady was very distressing but we entered into a long conversation in which i recounted the adventures that had taken place since i had left her and for the time forgot our source of annoyance and regret for three days my father insisted upon the old woman pumping the gas out of his body after that he again fell into one of his sleeps which lasted nearly thirty hours when he arose i went again to see him it was eight oclock in the evening and i entered with a candle take it awayquick take it away put it out carefully why whats the matter sir dont come near me if you love me dont come near me put it out i sayput it out i obeyed his orders and then asked him the reason reason said he now that we were in the dark cant you see no father i can see nothing in the dark well then peter im a magazine full of gunpowder the least spark in the world and i am blown up consider the danger you surely would not be the destruction of your father peter and the poor old gentleman burst into tears and wept like a child i knew that it was in vain to reason with him my dear father said i on board ship when there is any danger of this kind we always float the magazine now if you were to drink a good deal of water the powder would be spoiled and there would be no danger my father was satisfied with my proposal and drank a tumbler of water every halfhour which the old nurse was obliged to supply as fast as he called for it and this satisfied him for three or four days and i was again left to the company of my dear ellen when my father again fell into his stupor and we wondered what would be his next fancy i was hastily summoned by the nurse and found my poor father lying in bed and breathing in a very strange manner what is the matter my dear sir inquired i why dont you see what is the matter how is a poor little infant just born to live unless its mother is near to suckle it and take care of it indeed sir do you mean to say that you are just born to be sure i do im dying for the breast this was almost too absurd but i gravely observed that it was all very true but unfortunately his mother had died in childbirth and the only remedy was to bring him up by hand he agreed with me i desired the nurse to make some gruel with brandy and feed him which she did and he took the gruel just as if he were a baby i was about to wish him goodnight when he beckoned to me and said peter she hasnt changed my napkin this was too much and i could not help laughing i told the nurse what he said and she replied lord bless you sir what matter if the old gentleman takes a fancy why not indulge him ill fetch the kitchen tablecloth this fit lasted about six days for he went to sleep because a baby always slept much and i was in hopes it would last much longer but he again went off into his lethargic fit and after a long sleep awoke with a new fancy my time had nearly expired and i had written to my new captain requesting an extension of leave but i received an answer stating that it could not be granted and requesting me to join the brig immediately i was rather surprised at this but of course was compelled to obey and embracing my dear sister once more set off for portsmouth i advised her to humour my father and this advice she followed but his fancies were such occasionally as would have puzzled the most inventive genius to combat or to find the remedy which he might acknowledge to be requisite his health became certainly worse and worse and his constitution was evidently destroyed by a slow undermining bodily and mental fever the situation of my poor sister was very distressing and i quitted her with melancholy forebodings i ought here to observe that i received all my prizemoney amounting to l a large sum for a lieutenant i put it into the funds and gave a power of attorney to ellen requesting her to use it as her own we consulted as to what she should do if my father should die and agreed that all his debts which we knew to amount to three or four hundred pounds should be paid and that she should manage how she could upon what was left of my fathers property and the interest of my prizemoney chapter liv we receive our sailing orders and orders of every descriptiona quarterdeck conversationlisteners never hear any good of themselves when i arrived at portsmouth i reported myself to the captain who lived at the hotel i was ushered into his room to wait for him as he was dressing to dine with the admiral my eyes naturally turned to what lay on the table merely from the feeling which one has to pass away the time not from curiosity and i was much surprised to see a pile of letters the uppermost of which was franked by lord privilege this however might be merely accidental but my curiosity was excited and i lifted up the letter and found that the second the third and indeed at least ten of these were franked by my uncle i could not imagine how there could be any intimacy between him and my uncle and was reflecting upon it when captain hawkins for that was his name entered the room he was very kind and civil apologized for not being able to extend my leave which he said was because he had consulted the admiral who would not sanction the absence of the first lieutenant and had very peremptorily desired he would recall me immediately i was satisfied he shook my hand and we parted on my arrival on board the hulk for the brig was still in dock i was warmly received by my messmates they told me that the captain had generally speaking been very civil but that occasionally the marks of the cloven foot appeared webster said i to the second lieutenant do you know anything about his family or connections it is a question i have asked of those who have sailed with him and they all say that he never speaks of his own family but very often boasts of his intimacy with the nobility some say that he is a byeblow of some great man i reflected very much upon this and connecting it with the numerous franks of lord privilege which i saw on the table had my misgivings but then i knew that i could do my duty and had no reason to fear any man i resolved in my own mind to be very correct and put it out of the power of any one to lay hold of me and then dismissed the subject the brig was repaired and out of dock and for some days i was very busy getting her ready for sea i never quitted her in fact i had no wish i never had any taste for bad company and midnight orgies and i had no acquaintance with the respectable portion of the inhabitants of portsmouth at last the ships company were removed into the brig we went out of harbour and anchored at spithead captain hawkins came on board and gave me an orderbook saying mr simple i have a great objection to written orders as i consider that the articles of war are quite sufficient to regulate any ship still a captain is in a very responsible situation and if any accident occurs he is held amenable i therefore have framed a few orders of my own for the interior discipline of the vessel which may probably save me harmless in case of being hauled over the coals but not with any wish that they should interfere with the comforts of the officers only to guard against any mischance of which the onus may fall upon myself i received the orderbook and the captain went ashore when i went down into the gunroom to look through it i at once perceived that if rigidly conformed to every officer in the ship would be rendered uncomfortable and if not conformed to i should be the party that was answerable i showed it to webster who agreed with me and gave it as his opinion that the captains good nature and amiability were all a blind and that he was intending to lay hold of us as soon as it was in his power i therefore called all the officers together and told them my opinion webster supported me and it was unanimously agreed that the orders should be obeyed although not without remonstrance the major part of the orders however only referred to the time that the brig was in harbour and as we were about to proceed to sea it was hardly worth while saying anything at present the orders for the sailing of the brig came down and by the same post i received a letter from my sister ellen stating that they had heard from captain fielding who had immediately written to bombay where the regiment was stationed and had received an answer informing him that there was no married man in the regiment of the name of sullivan and no woman who had followed that regiment of that name this at once put an end to all our researches after the wetnurse who had been confined in my uncles house where she had been sent it was of course impossible to say but i gave up all chance of discovering my uncles treachery and as i thought of celeste sighed at the little hope i had of ever being united to her i wrote a long letter to obrien and the next day we sailed for our station in the north sea the captain added a night orderbook to the other and sent it up every evening to be returned in the morning with the signature of every officer of the night watches he also required all our signatures to his general orderbook that we might not say we had not read them i had the first watch when swinburne came up to me well mr simple i do not think we have made much by our exchange of captains and i have a shrewd suspicion we shall have squalls ere long we must not judge too hastily swinburne replied i no noi dont say that we should but still one must go a little by looks in the world and im sure his looks wouldnt help him much hes just like a winters day short and dirty and he walks the deck as if planks were not good enough for his feet mr williams says he looks as if he were big with the fate of cato and of rome what that means i dont knowsome joke i suppose for the youngsters are always joking were you ever up the baltic mr simple now i think of it i know you never were ive seen some tight work up there with the gunboats and so we should now with captain obrien but as for this little man ive an idea twill be more talk than work you appear to have taken a great dislike to the captain swinburne i do not know whether as first lieutenant i ought to listen to you its because youre first lieutenant that i tell it you mr simple i never was mistaken in the main of an officers character when i could look him in the face and hear him talk for half an hour and i came up on purpose to put you on your guard for i feel convinced that towards you he means mischief what does he mean by having the greasyfaced serjeant of marines in his cabin for half an hour every morning his reports as master of arms ought to come through you as first lieutenant but he means him as a spy upon all and upon you in particular the fellow has begun to give himself airs already and speaks to the young gentlemen as if they were beneath him i thought you might not know it mr simple so i thought it right to tell you i am much obliged to you swinburne for your good wishes but i can do my duty and why should i fear anything a man may do his duty mr simple but if a captain is determined to ruin him he has the power i have been longer in the service than you have and have been wide awake only be careful of one thing mr simple i beg your pardon for being so free but in no case lose your temper no fear of that swinburne replied i its very easy to say no fear of that mr simple but recollect you have not yet had your temper tried as some officers have you have always been treated like a gentleman but should you find yourself treated otherwise you have too good blood in your veins not to speaki am sure of that ive seen officers insulted and irritated till no angel could put up with the treatmentand then for an unguarded word which they would have been swabs not to have made use of sent out of the service to the devil but you forget swinburne that the articles of war are made for the captain as well as for everybody else in the ship i know that but still at courtmartials captains make a great distinction between what a superior says to an inferior and what an inferior says to a superior true replied i quoting shakespeare thats in the captain but a choleric word which in the soldier is rank blasphemy exactly my meaningi rather think said swinburne if a captain calls you no gentleman you musnt say the same to him certainly not but i can demand a courtmartial yes and it will be granted but what do you gain by that its like beating against a heavy gale and a lee tidethousand to one if you fetch your port and if you do your vessel is strained to pieces sails worn as thin as a newspaper and rigging chafed half through wanting fresh serving no orders for a refit and laid up in ordinary for the rest of your life no no mr simple the best plan is to grin and bear it and keep a sharp lookout for depend upon it mr simple in the best ships company in the world a spy captain will always find spy followers do you refer that observation to me mr swinburne said a voice from under the bulwark i started round and found the captain who had crept upon deck unperceived by us during our conversation swinburne made no reply but touched his hat and walked over to leeward i presume mr simple said the captain turning to me that you consider yourself justified in finding fault and abusing your captain to an inferior officer on his majestys quarterdeck if you heard the previous conversation sir replied i you must be aware that we were speaking generally about courtmartials i do not imagine that i have been guilty of any impropriety in conversing with an officer upon points connected with the service you mean then to assert sir that the gunner did not refer to me when he said the words spy captain i acknowledge sir that as you were listening unperceived the term might appear to refer to you but the gunner had no idea at the time that you were listening his observation was that a spy captain would always find spy followers this i take to be a general observation and i am sorry that you think otherwise very well mr simple said captain hawkinsand he walked down the companion ladder into his cabin now ant it odd mr simple that i should come up with the intention of being of service to you and yet get you into such a scrape however perhaps it is all for the best open war is preferable to watching in the dark and stabbing in the back he never meant to have shown his colours but i hit him so hard that he forgot himself i suspect that to be the case swinburne but i think that you had better not talk any more with me tonight wish i hadnt talked quite so much as things have turned out replied swinburne goodnight sir i reflected upon what had passed and felt convinced that swinburne was right in saying that it was better this had occurred than otherwise i now knew the ground which i stood upon and forewarned was being forearmed chapter lv we encounter a dutch brig of warcaptain hawkins very contemplative near the capstanhard knocks and no thanks for itwhos afraidmen will talkthe brig goes about on the wrong tack at daylight the next morning we were off the texel and could see the low sandhills but we had scarcely made them out when the fog in the offing cleared up and we made a strange vessel the hands were turned up and all sail made in chase we made her out to be a brig of war and as she altered her course considerably we had an idea that she was an enemy we made the private signal which was unanswered and we cleared for action the brig making all sail on the starboard tack and we following hershe bearing about two miles on our weather bow the breeze was not steady at one time the brig was staggering under her topgallant sails while we had our royals set at another we would have hands by the topgallant sheets and topsail halyards while she expanded every stitch of canvas on the whole however in an hour we had neared about half a mile our men were all at their quarters happy to be so soon at their old work their jackets and hats were thrown off a bandana handkerchief tied round their heads and another or else their black silk handkerchiefs tied round their waists every gun was ready everything was in its place and every soul i was going to say was anxious for the setto but i rather think i must not include the captain who from the commencement showed no signs of pleasure and anything but presence of mind when we first chased the vessel it was reported that it was a merchantman and it was not until we had broad daylight that we discovered her to be a manofwar there was one thing to be said in his favourhe had never been in action in his life the breeze now fell light and we were both with our sails set when a thick fog obscured her from our sight the fog rolled on till we met it and then we could not see ten yards from the brig this was a source of great mortification as we had every chance of losing her fortunately the wind was settling down fast into a calm and about twelve oclock the sails flapped against the mast i reported twelve oclock and asked the captain whether we should pipe to dinner not yet replied he we will put her head about go about sir replied i with surprise yes said he im convinced that the chase is on the other tack at this moment and if we do not we shall lose her if she goes about sir said i she must get among the sands and we shall be sure of her sir replied he when i ask your advice you will be pleased to give it i command this vessel i touched my hat and turned the hands up about ship convinced that the captain wished to avoid the action as the only chance of escape for the brig was her keeping her wind in the tack she was on bout shipbout ship cried the men what the hell are we going about for inquired they of one another as they came up the ladder silence there fore and aft cried i captain hawkins i do not think we can get her round unless we wearthe wind is very light then wear ship mr simple there are times when grumbling and discontent among the seamen is so participated by the officers although they do not show it that the expressions made use of are passed unheeded such was the case at present the officers looked at each other and said nothing but the men were unguarded in their expressions the brig wore gradually round and when the men were bracing up the yards sharp on the other tack instead of the hurrah and down with the mark they fell back with a groan brace up those yards in silence there said i to the men the ropes were coiled down and we piped to dinner the captain who continued on deck could not fail to hear the discontented expressions which occasionally were made use of on the lower deck he made no observation but occasionally looked over the side to see whether the brig went through the water this she did slowly for about ten minutes when it fell a perfect calmso that to use a common sea phrase he gained little by his motion about halfpast one a slight breeze from the opposite quarter sprung upwe turned round to itit increasedthe fog blew away and in a quarter of an hour the chase was again visible now upon our lee beam the men gave three cheers silence there fore and aft cried the captain angrily mr simple is this the way that the ships company have been disciplined under their late commander to halloo and bawl whenever they think proper i was irritated at any reflection upon obrien and i replied yes sir they have been always accustomed to express their joy at the prospect of engaging the enemy very well mr simple replied he how are we to shift her head inquired the master touching his hat for the chase of course replied the captain who then descended into his cabin come my lads said swinburne as soon as the captain was below i have been going round and i find that your pets are all in good fighting order i promise ye you shant wait for powder theyll find that the rattlesnake can bite devilish hard yet i expectaye and without its head too replied one of the men who was the joe miller of the brig the chase perceiving that she could not escapefor we were coming up with her hand over hand now shortened sail for action hoisting dutch colours captain hawkins again made his appearance on the quarterdeck when we were within half a mile of her are we to run alongside of her or how inquired i mr simple i command her replied he and want no interference whatever very well sir replied i and i walked to the gangway mr thompson cried the captain who appeared to have screwed up his courage to the right pitch and had now taken his position for a moment on one of the carronades you will lay the brig right bang bangwhiz whizbangwhiz came three shots from the enemy cleaving the air between our masts the captain jumped down from the carronade and hastened to the capstern without finishing his sentence shall we fire when we are ready sir said i for i perceived that he was not capable of giving correct orders yesyes to be sure replied he remaining where he was thompson said i to the master i think we can manage in our present commanding position to get foul of him so as to knock away his jibboom and fore topmast and then she cant escape we have good way on her ill manage it simple or my names not thompson replied the master jumping into the quarterboat conning the vessel in that exposed situation as we received the enemys fire look out my lads and pour it into her now just as you please said i to the men the seamen were however too well disciplined to take immediate advantage of my permission they waited until we passed her and just as the master put up his helm so as to catch her jibboom between our masts the whole broadside was poured into his bow and chesstree her jibboom and foretopgallant went down and she had so much way through the water that we tore clear from her and rounding to the wind shot ahead the enemy although in confusion from the effects of our broadside put up his helm to rake us we perceived his manoeuvre and did the same and then squaring our sails we ran with him before the wind engaging broadside to broadside this continued about half an hour and we soon found that we had no fool to play with the brig was well fought and her guns well directed we had several men taken down below and i thought it would be better to engage her even closer there was about a cables length between both vessels as we ran before the wind at about six miles an hour with a slight rolling motion thompson said i let us see if we cannot beat them from their guns lets port the helm and close her till we can shy a biscuit on board just my opinion simple well see if they wont make another sort of running fight of it in a few minutes we were so close on board of her that the men who loaded the guns could touch each other with their rammers and sponges the men cheered it was gallantly returned by the enemy and havoc was now commenced by the musketry on both sides the french captain who appeared as brave a fellow as ever stepped stood for some minutes on the hammocks i was also holding on by the swifter of the main rigging when he took off his hat and politely saluted me i returned the compliment but the fire became too hot and i wished to get under the shelter of the bulwark still i would not go down first and the french captain appeared determined not to be the first either to quit the post of honour at last one of our marines hit him in the right arm he clapped his hand to the part as if to point it out to me nodded and was assisted down from the hammocks i immediately quitted my post for i thought it foolish to stand as a mark for forty or fifty soldiers i had already received a bullet through the small of my leg but the effects of such close fire now became apparent our guns were only half manned our sides terribly cut up and our sails and rigging in tatters the enemy was even worse off and two broadsides more brought her mainmast by the board our men cheered and threw in another broadside the enemy dropped astern we rounded to rake her she also attempted to round to but could not until she had cleared away her wreck and taken in her foresail and lowered her topsail she then continued the action with as much spirit as ever hes a fine fellow by god exclaimed thompson i never saw a man fight his ship better but we have him websters down poor fellow im sorry for it replied i but im afraid that there are many poor fellows who have lost the number of their mess i think it useless throwing away the advantage which we now have he cant escape and hell fight this way for ever we had better run ahead repair damages and then he must surrender in his crippled state when we attack him again i agree with you said thompson the only point is that it will soon be dark ill not lose sight of him and he cannot get away if he puts before the wind then we will be at him again we gave him the loaded guns as we forged ahead and when we were about half a mile from him hoveto to repair damages the reader may now ask but where was the captain all this time my answer is that he was at the capstern where he stood in silence not once interfering during the whole action which was fought by thompson the master and myself how he looked or how he behaved in other points during the engagement i cannot pretend to say for i had no time to observe him even now i was busy knotting the rigging rousing up new sails to bend and getting everything in order and i should not have observed him had he not come up to me for as soon as we had ceased firing he appeared to recover himself he did not however first address me he commenced speaking to the men come be smart my lads send a hand here to swab up the blood here youngster run down to the surgeon and let him know that i wish a report of the killed and wounded by degrees he talked more and at last came up to me this has been rather smartish mr simple very smart indeed sir replied i and then turned away to give directions maintop there send down the hauling line on the starboard side ay ay sir now then my lads clap on and run it up at once maintop there hailed the captain be a little smarter or by gd ill call you down for something this did not come with a good grace from one who had done nothing to those who were working with all their energy mr simple said the captain i wish you would carry on duty with less noise at all events he set us that example during the action muttered the joe miller and the other men laughed heartily at the implication in two hours during which we had carefully watched the enemy who still lay where we left him we were again ready for action shall i give the men their grog now sir said i to the captain they must want it no no replied the captain no no mr simple i dont like what you call dutch courage i dont think he much does and this fellow has shown plenty of it said the joe miller softly and the men about him laughed heartily i think sir observed i that it is an injustice to this fine ships company to hint at their requiring dutch courage dutch courage is a term for courage screwed up by drinking freely and i most respectfully beg leave to observe that the men have not had their afternoons allowance and after the fatigues they have undergone really require it i command this ship sir replied he certainly sir i am aware of it rejoined i she is now all ready for action again and i wait your orders the enemy is two miles on the lee quarter the surgeon here came up with his report good heavens said the captain fortyseven men killed and wounded mr webster dangerously why the brig is crippled we can do no more positively we can do no more we can take that brig anyhow cried one of the seamen from a dozen of the men who were to leeward expecting orders to renew the attack what man was that cried the captain no one answered by gd this ship is in a state of mutiny mr simple will soon be i think said a voice from the crowd which i knew very well but the captain having been but a short time with us did not know it do you hear that mr simple cried the captain i regret to say that i did hear it sir i little thought that ever such an expression would have been made use of on board of the rattlesnake then fearing he would ask me the mans name and to pretend not to have recognised it i said who was that who made use of that expression but no one answered and it was so dark that it was impossible to distinguish the men after such mutinous expressions observed the captain i certainly will not risk his majestys brig under my command as i should have wished to have done even in her crippled state by again engaging the enemy i can only regret that the officers appear as insolent as the men perhaps captain hawkins you will state in what and when i have proved myself insolent i cannot accuse myself i hope the expression was not applied to me sir said thompson the master touching his hat silence gentlemen if you please mr simple wear round the ship whether the captain intended to attack the enemy or not we could not tell but we were soon undeceived for when we were round he ordered her to be kept away until the dutch brig was on our lee quarter then ordering the master to shape his course for yarmouth he went down into the cabin and sent up word that i might pipe to supper and serve out the spirits the rage and indignation of the men could not be withheld after they went down to supper they gave three heavy groans in concert indeed during the whole of that night the officers who kept the watches had great difficulty in keeping the men from venting their feeling in what might be almost termed justifiable mutiny as for myself i could hardly control my vexation the brig was our certain prize and this was proved for the next day she hauled down her colours immediately to a much smaller manofwar which fell in with her still lying in the same crippled state the captain and first lieutenant killed and nearly twothirds of her ships company either killed or wounded had we attacked her she would have hauled down her colours immediately for it was our last broadside which had killed the captain as first lieutenant i should have received my promotion which was now lost i cried for vexation when i thought of it as i lay in bed that his conduct was severely commented upon by the officers in the gunroom as well as by the whole ships company i hardly need say thompson was for bringing him to a courtmartial which i would most gladly have done if it only were to get rid of him but i had a long conversation with old swinburne on the subject and he proved to me that i had better not attempt it for dye see mr simple you have no proof he did not run down below he stood his ground on deck although he did nothing you cant prove cowardice then although there can be no great doubt of it again with regard to his not renewing the attack why is not a captain at liberty to decide what is the best for his majestys service and if he thought in the crippled state of the brig so close to the enemys coast that it wasnt advisable why it could only be brought in as an error in judgment then theres another thing which must be remembered mr simple which is that no captains sitting on a courtmartial will if it be possible to extricate him ever prove cowardice against a brother captain because they feel that its a disgrace to the whole cloth swinburnes advice was good and i gave up all thoughts of proceeding still it appeared to me that the captain was very much afraid that i would he was so extremely amiable and polite during our run home he said that he had watched how well i had behaved in the action and would not fail to notice it this was something but he did not keep his word for his despatch was published before we quitted the roadstead and not the name of one officer mentioned only generally saying that they conducted themselves to his satisfaction he called the enemy a corvette not specifying whether she was a brig or ship corvette and the whole was written in such a bombastic style that any one would have imagined that he had fought a vessel of superior force he stated at the end that as soon as he repaired damages he wore round but that the enemy declined further action so she didcertainlyfor the best of all possible reasons that she was too disabled to come down to us all this might have been contested but the enormous list of killed and wounded proved that we had had a hard fight and the capture of the brig afterwards that we had really overpowered her so that on the whole captain hawkins gained a great deal of credit with some although whispers were afloat which came to the ears of the admiralty and prevented him from being postedthe more so as he had the modesty not to apply for it chapter lvi consequences of the actiona ship without a fighting captain is like a thing without a headso do the sailors thinka mutiny and the loss of our famous ships company during our stay at yarmouth we were not allowed to put our foot on shore upon the plea that we must repair damages and proceed immediately to our station but the real fact was that captain hawkins was very anxious that we should not be able to talk about the action finding no charges preferred against him he recommenced his system of annoyance his apartments had windows which looked out upon where the brig lay at anchor and he constantly watched all our motions with his spyglass noting down if i did not hoist up boats c exactly at the hour prescribed in his book of orders so as to gather a list of charges against me if he could this we did not find out until afterwards i mentioned before that when swinburne joined us at plymouth he had recommended a figurehead being put on the brig this had been done at obriens expensenot in the cheap way recommended by swinburne but in a very handsome manner it was a large snake coiled up in folds with its head darting out in a menacing attitude and the tail with its rattle appeared below the whole was gilded and had a very good effect but after the dockyard men had completed the repairs and the brig was painted one night the head of the rattlesnake disappeared it had been sawed off by some malicious and evil disposed persons and no traces of it were to be found i was obliged to report this to the captain who was very indignant and offered twenty pounds for the discovery of the offender but had he offered twenty thousand he never would have found out the delinquent it was however never forgotten for he understood what was implied by these manoeuvres a new head was carved but disappeared the night after it was fixed on the rage of the captain was without bounds he turned the hands up and declared that if the offender was not given up he would flog every hand on board he gave the ships company ten minutes and then prepared to execute his threat mr paul turn the hands up for punishment said the captain in a rage and descended to his cabin for the articles of war when he was down below the officers talked over the matter to flog every man for the crime of one was the height of injustice but it was not for us to oppose him still the ships company must have seen in our countenances that we shared their feelings the men were talking with each other in groups until they all appeared to have communicated their ideas on the subject the carpenters who had been slowly bringing aft the gratings left off the job the boatswains mates who had came aft rolled the tails of their cats round the red handles and every man walked down below no one was left on the quarterdeck but the marines under arms and the officers perceiving this i desired mr paul the boatswain to send the men up to rig the gratings and the quartermasters with their seizings he came up and said that he had called them but that they did not answer perceiving that the ships company would break out into open mutiny if the captain persisted in his intention i went down into the cabin and told the captain the state of things and wished for his orders or presence on deck the captain whose wrath appeared incapable of reflection immediately proceeded on deck and ordered the marines to load with ballcartridge this was done but as i was afterwards told by thompson who was standing aft the marines loaded with powder and put the balls into their pockets they wished to keep up the character of their corps for fidelity and at the same time not fire upon men whom they loved as brothers and with whom they coincided in opinion indeed we afterwards discovered that it was a marine who had taken off the head of the snake a second time the captain then ordered the boatswain to turn the hands up the boatswain made his appearance with his right arm in a slingwhats the matter with your arm mr paul said i as he passed me tumbled down the hatchway just nowcant move my arm i must go to the surgeon as soon as this is over the hands were piped up again but no one obeyed the order thus was the brig in a state of mutiny mr simple go forward to the main hatchway with the marines and fire on the lower deck cried the captain sir said i there are two frigates within a cables length of us and would it not be better to send for assistance without shedding blood besides sir you have not yet tried the effect of calling up the carpenters and boatswains mates by name will you allow me to go down first and bring them to a sense of their duty yes i presume you know your power but of this hereafter i went down below and called the men by name sir said one of the boatswains mates the ships company say that they will not submit to be flogged i do not speak to the ships company generally collins replied i but you are now ordered to rig the gratings and come on deck it is an order that you cannot refuse go up directly and obey it quartermasters go on deck with your seizings when all is ready you can then expostulate the men obeyed my orders they crawled on deck rigged the gratings and stood by all is ready sir said i touching my hat to the captain send the ships company aft mr paul aft then all of you for punishment cried the boatswain yes it is all of us for punishment cried one voice were all to flog one another and then pay off the jollies this time the men obeyed the order they all appeared on the quarterdeck the men are all aft sir reported the boatswain and now my lads said the captain ill teach you what mutiny is you see the two frigates alongside of us you had forgotten them i suppose but i hadnt here you scoundrel mr jonesthis was the joe millerstrip sir if ever there was mischief in a ship you are at the head head sir said the man assuming a vacant look what head sir do you mean the snakes head i dont know anything about it sir strip sir cried the captain in a rage ill soon bring you to your senses if you please your honour what have i done to be tied up said the man strip you scoundrelwell sir if you please its hard to be flogged for nothing the man pulled off his clothes and walked up to the grating the quartermasters seized him up seized up sir reported the scoundrel of a sergeant of marines who acted as the captains spy the captain looked for the articles of war to read as is necessary previous to punishing a man and was a little puzzled to find one where no positive offence had been committed at last he pitched upon the one which refers to combination and conspiracy and creating discontent we all took off our hats as he read it and he then called mr paul the boatswain and ordered him to give the man a dozen please sir said the boatswain pointing to his arm in a sling i cant flogi cant lift up my armyour arm was well enough when i came on board sir cried the captain yes sir but in hurrying the men up i slipped down the ladder and im afraid ive put my shoulder out the captain bit his lips he fully believed it was a sham on the part of the boatswain which indeed it was to get off flogging the men well then where is the chief boatswains mate miller here sir said miller coming forward a stout muscular man nearly six feet high with a pigtail nearly four feet long and his open breast covered with black shaggy hair give that man a dozen sir said the captain the man looked at the captain then at the ships company and then at the man seized up but did not commence the punishment do you hear me sir roared the captain if you please your honour id rather take my disratingidont wish to be chief boatswains mate in this here business obey your orders immediately sir cried the captain or by god ill try you for mutiny well sir i beg your pardon but what must be must be i mean no disrespect captain hawkins but i cannot flog that manmy conscience wont let me your conscience sir beg your pardon captain hawkins ive always done my duty foul weather or fair and ive been eighteen years in his majestys service without ever being brought to punishment but if i am to be hung now saving your pleasure and with all respect i cant help it i give you but one moment more sir cried the captain do your duty the man looked at the captain and then eyed the yardarm captain hawkins i will do my duty although i must swing for it so saying he threw his cat down on the quarterdeck and fell back among the ships company the captain was now confounded and hardly knew how to act to persevere appeared uselessto fall back was almost as impossible a dead silence of a minute ensued every one was breathless with impatience to know what would be done next the silence was however first broken by jones the joe miller who was seized up beg your honours pardon sir said he turning his head round but if i am to be flogged will you be pleased to let me have it over i shall catch my death acold naked here all day this was decided mockery on the part of the man and roused the captain sergeant of marines put miller and that man collins both legs in irons for mutiny my men i perceive that there is a conspiracy in the ship but i shall very soon put an end to it i know the men and by god they shall repent it mr paul pipe down mr simple man my gig and recollect its my positive orders that no boat goes on shore the captain left the brig looking daggers at me as he went over the side but i had done my duty and cared little for that indeed i was now watching his conduct as carefully as he did mine the captain wishes to tell his own story first said thompson coming up to me now if i were you simple i would take care that the real facts should be known hows that to be done replied i he has ordered no communication with the shore simply by sending an officer on board of each of the frigates to state that the brig is in a state of mutiny and request that they will keep a lookout upon her this is no more than your duty as commanding officer you only send the message leave me to state the facts of my own accord recollect that the captains of these frigates will be summoned if there is a court of inquiry which i expect will take place i considered a little and thought the advice good i despatched thompson first to one frigate and then to the other the next day the captain came on board as soon as he stepped on the quarterdeck he inquired how i dare disobey his orders in sending the boats away my reply was that his orders were not to communicate with the shore but that as commanding officer i considered it my duty to make known to the other ships that the men were in a state of insubordination that they might keep their eyes upon us he kept his eyes upon me for some time and then turned away without reply as we expected a court of inquiry was called upon his representations to the admiral about twenty of the men were examined but so much came out as to the reason why the head of the snake had been removedfor the sailors spoke boldlythat the admiral and officers who were appointed strongly recommended captain hawkins not to proceed further than to state that there were some disaffected characters in the ship and move the admiral to have them exchanged into others this was done and the captains of the frigates who immediately gave their advice divided all our best men between them they spoke very freely to me and asked me who were the best men which i told them honestly for i was glad to be able to get them out of the power of captain hawkins these they marked as disaffected and exchanged them for all the worst they had on board the few that were left ran away and thus from having one of the finest and best organised ships companies in the service we were now one of the very worst miller was sent on board of the frigate and under surveillance he soon proved that his character was as good as i stated it to be and two years afterwards was promoted to the rank of boatswain webster the second lieutenant would not rejoin us and another was appointed i must here remark that there is hardly any degree of severity which a captain may not exert towards his seamen provided they are confident of or he has proved to them his courage but if there be a doubt or a confirmation to the contrary all discipline is destroyed by contempt and the ships company mutiny either directly or indirectly there is an old saying that all tyrants are cowards that tyranny is in itself a species of meanness i acknowledge but still the saying ought to be modified if it is asserted that all mean tyrants are cowards i agree but i have known in the service most special tyrants who were not cowards their tyranny was excessive but there was no meanness in their dispositions on the contrary they were generous openhearted and occasionally when not influenced by anger proved that their hearts if not quite right were not very much out of their places yet they were tyrants but although tyrants the men forgave them and one kind act when they were not led away by the impetuosity of their feelings obliterated a hundred acts of tyranny but such is not the case in our service with men who in their tyranny are mean the seamen show no quarter to them and will undergo all the risk which the severity of the articles of war renders them liable to rather than not express their opinion of a man whom they despise i do not like to mention names but i could point out specimens of brave tyrants and of cowardly tyrants who have existed and do even now exist in our service the present regulations have limited tyranny to a certain degree but it cannot check the mean tyrant for it is not in points of consequence likely to be brought before the notice of his superiors that he effects his purpose he resorts to paltry measureshe smiles that he may betrayhe confines himself within the limit that may protect him and he is never exposed unless by his courage being called in question which but rarely occurs and when it does occur it is most difficult as well as most dangerous to attempt to prove it it may be asked why i did not quit the ship after having been aware of the character of the captain and the enmity which he bore to me in reply i can only say that i did often think of it talked over the subject with my messmates but they persuaded me to remain and as i was a first lieutenant and knew that any successful action would in all probability insure my promotion i determined to use a nautical expression to rough it out and not throw away the only chance which i now had of obtaining my rank as commander footnote marines chapter lvii news from home not very agreeable although the reader may laughwe arrive at portsmouth where i fall in with my old acquaintance mrs trotterwe sail with a convoy for the baltic i had written to my sister ellen giving her an account of all that had passed and mentioning the character of the captain and his apparent intimacy with my uncle i received an answer from her telling me that she had discovered from a very communicative old maiden lady that captain hawkins was an illegitimate son of my uncle by a lady with whom he had been acquainted about the time that he was in the army i immediately conceived the truth that my uncle had pointed me out to him as an object of his vengeance and that captain hawkins was too dutiful and too dependent a son not to obey him the state of my father was more distressing than ever but there was something very ludicrous in his fancies he had fancied himself a jackass and had brayed for a week kicking the old nurse in the stomach so as to double her up like a hedgehog he had taken it into his head that he was a pump and with one arm held out as a spout he had obliged the poor old nurse to work the other up and down for hours together at another time he had an idea that he was a woman in labour and they were obliged to give him a strong dose of calomel and borrow a child of six years old from a neighbour to make him believe that he was delivered he was perfectly satisfied although the child was born to him in cloth trousers and a jacket with three rows of sugarloaf buttons aye said he it was those buttons which hurt my side so much in fact there was a string of strange conceptions of this kind that had accumulated so as to drive my poor sister almost mad and sometimes his ideas would be attended with a very heavy expense as he would send for architects make contracts c for building supposing himself to have come to the title and property of his brother this being the basis of his disease occurred frequently i wrote to poor ellen giving her my best advice and by this time the brig was again ready for sea and we expected to sail immediately i did not forget to write to obrien but the distance between us was so great that i knew i could not obtain his answer probably for a year and i felt a melancholy foreboding how much i required his advice our orders were to proceed to portsmouth and join a convoy collected there bound up the baltic under the charge of the acasta frigate and two other vessels we did not sail with any pleasure or hopes of gaining much in the way of prizemoney our captain was enough to make any ship a hell and our ships company were composed of a mutinous and incorrigible set of scoundrels with of course a few exceptions how different did the officers find the brig after losing such a captain as obrien and so fine a ships company but there was no help for it and all we had to do was to make the best of it and hope for better times the cat was at work nearly every day and i must acknowledge that generally speaking it was deserved although sometimes a report from the sergeant of marines of any good man favoured by me was certain to be attended to this system of receiving reports direct from an inferior officer instead of through me as first lieutenant became so annoying that i resolved at all risk to expostulate i soon had an opportunity for one morning the captain said to me mr simple i understand that you had a fire in the galley last night after hours it is very true sir that i did order a stove to be lighted but may i inquire whether the first lieutenant has not a discretionary power in that point and further how it is that i am reported to you by other people the discipline of this ship is carried on by me under your directions and all reports ought to come through me and i cannot understand upon what grounds you permit them through any other channel i command my own ship sir and shall do as i please in that respect when i have officers i can confide in i shall in all probability allow them to report to me if there is anything in my conduct which has proved to you that i am incapable or not trustworthy i would feel obliged to you sir if you would in the first place point it outand in the next bring me to a courtmartial if i do not correct it i am no courtmartial man sir replied he but i am not to be dictated to by an inferior officer so youll oblige me by holding your tongue the sergeant of marines as masteratarms is bound to report to me any deviation from the regulations i have laid down for the discipline of the ship granted sir but that report according to the custom of the service should come through the first lieutenant i prefer it coming direct sirit stands less chance of being garbled thank you captain hawkins for the compliment the captain walked away without further reply and shortly after went down below swinburne ranged up alongside of me as soon as the captain disappeared well mr simple so i hear we are bound to the baltic why couldnt they have ordered us to pick up the convoy off yarmouth instead of coming all the way to portsmouth we shall be in tomorrow with this slant of wind i suppose the convoy are not yet collected swinburne and you recollect theres no want of french privateers in the channel very true sir when were you up the baltic swinburne i was in the old st george a regular old ninetyeight she sailed just like a haystack one mile ahead and three to leeward lord bless you mr simple the cattegat wasnt wide enough for her but she was a comfortable sort of vessel after all excepting on a leeshore so we used always to give the land a wide berth i recollect by the bye mr simple do you recollect how angry you were because i didnt peach at barbadoes when the men sucked the monkey to be sure i do well then i didnt think it fair then as i was one of them but now that im a bit of an officer i just tell you that when we get to carlscrona theres a method of sucking the monkey there which as first lieutenant with such a queer sort of captain it is just as well that you should be up to in the old st george we had seventy men drunk one afternoon and the first lieutenant couldnt find it out nohow indeed swinburne you must let me into that secret so i will mr simple dont you know theres a famous stuff for cuts and wounds called balsam what riga balsam yes thats it well all the boats will bring that for sale as they did to us in the old st george devilish good stuff it is for wounds i believe but its not bad to drink and its very strong we used to take it inwardly mr simple and the first lieutenant never guessed it what you all got tipsy upon riga balsam all that could so i just give you a hint im much obliged to you swinburne i certainly never should have suspected it i believe seamen would get drunk upon anything the next morning we anchored at spithead and found the convoy ready for sea the captain went on shore to report himself to the admiral and as usual the brig was surrounded with bumboats and wherries with people who wished to come on board as we were not known on the portsmouth station and had no acquaintance with the people all the bumboats were very anxious to supply the ship and as this is at the option of the first lieutenant he is very much persecuted until he has made his decision certificates of good conduct from other officers were handed up the side from all of them and i looked over the books at the capstern in the second book the name struck me it was that of mrs trotter and i walked to the gangway out of curiosity to ascertain whether it was the same personage who when i was a youngster had taken such care of my shirts as i looked at the boats a voice cried out o mr simple have you forgot your old friend dont you recollect mrs trotter i certainly did not recollect her she had grown very fat and although more advanced in years was a betterlooking woman than when i had first seen her for she looked healthy and fresh indeed i hardly did recollect you mrs trotter ive so much to tell you mr simple replied she ordering the boat to pull alongside and as she was coming up desired the man to get the things in as if permission was quite unnecessary i did not counterorder it as i knew none of the others and as far as honesty was concerned believed them all to be much on a par on the strength then of old acquaintance mrs trotter was admitted well im sure mr simple cried mrs trotter out of breath with climbing up the brigs side what a man youve grownand such a handsome man too dear dear it makes me feel quite old to look at you when i call to mind the little boy whom i had charge of in the cockpit dont you think i look very old and ugly mr simple continued she smiling and smirking indeed mrs trotter i think you wear very well pray how is your husband ah mr simple poor dear mr trotterhes gone poor fellow no wonder what with his drinking and his love for meand his jealousydo you recollect how jealous he was mr simplehe wore himself out at last no wonder considering what he had been accustomed to after keeping his carriage and dogs with everybody to be reduced to see his wife go a bumming it broke his heart poor fellow and mr simple ive been much happier ever since for i could not bear to see him fretting lord how jealous he wasand all about nothing dont you want some fresh meat for the gunroom ive a nice leg of mutton in the boat and some milk for tea recollect mrs trotter i shall not overlook your bringing spirits on board lord mr simple how could you think of such a thing its very true that these common people do it but the company i have kept the society i have been in mr simple besides you must recollect that i never drank anything but water i could not exactly coincide with her but i did not contradict her would you like the portsmouth paper mr simple taking one out of her pocket i know gentlemen are fond of the news poor trotter used never to stir from the breakfast table until he had finished the daily paper but that was when we lived in very different style have you any clothes to wash mr simpleor have any of the gentlemen i fear we have no time we sail too soon replied i we go with the convoy indeed cried mrs trotter who walked to the main hatchway and called to her man bill i heard her give him directions to sell nothing upon trust in consequence of the intelligence of our immediate sailing i beg your pardon mr simple i was only desiring my head man to send for your steward that he might be supplied with the best and to save some milk for the gunroom and i must beg your pardon mrs trotter for i must attend to my duty mrs trotter made her courtesy and walked down the main ladder to attend to her duty and we separated i was informed that she had a great deal of custom as she understood how to manage the officers and made herself generally useful to them she had been a bumboat woman for six years and had made a great deal of money indeed it was reported that if a first lieutenant wanted forty or fifty pounds mrs trotter would always lend it to him without requiring his promissory note the captain came on board in the evening having dined with the admiral and left directions for having all ready for unmooring and heaving short at daylight the signal was made from the frigate at sunrise and before twelve oclock we were all under weigh and running past st helens with a favourable wind our force consisted of the acasta frigate the isis ship sloop mounting twenty guns the reindeer eighteen and our own brig the convoy amounted to nearly two hundred although the wind was fair and the water smooth we were more than a week before we made anholt light owing to the bad sailing and inattention of many of the vessels belonging to the convoy we were constantly employed repeating signals firing guns and often sent back to tow up the sternmost vessels at last we passed the anholt light with a light breeze and the next morning the main land was to be distinguished on both bows chapter lviii how we passed the sound and what passed in the sound the captain overhears again a conversation between swinburne and me i was on the signalchest abaft counting the convoy when swinburne came up to me theres a little difference between this part of the world and the west indies mr simple observed he black rocks and fir woods dont remind us of the blue mountains of jamaica or the cocoanut waving to the seabreeze indeed not swinburne replied i we shall have plenty of calms here without panting with the heat although we may find the gunboats a little too warm for us for depend upon it the very moment the wind goes down they will come out from every nook and corner and annoy us not a little have you been here before with a convoy swinburne to be sure i have and its sharp work that ive seen here mr simple work that ive an idea our captain wont have much stomach for swinburne i beg you will keep your thoughts relative to the captain to yourself recollect the last time it is my duty not to listen to them and i should rather think to report them also mr simple said captain hawkins who had crept up to us and overheard our conversation in this instance there is no occasion for my reporting them sir replied i for you have heard what has passed i have sir replied he and i shall not forget the conversation i turned forward swinburne had made his retreat the moment that he heard the voice of the captain how many sails are there in sight sir inquired the captain one hundred and sixtythree sir replied i signal for convoy to close from the acasta reported the midshipman of the watch we repeated it and the captain descended to his cabin we were then running about four miles an hour the water very smooth and anholt lighthouse hardly visible on deck bearing nnw about twenty miles in fact we were near the entrance of the sound which the reader may be aware is a narrow passage leading into the baltic sea we ran on followed by the convoy some of which were eight or ten miles astern of us and we were well into the sound when the wind gradually died away until it fell quite calm and the heads of the vessels were laid round the compass my watch was nearly out when the midshipman who was looking round with his glass on the copenhagen side reported three gunboats sweeping out from behind a point i examined them and went down to report them to the captain when i came on deck more were reported until we counted ten two of them large vessels called praams the captain now came on deck and i reported them we made the signal of enemy in sight to the acasta which was answered they dividedsix of them pulling along shore towards the convoy in the rear and four coming out right for the brig the acasta now made the signal for boats manned and armed to be held in readiness we hoisted out our pinnace and lowered down our cuttersthe other menofwar doing the same in about a quarter of an hour the gunboats opened their fire with their long thirtytwo pounders and their first shot went right through the hull of the brig just abaft the forebits fortunately no one was hurt i turned round to look at the captain he was as white as a sheet he caught my eye and turned aft when he was met by swinburnes eye steadily fixed upon him he then walked to the other side of the deck another shot ploughed up the water close to us rose and came through the hammocknetting tearing out two of the hammocks and throwing them on the quarterdeck when the acasta hoisted out pennants and made the signal to send our pinnace and cutter to the assistance of vessels astern the signal was also made to the isis and reindeer i reported the signal and inquired who was to take the command you mr simple will take the pinnace and order mr swinburne into the cutter mr swinburne sir replied i the brig will in all probability be in action soon and his services as a gunner will be required well then mr hilton may go beat to quarters where is mr webster the second lieutenant was close to us and he was ordered to take the duty during my absence i jumped into the pinnace and shoved off ten other boats from the acasta and the other menofwar were pulling in the same direction and i joined them the gunboats had now opened fire upon the convoy astern and were sweeping out to capture them dividing themselves into two parts and pulling towards different portions of the convoy in half an hour we were within gunshot of the nearest which directed its fire at us but the lieutenant of the acasta who commanded the detachment ordered us to lie on our oars for a minute while he divided his force in three divisions of four boats each with instructions that we should each oppose a division of two gunboats by pulling to the outermost vessel of the convoy and securing ourselves as much as possible from the fire by remaining under her lee and be in readiness to take them by boarding if they approached to capture any of our vessels this was well arranged i had the command of one division for the first lieutenants had not been sent away from the isis and reindeer and having inquired which of the divisions of gunboats i was to oppose i pulled for them in the meantime we observed that the two praams and two gunboats which had remained behind us and had been firing at the racehorse had also dividedone praam attacking the acasta the two gunboats playing upon the isis and the other praam engaging the rattlesnake and reindeer the latter vessel being in a line with us and about half a mile further out so that she could not return any effectual fire or indeed receive much damage the rattlesnake had the worst of it the fire of the praam being chiefly directed to her at the distance chosen by the enemy the frigates guns reached but the other menofwar having only two long guns were not able to return the fire but with their two the carronades being useless one of the praams mounted ten guns and the other eight the last was opposed to the rattlesnake and the fire was kept up very smartly particularly by the acasta and the enemy in about a quarter of an hour i arrived with my division close to the vessel which was nearest to the enemy it was a large sunderlandbuilt ship the gunboats which were within a quarter of a mile of her sweeping to her as fast as they could as soon as they perceived our approach directed their fire upon us but without success except the last discharge in which we being near enough they had loaded with grape the shot fell a little short but one piece of grape struck one of the bowmen of the pinnace taking off three fingers of his right hand as he was pulling his oar before they could fire again we were sheltered by the vessel pulling close to her side hid from the enemy my boat was the only one in the division which carried a gun and i now loaded waiting for the discharge of the gunboats and then pulling a little ahead of the ship fired at them and then returned under cover to load this continued for some time the enemy not advancing nearer but now firing into the sunderland ship which protected us at last the master of the ship looked over the side and said to me i say my joker do you call this giving me assistance i think i was better off before you came then i had only my share of the enemys fire but now that you have come i have it all im riddled like a sieve and have lost four men already suppose you give me a spell nowpull behind the vessel ahead of us ill take my chance i thought this request very reasonable and as i should be really nearer to the enemy if i pulled to the next vessel and all ready to support him if attacked i complied with his wish i had positive orders not to board with so small a force the four boats containing but forty men and each gunboat having at least seventy unless they advanced to capture and then i was to run all risks i pulled up to the other vessel a large brig and the captain as soon as we came alongside said i see what youre about and ill just leave you my vessel to take care of no use losing my men or being knocked on the head alls rightyou cant do better and we cant do better either his boat was lowered down and getting in with his men he pulled to another vessel and lay behind it all ready to pull back if a breeze sprang up as was to be expected the gunboats shifted their fire to the deserted vessel which our boat lay behind and thus did the action in our quarter continue until it was dark the gunboats not choosing to advance and we restricted from pulling out to attack them there was no moon and as daylight disappeared the effect was very beautiful in the distance the cannonading of the frigate and other menofwar answered by the praams and gunboats reinforced by six more as we afterwards found outthe vivid flashing of the guns reflected by the water as smooth as glassthe dark outlines of the numerous convoy with their sails hanging down the masts one portion of the convoy appearing for a moment as the guns were discharged in that direction and then disappearing while others were momentarily seenthe roar of the heavy guns opposed to usthe crashing of the timbers of the brig which was struck at every discharge and very often perforatedwith the whizzing of the shot as it passed byall this in a dark yet clear night with every star in the heavens twinkling and as it were looking down upon us was interesting as well as awful but i soon perceived that the gunboats were nearing us every time that they fired and i now discharged grape alone waiting for the flash of the fire to ascertain their direction at last i could perceive their long low hulls not two cables length from us and their sweeps lifting from the water it was plain that they were advancing to board and i resolved to anticipate them if possible i had fired ahead of the brig and i now pulled with all my boats astern giving my orders to the officers and laying on our oars in readiness the gunboats were about half a cables length from each other pulling up abreast and passing us at about the same distance when i directed the men to give way i had determined to throw all my force upon the nearest boat and in half a minute our bows were forced between their sweeps which we caught hold of to force our way alongside the resistance of the danes was very determined three times did i obtain a footing on the deck and three times was i thrown back into the boats at last we had fairly obtained our ground and were driving them gradually forward when as i ran on the gunwale to obtain a position more in advance of my men i received a blow with the butt end of a musketi believe on the shoulderwhich knocked me overboard and i fell between the sweeps and sunk under the vessels bottom i rose under her stern but i was so shook with the violence of the blow that i was for some time confused still i had strength to keep myself above water and paddled as it appeared away from the vessel until i hit against a sweep which had fallen overboard this supported me and i gradually recovered myself the loud report of a gun close to me startled me and i perceived that it was from the gunboat which i had boarded and that her head was turned in the direction of the other gunboat from this with the noise of the sweeps pulling i knew that my men had succeeded in capturing her i hallooed but they did not hear me and i soon lost sight of her another gun was now fired it was from the other gunboat retreating and i perceived her pulling inshore for she passed me not twenty yards off i now held the sweep with my hands and struck out off the shore in the direction of the convoy a light breeze rippled the water and i knew that i had no time to lose in about five minutes i heard the sound of oars and perceived a boat crossing me i hailed as loud as i couldthey heard me laid on their oarsand i hailed againthey pulled to me and took me in it was the master of the brig who aware of the capture of one gunboat and the retreat of the other was looking for his vessel or as he told me for what was left of her in a short time we found her and although very much cut up she had received no shot under water in an hour the breeze was strong the cannonading had ceased in every direction and we had repaired her damages so as to be able to make sail and continue our course through the sound here i may as well relate the events of the action one of the other divisions of gunboats had retreated when attacked by the boats the other had beaten off the boats and killed many of the men but had suffered so much themselves as to retreat without making any capture the acasta lost four men killed and seven wounded the isis three men wounded the reindeer had nobody hurt the rattlesnake had six men killed and two wounded including the captain but of that i shall speak hereafter i found that i was by no means seriously hurt by the blow i had received my shoulder was stiff for a week and very much discoloured but nothing more when i fell overboard i had struck against a sweep which had cut my ear half off the captain of the brig gave me dry clothes and in a few hours i was very comfortably asleep hoping to join my ship the next day but in this i was disappointed the breeze was favourable and fresh and we were clear of the sound but a long way astern of the convoy and none of the headmost menofwar to be seen i dressed and went on deck and immediately perceived that i had little chance of joining my ship until we arrived at carlscrona which proved to be the case about ten oclock the wind died away and we had from that time such baffling light winds that it was six days before we dropped our anchor every vessel of the convoy having arrived before us footnote webster however had left the ship at yarmouth see p ed chapter lix the dead man attends at the auction of his own effects and bids the sale to stopone more than was wantedpeter steps into his shoes againcaptain hawkins takes a friendly interest in peters papers riga balsam sternly refused to be admitted for the relief of the ships company as soon as the sails were furled i thanked the master of the vessel for his kindness and requested the boat he ordered it to be manned saying how glad your captain will be to see you i doubted that we shook hands and i pulled to the rattlesnake which lay about two cables length astern of us i had put on a jacket when i left the brig on service and coming in a merchantmans boat no attention was paid to me indeed owing to circumstances no one was on the lookout and i ascended the side unperceived the men and officers were on the quarterdeck attending the sale of dead mens effects before the mast and every eye was fixed upon six pair of nankeen trousers exposed by the pursers steward which i recognized as my own nine shillings for six pair of nankeen trousers cried the pursers steward come my men theyre worth more than that observed the captain who appeared to be very facetious its better to be in his trousers than in his shoes this brutal remark created a silence for a moment well then steward let them go one would think that pulling on his trousers would make you as afraid as he was continued the captain laughing shame was cried out by one or two of the officers and i recognised swinburnes voice as one more likely if they put on yours cried i in a loud indignant tone everybody started and turned round captain hawkins staggered to a carronade i beg to report myself as having rejoined my ship sir continued i hurrah my lads three cheers for mr simple said swinburne the men gave them with emphasis the captain looked at me and without saying a word hastily retreated to his cabin i perceived as he went down that he had his arm in a sling i thanked the men for their kind feeling towards me shook hands with thompson and webster who warmly congratulated me and then with old swinburne who nearly wrung my arm off and gave my shoulder such pain as to make me cry out and with the others who extended theirs i desired the sale of my effects to be stopped fortunately for me it had but just begun and the articles were all returned thompson had informed the captain that he knew my fathers address and would take charge of my clothes and send them home but the captain would not allow him in a few minutes i received a letter from the captain desiring me to acquaint him in writing for the information of the senior officer in what manner i had escaped i went down below when i found one very melancholy face that of the passed midshipman of the acasta who had received an acting order in my place when i went to my desk i found two important articles missing one my private letterbook and the other the journal which i kept of what passed and from which this narrative has been compiled i inquired of my messmates who stated that the desk had not been looked into by any one but the captain who of course must have possessed himself of those important documents i wrote a letter containing a short narrative of what had happened and at the same time another on service to the captain requesting that he would deliver up my property the private journal and letterbook in his possession the captain as soon as he received my letters sent up word for his boat to be manned as soon as it was manned i reported it and then begged to know whether he intended to comply with my request he answered that he should not and then went on deck and quitted the brig to pull on board of the senior officer i therefore determined immediately to write to the captain of the acasta acquainting him with the conduct of captain hawkins and requesting his interference this i did immediately and the boat that had brought me on board not having left the brig i sent the letter by it requesting them to put it into the hands of one of the officers the letter was received previous to captain hawkins visit being over and the captain of the acasta put it into his hands inquiring if the statement were correct captain hawkins replied that it was true that he had detained these papers as there was so much mutiny and disaffection in them and that he should not return them to me that i cannot permit replied the captain of the acasta who was aware of the character of captain hawkins if by mistake you have been put in possession of any of mr simples secrets you are bound in honour not to make use of them neither can you retain property not your own but captain hawkins was determined and refused to give them to me well then captain hawkins replied the captain of the acasta you will oblige me by remaining on my quarterdeck till i come out of the cabin the captain of the acasta then wrote an order directing captain hawkins immediately to deliver up to him the papers of mine in his possession and coming out of the cabin put it into captain hawkins hands saying now sir here is a written order from your superior officer disobey it if you dare if you do i will put you under arrest and try you by a courtmartial i can only regret that any captain in his majestys service should be forced in this way to do his duty as a gentleman and a man of honour captain hawkins bit his lip at the order and the cutting remarks accompanying it your boat is manned sir said the captain of the acasta in a severe tone captain hawkins came on board sealed up the books and sent them to the captain of the acasta who redirected them to me on his majestys service and returned them by the same boat the public may therefore thank the captain of the acasta for the memoirs which they are now reading from my messmates i gained the following intelligence of what had passed after i had quitted the brig the fire of the praam had cut them up severely and captain hawkins had been struck in the arm with a piece of the hammockrail which had been shot away shortly after i left although the skin only was razed he thought proper to consider himself badly wounded and giving up the command to mr webster the second lieutenant had retreated below where he remained until the action was over when mr webster reported the return of the boats with the capture of the gunboat and my supposed death he was so delighted that he quite forgot his wound and ran on deck rubbing his hands as he walked up and down at last he recollected himself went down into his cabin and came up again with his arm in a sling the next morning he went on board of the acasta and made his report to the senior officer bringing back with him the disappointed passedmidshipman as my successor he had also stated on the quarterdeck that if i had not been killed he intended to have tried me by a courtmartial and have turned me out of the service that he had quite enough charges to ruin me for he had been collecting them ever since i had been under his command and that now he would make that old scoundrel of a gunner repent his intimacy with me all this was confided to the surgeon who as i before observed was very much of a courtier but the surgeon had repeated it to thompson the master who now gave me the information there was one advantage in all this which was that i knew exactly the position in which i stood and what i had to expect during the short time that we remained in port i took care that riga balsam should not be allowed to come alongside and the men were all sober we received orders from the captain of the acasta to join the admiral who was off the texel in pursuance of directions he had received from the admiralty to despatch one of the squadron and we were selected from the dislike which he had taken to captain hawkins chapter lx an old friend in a new caseheart of oak in swedish fura mans a man all the world over and something more in many parts of itpeter gets reprimanded for being dilatory but proves a title to a defence allowed when we were about forty miles off the harbour a frigate hove in sight we made the private signal she hoisted swedish colours and kept away a couple of points to close with us we were within two miles of her when she up courses and took in her topgallant sails as we closed to within two cables lengths she hoveto we did the same and the captain desired me to lower down the boat and board her ask her name by whom she was commanded and offer any assistance if the captain required it this was the usual custom of the service and i went on board in obedience to my orders when i arrived on the quarterdeck i asked in french whether there was any one who spoke it the first lieutenant came forward and took off his hat i stated that i was requested to ask the name of the vessel and the commanding officer to insert it in our log and to offer any service that we could command he replied that the captain was on deck and turned round but the captain had gone down below i will inform him of your messagei had no idea that he had quitted the deck and the first lieutenant left me i exchanged a few compliments and a little news with the officers on deck who appeared to be very gentlemanlike fellows when the first lieutenant requested my presence in the cabin i descendedthe door was openedi was announced by the first lieutenant and he quitted the cabin i looked at the captain who was sitting at the table he was a fine stout man with two or three ribands at his buttonhole and a large pair of moustachios i thought that i had seen him before but i could not recollect when his face was certainly familiar to me but as i had been informed by the officers on deck that the captain was a count shucksen a person i had never heard of i thought that i must be mistaken i therefore addressed him in french paying him a long compliment with all the necessary et ceteras the captain turned round to me took his hand away from his forehead which it had shaded and looking me full in the face replied mr simple i dont understand but very little french spin your yarn in plain english i startedi thought that i knew your face replied i am i mistakenno it must bemr chucks you are right my dear mr simple it is your old friend chucks the boatswain whom you now see i knew you as soon as you came up the side and i was afraid that you would immediately recognize me and i slipped down into the cabin for which apparent rudeness allow me to apologise that you might not explain before the officers we shook hands heartily and then he requested me to sit down but said i they told me on deck that the frigate was commanded by a count shucksen that is my present rank my dear peter said he but as you have no time to lose i will explain all i know i can trust to your honour you remember that you left me as you and i supposed dying in the privateer with the captains jacket and epaulettes on my shoulders when the boats came out and you left the vessel they boarded and found me i was still breathing and judging of my rank by the coat they put me into the boat and pushed on shore the privateer sank very shortly after i was not expected to live but in a few days a change took place and i was better they asked me my name and i gave my own which they lengthened into shucksen somehow or another i recovered by a miracle and am now as well as ever i was in my life they were not a little proud of having captured a captain in the british service as they supposed for they never questioned me as to my real rank after some weeks i was sent home to denmark in a running vessel but it so happened that we met with a gale and were wrecked on the swedish coast close to carlscrona the danes were at that time at war having joined the russians and they were made prisoners while i was of course liberated and treated with great distinction but as i could not speak either french or their own language i could not get on very well however i had a handsome allowance and permission to go to england as soon as i pleased the swedes were then at war with the russians and were fitting out their fleet but lord bless them they didnt know much about it i amused myself walking in the dockyard and looking at their motions but they had not thirty men in the fleet who knew what they were about and as for a man to set them going there wasnt one well peter you know i could not be idle and so by degrees i told one and then told anotheruntil they went the right way to work and the captains and officers were very much obliged to me at last they all came to me and if they did not understand me entirely i showed them how to do it with my own hands and the fleet began to make a show with their rigging the admiral who commanded was very much obliged and i seemed to come as regularly to my work as if i was paid for it at last the admiral came with an english interpreter and asked me whether i was anxious to go back to england or would i like to join their service i saw what they wanted and i replied that i had neither wife nor child in england and that i liked their country very much but i must take time to consider of it and must also know what they had to propose i went home to my lodgings and to make them more anxious i did not make my appearance at the dockyard for three or four days when a letter came from the admiral offering me the command of a frigate if i would join their service i replied for i knew how much they wanted me that i would prefer an english frigate to a swedish one and that i would not consent unless they offered something more and then with the express stipulation that i should not take arms against my own country they then waited for a week when they offered to make me a count and give me the command of a frigate this suited me as you may suppose peter it was the darling wish of my hearti was to be made a gentleman i consented and was made count shucksen and had a fine large frigate under my command i then set to work with a will superintended the fitting out of the whole fleet and showed them what an englishman could do we sailed and you of course know the brush we had with the russians which i must say did us no discredit i was fortunate to distinguish myself for i exchanged several broadsides with a russian twodeck ship and came off with honour when we went into port i got this riband i was out afterwards and fell in with a russian frigate and captured her for which i received this other riband since that i have been in high favour and now that i speak the languages i like the people very much i am often at court when i am in harbour and peter i am married i wish you joy count with all my heart yes and well married tooto a swedish countess of very high family and i expect that i have a little boy or girl by this time so you observe peter that i am at last a gentleman and what is more my children will be noble by two descents who would have thought that this would have been occasioned by my throwing the captains jacket into the boat instead of my own and now my dear mr simple that i have made you my confidant i need not say do not say a word about it to anybody they certainly could not do me much harm but still they might do me some and although i am not likely to meet any one who may recognize me in this uniform and these moustachios its just as well to keep the secret which to you and obrien only would i have confided my dear count replied i your secret is safe with me you have come to your title before me at all events and i sincerely wish you joy for you have obtained it honourably but although i would like to talk with you for days i must return on board for i am now sailing with a very unpleasant captain i then in a few words stated where obrien was and when we parted i went with him on deck count shucksen taking my arm and introducing me as an old shipmate to his officers i hope we may meet again said i but i am afraid there is little chance who knows replied he see what chance has done for me my dear peter god bless you you are one of the very few whom i always loved god bless you my boy and never forget that all i have is at your command if you come my way i thanked him and saluting the officers went down the side as i expected when i came on board the captain demanded in an angry tone why i had stayed so long i replied that i was shown down into count shucksens cabin and he conversed so long that i could not get away sooner as it would not have been polite to have left him before he had finished his questions i then gave a very civil message and the captain said no more the very name of a great man always silenced him chapter lxi bad news from home and worse on boardnotwithstanding his previous trials peter forced to prepare for anothermrs trotter again improves as she grows oldcaptain hawkins and his twelve charges no other event of consequence occurred until we joined the admiral who only detained us three hours with the fleet and then sent us home with his despatches we arrived after a quiet passage at portsmouth where i wrote immediately to my sister ellen requesting to know the state of my fathers health i waited impatiently for an answer and by return of post received one with a black seal my father had died the day before from a brain fever and ellen conjured me to obtain leave of absence to come to her in her state of distress the captain came on board the next morning and i had a letter ready written on service to the admiral stating the circumstances and requesting leave of absence i presented it to him and entreated him to forward it at any other time i would not have condescended but the thoughts of my poor sister unprotected and alone with my father lying dead in the house made me humble and submissive captain hawkins read the letter and very coolly replied that it was very easy to say that my father was dead but he required proofs even this insult did not affect me i put my sisters letter into his handhe read it and as he returned it to me he smiled maliciously it is impossible for me to forward your letter mr simple as i have one to deliver to you he put a large folio packet into my hand and went below i opened it it was a copy of a letter demanding a courtmartial upon me with a long list of the charges preferred by him i was stupefied not so much at his asking for a courtmartial but at the conviction of the impossibility of my now being able to go to the assistance of my poor sister i went down into the gunroom and threw myself on a chair at the same time tossing the letter to thompson the master he read it over carefully and folded it up upon my word simple i do not see that you have much to fear these charges are very frivolous no nothat i care little about but it is my poor sister i had written for leave of absence and now she is left god knows how long in such distressing circumstances thompson looked grave i had forgotten your fathers death simple it is indeed cruel i would offer to go myself but you will want my evidence at the courtmartial it cant be helped write to your sister and keep up her spirits tell her why you cannot come and that it will all end well i did so and went early to bed for i was really ill the next morning the official letter from the portadmiral came off acquainting me that a courtmartial had been ordered upon me and that it would take place that day week i immediately resigned the command to the second lieutenant and commenced an examination into the charges preferred they were very numerous and dated back almost to the very day that he had joined the ship there were twelve in all i shall not trouble the reader with the whole of them as many were very frivolous the principal charges were for mutinous and disrespectful conduct to captain hawkins on such a date having in a conversation with an inferior officer on the quarterdeck stated that captain hawkins was a spy and had spies in the ship for neglect of duty in disobeying the orders of captain hawkins on the night of the of for having on the of sent away two boats from the ship in direct opposition to the orders of captain hawkins for having again on the morning of the of held mutinous and disrespectful conversation relative to captain hawkins with the gunner of the ship allowing the latter to accuse captain hawkins of cowardice without reporting the same for insulting expressions on the quarterdeck to captain hawkins on his rejoining the brig on the morning of the of for not causing the orders of captain hawkins to be put in force on several occasions c c c and further as captain hawkins testimony was necessary in two of the charges the king on those charges was the prosecutor although most of these charges were frivolous yet i at once perceived my danger some were dated back many months to the time before our ships company had been changed and i could not find the necessary witnesses indeed in all but the recent charges not expecting to be called to a courtmartial i had serious difficulties to contend with but the most serious was the first charge which i knew not how to get over swinburne had most decidedly referred to the captain when he talked of spy captains however with the assistance of thompson i made the best defence i could ready for my trial two days before my courtmartial i received a letter from ellen who appeared in a state of distraction from this accumulation of misfortune she told me that my father was to be buried the next day and that the new rector had written to her to know when it would be convenient for the vicarage to be given up that my fathers bills had been sent in and amounted to twelve hundred pounds already and that she knew not the extent of the whole claims there appeared to be nothing left but the furniture of the house and she wanted to know whether the debts were to be paid with the money i had left in the funds for her use i wrote immediately requesting her to liquidate every claim as far as my money went sending her an order upon my agent to draw for the whole amount and a power of attorney to him to sell out the stock i had just sealed the letter when mrs trotter who had attended the ship since our return to portsmouth begged to speak with me and walked in after her message without waiting for an answer my dear mr simple said she i know all that is going on and i find that you have no lawyer to assist you now i know that it is necessary and will very probably be of great service in your defencefor when people are in distress and anxiety they have not their wits about them so i have brought a friend of mine from portsea a very clever man who for my sake will undertake your cause and i hope you will not refuse him you recollect giving me a dozen pair of stockings i did not refuse them nor shall you refuse me now i always said to mr trotter go to a lawyer and if he had taken my advice he would have done well i recollect when a hackneycoachman smashed the panel of our carriage trotter says i go to a lawyer and he very politely answered go to the devil but what was the consequencehes dead and im bumming now mr simple will you oblige meits all free gratis for nothingnot for nothing for its for my sake you see mr simple i have admirers yet concluded she smiling mrs trotters advice was good and although i would not listen to receiving his services gratuitously i agreed to employ him and very useful did he prove against such charges and such a man as captain hawkins he came on board that afternoon carefully examined into all the documents and the witnesses whom i could bring forward showed me the weak side of my defence and took the papers on shore with him every day he came on board to collect fresh evidence and examine into my case at last the day arrived i dressed myself in my best uniform the gun fired from the admirals ship with the signal for a courtmartial at nine oclock and i went on board in a boat with all the witnesses on my arrival i was put under the custody of the provostmarshal the captains ordered to attend pulled alongside one after another and were received by a party of marines presenting their arms at halfpast nine the court was all assembled and i was ushered in courtsmartial are open courts although no one is permitted to print the evidence at the head of the long table was the admiral as president on his right hand standing was captain hawkins as prosecutor on each side of the table were six captains sitting near to the admiral according to their seniority at the bottom facing the admiral was the judgeadvocate on whose left hand i stood as prisoner the witnesses called in to be examined were stationed on his right and behind him by the indulgence of the court was a small table at which sat my legal adviser so close as to be able to communicate with me the court were all sworn and then took their seats stauncheons with ropes covered with green baize passed along were behind the chairs of the captains who composed the court so that they might not be crowded upon by those who came in to listen to what passed the charges were then read as well as the letters to and from the admiral by which the courtmartial was demanded and granted and then captain hawkins was desired to open his prosecution he commenced with observing his great regret that he had been forced to a measure so repugnant to his feelings his frequent cautions to me and the indifference with which i treated them and after a preamble composed of every falsity that could be devised he commenced with the first charge and stating himself to be the witness gave his evidence when it was finished i was asked if i had any questions to put by the advice of my lawyer i replied no the president then asked the captains composing the courtmartial commencing according to their seniority whether they wished to ask any questions i wish said the second captain who was addressed to ask captain hawkins whether when he came on deck he came up in the usual way in which a captain of a manofwar comes on his quarterdeck or whether he slipped up without noise captain hawkins declared that he came up as he usually did this was true enough for he invariably came up by stealth pray captain hawkins as you have repeated a good deal of conversation which passed between the first lieutenant and the gunner may i ask you how long you were by their side without their perceiving you a very short time was the answer but captain hawkins do you not think allowing that you came up on deck in your usual way as you term it that you would have done better to have hemmed or hawed so as to let your officers know that you were present i should be very sorry to hear all that might be said of me in my supposed absence to this observation captain hawkins replied that he was so astonished at the conversation that he was quite breathless having till then had the highest opinion of me no more questions were asked and they proceeded to the second charge this was a very trifling onefor lighting a stove contrary to orders the evidence brought forward was the sergeant of marines when his evidence in favour of the charge had been given i was asked by the president if i had any questions to put to the witness i put the following did you repeat to captain hawkins that i had ordered the stove to be lightedi did are you not in the custom of reporting direct to the captain any negligence or disobedience of orders you may witness in the shipi am did you ever report anything of the sort to me as first lieutenant or do you always report direct to the captain i always report direct to the captain by the captains ordersyes the following questions were then put by some of the members of the court you have served in other ships beforeyes did you ever sailing with other captains receive an order from them to report direct to them and not through the first lieutenant the witness here prevaricated answer directly yes or nono the third charge was then brought forwardfor sending away boats contrary to express orders this was substantiated by captain hawkins own evidence the order having been verbal by the advice of my counsel i put no questions to captain hawkins neither did the court the fourth chargethat of holding mutinous conversation with the gunner and allowing him to accuse the captain of unwillingness to engage the enemywas then again substantiated by captain hawkins as the only witness i again left my reply for my defence and only one question was put by one of the members which was to inquire of captain hawkins as he appeared peculiarly unfortunate in overhearing conversations whether he walked up as usual to the taffrail or whether he crept up captain hawkins gave the same answer as before the fifth chargefor insulting expressions to captain hawkins on my rejoining the brig at carlscronawas then brought forward and the sergeant of marines and one of the seamen appeared as witnesses this charge excited a great deal of amusement in the crossexamination by the members of the court captain hawkins was asked what he meant by the expression when disposing of the clothes of an officer who was killed in action that the men appeared to think that his trousers would instil fear nothing more upon my honour sir replied captain hawkins than an implication that they were alarmed lest they should be haunted by his ghost then of course mr simple meant the same in his reply observed the captain sarcastically the remainder of the charges were then brought forward but they were of little consequence the witnesses were chiefly the sergeant of marines and the spyglass of captain hawkins who had been watching me from the shore it was late in the afternoon before they were all gone through and the president then adjourned the court that i might bring forward my own witnesses in my defence on the following day and i returned on board the rattlesnake chapter lxii a good defence not always good against a bad accusationpeter wins the heart of his judges yet loses his cause and is dismissed his ship the next day i commenced my defence and i preferred calling my own witnesses first and by the advice of my counsel and at the request of swinburne i called him i put the following questionswhen we were talking on the quarterdeck was it fine weatheryes it was do you think that you might have heard any one coming on deck in the usual way up the companion ladder sure of it do you mean then to imply that captain hawkins came up stealthily i have an idea he pounced upon us as a cat does on a mouse what were the expressions made use of i said that a spy captain would always find spy followers in that remark were you and mr simple referring to your own captain the remark was mine what mr simple was thinking of i cant tell but i did refer to the captain and he has proved that i was right this bold answer of swinburnes rather astonished the court who commenced crossquestioning him but he kept to his original assertionthat i had only answered generally to repel the second charge i produced no witnesses but to the third charge i brought forward three witnesses to prove that captain hawkinss orders were that i should send no boats on shore not that i should not send them on board of the menofwar close to us in answer to the fourth charge i called swinburne who stated that if i did not he would come forward swinburne acknowledged that he accused the captain of being shy and that i reprimanded him for so doing did he say that he would report you inquired one of the captains no sir replied swinburne cause he never meant to do it this was an unfortunate answer to the fifth charge i brought several witnesses to prove the words of captain hawkins and the sense in which they were taken by the ships company and the men calling out shame when he used the expression to refute the other charges i called one or two witnesses and the court then adjourned inquiring of me when i would be ready to commence my defence i requested a day to prepare which was readily granted and the ensuing day the court did not sit i hardly need say that i was busily employed arranging my defence with my counsel at last all was done and i went to bed tired and unhappy but i slept soundly which could not be said of my counsel for he went on shore at eleven oclock and sat up all night making a fair copy after all the fairest court of justice is a naval courtmartialno browbeating of witnesses an evident inclination towards the prisonerevery allowance and every favour granted him and no legal quibbles attended to it is a court of equity with very few exceptions and the humbler the individual the greater the chance in his favour i was awoke the following morning by my counsel who had not gone to bed the previous night and who had come off at seven oclock to read over with me my defence at nine oclock i again proceeded on board and in a short time the court was sitting i came in handed my defence to the judgeadvocate who read it aloud to the court i have a copy still by me and will give the whole of it to the reader mr president and gentlemenafter nearly fourteen years service in his majestys navy during which i have been twice made prisoner twice wounded and once wrecked and as i trust i shall prove to you by certificates and the public despatches i have done my duty with zeal and honour i now find myself in a situation in which i never expected to be placedthat of being arraigned before and brought to a courtmartial for charges of mutiny disaffection and disrespect towards my superior officer if the honourable court will examine the certificates i am about to produce they will find that until i sailed with captain hawkins my conduct has always been supposed to have been diametrically opposite to that which is now imputed to me i have always been diligent and obedient to command and i have only to regret that the captains with whom i have had the honour to sail are not now present to corroborate by their oral evidence the truth of these documents allow me in the first place to point out to the court that the charges against me are spread over a large space of time amounting to nearly eighteen months during the whole of which period captain hawkins never stated to me that it was his intention to try me by a courtmartial and although repeatedly in the presence of a senior officer has never preferred any charge against me the articles of war state expressly that if any officer soldier or marine has any complaint to make he is to do so upon his arrival at any port or fleet where he may fall in with a superior officer i admit that this article of war refers to complaints to be made by inferiors against superiors but at the same time i venture to submit to the honourable court that a superior is equally bound to prefer a charge or to give notice that the charge will be preferred on the first seasonable opportunity instead of lulling the offender into security and disarming him in his defence by allowing the time to run on so long as to render him incapable of bringing forward his witnesses i take the liberty of calling this to your attention and shall now proceed to answer the charges which have been brought against me i am accused of having held a conversation with an inferior officer on the quarterdeck of his majestys brig rattlesnake in which my captain was treated with contempt that it may not be supposed that mr swinburne was a new acquaintance made upon my joining the brig i must observe that he was an old shipmate with whom i had served many years and with whose worth i was well acquainted he was my instructor in my more youthful days and has been rewarded for his merit with the warrant which he now holds as gunner of his majestys brig rattlesnake the offensive observation in the first place was not mine and in the second it was couched in general terms here mr swinburne has pointedly confessed that he did refer to the captain although the observation was in the plural but that does not prove the charge against meon the contrary adds weight to the assertion of mr swinburne that i was guiltless of the present charge that captain hawkins has acted as a spy his own evidence on this charge as well as that brought forward by other witnesses will decidedly prove but as the truth of the observation does not warrant the utterance i am glad that no such expression escaped my lips upon the second charge i shall dwell but a short time it is true that there is a general order that no stoves shall be alight after a certain hour but i will appeal to the honourable court whether a first lieutenant is not considered to have a degree of licence of judgment in all that concerns the interior discipline of the ship the surgeon sent to say that a stove was required for one of the sick i was in bed at the time and replied immediately in the affirmative does captain hawkins mean to assert to the honourable court that he would have refused the request of the surgeon most certainly not the only error i committed if it were an error was not going through the form of awaking captain hawkins to ask the permission which as first lieutenant i thought myself authorized to give the charge against me of having sent away two boats contrary to his order i have already disproved by witnesses the order of captain hawkins was not to communicate with the shore my reasons for sending away the boatshere captain hawkins interposed and stated to the president that my reasons were not necessary to be received the court was cleared and on our return the court had decided that my reasons ought to be given and i continued my reasons for sending away these boats or rather it was one boat which was despatched to the two frigates if i remember well were that the brig was in a state of mutiny the captain had tied up one of the men and the ships company refused to be flogged captain hawkins then went on shore to the admiral to report the situation of his ship and i conceived it my duty to make it known to the menofwar anchored close to us i shall not enter into further particulars as they will only detain the honourable court and i am aware that this courtmartial is held upon my conduct and not upon that of captain hawkins to the charge of again holding disrespectful language on the quarterdeck as overheard by captain hawkins i must refer the honourable court to the evidence in which it is plainly proved that the remarks upon him were not mine but those of mr swinburne and that i remonstrated with mr swinburne for using such unguarded expressions the only point of difficulty is whether it was not my duty to have reported such language i reply that there is no proof that i did not intend to report it but the presence of captain hawkins who heard what was said rendered such report unnecessary on the fifth charge i must beg that the court will be pleased to consider that some allowance ought to be made for a moment of irritation my character was traduced by captain hawkins supposing that i was dead so much so that even the ships company cried out shame i am aware that no language of a superior officer can warrant a retort from an inferior but as what i intended to imply by that language is not yet known although captain hawkins has given an explanation to his i shall merely say that i meant no more by my insinuations than captain hawkins did at the time by those which he made use of with respect to me upon the other trifling charges brought forward i lay no stress as i consider them fully refuted by the evidence which has been already adduced and i shall merely observe that for reasons best known to himself i have been met with a most decided hostility on the part of captain hawkins from the time that he first joined the ship that on every occasion he has used all his efforts to render me uncomfortable and embroil me with others that not content with narrowly watching my conduct on board he has resorted to his spyglass from the shore and instead of assisting me in the execution of a duty sufficiently arduous he has thrown every obstacle in my way placed inferior officers as spies over my conduct and made me feel so humiliated in the presence of the ships company over which i have had to superintend and in the disciplining of which i had a right to look to him for support that were it not that some odium would necessarily be attached to the sentence i should feel it as one of the happiest events of my life that i were dismissed from the situation which i now hold under his command i now beg that the honourable court will allow the documents i lay upon the table to be read in support of my character when this was over the court was cleared that they might decide upon the sentence i waited about half an hour in the greatest anxiety when i was again summoned to attend the usual forms of reading the papers were gone through and then came the sentence which was read by the president he and the whole court standing up with their cocked hats on their heads after the preamble it concluded with saying that it was the opinion of that court that the charges had been partly proved and therefore that lieutenant peter simple was dismissed his ship but in consideration of his good character and services his case was strongly recommended to the consideration of the lords commissioners of the admiralty chapter lxiii peter looks upon his loss as something gainedgoes on board the rattlesnake to pack up and is ordered to pack offpolite leavetaking between relations mrs trotter better and bettergoes to london and afterwards falls into all manner of misfortunes by the hands of robbers and of his own uncle i hardly knew whether i felt glad or sorry at this sentence on the one hand it was almost a deathblow to my future advancement or employment in the service on the other the recommendation very much softened down the sentence and i was quite happy to be quit of captain hawkins and free to hasten to my poor sister i bowed respectfully to the court which immediately adjourned captain hawkins followed the captains on the quarterdeck but none of them would speak to himso much to his disadvantage had come out during the trial about ten minutes afterwards one of the elder captains composing the court called me into the cabin mr simple said he we are all very sorry for you our sentence could not be more lenient under the circumstances it was that conversation with the gunner at the taffrail which floored you it must be a warning to you to be more careful in future how you permit any one to speak of the conduct of your superiors on the quarterdeck i am desired by the president to let you know that it is our intention to express ourselves very strongly to the admiral in your behalf so much so that if another captain applies for you you will have no difficulty in being appointed to a ship and as for leaving your present ship under any other circumstances i should consider it a matter of congratulation i returned my sincere thanks and soon afterwards quitted the guardship and went on board of the brig to pack up my clothes and take leave of my messmates on my arrival i found that captain hawkins had preceded me and he was on deck when i came up the side i hastened down into the gunroom where i received the condolements of my messmates simple i wish you joy cried thompson loud enough for the captain to hear on deck i wish i had your luck i wish somebody would try me by a courtmartial as it has turned out replied i in a loud voice and after the communication made to me by the captains composing the court of what they intend to say to the admiralty i agree with you thompson that it is a very kind act on the part of captain hawkins and i feel quite grateful to them steward comeglasses cried thompson and let us drink success to mr simple all this was very annoying to captain hawkins who overheard every word when our glasses were filledsimple your good health and may i meet with as good a messmate said thompson at this moment the sergeant of marines put his head in at the gunroom door and said in a most insolent tone that i was to leave the ship immediately i was so irritated that i threw my glass of grog in his face and he ran up to the captain to make the complaint but i did not belong to the ship and even if i had i would have resented such impertinence captain hawkins was in a great rage and i believe would have written for another courtmartial but he had had enough of them he inquired very particularly of the sergeant whether he had told me that i was to leave the ship directly or whether that captain hawkins desired that i should leave the ship immediately and finding that he had not given the latter message which i was aware of for had he given it i dare not have acted as i did he then sent down again by one of the midshipmen desiring me to leave the ship immediately my reply was that i should certainly obey his orders with the greatest pleasure i hastened to pack up my clothes reported myself ready to the second lieutenant who went up for permission to man a boat which was refused by captain hawkins who said i might go on shore in a shoreboat i called one alongside shook hands with all my messmates and when i arrived on the quarterdeck with swinburne and some of the best men who came forward captain hawkins stood by the binnacle bursting with rage as i went over the planeshear i took my hat off to him and wished him goodmorning very respectfully adding if you have any commands for my uncle captain hawkins i shall be glad to execute them this observation which showed him that i knew the connection and correspondence between them made him gasp with emotion leave the ship sir or by god ill put you in irons for mutiny cried he i again took off my hat and went down the side and shoved off as soon as i was a few yards distant the men jumped on the carronades and cheered and i perceived captain hawkins order them down and before i was a cables length from her the pipe all hands to punishment so i presume some of the poor fellows suffered for their insubordination in showing their good will i acknowledge that i might have left the ship in a more dignified manner and that my conduct was not altogether correct but still i state what i really did do and some allowance must be made for my feelings this is certain that my conduct after the courtmartial was more deserving of punishment than that for which i had been tried but i was in a state of feverish excitement and hardly knew what i did when i arrived at sally port i had my effects wheeled up to the blue posts and packing up those which i most required i threw off my uniform and was once more a gentleman at large i took my place in the mail for that evening sent a letter of thanks with a few bank notes to my counsel and then sat down and wrote a long letter to obrien acquainting him with the events which had taken place i had just finished and sealed it up when in came mrs trotter oh my dear mr simple im so sorry and i have come to console you theres nothing like women when men are in affliction as poor trotter used to say as he laid his head in my lap when do you go to town this evening mrs trotter i hope i am to continue to attend the ship i hope so too mrs trotter i have no doubt but you will now mr simple how are you off for money do you want a little you can pay me byandby dont be afraid im not quite so poor as i was when you came down to mess with trotter and me and when you gave me the dozen pair of stockings i know what it is to want money and what it is to want friends many thanks to you mrs trotter replied i but i have sufficient to take me home and then i can obtain more well im glad of it but it was offered in earnest goodbye god bless you come mr simple give me a kiss it wont be the first time i kissed her for i felt grateful for her kindness and with a little smirking and ogling she quitted the room i could not help thinking after she was gone how little we know the hearts of others if i had been asked if mrs trotter was a person to have done a generous action from what i had seen of her in adversity i should have decidedly said no yet in this offer she was disinterested for she knew the service well enough to be aware that i had little chance of being a first lieutenant again and of being of service to her and how often does it also occur that those who ought from gratitude or long friendship to do all they can to assist you turn from you in your necessity and prove false and treacherous it is god alone who knows our hearts i sent my letter to obrien to the admirals office sat down to a dinner which i could not taste and at seven oclock got into the mail when i arrived in town i was much worse but i did not wait more than an hour i took my place in a coach which did not go to the town near which we resided for i had inquired and found that coach was full and i did not choose to wait another day the coach in which i took my place went within forty miles of the vicarage and i intended to post across the country the next evening i arrived at the point of separation and taking out my portmanteau ordered a chaise and set off for what had once been my home i could hardly hold my head up i was so ill and i lay in a corner of the chaise in a sort of dream kept from sleeping from intense pain in the forehead and temples it was about nine oclock at night when we were in a dreadful jolting road the shocks proceeding from which gave me agonizing pain that the chaise was stopped by two men who dragged me out on the grass one stood over me while the other rifled the chaise the postboy who appeared a party to the transaction remained quietly on his horse and as soon as they had taken my effects turned round and drove off they then rifled my person taking away everything that i had leaving me nothing but my trousers and shirt after a short consultation they ordered me to walk on in the direction in which we had been proceeding in the chaise and to hasten as fast as i could or they would blow my brains out i complied with their request thinking myself fortunate to have escaped so well i knew that i was still thirty miles at least from the vicarage but ill as i was i hoped to be able to reach it on foot i walked during the remainder of the night but i got on but slowly i reeled from one side of the road to the other and occasionally sat down to rest morning dawned and i perceived habitations not far from me i staggered on in my course the fever now raged in me my head was splitting with agony and i tottered to a bank near a small neat cottage on the side of the road i have a faint recollection of some one coming to me and taking my hand but nothing further and it was not till many months afterwards that i became acquainted with the circumstances which i now relate it appears that the owner of the cottage was a halfpay lieutenant in the army who had soldout on account of his wounds i was humanely taken into his house laid on a bed and a surgeon requested to come to me immediately i had now lost all recollection and who i was they could not ascertain my pockets were empty and it was only by the mark on my linen that they found that my name was simple for three weeks i remained in a state of alternate stupor and delirium when the latter came on i raved of lord privilege obrien and celeste mr selwin the officer who had so kindly assisted me knew that simple was the patronymic name of lord privilege and he immediately wrote to his lordship stating that a young man of the name of simple who in his delirium called upon him and captain obrien was lying in a most dangerous state in his house and that as he presumed i was a relative of his lordships he had deemed it right to apprise him of the fact my uncle who knew that it must be me thought this too favourable an opportunity provided i should live not to have me in his power he wrote to say that he would be there in a day or two at the same time thanking mr selwin for his kind attention to his poor nephew and requesting that no expense might be spared when my uncle arrived which he did in his own chariot the crisis of the fever was over but i was still in a state of stupor arising from extreme debility he thanked mr selwin for his attention which he said he was afraid was of little avail as i was every year becoming more deranged and he expressed his fears that it would terminate in chronic lunacy his poor father died in the same state continued my uncle passing his hand across his eyes as if much affected i have brought my physician with me to see if he can be moved i shall not be satisfied unless i am with him night and day the physician who was my uncles valet took me by the hand felt my pulse examined my eyes and pronounced that it would be very easy to move me and that i should recover sooner in a more airy room of course mr selwin raised no objections putting down all to my uncles regard for me and my clothes were put on me as i lay in a state of insensibility and i was lifted into the chariot it is most wonderful that i did not die from being thus taken out of my bed in such a state but it pleased heaven that it should be otherwise had such an event taken place it would probably have pleased my uncle much better than my surviving when i was in the carriage supported by the pseudophysician my uncle again thanked mr selwin begged that he would command his interest wrote a handsome cheque for the surgeon who had attended me and getting into the carriage drove off with me still in a state of insensibilitythat is i was not so insensible but i think i felt i had been removed and i heard the rattling of the wheels but my mind was so uncollected and i was in a state of such weakness that i could not feel assured of it for a minute for some days afterwards for i recollect nothing about the journey i found myself in bed in a dark room and my arms confined i recalled my senses and by degrees was able to recollect all that had occurred until i laid down by the roadside where was i the room was dark i could distinguish nothing that i had attempted to do myself some injury i took for granted or my arms would not have been secured i had been in a fever and delirious i supposed and had now recovered i had been in a reverie for more than an hour wondering why i was left alone when the door of the apartment opened who is there inquired i oh youve come to yourself again said a gruff voice then ill give you a little daylight he took down a shutter which covered the whole of the window and a flood of light poured in which blinded me i shut my eyes and by degrees admitted the light until i could bear it i looked at the apartment the walls were bare and whitewashed i was on a trucklebed i looked at the windowit was closed up with iron barswhy where am i inquired i of the man with alarm where are you replied he why in bedlam chapter lxiv as obrien said its a long lane that has no turningi am rescued and happiness pours in upon me as fast as misery before overwhelmed me the shock was too greati fell back on my pillow insensible how long i laid i know not but when i recovered the keeper was gone and i found a jug of water and some bread by the side of the bed i drank the water and the effect it had upon me was surprising i felt that i could get up and i rose my arms had been unpinioned during my swoon i got on my feet and staggered to the window i looked out saw the bright sun the passersby the houses oppositeall looked cheerful and gay but i was a prisoner in a madhouse had i been mad i reflected and supposed that i had been and had been confined by those who knew nothing of me it never came into my head that my uncle had been a party to it i threw myself on the bed and relieved myself with tears it was about noon that the medical people attended by the keepers and others came into my apartment is he quite quiet o lord yes sir as quiet as a lamb replied the man who had before entered i then spoke to the medical gentleman begging him to tell why and how i had been brought here he answered mildly and soothingly saying that i was there at the wish of my friends and that every care would be taken of me that he was aware that my paroxysms were only occasional and that during the time i was quiet i should have every indulgence that could be granted and that he hoped that i soon should be perfectly well and be permitted to leave the hospital i replied by stating who i was and how i had been taken ill the doctor shook his head advised me to lie down as much as possible and then quitted me to visit the other patients as i afterwards discovered my uncle had had me confined upon the plea that i was a young man who was deranged with an idea that his name was simple and that he was the heir to the title and estates that i was very troublesome at times forcing my way into his house and insulting the servants but in every other respect was harmless that my paroxysms generally ended in a violent fever and it was more from the fear of my coming to some harm than from any illwill towards the poor young man that he wished me to remain in the hospital and be taken care of the reader may at once perceive the art of this communication i having no idea why i was confined would of course continue to style myself by my true name and as long as i did this so long would i be considered in a deranged state the reader must not therefore be surprised when i tell him that i remained in bedlam for one year and eight months the doctor called upon me for two or three days and finding me quiet ordered me to be allowed books paper and ink to amuse myself but every attempt at explanation was certain to be the signal for him to leave my apartment i found therefore not only by him but from the keeper who paid no attention to anything i said that i had no chance of being listened to or of obtaining my release after the first month the doctor came to me no more i was a quiet patient and he received the report of the keeper i was sent there with every necessary document to prove that i was mad and although a very little may establish a case of lunacy it requires something very strong indeed to prove that you are in your right senses in bedlam i found it impossible at the same time i was well treated was allowed all necessary comforts and such amusement as could be obtained from books c i had no reason to complain of the keeperexcept that he was too much employed to waste his time in listening to what he did not believe i wrote several letters to my sister and to obrien during the first two or three months and requested the keeper to put them in the post this he promised to do never refusing to take the letters but as i afterwards found out they were invariably destroyed yet i still bore up with the hopes of release for some time but the anxiety relative to my sister when i thought of her situation my thoughts of celeste and of obrien sometimes quite overcame me then indeed i would almost become frantic and the keeper would report that i had had a paroxysm after six months i became melancholy and i wasted away i no longer attempted to amuse myself but sat all day with my eyes fixed upon vacancy i no longer attended to my person i allowed my beard to grow my face was never washed unless mechanically when ordered by the keeper and if i was not mad there was every prospect of my soon becoming so life passed away as a blanki had become indifferent to everythingi noted time no morethe change of seasons was unperceived even the day and the night followed without my regarding them i was in this unfortunate situation when one day the door was opened and as had been often the custom during my imprisonment visitors were going round the establishment to indulge their curiosity in witnessing the degradation of their fellowcreatures or to offer their commiseration i paid no heed to them not even casting up my eyes this young man said the medical gentleman who accompanied the party has entertained the strange idea that his name is simple and that he is the rightful heir to the title and property of lord privilege one of the visitors came up to me and looked me in the face and so he is cried he to the doctor who looked with astonishment peter dont you know me i started up it was general obrien i flew into his arms and burst into tears sir said general obrien leading me to the chair and seating me upon it i tell you that is mr simple the nephew of lord privilege and i believe the heir to the title if therefore his assertion of such being the case is the only proof of his insanity he is illegally confined i am here a foreigner and a prisoner on parole but i am not without friends my lord belmore said he turning to another of the visitors who had accompanied him i pledge you my honour that what i state is true and i request that you will immediately demand the release of this poor young man i assure you sir that i have lord privileges letter observed the doctor lord privilege is a scoundrel replied general obrien but there is justice to be obtained in this country and he shall pay dearly for his lettre de cachet my dear peter how fortunate was my visit to this horrid place i had heard so much of the excellent arrangements of this establishment that i agreed to walk round with lord belmore but i find that it is abused indeed general obrien i have been treated with kindness replied i and particularly by this gentleman it was not his fault general obrien and lord belmore then inquired of the doctor if he had any objection to my release none whatever my lord even if he were insane although i now see how i have been imposed upon we allow the friends of any patient to remove him if they think that they can pay him more attention he may leave with you this moment i now did feel my brain turn with the revulsion from despair to hope and i fell back in my seat the doctor perceiving my condition bled me copiously and laid me on the bed where i remained more than an hour watched by general obrien i then got up calm and thankful i was shaved by the barber of the establishment washed and dressed myself and leaning on the generals arm was let out i cast my eyes upon the two celebrated stone figures of melancholy and raving madness as i passed them i trembled and clung more tightly to the generals arm was assisted into the carriage and bade farewell to madness and misery the general said nothing until we approached the hotel where he resided in doverstreet and then he inquired in a low voice whether i could bear more excitement it is celeste you mean general it is my dear boy she is here and he squeezed my hand alas cried i what hopes have i now of celeste more than you had before replied the general she lives but for you and if you are a beggar i have a competence to make you sufficiently comfortable i returned the generals pressure of the hand but could not speak we descended and in a minute i was led by the father into the arms of the astonished daughter i must pass over a few days during which i had almost recovered my health and spirits and had narrated my adventures to general obrien and celeste my first object was to discover my sister what had become of poor ellen in the destitute condition in which she had been left i knew not and i resolved to go down to the vicarage and make inquiries i did not however set off until a legal adviser had been sent for by general obrien and due notice given to lord privilege of an action to be immediately brought against him for false imprisonment i set off in the mail and the next evening arrived at the town of i hastened to the parsonage and the tears stood in my eyes as i thought of my mother my poor father and the peculiar and doubtful situation of my dear sister i was answered by a boy in livery and found the present incumbent at home he received me politely listened to my story and then replied that my sister had set off for london on the day of his arrival and that she had not communicated her intentions to any one here then was all clue lost and i was in despair i walked to the town in time to throw myself into the mail and the next evening joined celeste and the general to whom i communicated the intelligence and requested advice how to proceed lord belmore called the next morning and the general consulted him his lordship took great interest in my concerns and previous to any further steps advised me to step into his carriage and allow him to relate my case to the first lord of the admiralty this was done immediately and as i had now an opportunity of speaking freely to his lordship i explained to him the conduct of captain hawkins and his connection with my uncle also the reason of my uncles persecution his lordship finding me under such powerful protection as lord belmores and having an eye to my future claims which my uncles conduct gave him reason to suppose were well founded was extremely gracious and said that i should hear from him in a day or two he kept his word and on the third day after my interview i received a note announcing my promotion to the rank of commander i was delighted with this good fortune as was general obrien and celeste when at the admiralty i inquired about obrien and found that he was expected home every day he had gained great reputation in the east indies was chief in command at the taking of some of the islands and it was said was to be created a baronet for his services everything wore a favourable aspect excepting the disappearance of my sister this was a weight on my mind i could not remove but i have forgotten to inform the reader by what means general obrien and celeste arrived so opportunely in england martinique had been captured by our forces about six months before and the whole of the garrison surrendered as prisoners of war general obrien was sent home and allowed to be on parole although born a frenchman he had very high connections in ireland of whom lord belmore was one when they arrived they had made every inquiry for me without success they knew that i had been tried by a courtmartial and dismissed my ship but after that no clue could be found for my discovery celeste who was fearful that some dreadful accident had occurred to me had suffered very much in health and general obrien perceiving how much his daughters happiness depended upon her attachment for me had made up his mind that if i were found we should be united i hardly need say how delighted he was when he discovered me though in a situation so little to be envied the story of my incarceration of the action to be brought against my uncle and the reports of foul play relative to the succession had in the meantime been widely circulated among the nobility and i found that every attention was paid me and i was repeatedly invited out as an object of curiosity and speculation the loss of my sister also was a subject of much interest and many people from goodwill made every inquiry to discover her i had returned one day from the solicitors who had advertised for her in the newspapers without success when i found a letter for me on the table in an admiralty enclosure i opened itthe enclosure was one from obrien who had just cast anchor at spithead and who had requested that the letter should be forwarded to me if any one could tell my address i tore it open my dear peterwhere are and what has become of you i have received no letters for these two years and i have fretted myself to death i received your letter about the rascally courtmartial but perhaps you have not heard that the little scoundrel is dead yes peter he brought your letter out in his own ship and that was his deathwarrant i met him at a private party he brought up your name i allowed him to abuse you and then told him he was a liar and a scoundrel upon which he challenged me very much against his will but the affront was so public that he couldnt help himself upon which i shot him with all the goodwill in the world and could he have jumped up again twenty times like jackinthebox i would have shot him every time the dirty scoundrel but theres an end of him nobody pitied him for every one hated him and the admiral only looked grave and then was very much obliged to me for giving him a vacancy for his nephew bythebye from some unknown hand but i presume from the officers of his ship i received a packet of correspondence between him and your worthy uncle which is about as elegant a piece of rascality as ever was carried on between two scoundrels but thats not all peter ive got a young woman for you who will make your heart gladnot mademoiselle celeste for i dont know where she isbut the wetnurse who went out to india her husband was sent home as an invalid and she was allowed her passage home with him in my frigate finding that he belonged to the regiment i talked to him about one osullivan who married in ireland and mentioned the girls name and when he discovered that he was a countryman of mine he told me that his real name was osullivan sure enough but that he had always served as oconnell and that his wife on board was the young woman in question upon which i sent to speak to her and telling her that i knew all about it and mentioning the names of ella flanagan and her mother who had given me the information she was quite astonished and when i asked her what had become of the child which she took in place of her own she told me that it had been drowned at plymouth and that her husband was saved at the same time by a young officer whose name i have here says she and then she pulled out of her neck your card with peter simple on it now says i do you know good woman that in helping on the rascally exchange of children you ruin that very young man who saved your husband for you deprive him of his title and property she stared like a stuck pig when i said so and then cursed and blamed herself and declared shed right you as soon as we came home and most anxious she is still to do so for she loves the very name of you so you see peter a good action has its reward sometimes in this world and a bad action also seeing as how ive shot that confounded villain who dared to illuse you i have plenty more to say to you peter but i dont like writing what perhaps may never be read so ill wait till i hear from you and then as soon as i get through my business we will set to and trounce that scoundrel of an uncle i have twenty thousand pounds jammed together in the consolidated besides the spice islands which will be a pretty penny and every farthing of it shall go to right you peter and make a lord of you as i promised you often that you should be and if you win you shall pay and if you dont then dn the luck and dn the money too i beg you will offer my best regards to miss ellen and say how happy i shall be to hear that she is well but it has always been on my mind peter that your father did not leave too much behind him and i wish to know how you both get on i left you a carte blanche at my agents and i only hope that you have taken advantage of it if required if not youre not the peter that i left behind me so now farewell and dont forget to answer my letter in no time ever yours terence obrien this was indeed joyful intelligence i handed the letter to general obrien who read it celeste hanging over his shoulder and perusing it at the same time this is well said the general peter i wish you joy and celeste i ought to wish you joy also at your future prospects it will indeed be a gratification if ever i hail you as lady privilege celeste said i you did not reject me when i was pennyless and in disgrace o my poor sister ellen if i could but find you how happy should i be i sat down to write to obrien acquainting him with all that had occurred and the loss of my dear sister the day after the receipt of my letter obrien burst into the room after the first moments of congratulation were past he said my hearts broke peter about your sister ellen find her i must i shall give up my ship for ill never give up the search as long as i live i must find her do pray my dear obrien and i only wish wish what peter shall i tell you what i wishthat if i find her youll give her to me for my trouble as far as i am concerned obrien nothing would give me greater pleasure but god knows to what wretchedness and want may have compelled her shame on you peter to think so of your sister i pledge my honour for her poor miserable and unhappy she may bebut nono peter you dont knowyou dont love her as i do if you can allow such thoughts to enter your mind this conversation took place at the window we then turned round to general obrien and celeste captain obrien said the general sir terence obrien if you please general his majesty has given me a handle to my name i congratulate you sir terence said the general shaking him by the hand what i was about to say is that i hope you will take up your quarters at this hotel and we will all live together i trust that we shall soon find ellen in the meanwhile we have no time to lose in our exposure of lord privilege is the woman in town yes and under lock and key but the devil a fear of her millions would not bribe her to wrong him who risked his life for her husband shes irish general to the back bone nevertheless peter we must go to our solicitor to give the intelligence that he may take the necessary steps for three weeks obrien was diligent in his search for ellen employing every description of emissary without success in the meanwhile the general and i were prosecuting our cause against lord privilege one morning lord belmore called upon us and asked the general if we would accompany him to the theatre to see two celebrated pieces performed in the latter which was a musical farce a new performer was to come out of whom report spoke highly celeste consented and after an early dinner we joined his lordship in his private box which was above the stage on the first tier the first piece was played and celeste who had never seen the performance of young was delighted the curtain then drew up for the second piece in the second act the new performer a miss henderson was led by the manager on the stage she was apparently much frightened and excited but three rounds of applause gave her courage and she proceeded at the very first notes of her voice i was startled and obrien who was behind threw himself forward to look at her but as we were almost directly above and her head was turned the other way we could not distinguish her features as she proceeded in her song she gained courage and her face was turned towards us and she cast her eyes upsaw methe recognition was mutuali held out my arm but could not speakshe staggered and fell down in a swoon tis ellen cried obrien rushing past me and making one spring down on the stage he carried her off before any other person could come to her assistance i followed him and found him with ellen still in his arms and the actresses assisting in her recovery the manager came forward to apologize stating that the young lady was too ill to proceed and the audience who had witnessed the behaviour of obrien and myself were satisfied with the romance in real life which had been exhibited her part was read by another but the piece was little attended to every one trying to find out the occasion of this uncommon occurrence in the meantime ellen was put into a hackneycoach by obrien and me and we drove to the hotel where we were soon joined by the general and celeste chapter lxv it never rains but it pours whether it be good or bad newsi succeed in everything and to everything my wife my title and estateand alls well that ends well i shall pass over the scenes which followed and give my sisters history in her own words i wrote to you my dear peter to tell you that i considered it my duty to pay all my fathers debts with your money and that there were but sixty pounds left when every claim had been satisfied and i requested you to come to me as soon as you could that i might have your counsel and assistance as to my future arrangements i received your letter ellen and was hastening to you whenbut no matter i will tell my story afterwards day after day i waited with anxiety for a letter and then wrote to the officers of the ship to know if any accident had occurred i received an answer from the surgeon informing me that you had quitted portsmouth to join me and had not since been heard of you may imagine my distress at this communication as i did not doubt but that something dreadful had occurred as i knew too well that nothing would have detained you from me at such a time the new vicar appointed had come down to look over the house and to make arrangements for bringing in his family the furniture he had previously agreed to take at a valuation and the sum had been appropriated in liquidation of your fathers debts i had already been permitted to remain longer than was usual and had no alternative but to quit which i did not do until the last moment i could not leave my address for i knew not where i was to go i took my place in the coach and arrived in london my first object was to secure the means of livelihood by offering myself as a governess but i found great difficulties from not being able to procure a good reference and from not having already served in that capacity at last i was taken into a family to bring up three little girls but i soon found out how little chance i had of comfort the lady had objected to me as too goodlookingfor this same reason the gentleman insisted upon my being engaged thus was i a source of disunion the lady treated me with harshness and the gentleman with too much attention at last her illtreatment and his persecution were both so intolerable that i gave notice that i should leave my situation i beg pardon miss ellen but you will oblige me with the name and residence of that gentleman said obrien indeed ellen do no such thing replied i continue your story i could not obtain another situation as governess for as i always stated where i had been and did not choose to give the precise reason for quitting merely stating that i was not comfortable whenever the lady was called upon for my character she invariably spoke of me so as to prevent my obtaining a situation at last i was engaged as teacher to a school i had better have taken a situation as housemaid i was expected to be everywhere to do everything was up at daylight and never in bed till past midnight fared very badly and was equally ill paid but still it was honest employment and i remained there for more than a year but though as economical as possible my salary would not maintain me in clothes and washing which was all i required there was a master of elocution who came every week and whose wife was the teacher of music they took a great liking to me and pointed out how much better i should be off if i could succeed on the stage of which they had no doubt for months i refused hoping still to have some tidings of you but at last my drudgery became so insupportable and my means so decreased that i unwillingly consented it was then nineteen months since i had heard of you and i mourned you as dead i had no relations except my uncle and i was unknown even to him i quitted the situation and took up my abode with the teacher of elocution and his wife who treated me with every kindness and prepared me for my new career neither at the school which was three miles from london nor at my new residence which was over westminsterbridge did i ever see a newspaper it was no wonder therefore that i did not know of your advertisements after three months preparation i was recommended and introduced to the manager by my kind friends and accepted you know the rest well miss ellen if any one ever tells you that you were on the stage at all events you may reply that you wasnt there long i trust not long enough to be recognised replied she i recollect how often i have expressed my disgust at those who would thus consent to exhibit themselves but circumstances strangely alter our feelings i do however trust that i should have been respectable even as an actress that you would miss ellen replied obrien what did i tell you peter you pledged your honour that nothing would induce ellen to disgrace her family i recollect obrien thank you sir terence for your good opinion replied ellen my sister had been with us about three days during which i had informed her of all that had taken place when one evening finding myself alone with her i candidly stated to her what were obriens feelings towards her and pleaded his cause with all the earnestness in my power my dear brother she replied i have always admired captain obriens character and always have felt grateful to him for his kindness and attachment to you but i cannot say that i love him i have never thought about him except as one to whom we are both much indebted but do you mean to say that you could not love him no i do not and i will do all i can peteri will try i never will if possible make him unhappy who has been so kind to you depend upon it ellen that with your knowledge of obrien and with feelings of gratitude to him you will soon love him if once you accept him as a suitor may i tell him you may tell him that he may plead his own cause my dear brother and at all events i will listen to no other until he has had fair play but recollect that at present i only like himlike him very much it is true but still i only like him i was quite satisfied with my success and so was obrien when i told him by the powers peter shes an angel and i cant expect her to love an inferior being like myself but if shell only like me well enough to marry me ill trust to aftermarriage for the rest love comes with the children peter well but you need not say that to her divil a bitthey shall come upon her like old age without her perceiving it obrien having thus obtained permission certainly lost no time in taking advantage of it celeste and i were more fondly attached every day the solicitor declared my case so good that he could raise fifty thousand pounds upon it in short all our causes were prosperous when an event occurred the details of which of course i did not obtain until some time afterwards but which i shall narrate here my uncle was very much alarmed when he discovered that i had been released from bedlamstill more so when he had notice given him of a suit relative to the succession to the title his emissaries had discovered that the wetnurse had been brought home in obriens frigate and was kept so close that they could not communicate with her he now felt that all his schemes would prove abortive his legal adviser was with him and they had been walking in the garden talking over the contingencies when they stopped close to the drawingroom windows of the mansion at eagle park but sir observed the lawyer if you will not confide in me i cannot act for your benefit you still assert that nothing of the kind has taken place i do replied his lordship it is a foul invention then my lord may i ask you why you considered it advisable to imprison mr simple in bedlam because i hate him retorted his lordshipdetest him and for what reason my lord his character is unimpeached and he is your near relative i tell you sir that i hate himwould that he were now lying dead at my feet hardly were the words out of my uncles mouth when a whizzing was heard for a second and then something fell down within a foot of where they stood with a heavy crash they startedturned roundthe adopted heir lay lifeless at their feet and their legs were bespattered with his blood and his brains the poor boy seeing his lordship below had leaned out of one of the upper windows to call to him but lost his balance and had fallen head foremost upon the wide stone pavement which surrounded the mansion for a few seconds the lawyer and my uncle looked upon each other with horror a judgmenta judgment cried the lawyer looking at his client my uncle covered his face with his hands and fell assistance now came out but there was more than one to help up the violence of his emotion had brought on an apoplectic fit and my uncle although he breathed never spoke again it was in consequence of this tragical event of which we did not know the particulars until afterwards that the next morning my solicitor called upon me and put a letter into my hand saying allow me to congratulate your lordship we were all at breakfast at the time and the general obrien and myself jumped up all in such astonishment at this unexpected title being so soon conferred upon me that we had a heavy bill for damages to pay and had not ellen caught the teaurn as it was tipping over there would in all probability have been a doctors bill into the bargain the letter was eagerly readit was from my uncles legal adviser who had witnessed the catastrophe informing me that all dispute as to the succession was at an end by the tragical event that had taken place and that he had put seals upon everything awaiting my arrival or instructions the solicitor as he presented the letter said that he would take his leave and call again in an hour or two when i was more composed my first movement when i had read the letter aloud was to throw my arms round celeste and embrace herand obrien taking the hint did the same to ellen and was excused in consideration of circumstances but as soon as she could disengage herself her arms were entwined round my neck while celeste was hanging on her fathers having disposed of the ladies the gentlemen now shook hands and though we had not all appetites to finish our breakfasts never was there a happier quintette in about an hour my solicitor returned and congratulated me and immediately set about the necessary preparations i desired him to go down immediately to eagle park attend to the funeral of my uncle and the poor little boy who had paid so dearly for his intended advancement and take charge from my uncles legal adviser who remained in the house the dreadful accident in high life found its way into the papers of the day and before dinner time a pile of visiting cards was poured in which covered the table the next day a letter arrived from the first lord announcing that he had made out my commission as postcaptain and trusted that i would allow him the pleasure of presenting it himself at his dinner hour at halfpast seven very much obliged to him the fool of the family might have waited a long while for it while i was reading this letter the waiter came up to say that a young woman below wanted to speak to me i desired her to be shown up as soon as she came in she burst into tears knelt down and kissed my hand sure its youoh yesits you that saved my poor husband when i was assisting to your ruin and ant i punished for my wicked doingsant my poor boy dead she said no more but remained on her knees sobbing bitterly of course the reader recognises in her the wetnurse who had exchanged her child i raised her up and desired her to apply to my solicitor to pay her expenses and leave her address but do you forgive me mr simple its not that i have forgiven myself i do forgive you with all my heart my good woman you have been punished enough i have indeed replied she sobbing but dont i deserve it all and more too gods blessing and all the saints too upon your head for your kind forgiveness anyhow my heart is lighter and she quitted the room she had scarcely quitted the hotel when the waiter came up again another lady my lord wishes to speak with you but she wont give her name really my lord you seem to have an extensive female acquaintance said the general at all events i am not aware of any that i need be ashamed of show the lady up waiter in a moment entered a fat unwieldly little mortal very warm from walking she sat down in a chair threw back her tippet and then exclaimed lord bless you how you have grown gemini if i can hardly believe my eyes and i declare he dont know me i really cannot exactly recollect where i had the pleasure of seeing you before madam well thats what i said to jemima when i went down in the kitchen jemima says i i wonder if little peter simple will know me and jemima says i think he would the parrot marm mrs handycock i believe said i recollecting jemima and the parrot although from a little thin woman she had grown so fat as not to be recognisable oh so youve found me out mr simplemy lord i ought to say well i need not ask after your grandfather now for i know hes dead but as i was coming this way for orders i thought i would just step in and see how you looked i trust mr handycock is well maam pray is he a bull or a bear lord bless you mr simple my lord i should say hes been neither bull nor bear for this three years he was obliged to waddle if i didnt know much about bulls and bears i know very well what a lame duck is to my cost were off the stock exchange and mr handycock is set up as a coal merchant indeed yes that is we have no coals but we take orders and have halfacrown a chaldron for our trouble as mr handycock says its a very good business if you only had enough of it perhaps your lordship may be able to give us an order its nothing out of your pocket and something into ours i shall be very happy when i return again to town mrs handycock i hope the parrot is quite well oh my lord thats a sore subject only think of mr handycock when we retired from the change taking my parrot one day and selling it for five guineas saying five guineas were better than a nasty squalling bird to be sure there was nothing for dinner that day but as jemima agreed with me wed rather have gone without a dinner for a month than have parted with poll since weve looked up a little in the world i saved up five guineas by hook or by crook and tried to get poll back again but the lady said she wouldnt take fifty guineas for him mrs handycock then jumped from her chair saying good morning my lord ill leave one of mr handycocks cards jemima would be so glad to see you as she left the room celeste laughingly asked me whether i had any more such acquaintances i replied that i believed not but i must acknowledge that mrs trotter was brought to my recollection and i was under some alarm lest she should also come and pay me her respects the next day i had another unexpected visit we had just sat down to dinner when we heard a disturbance below and shortly after the generals french servant came up in great haste saying that there was a foreigner below who wished to see me and that he had been caning one of the waiters of the hotel for not paying him proper respect who can that be thought i and i went out of the door and looked over the banisters as the noise continued you must not come here to beat englishmen i can tell you roared one of the waiters what do we care for your foreign counts sacre canaille cried the other party in a contemptuous voice which i well knew ay canalwell duck you in the canal if you dont mind you will said the stranger who had hitherto spoken french allow me to observein the most delicate manner in the worldjust to hint that you are a dd trencherscraping napkincarrying shillingseeking upanddownstairs son of a bitchand take this for your impudence the noise of the cane was again heard and i hastened downstairs where i found count shucksen thrashing two or three of the waiters without mercy at my appearance the waiters who were showing fight retreated to a short distance out of reach of the cane my dear count exclaimed i is it you my dear lord privilege will you excuse me but these fellows are saucy then ill have them discharged replied i if a friend of mine and an officer of your rank and distinction cannot come to see me without insult i will seek another hotel this threat of mine and the reception i gave the count put all to rights the waiters sneaked off and the master of the hotel apologised it appeared that they had desired him to wait in the coffeeroom until they could announce him which had hurt the counts dignity we are just sitting down to dinner count will you join us as soon as i have improved my toilet my dear lord replied he you must perceive that i am off a journey the master of the hotel bowed and proceeded to show the count to a dressingroom when i returned upstairswhat was the matter inquired obrien oh nothinga little disturbance in consequence of a foreigner not understanding english in about five minutes the waiter opened the door and announced count shucksen now obrien youll be puzzled said i and in came the count my dear lord privilege said he coming up and taking me by the hand let me not be the last to congratulate you upon your accession i was running up the channel in my frigate when a pilotboat gave me a newspaper in which i saw your unexpected change of circumstances i made an excuse for dropping my anchor at spithead this morning and i have come up post to express how sincerely i participate in your good fortune count shucksen then politely saluted the ladies and the general and turned round to obrien who had been staring at him with astonishment count shucksen allow me to introduce sir terence obrien by the piper that played before moses but its a puzzle said obrien blood and thunder if it ant chucksmy dear fellow when did you rise from your grave fortunately replied the count as they shook each others hands for some time i never went into it sir terence but now with your permission my lord ill take some food as i really am not a little hungry after dinner captain obrien you shall hear my history his secret was confided to the whole party upon my pledging myself for their keeping it locked up in their own breasts which was a bold thing on my part considering that two of them were ladies the count stayed with us for some time and was introduced everywhere it was impossible to discover that he had not been bred up in a court his manners were so good he was a great favourite with the ladies and his moustachios bad french and waltzingan accomplishment he had picked up in swedenwere quite the vogue all the ladies were sorry when the swedish count announced his departure by a ppc before i left town i called upon the first lord of the admiralty and procured for swinburne a firstrate buildingthat is to say ordered to be built this he had often said he wished as he was tired of the sea after a service of fortyfive years subsequently i obtained leave of absence for him every year and he used to make himself very happy at eagle park most of his time was however passed on the lake either fishing or rowing about telling long stories to all who would join him in his water excursions a fortnight after my assuming my title we set off for eagle park and celeste consented to my entreaties that the wedding should take place that day month upon this hint obrien spake and to oblige me ellen consented that we should be united on the same day obrien wrote to father mgrath but the letter was returned by post with dead marked upon the outside obrien then wrote to one of his sisters who informed him that father mgrath would cross the bog one evening when he had taken a very large proportion of whisky and that he was seen out of the right path and had never been heard of afterwards on the day appointed we were all united and both unions have been attended with as much happiness as this world can afford both obrien and i are blessed with children which as obrien observed have come upon us like old age until we now can muster a large christmas party in the two families the generals head is white and he sits and smiles happy in his daughters happiness and in the gambols of his grandchildren such reader is the history of peter simple viscount privilege no longer the fool but the head of the family who now bids you farewell the end the three cutters chapter i cutter the first reader have you ever been at plymouth if you have your eye must have dwelt with ecstasy upon the beautiful property of the earl of mount edgcumbe if you have not been at plymouth the sooner that you go there the better at mount edgcumbe you will behold the finest timber in existence towering up to the summits of the hills and feathering down to the shingle on the beach and from this lovely spot you will witness one of the most splendid panoramas in the world you will seei hardly know what you will not seeyou will see ram head and cawsand bay and then you will see the breakwater and drakes island and the devils bridge below you and the town of plymouth and its fortifications and the hoe and then you will come to the devils point round which the tide runs devilish strong and then you will see the new victualling officeabout which sir james gordon used to stump all day and take a pinch of snuff from every man who carried a box which all were delighted to give and he was delighted to receive proving how much pleasure may be communicated merely by a pinch of snuffand then you will see mount wise and mutton cove the town of devonport with its magnificent dockyard and arsenals north corner and the way which leads to saltash and you will see ships building and ships in ordinary and ships repairing and ships fitting and hulks and convict ships and the guardship ships ready to sail and ships under sail besides lighters menofwars boats dockyardboats bumboats and shoreboats in short there is a great deal to see at plymouth besides the sea itself but what i particularly wish now is that you will stand at the battery of mount edgecumbe and look into barn pool below you and there you will see lying at single anchor a cutter and you may also see by her pendant and ensign that she is a yacht of all the amusements entered into by the nobility and gentry of our island there is not one so manly so exciting so patriotic or so national as yachtsailing it is peculiar to england not only from our insular position and our fine harbours but because it requires a certain degree of energy and a certain amount of income rarely to be found elsewhere it has been wisely fostered by our sovereigns who have felt that the security of the kingdom is increased by every man being more or less a sailor or connected with the nautical profession it is an amusement of the greatest importance to the country as it has much improved our shipbuilding and our shipfitting while it affords employment to our seamen and shipwrights but if i were to say all that i could say in praise of yachts i should never advance with my narrative i shall therefore drink a bumper to the health of admiral lord yarborough and the yacht club and proceed you observe that this yacht is cutterrigged and that she sits gracefully on the smooth water she is just heaving up her anchor her foresail is loose all ready to cast herin a few minutes she will be under weigh you see that there are some ladies sitting at the taffrail and there are five haunches of venison hanging over the stern of all amusements give me yachting but we must go on board the deck you observe is of narrow deal planks as white as snow the guns are of polished brass the bitts and binnacles of mahogany she is painted with taste and all the mouldings are gilded there is nothing wanting and yet how clear and unencumbered are her decks let us go below this is the ladies cabin can anything be more tasteful or elegant is it not luxurious and although so small does not its very confined space astonish you when you view so many comforts so beautifully arranged this is the diningroom and where the gentlemen repair what can be more complete or recherche and just peep into their staterooms and bedplaces here is the stewards room and the beaufet the steward is squeezing lemons for the punch and there is the champagne in ice and by the side of the pail the longcorks are ranged up all ready now let us go forwards here are the mens berths not confined as in a manofwar no luxury starts from abaft and is not wholly lost even at the forepeak this is the kitchen is it not admirably arranged what a multum in parvo and how delightful are the fumes of the turtlesoup at sea we do meet with rough weather at times but for roughing it out give me a yacht now that i have shown you round the vessel i must introduce the parties on board you observe that florid handsome man in white trousers and blue jacket who has a telescope in one hand and is sipping a glass of brandy and water which he has just taken off the skylight that is the owner of the vessel and a member of the yacht club it is lord b he looks like a sailor and he does not much belie his looks yet i have seen him in his robes of state at the opening of the house of lords the one near to him is mr stewart a lieutenant in the navy he holds on by the rigging with one hand because having been actively employed all his life he does not know what to do with hands which have nothing in them he is protege of lord b and is now on board as sailingmaster of the yacht that handsome wellbuilt man who is standing by the binnacle is a mr hautaine he served six years as midshipman in the navy and did not like it he then served six years in a cavalry regiment and did not like it he then married and in a much shorter probation found that he did not like that but he is very fond of yachts and other mens wives if he does not like his own and wherever he goes he is welcome that young man with an embroidered silk waistcoat and white gloves bending to talk to one of the ladies is a mr vaughan he is to be seen at almacks at crockfords and everywhere else everybody knows him and he knows everybody he is a little in debt and yachting is convenient the one who sits by the lady is a relation of lord b you see at once what he is he apes the sailor he has not shaved because sailors have no time to shave every day he has not changed his linen because sailors cannot change every day he has a cigar in his mouth which makes him half sick and annoys his company he talks of the pleasure of a rough sea which will drive all the ladies belowand then they will not perceive that he is more sick than themselves he has the misfortune to be born to a large estate and to be a fool his name is ossulton the last of the gentlemen on board whom i have to introduce is mr seagrove he is slightly made with marked features full of intelligence he has been brought up to the bar and has every qualification but application he has never had a brief nor has he a chance of one he is the fiddler of the company and he has locked up his chambers and come by invitation of his lordship to play on board of his yacht i have yet to describe the ladiesperhaps i should have commenced with themi must excuse myself upon the principle of reserving the best to the last all puppetshowmen do so and what is this but the first scene in my puppetshow we will describe them according to seniority that tall thin crosslooking lady of fortyfive is a spinster and sister to lord b she has been persuaded very much against her will to come on board but her notions of propriety would not permit her niece to embark under the protection of only her father she is frightened at everything if a rope is thrown down on the deck up she starts and cries oh if on the deck she thinks the water is rushing in below if down below and there is a noise she is convinced there is danger and if it be perfectly still she is sure there is something wrong she fidgets herself and everybody and is quite a nuisance with her pride and illhumour but she has strict notions of propriety and sacrifices herself as a martyr she is the hon miss ossulton the lady who when she smiles shows so many dimples in her pretty oval face is a young widow of the name of lascelles she married an old man to please her father and mother which was very dutiful on her part she was rewarded by finding herself a widow with a large fortune having married the first time to please her parents she intends now to marry to please herself but she is very young and is in no hurry the young lady with such a sweet expression of countenance is the hon miss cecilia ossulton she is lively witty and has no fear in her composition but she is very young yet not more than seventeenand nobody knows what she really isshe does not know herself these are the parties who meet in the cabin of the yacht the crew consists of ten fine seamen the steward and the cook there is also lord bs valet mr ossultons gentleman and the ladys maid of miss ossulton there not being accommodation for them the other servants have been left on shore the yacht is now under weigh and her sails are all set she is running between drakes island and the main dinner has been announced as the reader has learnt something about the preparations i leave him to judge whether it be not very pleasant to sit down to dinner in a yacht the air has given everybody an appetite and it was not until the cloth was removed that the conversation became general mr seagrove said his lordship you very nearly lost your passage i expected you last thursday i am sorry my lord that business prevented my sooner attending to your lordships kind summons come seagrove dont be nonsensical said hautaine you told me yourself the other evening when you were talkative that you had never had a brief in your life and a very fortunate circumstance replied seagrove for if i had had a brief i should not have known what to have done with it it is not my fault i am fit for nothing but a commissioner but still i had business and very important business too i was summoned by ponsonby to go with him to tattersalls to give my opinion about a horse he wishes to purchase and then to attend him to forest wild to plead his cause with his uncle it appears then that you were retained replied lord b may i ask you whether your friend gained his cause no my lord he lost his cause but he gained a suit expound your riddle sir said cecilia ossulton the fact is that old ponsonby is very anxious that william should marry miss percival whose estates join on to forest wild now my friend william is about as fond of marriage as i am of law and thereby issue was joined but why were you to be called in inquired mrs lascelles because madam as ponsonby never buys a horse without consulting me i cannot see the analogy sir observed miss ossulton senior bridling up pardon me madam the fact is continued seagrove that as i always have to back ponsonbys horses he thought it right that in this instance i should back him he required special pleading but his uncle tried him for the capital offence and he was not allowed counsel as soon as we arrived and i had bowed myself into the room mr ponsonby bowed me out againwhich would have been infinitely more jarring to my feelings had not the door been left ajar do anything but pun seagrove interrupted hautaine well then i will take a glass of wine do so said his lordship but recollect the whole company are impatient for your story i can assure you my lord that it was equal to any scene in a comedy now be it observed that mr seagrove had a great deal of comic talent he was an excellent mimic and could alter his voice almost as he pleased it was a custom of his to act a scene as between other people and he performed it remarkably well whenever he said that anything he was going to narrate was as good as a comedy it was generally understood by those who were acquainted with him that he was to be asked so to do cecilia ossulton therefore immediately said pray act it mr seagrove upon which mr seagrovepremising that he had not only heard but also seen all that passedchanging his voice and suiting the action to the word commenced it may said he be called five thousand acres in a ringfence we shall not describe mr seagroves motions they must be inferred from his words it will then william observed mr ponsonby stopping and turning to his nephew after a rapid walk up and down the room with his hands behind him under his coat so as to allow the tails to drop their perpendicular about three inches clear of his body i may say without contradiction be the finest property in the countyfive thousand acres in a ringfence i dare say it will uncle replied william tapping his foot as he lounged in a green morocco easychair and so because you have set your fancy upon having these two estates enclosed together in a ringfence you wish that i should also be enclosed in a ringfence and a beautiful property it will be replied mr ponsonby which unclethe estate or the wife both nephew both and i expect your consent uncle i am not avaricious your present property is sufficient for me with your permission instead of doubling the property and doubling myself i will remain your sole heir and single observe william such an opportunity may not occur again for centuries we shall restore forest wild to its ancient boundaries you know it has been divided nearly two hundred years we now have a glorious golden opportunity of reuniting the two properties and when joined the estate will be exactly what it was when granted to our ancestors by henry the eighth at the period of the reformation this house must be pulled down and the monastery left standing then we shall have our own again and the property without encumbrance without encumbrance uncle you forget that there will be a wife and you forget that there will be five thousand acres in a ringfence indeed uncle you ring it too often in my ears that i should forget it but much as i should like to be the happy possessor of such a property i do not feel inclined to be the happy possessor of miss percival and the more so as i have never seen the property we will ride over it tomorrow william ride over miss percival uncle that will not be very gallant i will however one of these days ride over the property with you which as well as miss percival i have not as yet seen then i can tell you she is a very pretty property if she were not in a ringfence in good heart william that is i mean an excellent disposition valuable in matrimony and well tilledi should say welleducated by her thee maiden aunts who are the patterns of propriety does any one follow the fashion in a high state of cultivation that is her mind highly cultivated and according to the last new systemwhat is it a fourcourse shift i presume replied william laughing that is dancing singing music and drawing and only seventeen capital soil promising good crops what would you have more a very pretty estate uncle if it were not the estate of matrimony i am sorry very sorry to disappoint you but i must decline taking a lease of it for life then sir allow me to hint to you that in my testament you are only tenantatwill i consider it a duty that i owe to the family that the estate should be reunited that can only be done by one of our family marrying miss percival and as you will not i shall now write to your cousin james and if he accept my proposal shall make him my heir probably he will more fully appreciate the advantages of five thousand acres in a ringfence and mr ponsonby directed his steps towards the door stop my dear uncle cried william rising up from his easychair we do not quite understand one another it is very true that i would prefer half the property and remaining single to the two estates and the estate of marriage but at the same time i did not tell you that i would prefer beggary to a wife and five thousand acres in a ringfence i know you to be a man of your wordi accept your proposal and you need not put my cousin james to the expense of postage very good william i require no more and as i know you to be a man of your word i shall consider this match as settled it was on this account only that i sent for you and now you may go back again as soon as you please i will let you know when all is ready i must be at tattersalls on monday uncle there is a horse i must have for next season pray uncle may i ask when you are likely to want me let me seethis is mayabout july i should think july uncle spare mei cannot marry in the dogdays no hang it not july well william perhaps as you must come down once or twice to see the propertymiss percival i should sayit may be too soonsuppose we put it off till october octoberi shall be down at melton pray sir may i then inquire what portion of the year is not with you dogdays why uncle next april nowi think that would do next april eleven months and a winter between suppose miss percival was to take a cold and die i should be excessively obliged to her thought william no no continued mr ponsonby there is nothing certain in this world william well then uncle suppose we arrange it for the first hard frost we have had no hard frosts lately williamwe may wait for years the sooner it is over the bettergo back to town buy your horse and then come down heremy dear william to oblige your unclenever mind the dogdays well sir if i am to make a sacrifice it shall not be done by halves out of respect for you i will even marry in july without any regard to the thermometer you are a good boy williamdo you want a cheque i have had one today thought william and was almost at fault i shall be most thankful sirthey sell horseflesh by the ounce nowadays and you pay in poundsthere william thank you sir im all obedience and ill keep my word even if there should be a comet ill go and buy the horse and then i shall be ready to take the ringfence as soon as you please yes and youll get over it cleverly ive no doubtfive thousand acres william anda pretty wife have you any further commands uncle said william depositing the cheque in his pocketbook now my dear boy are you going yes sir i dine at the clarendon well then goodbyemake my compliments and excuses to your friend seagroveyou will come on tuesday or wednesday thus was concluded the marriage between william ponsonby and emily percival and the junction of the two estates which formed together the great desideratumfive thousand acres in a ringfence mr seagrove finished and he looked round for approbation very good indeed seagrove said his lordship you must take a glass of wine after that i would not give much for miss percivals chance of happiness observed the elder miss ossulton of two evils choose the least they say observed mr hautaine poor ponsonby could not help himself thats a very polite observation of yours mr hautainei thank you in the name of the sex replied cecilia ossulton nay miss ossulton would you like to marry a person whom you never saw most certainly not but when you mentioned the two evils mr hautaine i appeal to your honour did you not refer to marriage or beggary i must confess it miss ossulton but it is hardly fair to call on my honour to get me into a scrape i only wish that the offer had been made to me observed vaughan i should not have hesitated as ponsonby did then i beg you will not think of proposing for me said mrs lascelles laughingfor mr vaughan had been excessively attentive it appears to me vaughan observed seagrove that you have slightly committed yourself by that remark vaughan who thought so too replied mrs lascelles must be aware that i was only joking fie mr vaughan cried cecilia ossulton you know it came from your heart my dear cecilia said the elder miss ossulton you forget yourself what can you possibly know about gentlemens hearts the bible says that they are deceitful and desperately wicked aunt and cannot we also quote the bible against your sex miss ossulton replied seagrove yes you could perhaps if any of you had ever read it replied miss ossulton carelessly upon my word cissy you are throwing the gauntlet down to the gentlemen observed lord b but i shall throw my warder down and not permit this combat a loutrancei perceive you drink no more wine gentlemen we will take our coffee on deck we were just about to retire my lord observed the elder miss ossulton with great asperity i have been trying to catch the eye of mrs lascelles for some time but i was looking another way i presume interrupted mrs lascelles smiling i am afraid that i am the unfortunate culprit said mr seagrove i was telling a little anecdote to mrs lascelles which of course from its being communicated in an undertone was not proper for all the company to hear replied the elder miss ossulton but if mrs lascelles is now ready continued she bridling up as she rose from her chair at all events i can hear the remainder of it on deck replied mrs lascelles the ladies rose and went into the cabin cecilia and mrs lascelles exchanging very significant smiles as they followed the precise spinster who did not choose that mrs lascelles should take the lead merely because she had once happened to have been marriedthe gentlemen also broke up and went on deck we have a nice breeze now my lord observed mr stewart who had remained on deck and we lie right up channel so much the better replied his lordship we ought to have been anchored at cowes a week ago they will all be there before us tell mr simpson to bring me a light for my cigar said mr ossulton to one of the men mr stewart went down to his dinner the ladies and the coffee came on deck the breeze was fine the weather it was april almost warm and the yacht whose name was the arrow assisted by the tide soon left the mewstone far astern chapter ii cutter the second reader have you ever been at portsmouth if you have you must have been delighted with the view from the saluting battery and if you have not you had better go there as soon as you can from the saluting battery you may look up the harbour and see much of what i have described at plymouth the scenery is different but similar arsenals and dockyards and an equal portion of our stupendous navy are to be found thereand you will see gosport on the other side of the harbour and sally port close to you besides a great many other places which from the saluting battery you cannot see and then there is southsea beach to your left before you spithead with the menofwar and the motherbank crowded with merchant vesselsand there is the buoy where the royal george was wrecked and where she still lies the fish swimming in and out of her cabin windows but that is not all you can also see the isle of wightryde with its long wooden pier and cowes where the yachts lie in fact there is a great deal to be seen at portsmouth as well as at plymouth but what i wish you particularly to see just now is a vessel holding fast to the buoy just off the saluting battery she is a cutter and you may know that she belongs to the preventive service by the number of gigs and galleys which she has hoisted up all round her she looks like a vessel that was about to sail with a cargo of boats two on deck one astern one on each side of her you observe that she is painted black and all her boats are white she is not such an elegant vessel as the yacht and she is much more lumbered up she has no haunches of venison over the stern but i think there is a leg of mutton and some cabbages hanging by their stalks but revenuecutters are not yachtsyou will find no turtle or champagne but nevertheless you will perhaps find a joint to carve at a good glass of grog and a hearty welcome let us go on boardyou observe the guns are iron and painted black and her bulwarks are painted red it is not a very becoming colour but then it lasts a long while and the dockyard is not very generous on the score of paintor lieutenants of the navy troubled with much spare cash she has plenty of men and fine men they are all dressed in red flannel shirts and blue trousers some of them have not taken off their canvas or tarpaulin petticoats which are very useful to them as they are in the boats night and day and in all weathers but we will at once go down into the cabin where we shall find the lieutenant who commands her a masters mate and a midshipman they have each their tumbler before them and are drinking gintoddy hot with sugarcapital gin too bove proof it is from that small anker standing under the table it was one that they forgot to return to the customhouse when they made their last seizure we must introduce them the elderly personage with grizzly hair and whiskers a round pale face and a somewhat red nose being too much in the wind will make the nose red and this old officer is very often in the wind of course from the very nature of his profession is a lieutenant appleboy he has served in every class of vessel in the service and done the duty of first lieutenant for twenty years he is now on promotionthat is to say after he has taken a certain number of tubs of gin he will be rewarded with his rank as commander it is a pity that what he takes inside of him does not count for he takes it morning noon and night he is just filling his fourteenth glass he always keeps a regular account as he never exceeds his limited number which is seventeen then he is exactly down to his bearings the masters mates name is tomkins he has served his six years three times over and has now outgrown his ambition which is fortunate for him as his chances of promotion are small he prefers a small vessel to a large one because he is not obliged to be so particular in his dress and looks for his lieutenancy whenever there shall be another charity promotion he is fond of soft bread for his teeth are all absent without leave he prefers porter to any other liquor but he can drink his glass of grog whether it be based upon rum brandy or the liquor now before him mr smith is the name of that young gentleman whose jacket is so out at the elbows he has been intending to mend it these last two months but is too lazy to go to his chest for another he has been turned out of half the ships in the service for laziness but he was born soand therefore it is not his faulta revenuecutter suits him she is half her time hove to and he has no objection to boatservice as he sits down always in the sternsheets which is not fatiguing creeping for tubs is his delight as he gets over so little ground he is fond of grog but there is some trouble in carrying the tumbler so often to his mouth so he looks at it and lets it stand he says little because he is too lazy to speak he has served more than eight years but as for passingit has never come into his head such are the three persons who are now sitting in the cabin of the revenuecutter drinking hot gintoddy let me see it was i think in ninetythree or ninetyfour before you were in the service tomkins maybe sir its so long ago since i entered that i cant recollect datesbut this i know that my aunt died three days before then the question is when did your aunt die oh she died about a year after my uncle and when did your uncle die ill be hanged if i know then dye see youve no departure to work from however i think you cannot have been in the service at that time we were not quite so particular about uniform as we are now then i think the service was all the better for it nowadays in your crack ships a mate has to go down in the hold or spiritroom and after whipping up fifty empty casks and breaking out twenty full ones he is expected to come on quarterdeck as clean as if he was just come out of a bandbox well theres plenty of water alongside as far as the outward man goes and iron dust is soon brushed off however as you say perhaps a little too much is expected at least in five of the ships in which i was firstlieutenant the captain was always hauling me over the coals about the midshipmen not dressing properly as if i was their drynurse i wonder what captain prigg would have said if he had seen such a turnout as you mr smith on his quarterdeck i should have had one turnout more drawled smith with your outatelbows jacket there heh continued mr appleboy smith turned up his elbows looked at one and then at the other after so fatiguing an operation he was silent well where was i oh it was about ninetythree or ninetyfour as i said that it happenedtomkins fill your glass and hand me the sugar how do i get on this is no said appleboy counting some white lines on the table by him and taking up a piece of chalk he marked one more line on his tally i dont think this is so good a tub as the last tomkins theres a twang about ita want of juniperhowever i hope we shall have better luck this time of course you know we sail tomorrow i presume so by the leg of mutton coming on board truetrueim regularas clockworkafter being twenty years a firstlieutenant one gets a little methodi like regularity now the admiral has never omitted asking me to dinner once every time i have come into harbour except this timei was so certain of it that i never expected to sail and i have but two shirts clean in consequence thats odd isnt it and the more so because he has had such great people down here and has been giving large parties every day and yet i made three seizures besides sweeping up those thirtyseven tubs i swept them up observed smith thats all the same thing younkerwhen youve been a little longer in the service youll find out that the commanding officer has the merit of all that is donebut youre green yet let me see where was i ohit was about ninetythree or ninetyfour as i said at that time i was in the channel fleettomkins ill trouble you for the hot water this waters coldmr smith do me the favour to ring the bell jem some more hot water please sir said jem who was barefooted as well as bareheaded touching the lock of hair on his forehead the cook has capsized the kettlebut he has put more on capsized the kettle havery wellwell talk about that tomorrow mr tomkins do me the favour to put him in the report i may forget it and pray sir how long is it since he has put more on just this moment sir as i came aft very well well see to that tomorrowyou bring the kettle aft as soon as it is ready i say mr jem is that fellow sober yees sir he be sober as you be its quite astonishing what a propensity the common sailors have to liquor forty odd years have i been in the service and ive never found any difference i only wish i had a guinea for every time that i have given a fellow sevenwater grog during my servitude as firstlieutenant i wouldnt call the king my cousin well if theres no hot water we must take lukewarmit wont do to heave to by the lord harry who would have thought itim at number sixteen let me countyes surely i must have made a mistake a fact by heaven continued mr appleboy throwing the chalk down on the table only one more glass after thisthat is if i have counted righti may have seen double yes drawled smith well never mindlets go on with my storyit was either in the year ninetythree or ninetyfour that i was in the channel fleetwe were then abreast of torbay here be the hot water sir cried jem putting the kettle down on the deck very well boybythebye has the jar of butter come on board yes but it broke all down the middle i tied him up with a ropeyarn who broke it sir coxswain says as how he didnt but who did sir coxswain handed it up to bill jones and he says as how he didnt but who did sir bill jones gave it to me and im sure as how i didnt then who did sir i ask you i think it be bill jones sir cause hes fond of butter i know and there be very little left in the jar very well well see to that tomorrow morning mr tomkins youll oblige me by putting the butterjar down in the report in case it should slip my memory bill jones indeed looks as if butter wouldnt melt in his mouthnever mind well it was as i said beforeit was in the year ninetythree or ninetyfour when i was in the channel fleet we were then off torbay and had just taken two reefs in the topsails stop before i go on with my story ill take my last glassi think its the last let me countyes by heavens i make out sixteen well told never mind it shall be a stiff one boy bring the kettle and mind you dont pour the hot water into my shoes as you did the other night there that will do now tomkins fill up yours and you mr smith let us all start fair and then you shall have my storyand a very curious one it is i can tell you i wouldnt have believed it myself if i hadnt seen it hilloa whats this confound it whats the matter with the toddy heh mr tomkins mr tomkins tasted but like the lieutenant he had made it very stiff and as he had also taken largely before he was like him not quite so clear in his discrimination it has a queer twang sir smith what is it smith took up his glass tasted the contents salt water drawled the midshipman salt water so it is by heavens cried mr appleboy salt as lots wifeby all thats infamous cried the masters mate salt water sir cried jem in a fright expecting a salt eel for supper yes sir replied mr appleboy tossing the contents of the tumbler in the boys face salt water very well sirvery well it warnt me sir replied the boy making up a piteous look no sir but you said the cook was sober he was not so very much disguised sir replied jem oh very wellnever mind mr tomkins in case i should forget it do me the favour to put the kettle of salt water down in the report the scoundrel im very sorry gentlemen but theres no means of having any more gintoddybut never mind well see to this tomorrow two can play at this and if i dont saltwater their grog and make them drink it too i have been twenty years a firstlieutenant for nothingthats all good night gentlemen and continued the lieutenant in a severe tone youll keep a sharp lookout mr smithdo you hear sir yes drawled smith but its not my watch it was my first watch and just now it struck one bell youll keep the middle watch then mr smith said mr appleboy who was not a little put out and mr tomkins let me know as soon as its daylight boy get my bed made salt water by all thats blue however well see to that tomorrow morning mr appleboy then turned in so did mr tomkins and so did mr smith who had no idea of keeping the middle watch because the cook was drunk and had filled up the kettle with salt water as for what happened in ninetythree or ninetyfour i really would inform the reader if i knew but i am afraid that that most curious story is never to be handed down to posterity the next morning mr tomkins as usual forgot to report the cook the jar of butter and the kettle of salt water and mr appleboys wrath had long been appeased before he remembered them at daylight the lieutenant came on deck having only slept away half of the sixteen and a taste of the seventeenth saltwater glass of gintoddy he rubbed his grey eyes that he might peer through the grey of the morning the fresh breeze blew about his grizzly locks and cooled his rubicund nose the revenuecutter whose name was the active cast off from the buoy and with a fresh breeze steered her course for the needles passage chapter iii cutter the third reader have you been to st maloes if you have you were glad enough to leave the hole and if you have not take my advice and do not give yourself the trouble to go and see that or any other french port in the channel there is not one worth looking at they have made one or two artificial ports and they are no great things there is no getting out or getting in in fact they have no harbours in the channel while we have the finest in the world a peculiar dispensation of providence because it knew that we should want them and france would not in france what are called ports are all alike nasty narrow holes only to be entered at certain times of tide and certain winds made up of basins and backwaters customhouses and cabarets just fit for smugglers to run into and nothing more and therefore they are used for very little else now in the doghole called st maloes there is some pretty land although a great deficiency of marine scenery but never mind that stay at home and dont go abroad to drink sour wine because they call it bordeaux and eat villanous trash so disguised by cooking that you cannot possibly tell which of the birds of the air or beasts of the field or fishes of the sea you are cramming down your throat if all is right there is no occasion for disguise is an old saying so depend upon it that there is something wrong and that you are eating offal under a grand french name they eat everything in france and would serve you up the head of a monkey who has died of the smallpox as singe au petite verolethat is if you did not understand french if you did they would call it tete damour a lethiopique and then you would be even more puzzled as for their wine there is no disguise in thatits half vinegar no no stay at home you can live just as cheaply if you choose and then you will have good meat good vegetables good ale good beer and a good glass of grogand what is of more importance you will be in good company live with your friends and dont make a fool of yourself i would not have condescended to have noticed this place had it not been that i wish you to observe a vessel which is lying along the pierwharf with a plank from the shore to her gunnel it is low water and she is aground and the plank dips down at such an angle that it is a work of danger to go either in or out of her you observe that there is nothing very remarkable in her she is a cutter and a good seaboat and sails well before the wind she is short for her breadth of beam and is not armed smugglers do not arm nowthe service is too dangerous they effect their purpose by cunning not by force nevertheless it requires that smugglers should be good seamen smart active fellows and keenwitted or they can do nothing this vessel has not a large cargo in her but it is valuable she has some thousand yards of lace a few hundred pounds of tea a few bales of silk and about forty ankers of brandyjust as much as they can land in one boat all they ask is a heavy gale or a thick fog and they trust to themselves for success there is nobody on board except a boy the crew are all up at the cabaret settling their little accounts of every descriptionfor they smuggle both ways and every man has his own private venture there they are all fifteen of them and finelooking fellows too sitting at that long table they are very merry but quite sober as they are to sail tonight the captain of the vessel whose name bythebye is the happygoluckythe captain christened her himself is that finelooking young man with dark whiskers meeting under his throat his name is jack pickersgill you perceive at once that he is much above a common sailor in appearance his manners are good he is remarkably handsome very clean and rather a dandy in his dress observe how very politely he takes off his hat to that frenchman with whom he has just settled accounts he beats johnny crapeau at his own weapons and then there is an air of command a feeling of conscious superiority about jack see how he treats the landlord de haut en bas at the same time that he is very civil the fact is that jack is of a very good old family and received a very excellent education but he was an orphan his friends were poor and could do but little for him he went out to india as a cadet ran away and served in a schooner which smuggled opium into china and then came home he took a liking to the employment and is now laying up a very pretty little sum not that he intends to stop no as soon as he has enough to fit out a vessel for himself he intends to start again for india and with two cargoes of opium he will return he trusts with a handsome fortune and reassume his family name such are jacks intentions and as he eventually means to reappear as a gentleman he preserves his gentlemanly habits he neither drinks nor chews nor smokes he keeps his hands clean wears rings and sports a gold snuffbox notwithstanding which jack is one of the boldest and best of sailors and the men know it he is full of fun and as keen as a razor jack has a very heavy venture this time all the lace is his own speculation and if he gets it in safe he will clear some thousands of pounds a certain fashionable shop in london has already agreed to take the whole off his hands that short neatlymade young man is the second in command and the companion of the captain he is clever and always has a remedy to propose when there is a difficulty which is a great quality in a second in command his name is corbett he is always merryhalfsailor halftradesman knows the markets runs up to london and does business as well as a chapmanlives for the day and laughs at tomorrow that little punchy old man with long gray hair and fat face with a nose like a note of interrogation is the next personage of importance he ought to be called the sailingmaster for although he goes on shore in france off the english coast he never quits the vessel when they leave her with the goods he remains on board he is always to be found off any part of the coast where he may be ordered holding his position in defiance of gales and tides and fogs as for the revenuevessels they all know him well enough but they cannot touch a vessel in ballast if she has no more men on board than allowed by her tonnage he knows every creek and hole and corner of the coast how the tide runs intide halftide eddy or current that is his value his name is morrison you observe that jack pickersgill has two excellent supporters in corbett and morrison his other men are good seamen active and obedient which is all that he requires i shall not particularly introduce them now you may call for another litre my lads and that must be the last the tide is flowing fast and we shall be afloat in half an hour and we have just the breeze we want what dye think morrison shall we have dirt ive been looking just now and if it were any other month in the year i should say yes but theres no trusting april captain howsomever if it does blow off ill promise you a fog in three hours afterwards that will do as well corbett have you settled with duval yes after more noise and charivari than a panic in the stock exchange would make in england he fought and squabbled for an hour and i found that without some abatement i never should have settled the affair what did you let him off seventeen sous replied corbett laughing and that satisfied him inquired pickersgill yesit was all he could prove to be a surfaire two of the knives were a little rusty but he will always have something off he could not be happy without it i really think he would commit suicide if he had to pay a bill without a deduction let him live replied pickersgill jeannette a bottle of volnay of and three glasses jeannette who was the fille de cabaret soon appeared with a bottle of wine seldom called for except by the captain of the happygolucky you sail tonight said she as she placed the bottle before him pickersgill nodded his head i had a strange dream said jeannette i thought you were all taken by a revenue cutter and put in a cachot i went to see you and i did not know one of you againyou were all changed very likely jeannetteyou would not be the first who did not know their friends again when in misfortune there was nothing strange in your dream mais mon dieu je ne suis pas comme ca moi no that you are not jeannette you are a good girl and some of these fine days ill marry you said corbett doit etre bien beau ce jour la par exemple replied jeannette laughing you have promised to marry me every time you have come in these last three years well that proves i keep to my promise any how yes but you never go any further i cant spare him jeannette that is the real truth said the captain but wait a littlein the meantime here is a fivefranc piece to add to your petite fortune merci bien monsieur le capitaine bon voyage jeannette held her finger up to corbett saying with a smile mechant and then quitted the room come morrison help us to empty this bottle and then we will all go on board i wish that girl wouldnt come here with her nonsensical dreams said morrison taking his seat i dont like it when she said that we should be taken by a revenue cutter i was looking at a blue and a white pigeon sitting on the wall opposite and i said to myself now if that be a warning i will see if the blue pigeon flies away first i shall be in jail in a week if the white i shall be back here well said pickersgill laughing it wasnt well answered morrison tossing off his wine and putting the glass down with a deep sigh for the cursed blue pigeon flew away immediately why morrison you must have a chickenheart to be frightened at a blue pigeon said corbett laughing and looking out of the window at all events he has come back again and there he is sitting by the white one its the first time that ever i was called chickenhearted replied morrison in wrath nor do you deserve it morrison replied pickersgill but corbett is only joking well at all events ill try my luck in the same way and see whether i am to be in jail i shall take the blue pigeon as my bad omen as you did the sailors and captain pickersgill all rose and went to the window to ascertain corbetts fortune by this new species of augury the blue pigeon flapped his wings and then he sidled up to the white one at last the white pigeon flew off the wall and settled on the roof of the adjacent house bravo white pigeon said corbett i shall be here again in a week the whole party laughing then resumed their seats and morrisons countenance brightened up as he took the glass of wine poured out by pickersgill he said heres your health corbett it was all nonsense after allfor dye see i cant be put in jail without you are we all sail in the same boat and when you leave me you take with you everything that can condemn the vesselso heres success to our trip we will all drink that toast my lads and then on board said the captain heres success to our trip the captain rose as did the mates and men drank the toast turned down the drinkingvessels on the table hastened to the wharf and in half an hour the happygolucky was clear of the port of st maloes chapter iv portland bill the happygolucky sailed with a fresh breeze and a flowing sheet from st maloes the evening before the arrow sailed from barn pool the active sailed from portsmouth the morning after the yacht as we before observed was bound to cowes in the isle of wight the active had orders to cruise wherever she pleased within the limits of the admirals station and she ran for west bay on the other side of the bill of portland the happygolucky was also bound for that bay to land her cargo the wind was light and there was every appearance of fine weather when the happygolucky at ten oclock on the tuesday night made the portland lights as it was impossible to run her cargo that night she hove to at eleven oclock the portland lights were made by the revenue cutter active mr appleboy went up to have a look at them ordered the cutter to be hove to and then went down to finish his allowance of gintoddy at twelve oclock the yacht arrow made the portland lights and continued her course hardly stemming the ebb tide day broke and the horizon was clear the first on the lookout were of course the smugglers they and those on board the revenue cutter were the only two interested partiesthe yacht was neuter there are two cutters in sight sir said corbett who had the watch for pickersgill having been up the whole night had thrown himself down on the bed with his clothes on what do they look like said pickersgill who was up in a moment one is a yacht and the other may be but i rather think as far as i can judge in the gray that it is our old friend off here what old appleboy yes it looks like him but the day has scarcely broke yet well he can do nothing in a light wind like this and before the wind we can show him our heels but are you sure the other is a yacht said pickersgill coming on deck yes the king is more careful of his canvas youre right said pickersgill that is a yacht and youre right there again in your guessthat is the stupid old active which creeps about creeping for tubs well i see nothing to alarm us at present provided it dont fall a dead calm and then we must take to our boat as soon as he takes to his we are four miles from him at least watch his motions corbett and see if he lowers a boat what does she go now four knotsthat will soon tire their men the positions of the three cutters were as follows the happygolucky was about four miles off portland head and well into west bay the revenue cutter was close to the head the yacht was outside of the smuggler about two miles to the westward and about five or six miles from the revenue cutter two vessels in sight sir said mr smith coming down into the cabin to mr appleboy very well replied the lieutenant who was lying down in his standing bedplace the people say one is the happygolucky sir drawled smith heh what happygolucky yes i recollect ive boarded her twenty timesalways empty hows she standing she stands to the westward now sir but she was hove to they say when they first saw her then she has a cargo in her and mr appleboy shaved himself dressed and went on deck yes said the lieutenant rubbing his eyes again and again and then looking through the glass it is her sure enough let draw the fore sheethands make sail what vessels the other dont know sirshes a cutter a cutter yes may be a yacht or may be the new cutter ordered on the station make all sail mr tomkins hoist our pendant and fire a gun they will understand what we mean then they dont know the happygolucky as well as we do in a few minutes the active was under a press of sail she hoisted her pendant and fired a gun the smuggler perceived that the active had recognised her and she also threw out more canvas and ran off more to the westward theres a gun sir reported one of the men to mr stewart on board of the yacht yes give me the glassa revenue cutter then this vessel in shore running towards us must be a smuggler she has just now made all sail sir yes theres no doubt of it i will go down to his lordshipkeep her as she goes mr stewart then went down to inform lord b of the circumstance not only lord b but most of the gentlemen came on deck as did soon afterwards the ladies who had received the intelligence from lord b who spoke to them through the door of the cabin but the smuggler had more wind than the revenue cutter and increased her distance if we were to wear round now my lord observed mr stewart she is just abreast of us and in shore we could prevent her escape round with her mr stewart said lord b we must do our duty and protect the laws that will not be fair papa said cecilia ossulton we have no quarrel with the smugglers im sure the ladies have not for they bring us beautiful things miss ossulton observed her aunt it is not proper for you to offer an opinion the yacht wore round and sailing so fast the smuggler had little chance of escaping her but to chase is one thingto capture another let us give her a gun said lord b that will frighten her and he dare not cross our hawse the gun was loaded and not being more than a mile from the smuggler actually threw the ball almost a quarter of the way the gentlemen as well as lord b were equally excited by the ardour of pursuit but the wind died away and at last it was nearly calm the revenue cutters boats were out and coming up fast let us get our boat out stewart said his lordship and help them it is quite calm now the boat was soon out it was a very large one usually stowed on and occupied a large portion of the deck it pulled six oars and when it was manned mr stewart jumped in and lord b followed him but you have no arms said mr hautaine the smugglers never resist now observed stewart then you are going on a very gallant expedition indeed observed cecilia ossulton i wish you joy but lord b was too much excited to pay attention they shoved off and pulled towards the smuggler at this time the revenue boats were about five miles astern of the happygolucky and the yacht about threequarters of a mile from her in the offing pickersgill had of course observed the motions of the yacht had seen her wear on chase hoist her ensign and pendant and fire her gun well said he this is the blackest ingratitude to be attacked by the very people whom we smuggle for i only wish she may come up with us and let her attempt to interfere she shall rue the day i dont much like this though as we before observed it fell nearly calm and the revenue boats were in chase pickersgill watched them as they came up what shall we do said corbettget the boat out yes replied pickersgill we will get the boat out and have the goods in her all ready but we can pull faster than they do in the first place and in the next they will be pretty well tired before they come up to us we are fresh and shall soon walk away from them so i shall not leave the vessel till they are within half a mile we must sink the ankers that they may not seize the vessel for it is not worth while taking them with us pass them along ready to run them over the bows that they may not see us and swear to it but we have a good half hour and more ay and you may hold all fast if you choose said morrison although its better to be on the right side and get ready otherwise before half an hour ill swear that we are out of their sight look there said he pointing to the eastward at a heavy bank its coming right down upon us as i said it would true enough but still there is no saying which will come first morrison the boats or the fog so we must be prepared hilloa whats this why theres a boat coming from the yacht pickersgill took out his glass yes and the yachts own boat with the name painted on her bows well let them comewe will have no ceremony in resisting them they are not in the act of parliament and must take the consequences we have nought to fear get stretchers my lads and handspikes they row six oars and are three in the stern sheetsthey must be good men if they take us in a few minutes lord b was close to the smuggler boat ahoy what do you want surrender in the kings name to what and to whom and what are we to surrender we are an english vessel coasting along shore pull on board my lads cried stewart i am a kings officerwe know her the boat darted alongside and stewart and lord b followed by the men jumped on the deck well gentlemen what do you want said pickersgill we seize youyou are a smuggler theres no denying it look at the casks of spirits stretched along the deck we never said that we were not smugglers replied pickersgill but what is that to you you are not a kings ship or employed by the revenue no but we carry a pendant and it is our duty to protect the laws and who are you said pickersgill i am lord b then my lord allow me to say that you would do much better to attend to the framing of laws and leave people of less consequence like those astern of me to execute them mind your own business is an old adage we shall not hurt you my lord as you have only employed words but we shall put it out of your power to hurt us come aft my lads now my lord resistance is useless we are double your numbers and you have caught a tartar lord b and mr stewart perceived that they were in an awkward predicament you may do what you please observed mr stewart but the revenue boats are coming up recollect look you sir do you see the revenue cutter said pickersgill stewart looked in that direction and saw that she was hidden in the fog in five minutes sir the boats will be out of sight also and so will your vessel we have nothing to fear from them indeed my lord we had better return said mr stewart who perceived that pickersgill was right i beg your pardon you will not go on board your yacht so soon as you expect take the oars out of the boat my lads two or three of you and throw in a couple of our paddles for them to reach the shore with the rest of you knock down the first man who offers to resist you are not aware perhaps my lord that you have attempted piracy on the high seas stewart looked at lord b it was true enough the men of the yacht could offer no resistance the oars were taken out of the boat and the men put in again my lord said pickersgill your boat is manneddo me the favour to step into it and you sir do the same i should be sorry to lay my hands upon a peer of the realm or a kings officer even on half pay remonstrance was vain his lordship was led to the boat by two of the smugglers and stewart followed i will leave your oars my lord at the weymouth customhouse and i trust this will be a lesson to you in future to mind your own business the boat was shoved off from the sloop by the smugglers and was soon lost sight of in the fog which had now covered the revenue boats as well as the yacht at the same time it brought down a breeze from the eastward haul to the wind morrison said pickersgill we will stand out to get rid of the boats if they pull on they will take it for granted that we shall run into the bay as will the revenue cutter pickersgill and corbett were in conversation abaft for a short time when the former desired the course to be altered two points keep silence all of you my lads and let me know if you hear a gun or a bell from the yacht said pickersgill there is a gun sir close to us said one of the men the sound was right ahead that will do keep her as she goes aft here my lads we cannot run our cargo in the bay for the cutter has been seen to chase us and they will all be on the lookout at the preventive stations for us on shore now my lads i have made up my mind that as these yacht gentlemen have thought proper to interfere i will take possession of the yacht for a few days we shall then outsail everything go where we like unsuspected and land our cargo with ease i shall run alongside of her she can have but few hands on board and mind do not hurt anybody but be civil and obey my orders morrison you and your four men and the boy will remain on board as before and take the vessel to cherbourg where we will join you in a short time another gun was fired from the yacht those on board particularly the ladies were alarmed the fog was very thick and they could not distinguish the length of the vessel they had seen the boat board but had not seen her turned adrift without oars as the fog came on just at that time the yacht was left with only three seamen on board and should it come on bad weather they were in an awkward predicament mr hautaine had taken the command and ordered the guns to be fired that the boat might be enabled to find them the fourth gun was loading when they perceived the smugglers cutter close to them looming through the fog here they are cried the seamen and they have brought the prize along with them three cheers for the arrow hilloa youll be on board of us cried hautaine thats exactly what i intended to be sir replied pickersgill jumping on the quarterdeck followed by his men who the devil are you thats exactly the same question that i asked lord b when he boarded us replied pickersgill taking off his hat to the ladies well but what business have you here exactly the same question which i put to lord b replied pickersgill where is lord b sir said cecilia ossulton going up to the smuggler is he safe yes madam he is safe at least he is in his boat with all his men and unhurt but you must excuse me if i request you and the other ladies to go down below while i speak to these gentlemen be under no alarm miss you will receive neither insult nor illtreatmenti have only taken possession of this vessel for the present take possession cried hautaine of a yacht yes sir since the owner of the yacht thought proper to attempt to take possession of me i always thought that yachts were pleasurevessels sailing about for amusement respected themselves and not interfering with others but it appears that such is not the case the owner of this yacht has thought proper to break through the neutrality and commence aggression and under such circumstances i have now in retaliation taken possession of her and pray what do you mean to do sir simply for a few days to make an exchange i shall send you on board of my vessel as smugglers while i remain here with the ladies and amuse myself with yachting why sir you cannot mean i have said gentlemen and that is enough i should be sorry to resort to violence but i must be obeyed you have i perceive three seamen only left they are not sufficient to take charge of the vessel and lord b and the others you will not meet for several days my regard for the ladies even common humanity points out to me that i cannot leave the vessel in this crippled condition at the same time as i must have hands on board of my own you will oblige me by going on board and taking her safely into port it is the least return you can make for my kindness in those dresses gentlemen you will not be able to do your duty oblige me by shifting and putting on these corbett handed a flannel shirt a rough jacket and trousers to messrs hautaine ossulton vaughan and seagrove after some useless resistance they were stripped and having put on the smugglers attire they were handed on board of the happygolucky the three english seamen were also sent on board and confined below as well as ossultons servant who was also equipped like his master and confined below with the seamen corbett and the men then handed up all the smuggled goods into the yacht dropped the boat and made it fast astern and morrison having received his directions the vessels separatedmorrison running for cherbourg and pickersgill steering the yacht along shore to the westward about an hour after this exchange had been effected the fog cleared up and showed the revenue cutter hove to for her boats which had pulled back and were close on board of her and the happygolucky about three miles in the offing lord b and his boats crew were about four miles in shore paddling and drifting with the tide towards portland as soon as the boats were on board the revenue cutter made all sail after the smuggler paying no attention to the yacht and either not seeing or not caring about the boat which was drifting about in west bay chapter v the travestie here we are corbett and now i only wish my venture had been double observed pickersgill but i shall not allow business to absorb me whollywe must add a little amusement it appears to me corbett that the gentlemans clothes which lie there will fit you and those of the goodlooking fellow who was spokesman will i am sure suit me well now let us dress ourselves and then for breakfast pickersgill then exchanged his clothes for those of mr hautaine and corbett fitted on those of mr ossulton the steward was summoned up and he dared not disobey he appeared on deck trembling stewardyou will take these clothes below said pickersgill and observe i now command this yacht and during the time that i am on board you will pay me the same respect as you did lord b nay more you will always address me as lord b you will prepare dinner and breakfast and do your duty just as if his lordship was on board and take care that you feed us well for i will not allow the ladies to be entertained in a less sumptuous manner than beforeyou will tell the cook what i sayand now that you have heard me take care that you obey if not recollect that i have my own men here and if i but point with my finger overboard you godo you perfectly comprehend me yessir stammered the steward yes sirwhat did i tell you sirrahyes my lorddo you understand me yesmy lord pray steward whose clothes has this gentleman put on mrmr ossultons i thinksirmy lord i mean very well steward then recollect in future you always address that gentleman as mr ossulton yes my lord and the steward went down below and was obliged to take a couple of glasses of brandy to keep himself from fainting who are they and what are they mr maddox cried the ladysmaid who had been weeping piratesbloody murderous stickatnothing pirates replied the steward oh screamed the ladysmaid what will become of us poor unprotected females and she hastened into the cabin to impart this dreadful intelligence the ladies in the cabin were not in a very enviable situation as for the elder miss ossulton but perhaps it will be better in future to distinguish the two ladies by calling the elder simply miss ossulton and her niece cecilia she was sitting with her salts to her nose agonised with a mixture of trepidation and wounded pride mrs lascelles was weeping but weeping gently cecilia was sad and her heart was beating with anxiety and suspensewhen the maid rushed in o madam o miss o mrs lascelles i have found it all outthey are murderous bloody doeverything pirates mercy on us exclaimed miss ossulton surely they will never dare oh maam they dare anythingthey just now were throwing the steward overboardand they have rummaged all the portmanteaus and dressed themselves in the gentlemens best clothesthe captain of them told the steward that he was lord band that if he dared to call him anything else he would cut his throat from ear to earand if the cook dont give them a good dinner they swear that theyll chop his right hand off and make him eat it without pepper or salt miss ossulton screamed and went off into hysterics mrs lascelles and cecilia went to her assistance but the latter had not forgotten the very different behaviour of jack pickersgill and his polite manners when he boarded the vessel she did not therefore believe what the maid had reported but still her anxiety and suspense were great especially about her father after having restored her aunt she put on her bonnet which was lying on the sofa where are you going dear said mrs lascelles on deck replied cecilia i must and will speak to these men gracious heaven miss ossulton going on deck have you heard what phoebe says yes aunt i have but i can wait here no longer stop her stop hershe will be murderedshe will beshe is mad screamed miss ossulton but no one attempted to stop cecilia and on deck she went on her arrival she found jack pickersgill and corbett walking the deck one of the smugglers at the helm and the rest forward and as quiet as the crew of the yacht as soon as she made her appearance jack took off his hat and made her a bow i do not know whom i have the honour of addressing young lady but i am flattered with this mark of confidence you feel and i assure you you feel correctly that you are not exactly in lawless hands cecilia looked with more surprise than fear at pickersgill mr hautaines dress became him he was a handsome finelooking man and had nothing of the ruffian in his appearance unless like byrons corsair he was half savage half soft she could not help thinking that she had met many with less pretensions as far as appearance went to the claims of a gentleman at almacks and other fashionable circles i have ventured on deck sir said cecilia with a little tremulousness in her voice to request as a favour that you will inform me what your intentions may be with regard to the vessel and with regard to the ladies and i feel much obliged to you for so doing and i assure you i will as far as i have made up my own mind answer you candidly but you trembleallow me to conduct you to a seat in few words then to remove your present alarm i intend that the vessel shall be returned to its owner with every article in it as religiously respected as if they were church property with respect to you and the other ladies on board i pledge you my honour that you have nothing to fear that you shall be treated with every respect your privacy never invaded and that in a few days you will be restored to your friends young lady i pledge my hopes of future salvation to the truth of this but at the same time i must make a few conditions which however will not be very severe but sir replied cecilia much relieved for pickersgill had stood by her in the most respectful manner you are i presume the captain of the smuggler pray answer me one question morewhat became of the boat with lord bhe is my father i left him in his boat without a hair of his head touched young lady but i took away the oars then he will perish cried cecilia putting her handkerchief to her eyes no young lady he is on shore probably by this time although i took away his means of assisting to capture us i left him the means of gaining the land it is not every one who would have done that after his conduct to us i begged him not to go said cecilia i told him that it was not fair and that he had no quarrel with the smugglers i thank you even for that replied pickersgill and now missi have not the pleasure of recollecting his lordships family name ossulton sir said cecilia looking at pickersgill with surprise then with your permission miss ossulton i will now make you my confidant excuse my using so free a term but it is because i wish to relieve your fears at the same time i cannot permit you to divulge all my intentions to the whole party on board i feel that i may trust you for you have courage and where there is courage there generally is truth but you must first tell me whether you will condescend to accept these terms cecilia demurred a momentthe idea of being the confidant of a smuggler rather startled her but still her knowledge of what his intentions were if she might not reveal them might be important as perhaps she might dissuade him she could be in no worse position than she was now and she might be in a much better the conduct of pickersgill had been such up to the present as to inspire confidence and although he defied the laws he appeared to regard the courtesies of life cecilia was a courageous girl and at length she replied provided what you desire me to keep secret will not be injurious to any one or compromise me in my peculiar situation i consent i would not hurt a fly miss ossulton but in selfdefence and i have too much respect for you from your conduct during our short meeting to compromise you allow me now to be very candid and then perhaps you will acknowledge that in my situation others would do the same and perhaps not show half so much forbearance your father without any right whatever interferes with me and my calling he attempts to make me a prisoner to have me thrown in jail heavily fined and perhaps sent out of the country i will not enter into any defence of smuggling it is sufficient to say that there are pains and penalties attached to the infraction of certain laws and that i choose to risk thembut lord b was not empowered by government to attack me it was a gratuitous actand had i thrown him and all his crew into the sea i should have been justified for it was in short an act of piracy on their part now as your father has thought to turn a yacht into a revenue cutter you cannot be surprised at my retaliating in turning her into a smuggler and as he has mixed up looking after the revenue with yachting he cannot be surprised if i retaliate by mixing up a little yachting with smuggling i have dressed your male companions as smugglers and have sent them in the smuggling vessel to cherbourg where they will be safely landed and i have dressed myself and the only person whom i could join with me in this frolic as gentlemen in their places my object is twofold one is to land my cargo which i have now on board and which is very valuable the other is to retaliate upon your father and his companions for their attempt upon me by stepping into their shoes and enjoying for a day or two their luxuries it is my intention to make free with nothing but his lordships wine and eatablesthat you may be assured of but i shall have no pleasure if the ladies do not sit down to the dinnertable with us as they did before with your father and his friends you can hardly expect that sir said cecilia yes i do and that will be not only the price of the early release of the yacht and themselves but it will also be the only means by which they will obtain anything to eat you observe miss ossulton the sins of the fathers are visited on the children i have now told you what i mean to do and what i wish i leave you to think of it and decide whether it will not be the best for all parties to consent you have my permission to tell the other ladies that whatever may be their conduct they are as secure from illtreatment or rudeness as if they were in grosvenor square but i cannot answer that they will not be hungry if after such forbearance in every point they show so little gratitude as not to honour me with their company then i am to understand that we are to be starved into submission no not starved miss ossulton but recollect that you will be on bread and water and detained until you do consent and your detention will increase the anxiety of your father you know how to persuade sir said cecilia as far as i am concerned i trust i shall ever be ready to sacrifice any feelings of pride to spare my father so much uneasiness with your permission i will now go down into the cabin and relieve my companions from the worst of their fears as for obtaining what you wish i can only say that as a young person i am not likely to have much influence with those older than myself and must inevitably be overruled as i have not permission to point out to them reasons which might avail would you so far allow me to be relieved from my promise as to communicate all you have said to me to the only married woman on board i think i then might obtain your wishes which i must candidly tell you i shall attempt to effect only because i am most anxious to rejoin my friends and be relieved of my company replied pickersgill smiling ironicallyof course you are but i must and will have my petty revenge and although you may and probably will detest me at all events you shall not have any very formidable charge to make against me before you go below miss ossulton i give you my permission to add the married lady to the number of my confidants and you must permit me to introduce my friend mr ossulton and pickersgill waved his hand in the direction of corbett who took off his hat and made a low obeisance it was impossible for cecilia ossulton to help smiling and continued pickersgill having taking the command of this yacht instead of his lordship it is absolutely necessary that i also take his lordships name while on board i am lord b and allow me to introduce myself under that namei cannot be addressed otherwise depend upon it miss ossulton that i shall have a most paternal solicitude to make you happy and comfortable had cecilia ossulton dared to have given vent to her real feelings at that time she would have burst into a fit of laughter it was too ludicrous at the same time the very burlesque reassured her still more she went into the cabin with a heavy weight removed from her heart in the meantime miss ossulton and mrs lascelles remained below in the greatest anxiety at cecilias prolonged stay they knew not what to think and dared not go on deck mrs lascelles had once determined at all risks to go up but miss ossulton and phoebe had screamed and implored her so fervently not to leave them that she unwillingly consented to remain cecilias countenance when she entered the cabin reassured mrs lascelles but not her aunt who ran to her crying and sobbing and clinging to her saying what have they done to you my poor poor cecilia nothing at all aunt replied cecilia the captain speaks very fairly and says he shall respect us in every possible way provided that we obey his orders but if not if notwhat cecilia said miss ossulton grasping her nieces arm he will starve us and not let us go god have mercy on uscried miss ossulton renewing her sobs cecilia then went to mrs lascelles and communicated to her apart all that had passed mrs lascelles agreed with cecilia that they were in no danger of insult and as they talked over the matter they at last began to laugh there was a novelty in it and there was something so ridiculous in all the gentlemen being turned into smugglers cecilia was glad that she could not tell her aunt as she wished her to be so frightened as never to have her company on board of the yacht again and mrs lascelles was too glad to annoy her for many and various insults received the matter was therefore canvassed over very satisfactorily and mrs lascelles felt a natural curiosity to see this new lord b and the second mr ossulton but they had had no breakfast and were feeling very hungry now that their alarm was over they desired phoebe to ask the steward for some tea or coffee the reply was that breakfast was laid in the cabin and lord b trusted that the ladies would come to partake of it no no replied mrs lascelles i never can without being introduced to them first nor will i go replied cecilia but i will write a note and we will have our breakfast here cecilia wrote a note in pencil as follows miss ossultons compliments to lord b and as the ladies feel rather indisposed after the alarm of this morning they trust that his lordship will excuse their coming to breakfast but hope to meet his lordship at dinner if not before that time on deck the answer was propitious and the steward soon appeared with the breakfast in the ladies cabin well maddox said cecilia how do you get on with your new master the steward looked at the door to see if it was closed shook his head and then said with a look of despair he has ordered a haunch of venison for dinner miss and he has twice threatened to toss me overboard you must obey him maddox or he certainly will these pirates are dreadful fellows be attentive and serve him just as if he was my father yes yes maam i will but our time may come its burglary on the high seas and ill go fifty miles to see him hanged steward cried pickersgill from the cabin o lord he cant have heard medyethink he did miss the partitions are very thin and you spoke very loud said mrs lascelles at all events go to him quickly goodbye miss goodbye maam if i shouldnt see you any more said maddox trembling with fear as he obeyed the awful summonswhich was to demand a toothpick miss ossulton would not touch the breakfast not so mrs lascelles and cecilia who ate very heartily its very dull to be shut up in this cabin said mrs lascelles come cecilia lets go on deck and leave me cried miss ossulton there is phoebe here aunt we are going up to persuade the pirates to put us all on shore mrs lascelles and cecilia put on their bonnets and went up lord b took off his hat and begged the honour of being introduced to the pretty widow he handed the ladies to a seat and then commenced conversing upon various subjects which at the same time possessed great novelty his lordship talked about france and described its ports told now and then a good anecdote pointed out the different headlands bays towns and villages which they were passing rapidly and always had some little story connected with each before the ladies had been two hours on deck they found themselves to their infinite surprise not only interested but in conversation with the captain of the smuggler and more than once they laughed outright but the soidisant lord b had inspired them with confidence they fully believed that what he had told them was true and that he had taken possession of the yacht to smuggle his goods to be revenged and to have a laugh now none of these three offences are capital in the eyes of the fair sex and jack was a handsome finelooking fellow of excellent manners and very agreeable conversation at the same time neither he nor his friend were in their general deportment and behaviour otherwise than most respectful ladies as you are not afraid of me which is a greater happiness than i had reason to expect i think you may be amused to witness the fear of those who accuse your sex of cowardice with your permission i will send for the cook and steward and inquire about the dinner i should like to know what there is for dinner observed mrs lascelles demurely wouldnt you cecilia cecilia put her handkerchief to her mouth tell the steward and the cook both to come aft immediately cried pickersgill in a few seconds they both made their appearance steward cried pickersgill with a loud voice yes my lord replied maddox with his hat in his hand what wines have you put out for dinner champagne my lord and claret my lord and madeira and sherry my lord no burgundy sir no my lord there is no burgundy on board no burgundy sir do you dare to tell me that upon my soul my lord cried maddox dropping on his knees there is no burgundy on boardask the ladies very well sir you may go cook what have you got for dinner sir a haunch of muttof venison my lord replied the cook with his white nightcap in his hand what else sirrah a boiled calfs head my lord a boiled calfs head let it be roasted or ill roast you sir cried pickersgill in an angry tone yes my lord ill roast it and what else sir maintenon cutlets my lord maintenon cutlets i hate themi wont have them sir let them be dressed a lombre chinoise i dont know what that is my lord i dont care for that sirrah if you dont find out by dinnertime youre food for fishesthats all you may go the cook walked off wringing his hands and his nightcap as wellfor he still held it in his right handand disappeared down the forehatchway i have done this to pay you a deserved compliment ladies you have more courage than the other sex recollect that we have had confidence given to us in consequence of your pledging your word my lord you do me then the honour of believing me i did not until i saw you replied mrs lascelles but now i am convinced that you will perform your promise you do indeed encourage me madam to pursue what is right said pickersgill bowing for your approbation i should be most sorry to lose still more sorry to prove myself unworthy of it as the reader will observe everything was going on remarkably well chapter vi the smuggling yacht cecilia returned to the cabin to ascertain whether her aunt was more composed but mrs lascelles remained on deck she was much pleased with pickersgill and they continued their conversation pickersgill entered into a defence of his conduct to lord b and mrs lascelles could not but admit the provocation after a long conversation she hinted at his profession and how superior he appeared to be to such a lawless life you may be incredulous madam replied pickersgill if i tell you that i have as good a right to quarter my arms as lord b himself and that i am not under my real name smuggling is at all events no crime and i infinitely prefer the wild life i lead at the head of my men to being spurned by society because i am poor the greatest crime in this country is poverty i may if i am fortunate some day resume my name you may perhaps meet me and if you please you may expose me that i should not be likely to do replied the widow but still i regret to see a person evidently intended for better things employed in so disreputable a profession i hardly know madam what is and what is not disreputable in this conventional world it is not considered disreputable to cringe to the vices of a court or to accept a pension wrung from the industry of the nation in return for base servility it is not considered disreputable to take tithes intended for the service of god and lavish them away at wateringplaces or elsewhere seeking pleasure instead of doing god service it is not considered disreputable to take fee after fee to uphold injustice to plead against innocence to pervert truth and to aid the devil it is not considered disreputable to gamble on the stock exchange or to corrupt the honesty of electors by bribes to doing which the penalty attached is equal to that decreed to the offence of which i am guilty all these and much more are not considered disreputable yet by all these are the moral bonds of society loosened while in mine we cause no guilt in others but still it is a crime a violation of the revenue laws and no more observe madam the english government encourage the smuggling of our manufactures to the continent at the same time that they take every step to prevent articles being smuggled into this country now madam can that be a crime when the head of the vessel is turned north which becomes no crime when she steers the opposite way there is a stigma attached to it you must allow that i grant you madam and as soon as i can quit the profession i shall no captive ever sighed more to be released from his chains but i will not leave it till i find that i am in a situation not to be spurned and neglected by those with whom i have a right to associate at this moment the steward was seen forward making signs to mrs lascelles who excused herself and went to him for the love of god madam said maddox as he appears to be friendly with you do pray find out how these cutlets are to be dressed the cook is tearing his hair and we shall never have any dinner and then it will all fall upon me and ishall be tossed overboard mrs lascelles desired poor maddox to wait there while she obtained the desired information in a few minutes she returned to him i have found it out they are first to be boiled in vinegar then fried in batter and served up with a sauce of anchovy and malaga raisins first fried in vinegar then boiled in batter and served up with almonds and raisins nono mrs lascelles repeated the injunction to the frightened steward and then returned aft and reentered into a conversation with pickersgill in which for the first time corbett now joined corbett had sense enough to feel that the less he came forward until his superior had established himself in the good graces of the ladies the more favourable would be the result in the mean time cecilia had gone down to her aunt who still continued to wail and lament the young lady tried all she could to console her and to persuade her that if they were civil and obedient they had nothing to fear civil and obedient indeed cried miss ossulton to a fellow who is a smuggler and a pirate i the sister of lord b never the presumption of the wretch that is all very well aunt but recollect we must submit to circumstances these men insist upon our dining with them and we must go or we shall have no dinner i sit down with a pirate never ill have no dinnerill starveill die but my dear aunt its the only chance we have of obtaining our release and if you do not do it mrs lascelles will think that you wish to remain with them mrs lascelles judges of other people by herself the captain is certainly a very wellbehaved handsome man he looks like a nobleman in disguise what an odd thing it would be aunt if this should be all a hoax a hoax child replied miss ossulton sitting up on the sofa cecilia found that she had hit the right nail as the saying is and she brought forward so many arguments to prove that she thought it was a hoax to frighten them and that the gentleman above was a man of consequence that her aunt began to listen to reason and at last consented to join the dinnerparty mrs lascelles now came down below and when dinner was announced they repaired to the large cabin where they found pickersgill and corbett waiting for them miss ossulton did not venture to look up until she heard pickersgill say to mrs lascelles perhaps madam you will do me the favour to introduce me to that lady whom i have not had the honour of seeing before certainly my lord replied mrs lascelles miss ossulton the aunt of this young lady mrs lascelles purposely did not introduce his lordship in return that she might mystify the old spinster i feel highly honoured in finding myself in the company of miss ossulton said pickersgill ladies we wait but for you to sit down ossulton take the head of the table and serve the soup miss ossulton was astonished she looked at the smugglers and perceived two welldressed gentlemanly men one of whom was apparently a lord and the other having the same family name it must be all a hoax thought she and she very quietly took to her soup the dinner passed off very pleasantly pickersgill was agreeable corbett funny and miss ossulton so far recovered herself as to drink wine with his lordship and to ask corbett what branch of their family he belonged to i presume its the irish branch said mrs lascelles prompting him exactly madam replied corbett have you ever been to torquay ladies inquired pickersgill no my lord answered mrs lascelles we shall anchor there in the course of an hour and probably remain there till tomorrow steward bring coffee tell the cook these cutlets were remarkably well dressed the ladies retired to the cabin miss ossulton was now convinced that it was all a hoax but said she i shall tell lord b my opinion of their practical jokes when he returns what is his lordships name who is on board he wont tell us replied mrs lascelles but i think i know it is lord blarney lord blaney you mean i presume said miss ossulton however the thing is carried too far cecilia we will go on shore at torquay and wait till the yacht returns with lord b i dont like these jokes they may do very well for widows and people of no rank now mrs lascelles was sorry to find miss ossulton so much at her ease she owed her no little spite and wished for revenge ladies will go very far to obtain this how far mrs lascelles would have gone i will not pretend to say but this is certain that the last innuendo of miss ossulton very much added to her determination she took her bonnet and went on deck at once told pickersgill that he could not please her or cecilia more than by frightening miss ossulton who under the idea that it was all a hoax had quite recovered her spirits talked of her pride and illnature and wished her to receive a useful lesson thus to follow up her revenge did mrs lascelles commit herself so far as to be confidential with the smuggler in return mrs lascelles i shall be able to obey you and at the same time to combine business with pleasure after a short conversation the yacht dropped her anchor at torquay it was then about two hours before sunset as soon as the sails were furled one or two gentlemen who resided there came on board to pay their respects to lord b and as pickersgill had found out from cecilia that her father was acquainted with no one there he received them in person asked them down in the cabin called for wine and desired them to send their boat away as his own was going on shore the smugglers took great care that the steward cook and ladys maid should have no communication with the guests one of them by corbetts direction being a sentinel over each individual the gentlemen remained about halfanhour on board during which corbett and the smugglers had filled the portmanteaus found in the cabin with the lace and they were put in the boat corbett then landed the gentlemen in the same boat and went up to the hotel the smugglers following him with the portmanteaus without any suspicion or interruption as soon as he was there he ordered posthorses and set off for a town close by where he had correspondents and thus the major part of the cargo was secured corbett then returned in the night bringing with him people to receive the goods and the smugglers landed the silks teas c with the same good fortune everything was out of the yacht except a portion of the lace which the portmanteaus would not hold pickersgill might easily have sent this on shore but to please mrs lascelles he arranged otherwise the next morning about an hour after breakfast was finished mrs lascelles entered the cabin pretending to be in the greatest consternation and fell on the sofa as if she were going to faint good heavens what is the matter exclaimed cecilia who knew very well what was coming oh the wretch he has made such proposals proposals what proposals what lord blaney cried miss ossulton oh hes no lord hes a villain and a smuggler and he insists that we shall both fill our pockets full of lace and go on shore with him mercy on me then it is no hoax after all and ive been sitting down to dinner with a smuggler sitting down madamif it were to be no more than thatbut we are to take his arm up to the hotel oh dear cecilia i am ordered on deck pray come with me miss ossulton rolled on the sofa and rang for phoebe she was in a state of great alarm a knock at the door come in said miss ossulton thinking it was phoebe when pickersgill made his appearance what do you want sir go out sir go out directly or ill scream it is no use screaming madam recollect that all on board are at my service you will oblige me by listening to me miss ossulton i am as you know a smuggler and i must send this lace on shore you will oblige me by putting it into your pockets or about your person and prepare to go on shore with me as soon as we arrive at the hotel you will deliver it to me and i then shall reconduct you on board of the yacht you are not the first lady who has gone on shore with contraband articles about her person me sir go on shore in that way no sir never what will the world say the hon miss ossulton walking with a smuggler no sir never yes madam walking arminarm with a smuggler i shall have you on one arm and mrs lascelles on the other and i would advise you to take it very quietly for in the first place it will be you who smuggle as the goods will be found on your person and you will certainly be put in prison for at the least appearance of insubordination we run and inform against you and further your niece will remain on board as a hostage for your good behaviour and if you have any regard for her liberty you will consent immediately pickersgill left the cabin and shortly afterwards cecilia and mrs lascelles entered apparently much distressed they had been informed of all and mrs lascelles declared that for her part sooner than leave her poor cecilia to the mercy of such people she had made up her mind to submit to the smugglers demands cecilia also begged so earnestly that miss ossulton who had no idea that it was a trick with much sobbing and blubbering consented when all was ready cecilia left the cabin pickersgill came down handed up the two ladies who had not exchanged a word with each other during cecilias absence the boat was ready alongsidethey went in and pulled on shore everything succeeded to the smugglers satisfaction miss ossulton frightened out of her wits took his arm and with mrs lascelles on the other they went up to the hotel followed by four of his boats crew as soon as they were shown into a room corbett who was already on shore asked for lord b and joined them the ladies retired to another apartment divested themselves of their contraband goods and after calling for some sandwiches and wine pickersgill waited an hour and then returned on board mrs lascelles was triumphant and she rewarded her new ally the smuggler with one of her sweetest smiles community of interest will sometimes make strange friendships chapter vii conclusion we must now return to the other parties who have assisted in the acts of this little drama lord b after paddling and paddling the men relieving each other in order to make head against the wind which was off shore arrived about midnight at a small town in west bay from whence he took a chaise on to portsmouth taking it for granted that his yacht would arrive as soon as if not before himself little imagining that it was in possession of the smugglers there he remained three or four days when becoming impatient he applied to one of his friends who had a yacht at cowes and sailed with him to look after his own we left the happygolucky chased by the revenue cutter at first the smuggler had the advantage before the wind but by degrees the wind went round with the sun and brought the revenue cutter to leeward it was then a chase on a wind and the revenue cutter came fast up with her morrison perceiving that he had no chance of escape let run the ankers of brandy that he might not be condemned but still he was in an awkward situation as he had more men on board than allowed by act of parliament he therefore stood on notwithstanding the shot of the cutter went over and over him hoping that a fog or night might enable him to escape but he had no such good fortuneone of the shot carried away the head of his mast and the happygoluckys luck was all over he was boarded and taken possession of he asserted that the extra men were only passengers but in the first place they were dressed in seamens clothes and in the second as soon as the boat was aboard of her appleboy had gone down to his gintoddy and was not to be disturbed the gentlemen smugglers therefore passed an uncomfortable night and the cutter going to portland by daylight before appleboy was out of bed they were taken on shore to the magistrate hautaine explained the whole affair and they were immediately released and treated with respect but they were not permitted to depart until they were bound over to appear against the smugglers and prove the brandy having been on board they then set off for portsmouth in the seamens clothes having had quite enough of yachting for that season mr ossulton declaring that he only wanted to get his luggage and then he would take care how he put himself again in the way of the shot of a revenue cruiser or of sleeping a night on her decks in the mean time morrison and his men were locked up in the jail the old man as the key was turned on him exclaiming as he raised his foot in vexation that cursed blue pigeon we will now return to the yacht about an hour after pickersgill had come on board corbett had made all his arrangements and followed him it was not advisable to remain at torquay any longer through fear of discovery he therefore weighed the anchor before dinner and made sail what do you intend to do now my lord said mrs lascelles i intend to run down to cowes anchor the yacht in the night and an hour before daylight have you in my boat with all my men i will take care that you are in perfect safety depend upon it even if i run a risk i should indeed be miserable if through my wild freaks any accident should happen to mrs lascelles or miss ossulton i am very anxious about my father observed cecilia i trust that you will keep your promise i always have hitherto miss ossulton have i not ours is but a short and strange acquaintance i grant it but it will serve for you to talk about long after i shall disappear as suddenly as i have comeyou will neither of you in all probability ever see me again the dinner was announced and they sat down to table as before but the elderly spinster refused to make her appearance and mrs lascelles and cecilia who thought she had been frightened enough did not attempt to force her pickersgill immediately yielded to these remonstrances and from that time she remained undisturbed in the ladies cabin meditating over the indignity of having sat down to table having drank wine and been obliged to walk on shore taking the arm of a smuggler and appear in such a humiliating situation the wind was light and they made but little progress and were not abreast of portland till the second day when another yacht appeared in sight and the two vessels slowly neared until in the afternoon they were within four miles of each other it then fell a dead calmsignals were thrown out by the other yacht but could not be distinguished and for the last time they sat down to dinner three days companionship on board of a vessel cooped up together and having no one else to converse with will produce intimacy and pickersgill was a young man of so much originality and information that he was listened to with pleasure he never attempted to advance beyond the line of strict decorum and politeness and his companion was equally unpresuming situated as they were and feeling what must have been the case had they fallen into other hands both cecilia and mrs lascelles felt some degree of gratitude towards him and although anxious to be relieved from so strange a position they had gradually acquired a perfect confidence in him and this had produced a degree of familiarity on their parts although never ventured upon by the smuggler as corbett was at the table one of the men came down and made a sign corbett shortly after quitted the table and went on deck i wish my lord you would come up a moment and see if you can make this flag out said corbett giving a significant nod to pickersgill excuse me ladies one moment said pickersgill who went on deck it is the boat of the yacht coming on board said corbett and lord b is in the sternsheets with the gentleman who was with him and how many men in the boatlet me seeonly four well let his lordship and his friend come when they are on the deck have the men ready in case of accident but if you can manage to tell the boats crew that they are to go on board again and get rid of them that way so much the better arrange this with adams and then come down againhis lordship must see us all at dinner pickersgill then descended and corbett had hardly time to give his directions and to resume his seat before his lordship and mr stewart pulled up alongside and jumped on deck there was no one to receive them but the seamen and those whom they did not know they looked round in amazement at last his lordship said to adams who stood forward what men are you belong to the yacht yer honour lord b heard laughing in the cabin he would not wait to interrogate the men he walked aft followed by mr stewart looked down the skylight and perceived his daughter and mrs lascelles with as he supposed hautaine and ossulton pickersgill had heard the boat rub the side and the sound of the feet on deck and he talked the more loudly that the ladies might be caught by lord b as they were he heard their feet at the skylight and knew that they could hear what passed and at that moment he proposed to the ladies that as this was their last meeting at table they should all take a glass of champagne to drink to their happy meeting with lord b this was a toast which they did not refuse maddox poured out the wine and they were all bowing to each other when his lordship who had come down the ladder walked into the cabin followed by mr stewart cecilia perceived her father the champagneglass dropped from her handshe flew into his arms and burst into tears who would not be a father mrs lascelles said pickersgill quietly seating himself after having first risen to receive lord b and pray whom may i have the honour of finding established here said lord b in an angry tone speaking over his daughters head who still lay in his arms by heavens yesstewart it is the smuggling captain dressed out even so my lord replied pickersgill you abandoned your yacht to capture me you left these ladies in a vessel crippled for want of men they might have been lost i have returned good for evil by coming on board with my own people and taking charge of them this night i expected to have anchored your vessel in cowes and have left them in safety by the cried stewart stop sir if you please cried pickersgill recollect you have once already attacked one who never offended oblige me by refraining from intemperate language for i tell you i will not put up with it recollect sir that i have refrained from that and also from taking advantage of you when you were in my power recollect sir also that the yacht is still in possession of the smugglers and that you are in no condition to insult with impunity my lord allow me to observe that we men are too hot of temperament to argue or listen coolly with your permission your friend and my friend and i will repair on deck leaving you to hear from your daughter and that lady all that has passed after that my lord i shall be most happy to hear anything which your lordship may please to say upon my word commenced mr stewart mr stewart interrupted cecilia ossulton i request your silence nay more if ever we are again to sail in the same vessel together i insist upon it your lordship will oblige me by enforcing miss ossultons request said mrs lascelles mr stewart was dumbfounded no wonder to find the ladies siding with the smuggler i am obliged to you ladies for your interference said pickersgill for although i have the means of enforcing conditions i should be sorry to avail myself of them i wait for his lordships reply lord b was very much surprised he wished for an explanation he bowed with hauteur everybody appeared to be in a false position even he lord b somehow or another had bowed to a smuggler pickersgill and stewart went on deck walking up and down crossing each other without speaking but reminding you of two dogs who both are anxious to fight but have been restrained by the voice of their masters corbett followed and talked in a low tone to pickersgill stewart went over to leeward to see if the boat was still alongside but it had long before returned to the yacht miss ossulton had heard her brothers voice but did not come out of the aftercabin she wished to be magnificent and at the same time she was not sure whether all was right phoebe having informed her that there was nobody with her brother and mr stewart and that the smugglers still had the command of the vessel after a while pickersgill and corbett went down forward and returned dressed in the smugglers clothes when they resumed their walk on the deck in the mean time it was dark the cutter flew along the coast and the needles lights were on the larboard bow the conversation between cecilia mrs lascelles and her father was long when all had been detailed and the conduct of pickersgill duly represented lord b acknowledged that by attacking the smuggler he had laid himself open to retaliation that pickersgill had shown a great deal of forbearance in every instance and after all had he not gone on board the yacht she might have been lost with only three seamen on board he was amused with the smuggling and the fright of his sister still more with the gentlemen being sent to cherbourg and much consoled that he was not the only one to be laughed at he was also much pleased with pickersgills intention of leaving the yacht safe in cowes harbour his respect to the property on board and his conduct to the ladies on the whole he felt grateful to pickersgill and where there is gratitude there is always good will but who can he be said mrs lascelles his name he acknowledges not to be pickersgill and he told me confidentially that he was of good family confidentially my dear mrs lascelles said lord b oh yes we are both his confidants are we not cecilia upon my honour mrs lascelles this smuggler appears to have made an impression which many have attempted in vain mrs lascelles did not reply to that remark but said now my lord you must decideand i trust you will to oblige ustreat him as he has treated us with the greatest respect and kindness why should you suppose otherwise replied lord b it is not only my wish but my interest so to do he may take us over to france tonight or anywhere else has he not possession of the vessel yes replied cecilia but we flatter ourselves that we have the command shall we call him down papa ring for maddox maddox tell mr pickersgill who is on deck that i wish to speak with him and shall be obliged by his stepping down into the cabin who my lord what him yes him replied cecilia laughing must i call him my lord now miss you may do as you please maddox but recollect he is still in possession of the vessel replied cecilia then with your lordships permission i will its the safest way the smuggler entered the cabin the ladies started as he appeared in his rough costume with his throat open and his loose black handkerchief he was the beau ideal of a handsome sailor your lordship wishes to communicate with me mr pickersgill i feel that you have had cause of enmity against me and that you have behaved with forbearance i thank you for your considerate treatment of the ladies and i assure you that i feel no resentment for what has passed my lord i am quite satisfied with what you have said and i only hope that in future you will not interfere with a poor smuggler who may be striving by a life of danger and privation to procure subsistence for himself and perhaps his family i stated to these ladies my intention of anchoring the yacht this night at cowes and leaving her as soon as she was in safety your unexpected presence will only make this difference which is that i must previously obtain your lordships assurance that those with you will allow me and my men to quit her without molestation after we have performed this service i pledge you my word mr pickersgill and i thank you into the bargain i trust you will allow me to offer some remuneration most certainly not my lord at all events mr pickersgill if at any other time i can be of service you may command me pickersgill made no reply surely mr pickersgill pickersgill how i hate that name said the smuggler musing i beg your lordships pardonif i may require your assistance for any of my unfortunate companions not for yourself mr pickersgill said mrs lascelles madam i smuggle no more for the pleasure i feel in hearing that resolution mr pickersgill said cecilia take my hand and thanks and mine said mrs lascelles half crying and mine too said lord b rising up pickersgill passed the back of his hand across his eyes turned round and left the cabin im so happy said mrs lascelles bursting into tears hes a magnificent fellow observed lord b come let us all go on deck you have not seen my aunt papa true ill go in to her and then follow you the ladies went upon deck cecilia entered into conversation with mr stewart giving him a narrative of what had happened mrs lascelles sat abaft at the taffrail with her pretty hand supporting her cheek looking very much a la juliette mrs lascelles said pickersgill before we part allow me to observe that it is you who have induced me to give up my profession why me mr pickersgill you said that you did not like it mrs lascelles felt the force of the compliment you said just now that you hated the name of pickersgill why do you call yourself so it was my smuggling name mrs lascelles and now that you have left off smuggling pray what may be the name we are to call you by i cannot resume it till i have not only left this vessel but shaken hands with and bid farewell to my companions and by that time mrs lascelles i shall be away from you but ive a great curiosity to know it and a ladys curiosity must be gratified you must call upon me some day and tell it me here is my address pickersgill received the card with a low bow and lord b coming on deck mrs lascelles hastened to meet him the vessel was now passing the bridge at the needles and the smuggler piloted her on as soon as they were clear and well inside the whole party went down into the cabin lord b requesting pickersgill and corbett to join him in a parting glass mr stewart who had received the account of what had passed from cecilia was very attentive to pickersgill and took an opportunity of saying that he was sorry that he had said or done anything to annoy him every one recovered his spirits and all was good humour and mirth because miss ossulton adhered to her resolution of not quitting the cabin till she could quit the yacht at ten oclock the yacht was anchored pickersgill took his leave of the honourable company and went in his boat with his men and lord b was again in possession of his vessel although he had not a ships company maddox recovered his usual tone and the cook flourished his knife swearing that he should like to see the smuggler who would again order him to dress cutlets a lombre chinoise the yacht had remained three days at cowes when lord b received a letter from pickersgill stating that the men of his vessel had been captured and would be condemned in consequence of their having the gentlemen on board who were bound to appear against them to prove that they had sunk the brandy lord b paid all the recognisances and the men were liberated for want of evidence it was about two years after this that cecilia ossulton who was sitting at her worktable in deep mourning for her aunt was presented with a letter by the butler it was from her friend mrs lascelles informing her that she was married again to a mr davenant and intended to pay her a short visit on her way to the continent mr and mrs davenant arrived the next day and when the latter introduced her husband she said to miss ossulton look cecilia dear and tell me if you have ever seen davenant before cecilia looked earnestly i have indeed cried she at last extending her hand with warmth and happy am i to meet with him again for in mr davenant she recognised her old acquaintance the captain of the happygolucky jack pickersgill the smuggler the end

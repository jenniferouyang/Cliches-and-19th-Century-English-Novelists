percival keene by captain marryat captain frederick marryat was born july and died august he retired from the british navy in in order to devote himself to writing in the following years he wrote books many of which are among the very best of english literature and some of which are still in print marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories he says somewhere that when he sat down for the days work he never knew what he was going to write he certainly was a literary genius percival keene was published in the nineteenth book to flow from marryats pen this etext was transcribed in by nick hodson and was reformatted in and again in percival keene by captain frederick marryat chapter one a few miles from the town of southampton there is an old mansionhouse which has been for centuries known as madeline hall in the possession of the de versely family it is a handsome building surrounded by a finely timbered park of some extent and what is more important by about acres of land which also appertain to it at the period in which i commence this history there resided in this mansion an elderly spinster of rank named the honourable miss delmar sister of the late lord de versely and aunt to the present earl and an honourable captain delmar who was the second son of the deceased nobleman this property belonged to the honourable miss delmar and was at her entire disposal upon her decease the honourable captain delmar at the time i am speaking of commanded a frigate employed upon what was designated channel service which in those days implied that the captain held a seat in the house of commons and that he voted with the ministry and further that his vote might when required be forthcoming the frigate was never seagoing except during the recess it must be admitted that hm ship paragon did occasionally get under weigh and remain cruising in sight of land for two or three days until the steward reported that the milk provided for the captains table was turning sour upon which important information the helm was immediately put up and the frigate in a case of such extreme distress would drop her anchor at the nearest port under her lee now as the paragon was constantly at spithead captain delmar was very attentive in visiting his aunt who lived at madeline hall illnatured people asserted because she had so fine an estate in her own gift certain it is that he would remain there for weeks which gave great satisfaction to the old lady who liked her nephew liked attention and was even so peculiar as to like sailors but it must be observed that there was another person at the mansion who also liked the captain liked attention and liked sailors this was miss arabella mason a very pretty young woman of eighteen years of age who constantly looked in the glass merely to ascertain if she had ever seen a face which she preferred to her own and who never read any novel without discovering that there was a remarkable likeness between the heroine and her pretty self miss arabella mason was the eldest daughter of the steward of the old lord de versely brother to the honourable miss delmar and was much respected by his lordship for his fidelity and his knowledge of business in the transaction of which he fell for he was felling trees and a tree fell upon him he left a widow and two daughters it was said that at his death mrs mason was not badly off as her husband had been very careful of his earnings mrs mason however did not corroborate this statement on the contrary she invariably pleaded poverty and the honourable miss delmar after lord de verselys death which happened soon after that of his stewardsent both the daughters to be educated at a country school where as everything that is taught is secondrate young ladies of course receive a secondrate education mrs mason was often invited by the honourable miss delmar to spend a month at madeline hall and used to bring her eldest daughter who had left school with her latterly however the daughter remained as a fixture and mrs mason received but an occasional invitation it may be inquired in what capacity miss arabella mason remained at the hall she was not a servant for her position in life was above that of a menial neither was she received altogether in the saloon as she was of too humble a grade to mix with gentry and nobility she was therefore betwixt and between a sort of humble companion in the drawingroom a cut above the housekeeper in the stillroom a fetcher and carrier of the honourable spinsters wishes a sort of link between the aristocratic old dame and her male attendants towards whom she had a sort of old maidish aversion however this position might be found useful to her mistress it must be admitted that it was a most unfortunate position for a young thoughtless and very pretty girl moreover who was naturally very lively very smart in repartee and very fond of being admired as the honourable captain delmar was very constant in his visits to his aunt it was but natural that he should pay some little attention to her humble companion by degrees the intimacy increased and at last there were reports in the servants hall that the captain and miss bella mason had been seen together in the evergreen walk and as the captains visits were continually repeated during the space of two years so did the scandal increase and people became more illnatured it was now seen that miss bella had been very often found in tears and the old butler and the older housekeeper shook their heads at each other like responsive mandarins the only person who was ignorant of the scandal afloat was the old lady spinster herself i must now introduce another personage the honourable captain delmar did not of course travel without his valet and this important personage had been selected out of the marine corps which had been drafted into the frigate benjamin keene for such was his name was certainly endowed with several qualities which were indispensable in a valet he was very clean in his person very respectful in his deportment and after the sovereign of great britain looked upon the honourable captain delmar as the greatest person in the world moreover benjamin keene although only a private marine was without exception one of the handsomest men that ever was seen and being equally as well made and well drilled as he was handsome in person he was the admiration of all the young women but nature who delights in a drawback had contrived to leave him almost without brains and further he was wholly uneducatedfor he was too stupid to learnhis faculties were just sufficient to enable him by constant drilling to be perfect in the manual exercise and mechanically to perform his duties as a valet ben always accompanied his master to the hall where the former was at one and the same time the admiration and laughter of all the servants it hardly need be observed that the clever and sprightly miss arabella mason considered ben as one much beneath her that is she said so on his first arrival at madeline hall but strange to say that two years afterwards just at the time that reports had been raised that she had been frequently discovered in tears there was a change in her manner towards him indeed some people insinuated that she was setting her cap at the handsome marine this idea it is true was ridiculed by the majority but still the intimacy appeared rapidly to increase it was afterwards asserted by those who find out everything after it has taken place that ben would never have ventured to look up to such an unequal match had he not been prompted to it by his master who actually proposed that he should marry the girl that such was the fact is undoubted although they knew it not and ben who considered the wish of his captain as tantamount to an order as soon as he could comprehend what his captain required of him stood up erect and raised his hand with a flourish to his head in token of his obedience shortly afterwards captain delmar again came over to madeline hall accompanied as usual by ben and the second day after their arrival it was made known to all whom it might concern that miss arabella mason had actually contracted a secret marriage with the handsome benjamin keene of course the last person made acquainted with this interesting intelligence was the honourable miss delmar and her nephew took upon himself to make the communication at first the honourable spinster bridled up with indignation wondered at the girls indelicacy and much more at her demeaning herself by marrying a private marine captain delmar replied that it was true that ben was only a private but that every common soldier was a gentleman by profession it was true that bella mason might have done betterbut she was his aunts servant and keene was his valet so that the disparity was not so very great he then intimated that he had long perceived the growing attachment talked of the danger of young people being left so much together hinted about opportunity and descanted upon morals and propriety the honourable miss delmar was softened down by the dexterous reasoning of her nephew she was delighted to find so much virtue extant in a sailor and after an hours conversation the married couple were sent for graciously pardoned and mrs keene after receiving a very tedious lecture received a very handsome present but if her mistress was appeased mrs keenes mother was not as soon as the intelligence was received old mrs mason set off for madeline hall she first had a closeted interview with her daughter and then with captain delmar and as soon as the latter was over she immediately took her departure without paying her respects to the mistress of the hall or exchanging one word with any of the servants this conduct gave occasion to more innuendoessome indeed ascribed her conduct to mortification at her daughters having made so imprudent a match but others exchanged very significant glances three weeks after the marriage the parliament having been prorogued the admiral of the port considered that he was justified in ordering the frigate out on a cruise ben keene of course accompanied his master and it was not until three months had passed away that the frigate returned into port as usual the honourable captain delmar as soon as he had paid his respects to the admiral set off to visit his aunt accompanied by his benedict marine on his arrival he found that everything appeared to be in great confusion indeed an event was occurring which had astonished the whole household the butler made a profound bow to the captain the footmen forgot their usual smirk when he alighted captain delmar was ushered in solemn silence into the drawingroom and his aunt who had notice of his arrival received him with a stiff prim air of unwonted frigidity with her arms crossed before her on her white muslin apron my dear aunt said captain delmar as she coldly took his proffered hand what is the matter the matter is this nephew replied the old ladythat marriage of your marine and bella mason should have taken place six months sooner than it did this is a wicked world nephew and sailors im afraid are marines you should say in this instance my dear aunt replied captain delmar insinuatingly i must confess that neither sailors nor marines are quite so strict as they ought to be however ben has married her come my dear aunt allow me to plead for them although i am very much distressed that such an event should take place in your house i think added he after a pause i shall give mr keene seven dozen at the gangway for his presumption as soon as i return on board that wont mend the matter nephew replied miss delmar ill turn her out of the house as soon as she can be moved and ill flog him as soon as i get him on board rejoined the captain i will not have your feelings shocked and your mind harassed in this way by any impropriety on the part of my followersmost infamous shamefulabominableunpardonable interjected the captain walking the quarterdeck up and down the room the honourable miss delmar continued to talk and the honourable captain to agree with her in all she said for an hour at least when people are allowed to give vent to their indignation without the smallest opposition they soon talk it away such was the case with the honourable miss delmar when it was first announced that bella keene was safely in bed with a fine boy the offended spinster turned away from the communication with horror when her own maid ventured to remark that it was a lovely baby she was ordered to hold her tongue she would not see the suffering mother and the horrid marine was commanded to stay in the kitchen lest she should be contaminated by meeting him on the stairs but every day softened down her indignation and before a fortnight was over the honourable miss delmar had not only seen but admired the baby and at last decided upon paying a visit to the mother who was now sufficiently recovered to undergo a lecture of about two hours length in which the honourable spinster commented upon her indecency indiscretion inconsiderateness incorrectness indecorum incontinence and indelicacy pointing out that her conduct was most inexcusable iniquitous and most infamous the honourable miss delmar having had such a long innings then gave it up because she was out of breath bella who waited patiently to make her response and who was a very clever girl then declared with many tears that she was aware that her conduct was inexcusable her faults had been involuntary and her sorrow was inexpressible her inexperience and her infatuation her only apology that her infelicity at her mistresss displeasure would inevitably increase her sufferings assured her that she was not incorrigible and that if her mistress would only indulge her with forgiveness as she hoped to inherit heaven she would never incur her anger by committing the same fault again satisfied with this assurance the honourable miss delmar softened down and not only forgave but actually took the child into her lap that bella might read the bible which she had presented her with reader the child who had this great honour conferred upon him who actually laid in the immaculate lap on the apron of immaculate snowy whiteness of the immaculate honourable miss delmar was no other person than the narrator of this historyor if you please it the hero of this tale that my mother had so far smoothed things pretty well must be acknowledged but it was to be presumed that her husband might not be pleased at so unusual an occurrence and already the sneers and innuendoes of the servants hall were not wanting it appeared however that an interview had taken place between ben and captain delmar shortly after my making my appearance what occurred did not transpire but this is certain that upon the marines return to the kitchen one of the grooms who ventured to banter him received such a sound thrashing from ben that it put an end to all further joking as ben had taken up the affair so seriously it was presumed that if there had been anticipation of the hymeneal rites he was himself the party who had been hasty and that now he was married he was resolved to resent any impertinent remarks upon his conduct at all events the question now became one of less interest as the scandal was of less importance and as ben had made known his determination to resent any remarks upon the subject not a word more was said at all events when he was present in due time i was christened and so completely was my mother reinstalled in the good graces of her mistress that as captain delmar had volunteered to stand my sponsor the honourable miss delmar gave the necessary female security at the particular request of my mother the captain consented that i should bear his own christian name and i was duly registered in the church books as percival keene chapter two there is no security in this world a dissolution of parliament took place and on the following election the honourable captain delmars constituents not being exactly pleased at the total indifference which he had shown to their interests took upon themselves to elect another member in his stead who as captain delmar had previously done promised everything and in all probability would follow the honourable captains example by performing nothing the loss of his election was followed up by the loss of his ship his majestys government not considering it necessary that captain delmar now that he had leisure to attend to his professional duties should retain his command the frigate therefore was paid off and recommissioned by another captain who had friends in parliament as ben keene belonged to the marine corps he could not of course remain as valet to captain delmar but was ordered with the rest of the detachment to the barracks at chatham my mother although she was determined that she would not live at barracks was not sorry to leave the hall where she could not fail to perceive that she was from her imprudent conduct no longer treated with the respect or cordiality to which she had been previously accustomed she was most anxious to quit a place in which her disgrace was so well known and captain delmar having given her his advice which coincided with her own ideas and also a very munificent present to enable her to set up housekeeping took his departure from the hall my mother returned to her room as the wheels of his carriage rattled over the gravel of the drive and many were the bitter tears which she shed over her unconscious boy the following day the honourable miss delmar sent for her as usual commenced with a tedious lecture which as before was wound up at parting with a handsome present the day after my mother packed up her trunks and with me in her arms set off to chatham where we arrived safely and immediately went into furnished lodgings my mother was a clever active woman and the presents which she had at different times received amounted to a considerable sum of money over which her husband had never ventured to assert any claim indeed i must do ben keene the justice to say that he had the virtue of humility he felt that his wife was in every way his superior and that it was only under peculiar circumstances that he could have aspired to her he was therefore submissive to her in everything consenting to every proposal that was made by her and guided by her opinion when therefore on her arrival at chatham she pointed out how impossible it would be for one brought up as she had been to associate with the women in the barracks and that she considered it advisable that she should set up some business by which she might gain a respectable livelihood ben although he felt that this would be a virtual separation a mensa et thoro named no objections having thus obtained the consent of her husband who considered her so much his superior as to be infallible my mother after much cogitation resolved that she would embark her capital in a circulating library and stationers shop for she argued that selling paper pens and sealingwax was a commerce which would secure to her customers of the better class accordingly she hired a house close to the barracks with a very goodsized shop below painting and papering it very smartly there was much taste in all her arrangements and although the expenses of the outlay and the first years rent had swallowed up a considerable portion of the money she had laid by it soon proved that she had calculated well and her shop became a sort of lounge for the officers who amused themselves with her smartness and vivacity the more so as she had a talent for repartee which men like to find in a very pretty woman in a short time my mother became quite the rage and it was a mystery how so pretty and elegant a person could have become the wife of a private marine it was however ascribed to her having been captivated with the very handsome person and figure of her husband and having yielded to her feelings in a moment of infatuation the ladies patronised her circulating library the officers and gentlemen purchased her stationery my mother then added gloves perfumery canes and lastly cigars to her previous assortment and before she had been a year in business found that she was making money very fast and increasing her customers every day my mother had a great deal of tact with the other sex she was full of merriment and fond of joking consequently a great favourite towards her own sex her conduct was quite the reverse she assumed a respectful prudish air blended with a familiarity which was never offensive she was therefore equally popular with her own sex and prospered in every sense of the word had her husband been the least inclined to have asserted his rights the position which she had gained was sufficient to her reducing him to a state of subjection she had raised herself unaided far above him he saw her continually chatting and laughing with his own officers to whom he was compelled to make a respectful salute whenever they passed by him he could not venture to address her or even to come into the shop when his officers were there or it would have been considered disrespectful towards them and as he could not sleep out of barracks all his intercourse with her was to occasionally slink down by the area to find something better to eat than he could have in his own mess or obtain from her an occasional shilling to spend in beer ben the marine found at last that somehow or another his wife had slipped out of his hands that he was nothing more than a pensioner on her bounty a slave to her wishes and a fetcher and carrier at her command and he resigned himself quietly to his fate as better men have done before chapter three i think that the reader will agree with me that my mother showed in her conduct great strength of character she had been compelled to marry a man whom she despised and to whom she felt herself superior in every respect she had done so to save her reputation that she had been in error is true but situation and opportunity had conspired against her and when she found out the pride and selfishness of the man to whom she was devoted and for whom she had sacrificed so muchwhen her ears were wounded by proposals from his lips that she should take such a step to avoid the scandal arising from their intimacywhen at the moment that he made such a proposition and the veil fell down and revealed the heart of man in its selfishness it is not to be wondered that with bitter tears arising from wounded love anger and despair at her hopeless position she consented after having lost all she valued what did she care for the future it was but one sacrifice more to make one more proof of her devotion and obedience but there are few women who like my mother would have recovered her position to the extent that she did had she not shown such determination had she consented to have accompanied her husband to the barracks and have mixed up with the other wives of the men she would have gradually sunk down to their level to this she could not consent having once freed herself from her thraldom he immediately sunk down to his level as she rose up to a position in which if she could not ensure more than civility and protection she was at all events secure from insult and illtreatment such was the state of affairs when i had arrived at the important age of six years a comiclooking laughing urchin petted by the officers and as fall of mischief as a tree full of monkeys my mothers business had so much increased that about a year previous to this date she had found it necessary to have some one to assist her and had decided upon sending for her sister amelia to live with her it was however necessary to obtain her mothers consent my grandmother had never seen my mother since the interview which she had had with her at madeline hall shortly after her marriage with ben the marine latterly however they had corresponded for my mother who was too independent to seek her mother when she was merely the wife of a private marine now that she was in flourishing circumstances had first tendered the olive branch which had been accepted as soon as my grandmother found that she was virtually separated from her husband as my grandmother found it rather lonely at the isolated house in which she resided and amelia declared herself bored to death it was at last agreed that my grandmother and my aunt amelia should both come and take up their residence with my mother and in due time they arrived milly as my aunt was called was three years younger than my mother very pretty and as smart as her sister perhaps a little more demure in her look but with more mischief in her disposition my grandmother was a cross spiteful old woman she was very large in her person but very respectable in her appearance i need not say that miss amelia did not lessen the attraction at the circulating library which after her arrival was even more frequented by the officers than before my aunt milly was very soon as fond of me as i was of mischief indeed it is not to be wondered at for i was a type of the latter i soon loved her better than my mother for she encouraged me in all my tricks my mother looked grave and occasionally scolded me my grandmother slapped me hard and rated me continually but reproof or correction from the two latter were of no avail and the former when she wished to play any trick which she dared not do herself employed me as her agent so that i obtained the whole credit for what were her inventions and i may safely add underwent the whole blame and punishment but that i cared nothing for her caresses cakes and sugarplums added to my natural propensity more than repaid me for the occasional severe rebukes of my mother and the vindictive blows i received from the long fingers of my worthy grandmother moreover the officers took much notice of me and it must be admitted that although i positively refused to learn my letters i was a very forward child my great patron was a captain bridgeman a very thin elegantlymade man who was continually performing feats of address and activity occasionally i would escape with him and go down to the mess remain at dinner drink toasts and standing on the messtable sing two or three comic songs which he had taught me i sometimes returned a little merry with the bumpers which made my mother very angry my old grandmother to hold up her hands and look at the ceiling through her spectacles and my aunt milly as merry as myself before i was eight years old i had become so notorious that any prank played in the town any trick undiscovered was invariably laid to my account and many were the applications made to my mother for indemnification for broken windows and other damage done too often i grant with good reason but very often when i had been perfectly innocent of the misdemeanour at last i was voted a common nuisance and every one except my mother and my aunt milly declared that it was high time that i went to school one evening the whole of the family were seated at tea in the back parlour i was sitting very quietly and demurely in a corner a sure sign that i was in mischief and so indeed i was for i was putting a little gunpowder into my grandmothers snuffbox which i had purloined just that she might smell powder as they say at sea without danger of life or limb when the old woman addressed my mother bella is that boy never going to school it will be the ruin of him what will be the ruin of him mother rejoined my aunt milly going to school hold your nonsense child you are as bad as the boy himself replied granny boys are never ruined by education girls sometimes are whether my mother thought that this was an innuendo reflecting upon any portion of her own life i cannot tell but she replied very tartly youre none the worse for my education mother or you would not be sitting here very true child replied granny but recollect neither would you have married a marinea private marine bella while your sister looks up to the officers ay continued the old woman leaving off her knitting and looking at her daughter and is likely to get one too if she plays her cards wellthat lieutenant flat cant keep out of the shop my granny having at this moment given me an opportunity to replace her snuffbox i did not fail to profit by it and as i perceived her knittingpin had dropped on the floor i stuck it into the skirt of her gown behind so that whenever she looked for it it was certain ever to be behind her mr flat is of a very respectable family i hear say continued my grandmother and a great fool interrupted my mother i hope milly wont listen to him hes an officer replied my granny not a private well mother i prefer my private marine for i can make him do as i please if hes a private im commanding officer and intend so to be as long as i live well well bella let us say no more on the old score but that boy must go to school deary me i have dropped my needle my grandmother rose and turned round and round looking for her needle which strange to say she could not find she opened her snuffbox and took a pinch to clear her optics deary me why whats the matter with my snuff and where can that needle be child come and look for the needle dont be sticking there in that corner i thought proper to obey the order and pretended to be very diligent in my search catching aunt millys eye i pointed to the knittingneedle sticking in the hind skirts of my grandmothers gown and then was down on my knees again while my aunt held her handkerchief to her mouth to check her laughter a minute afterwards ben the marine first tapped gently and then opened the door and came in for at that late hour the officers were all at dinner and the shop empty there are three parcels of books for you to take said my mother but youve plenty of time so take down the teathings and get your tea in the kitchen before you go you havent got a shilling bella about you i want some baccy said ben in his quiet way yes heres a shilling ben but dont drink too much beer replied my mother deary me what can have become of my needle exclaimed my grandmother turning round here it is maam said ben who perceived it sticking in her skirt thats percivals work ill answer for it my granny received the needle from ben and then turned to me you goodfornothing boy so you put the needle there did you pretending to look for it all the while you shall go to school sir that you shall you said a needle granny i was looking for a needle you didnt say your knittingpin i could have told you where that was yes yes those who hide can find to school you go or ill not stay in the house ben took the teatray out of the room he had been well drilled in and out of barracks ill go down in the kitchen to father cried i for i was tired of sitting still no you wont sir said my mother you naughty boy the kitchen is not the place for you and if ever i hear of you smoking a pipe again captain bridgeman smokes replied i yes sir he smokes cigars but a child like you must not smoke a pipe and now come here sir said my granny who had the lid of her snuffbox off and held it open in her hand what have you been doing with my snuff why granny have i had your snuffbox the whole day how should i knowa boy like you with every finger a fishhook i do believe you have i only wish i could find you out i had fresh snuff this morning perhaps they made a mistake at the shop mother said aunt milly they are very careless well i cant tell i must have some more i cant take this throw it in the fire granny said i and ill run with the box and get it full again well i suppose its the best thing i can do replied the old woman who went to the grate and leaning over poured the snuff out on the live coals the result was a loud explosion and a volume of smoke which burst out of the grate into her facethe dinner and lappets singed her spectacles lifted from her nose and her face as black as a sweeps the old woman screamed and threw herself back in so doing she fell over the chair upon which she had been sitting and somehow or another tripped me up and lay with all her weight upon me i had been just attempting to make my escape during the confusionfor my mother and milly were equally frightenedwhen i found myself completely smothered by the weight of my now almost senseless granny and as i have before mentioned she was a very corpulent woman had i been in any other position i should not have suffered so much but i had unfortunately fallen flat on my back and was now lying with my face upwards pressed upon by the broadest part of the old womans body my nose was flattened and my breath completely stopped how long my granny might have remained there groaning i cannot tell probably as i was somewhat a spoiled child before this it might have ended in her completely finishing me but she was roused up from her state of half syncope by a vigorous attack from my teeth which in the agony of suffocation i used with preternatural force of jaw from one so young i bit right through everything she had on and as my senses were fast departing my teeth actually met with my convulsive efforts my granny roused by the extreme pain rolled over on her side and then it was that my mother and aunt who supposed that i had made my escape from the room discovered me lifeless and black in the face they ran to me but i still held on with my teeth nor could i be separated from my now screaming relative until the admission of fresh air and a plentiful sprinkling of cold water brought me to my senses when i was laid on the sofa utterly exhausted it certainly was a narrow escape and it may be said that the biter was nearly bit as for my granny she recovered her fright and her legs but she did not recover her temper she could not sit down without a pillow on the chair for many days and although little was said to me in consequence of the danger i had incurred yet there was an evident abhorrence of me on the part of the old woman a quiet manner about my mother and a want of her usual hilarity on the part of my aunt which were to me a foreboding of something unpleasant a few days brought to light what was the result of various whisperings and consultations it was on a fine monday morning that ben made his appearance at an unusually early hour my cap was put on my head my cloak over my shoulders ben took me by the hand having a covered basket in the other and i was led away like a lamb to the butcher as i went out there was a tear in the eyes of my aunt milly a melancholy over the countenance of my mother and a twinkling expression of satisfaction in my grandmothers eyes which even her spectacles could not conceal from me the fact was my grandmother had triumphed and i was going to school chapter four as soon as i was clear of the door i looked up into bens face and said father where are we going well replied he i am going to take you to school school what am i going to school for replied i for biting your grandmother i expect in the first place and to get a little learning and a good deal of flogging if what they say is true i never was at school myself what do you learn and why are you flogged you learn to read and to write and to count i cant do either mores the pity and you are flogged because without flogging little boys cant learn anything this was not a very satisfactory explanation i made no further inquiries and we continued our way in silence until we arrived at the school door there was a terrible buzz inside ben tapped the door opened and a volume of hot air burst forth all the fresh air having been consumed in repeating the fresh lessons for the day ben walked up between the forms and introduced me to the schoolmaster whose name was mr thadeus ogallagher a poor scholar from ireland who had set up an establishment at halfaguinea a quarter for day scholars he was reckoned a very severe master and the children were kept in better order in his school than in any other establishment of the kind in the town and i presume that my granny had made inquiries to that effect as there were one or two schools of the same kind much nearer to my mothers house ben who probably had a great respect for learning in consequence of his having none himself gave a military salute to mr ogallagher saying with his hand still to his hat a new boy sir come to school oh by the powers dont i know him cried mr ogallagher its the young gentleman who bit a hole in his grandmother master keene as they call him keen teeth at all events lave him with me and thats his dinner in the basket i presume lave that too hell soon be a good boy or it will end in a blowup ben put down the basket turned on his heel and left the schoolroom and me standing by the throne of my future pedagoguei say throne because he had not a desk as schoolmasters generally have but a sort of square dais about eighteen inches high on which was placed another oblong superstructure of the same height serving him for a seat both parts were covered with some patched and torn old drugget and upon subsequent examination i found them to consist of three old claret cases without covers which he had probably picked up very cheap two of them turned upside down so as to form the lower square and the third placed in the same way upside down upon the two lower mr ogallagher sat in great dignity upon the upper one with his feet on the lower being thus sufficiently raised upon an eminence to command a view of the whole of his pupils in every part of the school he was not a tall man but very square built with carroty hair and very bushy red whiskers to me he appeared a most formidable person especially when he opened his large mouth and displayed his teeth when i was reminded of the sign of the red lion close to my mothers house i certainly never had been before so much awed during my short existence as i was with the appearance of my pedagogue who sat before me somewhat in the fashion of a roman tribune holding in his hand a short round ruler as if it were his truncheon of authority i had not been a minute in the school before i observed him to raise his arm away went the ruler whizzing through the air until it hit the skull of the lad for whom it was intended at the other end of the schoolroom the boy who had been talking to his neighbour rubbed his poll and whined why dont you bring back my ruler you spalpeen said mr ogallagher be quick johnny target or it will end in a blowup the boy who was not a little confused with the blow sufficiently recovered his senses to obey the order and whimpering as he came up returned the ruler to the hands of mr ogallagher that tongue of yours will get you into more trouble than it will business i expect johnny target its an unruly member and requires a constant ruler over it johnny target rubbed his head and said nothing master keene said he after a short pause did you see what a tundering tump on the head that boy got just now and do you know what it was for no replied i wheres your manners you animal no if you plase for the future you must not forget to say no sir or no mr ogallagher dye mind menow say yeswhat yes what yes what you little ignoramus say yes mr ogallagher and recollect as the parish clerk says this is the last time of asking yes mr ogallagher ah now you see theres nothing like coming to schoolyouve learnt manners already and now to go back again as to why johnny target had the rap on the head which brought tears into his eyes ill just tell you it was for talking you see the first thing for a boy to learn is to hold his tongue and that shall be your lesson for the day youll just sit down there and if you say one word during the whole time you are in the school it will end in a blowup that means on the present occasion that ill skin you alive as they do the eels which being rather keen work will just suit your constitution i had wit enough to feel assured that mr ogallagher was not to be trifled with so i took my seat and amused myself with listening to the various lessons which the boys came up to say and the divers punishments inflictedfew escaped at last the hour of recreation and dinner arrived the boys were dismissed each seized his basket containing his provisions or ran home to get his meal with his parents i found myself sitting in the schoolroom teteatete with mr ogallagher and feeling very well inclined for my dinner i cast a wistful eye at my basket but i said nothing mr ogallagher who appeared to have been in thought at last said mr keene you may now go out of school and scream till youre hoarse just to make up for lost time may i take my dinner sir inquired i is it your dinner you maneto be sure you may but first ill just look into the basket and its contents for you see mr keene theres some victuals that dont agree with larning and if you eat them youll not be fit for your work when your playhours are over whats easy of digestion will do but whats bad for little boys stomachs may get you into a scrape and then it will end in a blowup that is youll have a taste of the ferrule or the rodtwo assistants of mine to whom ive not yet had the pleasure of introducing youall in good time if what ive hear of you be true you and they will be better acquainted afore long mr ogallagher then examined the contents of my basket my aunt milly had taken care that i should be well provided there was a large paper of beef sandwiches a piece of bread and cheese and three or four slices of seedcake mr ogallagher opened all the packages and after a pause said now master keene dye think you would ever guess how i came by all my larning and what i fed upon when it was pumped into me then ill tell you it was dry bread with a little bit of cheese when i could get it and that wasnt often bread and cheese is the food to make a scholar of ye and mayhap one slice of the cake maynt much interfere so take them and run away to the playground as fast as you can and dye hear me master keene recollect your grace before meatfor what we have received the lord make us truly thankful now off wid you the rest of the contents are confiscated for my sole use and your particular benefit mr ogallagher grinned as he finished his oration and he looked so much like a wild beast that i was glad to be off as fast as i could i turned round as i went out of the door and perceived that the sandwiches were disappearing with wonderful rapidity but i caught his eye it was like that of a tigers at his meal and i was off at redoubled speed chapter five as soon as i gained the playground which was in fact nothing more than a small piece of waste land to which we had no more claim than any other people i sat down by a post and commenced my dinner off what mr ogallagher had thought proper to leave me i was afraid of him it is true for his severity to the other boys convinced me that he would have little mercy upon me if i dared to thwart him but indignation soon began to obtain the mastery over my fears and i began to consider if i could not be even with him for his barefaced robbery of my dinner and then i reflected whether it would not be better to allow him to take my food if i found out that by so doing he treated me well and i resolved at all events to delay a little the hour of play was now over and a bell summoned us all to school i went in with the others and took my seat where mr ogallagher had before desired me as soon as all was silent my pedagogue beckoned me to him now mr keene said he youll be so good as to lend me your ears that is to listen while i talk to you a little bit dye know how many roads there are to larning hold your tongue i ask you because i know you dont know and because im going to tell you there are exactly three roads the first is the eye my jewel and if a lad has a sharp eye like yours its a great deal that will get into his head by that road youll know a thing when you see it again although you maynt know your own fatherthats a secret only known to your mother the second road to larning young spalpeen is the ear and if you mind all people say and hear all you can youll gain a great many truths and just ten times as much more in the shape of lies you see the wheat and the chaff will come together and you must pick the latter out of the former at any seasonable future opportunity now we come to the third road to larning which is quite a different sort of road because you see the two first give us little trouble and we trot along almost whether we will or not the third and grand road is the head itself which requires the eye and the ear to help it and two other assistants which we call memory and application so you see we have the visual then the aural and then the mental roadsthree hard words which you dont understand and which i shant take the trouble to explain to such an animal as you are for i never throw away pearls to swine as the saying is now then mr keene we must come to another part of our history as there are three roads to larning so there are three manes or implements by which boys are stimulated to larn the first is the ruler which you saw me shy at the thick skull of johnny target and you seed what a rap it gave him well then the second is the ferrulea thing you never heard of perhaps but ill show it you here it is continued mr ogallagher producing a sort of flat wooden ladle with a hole in the centre of it the ruler is for the head as you have seen the ferrule is for the hand you have seen me use the ruler now ill show you what i do with the ferrule you tommy goskin come here sir tommy goskin put down his book and came up to his master with a good deal of doubt in his countenance tommy goskin you didnt say your lesson well today yes i did mr ogallagher replied tommy you said i did yourself well then sir you didnt say it well yesterday continued mr ogallagher yes i did sir replied the boy whimpering and is it you who dares to contradict me cried mr ogallagher at all events you wont say it well tomorrow so hold out your right hand poor tommy held it out and roared lustily at the first blow wringing his fingers with the smart now your left hand sir fair play is a jewel always carry the dish even tommy received a blow on his left hand which was followed up with similar demonstrations of suffering there sir you may go now said mr ogallagher and mind you dont do it again or else therell be a blowup and now master keene we come to the third and last which is the birch for the tailhere it ishave you ever had a taste no sir replied i well then you have that pleasure to come and come it will i dont doubt if you and i are a few days longer acquainted let me see here mr ogallagher looked round the school as if to find a culprit but the boys aware of what was going on kept their eyes so attentively to their books that he could not discover one at last he singled out a fat chubby lad walter puddock come here sir walter puddock came accordingly evidently he gave himself up for lost walter puddock i just have been telling master keene that youre the best latin scholar in the whole school now sir dont make me out to be a liardo me creditor by the blood of the ogallaghers ill flog ye till youre as thin as a herring whats the latin for a cocked hat as the roman gentlemen wore with their togeys walter puddock hesitated a few seconds and then without venturing a word of remonstrance let down his trousers see now the guilty tief he knows whats coming shame upon you walter puddock to disgrace your preceptor so and make him tell a lie to young master keene wheres phil mooney come along sir and hoist walter puddock its no larning that i can drive into you phil but its sartain sure that by your manes i drive a little into the other boys walter puddock as soon as he was on the back of phil mooney received a dozen cuts with the rod well laid on he bore it without flinching although the tears rolled down his cheeks there walter puddock i told you it would end in a blowup go to your dictionary you dirty blackguard and do more credit to your education and superior instruction from a certain person who shall be nameless mr ogallagher laid the rod on one side and then continued now master keene ive just shown you the three roads to larning and also the three implements to persuade little boys to larn if you dont travel very fast by the three first why you will be followed up very smartly by the three lasta nods as good as a wink to a blind horse any day and one thing more you little spalpeen mind that theres more mustard to the sandwiches tomorrow or else it will end in a blowup now youve got the whole theory of the art of tuition master keene please the pigs well commence with the practice tomorrow my worthy pedagogue did not address me any more during that day the school broke up at five and i made haste home thinking over all that had passed in the schoolroom my granny and mother were both anxious to know what had passed the first hoped that i had been flogged the second that i had not but i refused to communicate i assumed a haughty indifferent air for i was angry with my mother and as for my grandmother i hated her aunt milly however when we were alone did not question me in vain i told her all that had passed she bade me be of good heart and that i should not be illtreated if she could help it i replied that if i were illtreated i would have my revenge somehow or another i then went down to the barracks to the rooms of captain bridgeman and told him what had occurred he advised me to laugh at the ruler the ferrule and the rod he pointed out to me the necessity of my going to school and learning to read and write at the same time was very indignant at the conduct of mr ogallagher and told me to resist in every way any injustice or tyranny and that i should be sure of his support and assistance provided that i did pay attention to my studies fortified by the advice and protection of my two great friends i made up my mind that i would learn as fast as i could but if treated ill that i would die a martyr rather than yield to oppression at all events i would if possible play mr ogallagher a trick for every flogging or punishment i received and with this laudable resolution i was soon fast asleep too fast even to dream chapter six when my aunt milly called me in the morning that i might be up and have my breakfast in time for school i felt as if two years had passed over my head during the last twentyfour hours i had never witnessed tyranny until the day before and my blood was heated with indignation i felt myself capable of anything and everything my anger was about as great towards my mother and grandmother for having sent me to such a place as it was against mr ogallagher instead of going up and kissing my mother i paid no attention to either her or my grandmother much to the mortification of the former and surprise of the latter who said in a very cross manner wheres your manners child why dont you say good morning because i have not been long enough at school to learn manners granny come and kiss me before you go my child said my mother no mother you have sent me to school to be beat and i never will kiss you again naughty goodfornothing boy exclaimed my granny what a bad heart you must have no that he has not cried my aunt milly sister should have inquired what sort of a school it was before she sent him i made every inquiry replied my granny he cant play tricks there wont i cried i but i will and not only there but here ill be even with you all yes ill be even with you granny if i die for it why you audacious wretch ive great a mind to i dare say you have but recollect i can bite youd better be quiet granny or as the master says it will end in a blowup only hear the little wretch said my granny lifting up her hands i shall see you hanged yet you ungrateful child im not ungrateful replied i throwing my arms round millys neck and kissing her with fervour i can love those who love me then you dont love me said my mother reproachfully i did yesterday but i dont now but its time for me to go aunt is my basket ready i dont want father to take me to school i can do without him and when i dont choose to go any more i wont recollect that mother so saying i seized my basket and quitted the room there was a long consultation i found after my departure my mother when my aunt had informed her of mr ogallaghers conduct wished to remove me instantly my grandmother insisted upon it that there was not a word of truth in what i had said and threatened that if i did not remain at that very school she would leave chatham and take my aunt with her as my mother could not part with aunt milly the consequence was that my grandmother gained the day i arrived in good time and took my seat near my master i preferred doing this as i had had a long conversation with captain bridgeman who told me that although mr ogallagher had put the ruler down as punishment number the ferrule number and the birch as number and of course they were considered to be worse as the number rose that he considered it to be the very contrary as he had had them all well applied when he was at school he ordered me therefore never to hold out my hand to the ferrule by which refusal i should of course be flogged but he assured me that the birch especially when it is given often was a mere nothing now i considered that the surest way to avoid the ruler was to sit close to my master who could then have no pretence for sending it at my head the fact was i had determined to save the more noble portions of my body and leave mr ogallagher to do what he pleased with the other to do him justice he lost no time come here mr keene said he wheres your manners why dont you say good morning to your preceptor can you read at all no sir dye know your letters some of themi think i do sir some of themi suppose about two out of sixandtwenty its particular attention thats been paid to your education i perceive youve nothing to unlearn anyhow thats something now sir do you think that a classical scholar and a gentleman born like me is to demane myself by hearing you puzzle at the alphabet youre quite mistaken mr keene you must gain your first elements secondhand so wheres thimothy ruddel you timothy ruddel youll just teach this young master keene his whole alphabet and take care at the same time that you know your own lessons or it will end in a blowup and you master keene if you have not larnt your whole alphabet perfect by dinner time why youll have a small taste of number just as a hint to whats coming next go along you little ignorant blackguard and you timothy ruddel look out for a taste of number if you dont larn him and yourself all at once and at the same time i was very well pleased with this arrangement i had resolved to learn and i was doubly stimulated to learn now to save poor timothy ruddel from an unjust punishment in the three hours i was quite perfect and timothy ruddel who was called up before me was also able to say his lesson without a blunder very much to the disappointment of mr ogallagher who observed so youve slipped through my fingers have you this time master timothy never mind ill have you yet and moreover theres master keene to go through the fiery furnace just before dinner time i was called up with my memory of many of the letters and the assistance i had received from timothy ruddel i felt very confident what letters that sir said mr ogallagher a b c d e you little blackguard ill dodge you you think to escape you v x p o much to mr ogallaghers surprise i said them all without one mistake instead of commendation i received abuse by all the powers exclaimed my pedagogue but everything seems to go wrong today my hand has been completely idle this will never do didnt you tell me mr keene that you didnt know your letters i said i knew some of them sir if my memory is correct mr keene you told me that you knew two out of twentysix no sir you said that thats just as much as to tell me your preceptor a classical scholar and a milesian gentleman to boot that i lie for which i intend to have satisfaction mr keene i assure you youre guilty in two counts as they say at the old bailey where youll be called up to some of these days as sure as you stand there one count is in telling me a lie in saying you did not know your alphabet when its quite clear that you did and secondly in giving me the lie by stating that i said what you said you thought to escape me but youre mistaken mr keene so now if you please we will just have a taste of number hould out your hand mr keene dye hear me sir hould out your hand but this i positively refused to do you wont wont you well then we must increase the punishment for our contempt of court and at once commence with number which we intended to reserve till tomorrow come along phil mooney theres fresh mate for you to carry and come out number heres fresh ground for you to travel over phil mooney and the birch soon made their appearance i was hoisted by the one and scourged by the other the first taste of the birch is anything but agreeable i could only compare it to the dropping of molten lead i tried all i could to prevent crying out but it was impossible and at last i roared like a mad bull and i was as mad as a bull and as dangerous could i have picked up any weapon at the moment that i was dropped from the shoulders of phil mooney it would have gone hard with mr ogallagher my rage was greater than my agony i stood when i had been landed my chest heaving my teeth set fast and my apparel still in disorder the school was dismissed and i was left alone with the savage pedagogue who immediately took up my basket and began to rummage the contents make yourself decent mr keene and dont be shocking my modesty and taking away my appetite did you mention the mustard as i desired you upon my faith but youre a nice boy and do justice to the representations of your grandmother and when you see her you may tell her that i did not forget the promise she exacted from me you forgot all about the mustard you little blackguard if phil mooney was here i would give you another taste to freshen your memory for tomorrow however tomorrow will do as well if the mistakes not corrected here take your victuals and good appetite to you you little monster of iniquity mr ogallagher tossed me some bread but this time reserved the cheese for his own eating i had adjusted my dress and i therefore left the schoolroom i could not sit down without pain so i leant against a post the bread remained in my hand untouched had it been the greatest delicacy in the world i could not have tasted a morsel i was giddy from excess of feeling my thoughts were rapidly chasing each other when i heard a voice close to me i looked round it was walter puddock who had been flogged the day before never mind keene said he kindly it hurts at first but the more you get it the less you care for it i dont mind it a bit now i cries because he goes on flogging till you do and its no use having more than you can help i didnt deserve it replied i thats not necessary youll get it as we all do whether you deserve it or not well ill try to deserve it in future replied i clenching my fist ill be even with him why what can you do wait a little and youll see said i walking away for an idea had come into my head which i wished to follow up soon afterwards the bell rang and we returned to the schoolroom i was put under the tuition of another boy and took care to learn my lesson whether it was that he was tired with the exercise for he flogged and ferruled a dozen during that afternoon or that he thought that my morning dose had been sufficient i received no more punishment on that day chapter seven as soon as school was dismissed i went straight to the rooms of captain bridgeman and told him how i had been treated as soon as he heard it he exclaimed this is really too bad i will go with you and i will consult with your aunt amelia it so happened that aunt milly was alone in the shop when we arrived and after a detail of what had passed she told captain bridgeman that my grandmother had put me to that school out of feelings of illwill for the tricks i had played and had threatened that if i were removed she would leave chatham and take her away with her my mother required assistance in the shop and was afraid to affront my grandmother who was a very dictatorial positive old woman and would certainly keep her resolution but that rather than i should be treated in such a barbarous manner she would insist upon my mother taking me away or would herself leave the place it would never do for you to leave us miss amelia replied captain bridgeman there are but few attractions in this place and we cannot spare you the whole corps would go into deep mourning i dont want to leave the school interrupted i i would not leave it till i am revenged for all the world now ill tell you what i want to doand do it i will if he cuts me to pieces he eats my sandwiches and tells me if theres not more mustard tomorrow hell flog me he shall have plenty of mustard but he shall have something else what can i put into the sandwiches so as to half kill him not a bad idea my little percival said captain bridgeman ill just ask the doctor how much calomel a man may take without a coroners inquest being required yes that will do nicely said my aunt ill take care he shall have mustard enough not to perceive it well ill go to the barracks and be back directly said captain bridgeman and im ready for the flogging as soon as the sandwiches are down his throat replied i laughing i dont care a fig for it captain bridgeman soon returned with forty grains of calomel which he delivered into aunt millys hands that is as much as we dare give the strongest man without running great danger well try the effect of that upon him and if he dont improve i think i shall go up to the school myself and threaten him as for that replied aunt milly im sure that sister if she hears whats going on as she cannot take percival away will order her husband ben to go up and thrash him not a bad idea miss amelia well try that if we find it necessary at all events well see who can persecute most granny has told him to treat me ill said i thats very clear from what he said never mind ill make her sorry for it oh percival you must not do anything to granny said aunt milly looking very archly i must not hear anything of the kind the next morning i set off with a full conviction that i should be flogged before night and notwithstanding that as full of joy as if i was going to the fair the morning passed as usual i said my lesson but not very well i was thinking so much of my anticipated revenge that i could not pay attention to my teacher who was as usual one of the boys master keene said mr ogallagher well let the account stand over till the evening and then ill give you a receipt in full i may have one or two lines to add to it before the sun goes down youll not escape me this time anyhow the boys went out at the dinner hour leaving me as before to wait for my basket after the tyrant had helped himself i stood by him in silence while he was rummaging its contents now mr keene ill see if youve remembered my particular injunction relative to the mustard i told my aunt to put more mustard sir replied i humbly it she that cuts the sandwiches well then if your aunt has not complied with your request see if i dont flay you alive you little imp of abomination the sandwiches were pulled out of the paper and tasted down on your knees mr keene and thank all the blessed saints that your aunt has saved you from at least onehalf of what i intended to administer to you this blessed afternoon for she has doubled the mustard you tief said mr ogallagher speaking with his mouth as full as it could hold down went sandwich after sandwich until they had all disappeared oh what joy was mine i could have tossed up my cap and leapt in the air having received the bread and cheese for he permitted me to have the latter on this occasion i went out and enjoyed my meal delighted with mr ogallaghers having fallen into the trap i had laid for him the bell summoned us in and all went on as usual for the first two hours when i thought mr ogallagher changed countenance and looked very pale he continued however to hear the lessons until at last i perceived him pass his hand up and down and across his stomach as if he had had a twinge a few minutes afterwards he compressed his thick lips and then put his hands to his abdomen ah he begins to feel it now thought i and sure enough he did for the pain increased so rapidly that he lost all patience and vented his feelings by beating with his ruler on the heads of the whole class of boys standing up before him till one or two dropped down stunned with the blows at last he dropped the ruler and pressing both hands to his stomach he rolled himself backwards and forwards and then twisted and distorted his legs till he could bear the pain no longer and he gave vent to a tremendous irish howlgrinning and grinding his teeth for a few seconds and then howling again writhing and twisting in evident agonywhile the perspiration ran off his forehead och murder im poisoned sure lord save my sinful soul ohoh oh eheheh mercy mercy mercy mercy mercy oh holy st patrick im kilt entirelyand so subdued was he at last by the pain that he burst out into a flood of tears crying and roaring like a child again the paroxysms came onmurder murder murder shrieked the wretch at the highest pitch of his voice so that he was heard at some distance and some of the neighbours came in to inquire what was the matter mr ogallagher was now in a fainting state and leaning against the table he could merely say in a low voice a doctorquicka doctor the neighbours perceiving how ill he was led him out of the schoolrooms into his own apartment one going for a doctor and the others telling the boys they might all go home a notice of which they gladly availed themselves i need hardly say that i made all the haste i could to communicate the successful result of my trick to milly and captain bridgeman the medical man who was summoned gave mr ogallagher some very active medicine which assisted to rid him of the calomel of his having taken which of course the medical man was ignorant the violence of the dose was however so great and left him in such a state that mr ogallagher could not leave his room for three days nor resume his seat in the school until a week had elapsed during which i remained at home plotting still further mischief mr ogallagher resumed his occupations and i was again sent off to school when i entered the schoolroom i found him looking very pale and cadaverous as soon as he saw me his lips were drawn apart and he showed his large white teeth reminding me of the grinning of a hyena he did not however say anything to me my studies were resumed i said my lesson perfectly but was fully prepared for punishment i was however agreeably disappointed he did not punish either me or any of the other boys i afterwards found out the reason was that although necessity compelled him to reopen his school as soon as he could he was too weak to undergo the fatigue of following up his favourite diversion when the dinnerhour arrived and the boys were dismissed i waited patiently to see what he would do with my basket which stood beside him take your basket and eat your dinner master keene said he walking out of the schoolroom into his own apartments i could not help saying wont you have the sandwiches sir he turned round and gave me a look so penetrating and so diabolical that i felt sure that he knew to whom he had been indebted for his late severe illness from this day forward mr og never interfered with the contents of my basket and i had my dinner all to myself the shock which had been given to his constitution was so great that for three or four months he may be said to have crawled to his school room and i really began to think that the affair would turn out more serious than was intended but gradually he regained his strength and as he recovered his vigour so did he resume his severity but i was a great gainer during the three or four months of quiet which reigned during mr ogallaghers convalescence since i have been grown up i have often thought and am indeed confirmed in my opinion that we lose rather than gain by being educated at too early an age commence with one child at three years and with another at seven years old and in ten years the one whose brain was left fallow even till seven years old will be quite as far if not further advanced than the child whose intellect was prematurely forced at the earlier age this is a fact which i have since seen proved in many instances and it certainly was corroborated in mine in six months i could read and write very fairly and had commenced arithmetic true i was stimulated on by the advice of captain bridgeman the love i bore my aunt milly and the hatred which i had for my master which made me resolve that i would not deserve punishment on that score it was in may that i administered the dose to mr ogallagher in september he was quite well again and the ruler the ferrule and the rod were triumphantly at work it is useless to say how often i was punished for it was every day always once sometimes twice i became completely callous to it nay laughed at it but my mind was ever at work upon some mischief in the way of retaliation i put little pancakes of cobblers wax on mr ogallaghers throne and he had the pleasure of finding himself stuck fast by the breeches when he rose up to punish i anointed the handle of the ferrule and rod with birdlime put dead cats under the claret cases which composed his seat of authority so that the smell would drive him distracted before he found it out i drew up with a squirt all the ink which was in the inkstands fixed in the writingdesks so as not to be taken out of the sockets and made good the deficiency with water which put him to no little expense i once made him almost frantic by rubbing his handkerchief which always laid by his side and with which he was accustomed to wipe his face every five minutes for he was profuse in his perspiration with what is called cowitch not being aware of what was the cause he wiped his face more and more until he was as red as a peony and the itching became intolerable on such occasions he never inquired who was the party but called me and phil mooney i on the other hand never said a word in way of expostulation i took my flogging which was as severe as he could give it as a matter of course quite satisfied with the exchange as walter puddock had told me and as i have no doubt the eton boys will confirm after a certain quantity of flagellations the skin becomes so hard as to make the punishment almost a matter of indifference and so i found it so passed the time until the month of november when i was fully enabled to pay off my worthy pedagogue for all that i was indebted to him chapter eight the boys had been saving up all their money to purchase fireworks for the celebrated th of novembera day on which it was said that certain persons finding it impossible to reform the lords and commons had determined to get rid of them at once why they have not been in similar danger every year since the first attempt was made i know not certain it is that it is the only reform measure that can ever be effectual guy fawkes and his confederates whether popish or protestant from the disregard of human life certainly proved themselves the founders of a party still existing whose motto is measures and not men but to proceed mr ogallagher had never before attempted to interfere with the vested rights of urchins on that day being however in a most particular irascible humour instead of a whole he made it known that there would only be a half holiday and we were consequently all called in for morning lessons instead of carrying about as we had intended the effigy of the only true reformer that ever existed in this country this made us all very sulky and discontented in the first place and our anxiety to get out of school was so great that the lessons were not very perfect in the second the ferrule and rod were called out and liberally administered but what was our horror and dismay when mr ogallagher about an hour before dinner announced to us that all the squibs and crackers with which our pockets were crammed were to be given up immediately and that as we had not said our lessons well there would be no halfholiday the whole school were in mute despair one by one were the boys summoned up to the throne of mr ogallagher and their pockets searched by phil mooney who emptied them of their pyrotechnical contents all of which were deposited on the dais of mr ogallaghers throne which i have before observed was composed of two empty claret cases turned upside down surmounted by another on which mr ogallagher sat all three covered with old green baize by the time that the whole school had been rifled the heap of fireworks was very considerable and mr ogallagher to prevent any of them being recovered by the boys lifted up the claret case on which he sat and which was on the top of the other two and desired phil mooney to put them all underneath it this was done mr ogallagher resumed his seat and the lessons continued till the dinner hour arrived but alas not the halfholiday or the fireworks the boys went out some mournful some angry some sulky some frightened a few a very few declaiming against such injustice i was in a rage my blood boiled at last my invention came to my aid and without considering the consequences i determined how to act as it was an hour and a half before school would commence i hastened home and having spent all my money begged aunt milly to give me some she gave me a shilling and with that i bought as much gunpowder as i could procure more than a quarter of a pound i then returned to the school looked into the schoolroom and found it empty i quickly raised up the claret case under which the fireworks had been placed put the powder under it leaving only sufficient for a very small train which would not be perceived in the green baize covering having so done i left the schoolroom immediately and rejoined my companions i had a piece of touchwood as all the boys had to let off their fireworks with and this i lighted and left in a corner until the bell should summons us into school oh how my heart beat when i heard the sound so full was i of anxiety lest my project should fail once more we were all assembled mr ogallagher surveying with the smile of a demon the unhappy and disappointed faces of the boys was again perched upon his throne the rod on one side the ferrule on the other and the ruler that dreaded truncheon of command clenched in his broad fist i had the touchwood lighted and concealed in my hand gradually i moved downwards until at last unperceived by mr ogallagher i was behind him and close to my train of gunpowder i gave one look to ascertain if he had observed me his eye was roving over the school for some delinquent to throw his ruler at fearful that he might turn round to me i no longer hesitated and the touchwood was applied to the train ignorant as i was of the force of gunpowder it was with astonishment mingled with horror that i beheld in a second the claret case rise up as if it had wings and mr ogallagher thrown up to the ceiling enveloped in a cloud of smoke the crackers and squibs fizzing and banging while the boys in the school uttered a yell of consternation and fear as they rushed from from the explosion and afterwards tumbling over one another made their escape from the schoolroom the windows had all been blown out with a terrible crash and the whole schoolroom was now covered by the smoke there i stood in silent dismay at the mischief which i had done the squibs and crackers had not however all finished popping before i heard the howling of mr ogallagher who had fallen down upon the centre schoolroom table i was still in the schoolroom halfsuffocated yet not moving away from where i stood when the neighbours who had been alarmed by the explosion and the cries of the boys rushed in and perceiving only me and mr ogallagher who still howled they caught hold of us both and bore us out in their arms it was high time for the schoolroom was now on fire and in a few minutes more the flames burst out of the windows while volumes of smoke forced through the door and soon afterwards the roof the engines were sent for but before they could arrive or water be procured the whole tenement was so enveloped in flames that it could not be saved in an hour the locale of our misery was reduced to ashes they had put me on my legs as soon as we got clear of the schoolroom to ascertain whether i was hurt and finding that i was not they left me i never shall forget what my sensations were when i beheld the flames and volumes of smoke bursting out the hurry and bustle and confusion outside the working of the engines the troops marched up from the barracks the crowd of people assembled and the ceaseless mingling of tongues from every quarter and all this is my doing thought imine all mine i felt delighted that i had no partner or confederate i could at all events keep my own secret i did however feel some anxiety as to mr ogallagher for much as i detested him i certainly had no intention to kill him so after a time i made inquiries and found that he was alive and in no danger although very much bruised and somewhat burnt no one could explain how the catastrophe occurred further than that mr ogallagher had collected all the squibs and crackers from the boys and that they had exploded somehow or anothermost people said that it served him right my grandmother shook her head and said yes yes gunpowder will go off but and she looked at meit requires a match to be put to it i looked up very innocently but made no reply mr ogallaghers favourite expression to wit that it would end in a blowup proved as far as his school was concerned literally true he had not the means of procuring another suitable tenement in chatham and as soon as he had recovered from the injuries he had received he quitted the town it was not until he had left that i ventured to make known to captain bridgeman and my aunt milly the trifling share i had in the transaction and they perceiving the prudence of keeping my secret desired me on no account to let it be known to any one else chapter nine as soon as it was ascertained that mr ogallagher was gone my grandmother insisted upon my being sent to another school and on this occasion my mother made the inquiries herself and i was despatched to one much nearer home and being treated well not only played fewer tricks but advanced rapidly in my education so rapidly indeed that my grandmother began to think that i was not so bad a boy as i used to be as she treated me more kindly i felt less inclined to teaze her although the spirit of mischief was as undiminished as ever and was shown in various ways i may as well here observe that out of the many admirers of my aunt milly there were only two who appeared to be at all constant in their attention one was lieutenant flat who was positively smitten and would have laid his pay and person at her feet had he received anything like encouragement but my aunt disliked him in the first place and moreover had a very strong feeling towards captain bridgeman mr flat was certainly a very finelooking soldier being tall erect and wellmade but he was at the same time not overbrilliant he was as an officer the very sort of person my father ben was as a private but the other party captain bridgeman did not come forward he appeared to be in doubt and not at all able to make up his mind the fact was that my mother being married to a private made any match with the sister objectionable to the whole corps as it would be derogatory that one sister should be the wife of a private and the other of an officer ben would have been able to say my brotherinlaw the captain of my division which would never have done and this captain bridgeman felt and therefore resisted as well as he could the inroads which my aunts beauty and mirth had made into his heart my aunt was exactly a person to suit captain bridgeman as a helpmate had it not been for this unfortunate alliance of my mothers lieutenant flat was too stupid and indifferent to the opinion of the other officers to care anything about what they thought he would have married milly long before but my aunt who had made up her mind to marry an officer did not yet despair of obtaining the captain and although she would not positively dismiss lieutenant flat she merely kept him as a sort of reserve to fall back upon when every other chance was gone i should like if i possibly could to give the reader some idea of my mothers circulatinglibrary and sort of universal commodity shop it was a lowwindowed building one story high but running a long way back where it was joined to a small parlour in which we generally sat during the day as it was convenient in case of company or customers the little parlour having a glass door which permitted us to look into the shop in the front windows on one side were all the varieties of tapers sealingwax inkstands and every kind of stationery backed by childrens books leather writingcases prints caricatures and tonbridge ware in the other windows were ribbons caps gloves scarfs needles and other little articles in demand by ladies and which they required independent of their milliners at the entrance were sticks and canes on the counter a case of gold and more moderatepriced trinkets on the shelves of the millinery side were boxes of gloves ribbons buttons etcetera on the opposite side perfumes cigars toothbrushes combs scented soaps and other requisites for the toilet about ten feet on each side of the shop was occupied with the above articles the remainder of the shelves were reserved for the circulatinglibrary at the back of the shop were some seats round a small table on which was laid the newspaper of the day and on each side of the parlourdoor were hoops bats balls traps skittles and a variety of toys for children my mother usually attended to the millinery and my aunt milly to what might be termed the gentlemens side of the shop the remainder of the goods and circulatinglibrary were in the hands of both there were few hours of the day in which the chairs at the counter and round the table were not taken possession of by some one or another either reading the paper or a book or talking to pass away the time in fact it was a sort of rendezvous where all who met knew each other and where the idle of our own sex used to repair to get rid of their time captain bridgeman and mr flat were certainly the two most constantly to be found there although few of the marine officers were a day without paying us a visit such was the locale to describe the company will be more difficult but i will attempt it my mother remarkably nicely dressed is busy opening a parcel of new books just arrived my aunt milly behind the counter on the gentlemens side pretending to be working upon a piece of muslin about five inches square mr flat sitting near the table fallen back in his chair apparently watching the flies on the ceiling captain bridgeman a very goodlooking man very slight but extremely active is sitting at the counter opposite to where my aunt is standing a small black cane with a silver head to it in his hand and his gloves peculiarly clean and wellfitting he has an eye as sharp as an eagles a slight hook to his nose thin lips and very white teeth his countenance is as full of energy and fire as that of lieutenant flat is heavy and unmeaning miss amelia if i may take the liberty said captain bridgeman pointing with his cane to the bit of muslin she is employed upon what are you making its too small for any part of a ladys dress it is quite large enough for a cuff captain bridgeman a cuff then you are making a cuff i presume indeed she is not captain bridgeman replies my mother it is only to keep herself out of mischief she spoils a bit like that every week and thats why it is so small captain bridgeman it would be a pity to spoil a larger piece i really was not aware that such a mere trifle would keep you out of mischief said the captain you know replied aunt milly that idleness is the root of all evil captain bridgeman flat do you hear that says captain bridgeman what replies flat that idleness is the root of all evil what an evildisposed person you must be i was thinking replied flat i suspect its only lately youve taken to that who or what were you thinking about well i believe i was thinking how long it would be before dinner was ready thats very rude mr flat you might have said that you were thinking about me replied my aunt well so i was at first and then i began to think of dinnertime dont be offended miss amelia flat pays you a great compliment in dividing his attentions but i really wish to know why ladies will spoil muslin in such a predetermined manner will you explain that mrs keene yes captain bridgeman a piece of work is very valuable to a woman especially when she finds herself in company with gentlemen like you it saves her from looking down or looking at you when you are talking nonsense it prevents your reading in her eyes what is passing in her mind or discovering what effect your words may have upon her it saves much awkwardness and very often a blush sometimes a woman hardly knows which way to look sometimes she may look any way but the right now a bit of muslin with a needle is a remedy for all that for she can look down at her work and not look up till she thinks it advisable i thank you for your explanation madam i shall always take it as a great compliment if i see a lady very busy at work when im conversing with her but you may flatter yourself captain bridgeman replied my mother the attention to her work may arise from perfect indifference or from positive annoyance it saves the trouble of making an effort to be polite and pray may i inquire miss amelia what feeling may cause your particular attention to your work at this present moment perhaps in either case to preserve my selfpossession replied amelia or perhaps captain bridgeman i may prefer looking at a piece of muslin to looking at a marine officer thats not very flattering replied the captain if you spoil the muslin youre determined not to spoil me the muslin is of little value said amelia softly walking to the other side of the shop and turning over the books mr flat said my mother your subscription to the library is out last month i presume i can put your name down again well i dont know i never read a book replied mr flat yawning thats not at all necessary mr flat said my mother in most businesses there are sleeping partners besides if you dont read you come here to talk which is a greater enjoyment still and luxuries must be paid for well ill try another quarter replied mr flat and then and then what said my aunt milly smiling well i dont know says flat is that clock of yours right mrs keene it is but i am fearful that your thoughts run faster than the clock mr flat you are thinking of the dressbugle for dinner no i was not then you were thinking of yourself no i wasnt mrs keene said flat rising and walking out of the shop ill tell you said he turning round as he went out what i was thinking of mrs keene not of myselfi was thinking of my bull pup my mother burst out a laughing as the lieutenant disappeared i was not far wrong when i said he was thinking of himself said she for a calf is a sort of bull pup at this sally captain bridgeman laughed and danced about the shop at last he said poor flat miss amelia hes desperately in love with you thats more than i am with him said amelia calmly here two ladies came in captain bridgeman made a most polite bow i trust mrs handbell is quite well and miss handbelli hardly need ask the question with the charming colour you have captain bridgeman you appear to live in this library i wonder mrs keene dont take you into partnership if i were not honoured with the custom of mrs handbell and other ladies i fear that my shop would have little attraction for gentlemen replied my mother with a courtesy mrs keene is quite correct in her surmise miss handbell said captain bridgeman now that i have seen you i shall not think my morning thrown away if report says true captain bridgeman replied mrs handbell you would be quite as often here even if no ladies were to be customers of mrs keene mrs keene have you any of that narrow french ribbon left i think i have madam it was off this piece was it not yes but i really dont know exactly how much i require perhaps you will measure it and allow me to return what is left certainly madam will you take it with you or shall i send it i wish for it directly will you be very long in measuring it for i ought to be home now perhaps youll have the kindness to measure what you take off yourself madam replied my mother and then you need not wait you put confidence in me i observe mrs keene replied mrs handbell well i will do you justice my mother smiled most graciously put the piece of ribbon in paper and handed it to mrs handbell who bowing to captain bridgeman quitted the shop i wonder whether you would trust me in that way said captain bridgeman to my mother i dont think i should amelia says you will help yourself to cigars and that she is sure you cheat when you count them does she really say that well i did think that if there was any one who would have upheld my character it would have been miss amelia perhaps captain bridgeman she is getting tired of so doing or tired of me mrs keene which would be worse still here comes a fair young ladymiss evans if i mistake not i believe she is a good customer to your library she reads a great deal and is therefore only a customer to the library ladies who are fond of reading are seldom fond of working good morning miss evans said captain bridgeman you come for more food for the mind i presume miss evans gave a bob and turned to my mother have you anything new mrs keene i have brought back the three volumes of godolphin yes miss i have some books down today while miss evans was selecting from the new books enter mr jones mr smith and mr claville of the marine corps for cigars amelia comes out to attend themthey purchase a few articles and are talking very loud when three more ladies enter the shop all for books it being now about three oclock the customers and loungers come in fast captain bridgeman saunters away in company with his brother officers other parties enter who are succeeded by fresh claimants for books or the other articles to be procured in the repository this demand continues till about five oclock when the library becomes empty i come home from school my father slinks in from barracks and my mother and sister return to the back parlour where they find my grandmother as usual very busy with her knitting such is a fair sample of what took place at our shop every succeeding day my mother made few bad debts and rapidly added to her savings my aunt milly still balancing between the certainty of lieutenant flat and the chance of captain bridgeman and i dividing my time and talents between learning and contriving mischief chapter ten about six months after i had blown up the school of mr ogallagher the company to which my father ben belonged was ordered afloat again and shortly afterwards sailed for the east indies in the redoubtable that my mother was very much pleased at his departure i do not scruple to assert but whether she ever analysed her feelings i cannot pretend to say i rather think that all she wished was that the chapter of accidents would prevent bens reappearance as she was ashamed of him as a husband and felt that he was an obstacle to her sisters advancement so one fine day ben wished us all good bye my mother was very generous to him as she could well afford to be i rather think that ben himself was not sorry to go for stupid as he was he must have felt what a cypher he had become being treated not only by my mother but by everybody else even by me as a sort of upper servant it so happened that about a month after bens departure captain delmar had through the interest of his uncle lord de versely been appointed to a ship which was lying in the medway and he came down to chatham to join her he had no idea that my mother was there for he had lost sight of her altogether and had it not been for me might very probably have left the town without having made the discovery among other amusements i had a great partiality for a certain bull pup mentioned by lieutenant flat in the former chapter and which he had made me a present of the pup was now grown up and i had taught it many tricks but the one which afforded me most amusement of course at other peoples expense was that i had made out of oakum a sham pigtail about a foot and a half long very strong and think with an iron hook at the upper end of it the sham tail i could easily hook on to the collar of any ones coat from behind without their perceiving it and bob had been instructed by me whenever i told him to fetch it and not before to jump up at the tail wherever it might be and hang on to it with all the tenacity of the race as it may be supposed this was a great source of mirth in the barracks it was considered a good joke and was much applauded by captain bridgeman but it was not considered a good joke out of the barracks and many an old woman had i already frightened almost out of her senses by affixing the tail to any portion of the back part of her dress it so happened that one afternoon as i was cruising about with bob at my heels i perceived the newlyarrived captain delmar in all the pomp of pride of full uniform parading down the street with a little middy at his heels and i thought to myself law how i should like to hang my tail to his fine coat if i only dared the impulse had become so strong that i actually had pulled up my pinafore and disengaged the tail ready for any opportunity but i was afraid that the middy would see me captain delmar had passed close to me the middy at his heels was passing and i thought all chance was gone when suddenly captain delmar turned short round and addressed the little officer asking him whether he had brought the orderbook with him the middy touched his hat and said no upon which captain delmar began to inflict a most serious lecture upon the lad for forgetting what he had forgotten himself and i again passed by this was an opportunity i could not resist while the captain and middy were so well employed giving and receiving i fixed my oakum tail to the collar of the captains goldlaced coat and then walked over to the other side of the street with bob at my heels the middy being duly admonished captain delmar turned round again and resumed his way upon which i called bob who was quite as ready for the fun as i was and pointing to the captain said fetch it bob my companion cleared the street in three or four bounds and in a few seconds afterwards made a spring up the back of captain delmar and seizing the tail hung by it with his teeth shaking it with all his might as he hung in the air captain delmar was to use a sailors term completely taken aback indeed he was nearly capsized by the unexpected assault for a short time he could not discover what it was at last by turning his head over his shoulder and putting his hand behind him he discovered who his assailant was just at that time i called out mad dog mad dog and captain delmar hearing those alarming words became dreadfully frightened his cocked hat dropped from his head and he took to his heels as fast as he could running down the street with bob clinging behind him the first open door he perceived was that of my mothers library he burst in nearly upsetting captain bridgeman who was seated at the counter talking to aunt milly crying out help help as he turned round his sword became entangled between his legs tripped him up and he fell on the floor this unhooked the tail and bob galloped out of the shop bearing his prize to me who with the little middy remained in the street convulsed with laughter bob delivered up the tail which i again concealed under my pinafore and then with a demure face ventured to walk towards my mothers house and going in at the back door put master bob in the washhouse out of the way the little middy who had picked up the captains hat giving me a wink as i passed him as much as to say i wont inform against you in the meantime captain delmar had been assisted to his legs by captain bridgeman who well knew who had played the trick and who as well as aunt milly had great difficulty in controlling his mirth merciful heaven what was it was the animal mad has it bitten me exclaimed captain delmar falling back in his chair in which he had been seated by captain bridgeman i really do not know replied captain bridgeman but you are not hurt sir apparently nor indeed is your coat torn what dogwhose dog can it beit must be shot immediatelyi shall give ordersi shall report the case to the admiral may i ask for a glass of water oh mr dott youre there sir how came you to allow that dog to fasten himself on my back in that way if you please said the middy presenting his cocked hat to the captain i did draw my dirk to kill him but you ran away so fast that i couldnt catch you very well sir you may go down to the boat and wait for orders replied the captain at this moment my mother who had been dressing herself made her first appearance coming out of the back parlour with a glass of water which aunt milly had gone in for perceiving a goldlaced captain she advanced all smiles and courtesies until she looked in his face and then she gave a scream and dropped the tumbler on the floor much to the surprise of captain bridgeman and also of aunt milly who not having been at the hall was not acquainted with the person of captain delmar just at this moment in came i looking as demure as if as the saying is butter would not melt in my mouth and certainly as much astonished as the rest at my mothers embarrassment but she soon recovered herself and asked captain delmar if he would condescend to repose himself a little in the back parlour when my mother let the tumbler fall the captain had looked her full in the face and recognised her and in a low voice said excessively strangeso very unexpected he then rose up from the chair and followed my mother into the back room who can it be said aunt milly to captain bridgeman in a low tone i suppose it must be the new captain appointed to the calliope i read his name in the papersthe honourable captain delmar it must be him replied milly for my sister was brought up by his aunt mrs delmar no wonder she was surprised at meeting him so suddenly percival you naughty boy continued milly shaking her finger at me it was all your doing oh aunt milly you should have seen him run replied i laughing at the thought id recommend you not to play with post captains said captain bridgeman or you may get worse than you give mercy on us exclaimed he looking at me full in the face whats the matter said aunt milly captain bridgeman leant over the counter and i heard him whisper did you ever see such a likeness as between the lad and captain delmar milly blushed a little nodded her head and smiled as she turned away captain bridgeman appeared to be afterwards in a brown study he tapped his boot with his cane and did not speak about a quarter of an hour passed during which captain delmar remained with my mother in the parlour when she opened the door and beckoned me to come in i did so not without some degree of anxiety for i was afraid that i had been discovered but this doubt was soon removed captain delmar did me the honour to shake hands with me and then patted my head saying he hoped i was a good boy which being compelled to be my own trumpeter i very modestly declared that i was my mother who was standing up behind lifted up her eyes at my barefaced assertion captain delmar then shook hands with my mother intimating his intention of paying her another visit very soon and again patting me on the head quitted the parlour and went away through the shop as soon as captain delmar was gone my mother turned round and said you naughty mischievous boy to play such pranks ill have that dog killed without you promise me never to do so again do what again mother none of your pretended innocence with me ive been told of the pigtail that bob pulls at thats all very well at the barracks with the marines sir but do you know who it is that you have been playing that trick to no mother i dont who is he who is he you undutiful child why heshes the honourable captain delmar well what of that replied i hes a naval captain aint he yes but hes the nephew of the lady who brought me up and educated me it was he that made the match between me and our father so if it had not been for him child you never would have been born oh thats it replied i well mother if it had not been for me hed never have come into the shop and found you but my child we must be serious you must be very respectful to captain delmar and play no tricks with him for you may see him very often and perhaps he will take a fancy to you and if he does he may do you a great deal of good and bring you forward in the world so promise me well mother ill promise you ill leave him alone if you wish it law mother you should have seen how the middy laughed at him it was real fun to make a gallant captain run in the way he did go along you mischievous animal and recollect your promise to me said my mother as she went into the shop where she found that captain bridgeman to whom she intended to explain how it was that she had dropped the tumbler of water had gone away there was a great deal of consultation between my grandmother and my mother on that evening my aunt and i were sent out to to take a walk that we might not overhear what passed and when we returned we found them still in close conversation chapter eleven the honourable captain delmar was now a frequent visitor to my mother and a good customer to the library he did however generally contrive that his visit should be paid late in the afternoon just after the marine officers had retired to dress for dinner for he was a very haughty personage and did not think it proper for any officers of an inferior grade to come between the wind and his nobility i cannot say that i was partial to him indeed his pomposity as i considered it was to me a source of ridicule and dislike he took more notice of me than he did of anybody else but he appeared to consider that his condescending patronage was all that was necessary whereas had he occasionally given me a halfcrown i should have cherished better feelings towards him not that i wanted money for my mother supplied me very liberally considering my age but although you may coax and flatter a girl into loving you you cannot a boy who requires more substantial proofs of your goodwill there were a great many remarks not very flattering to my mother made behind her back as to her former intimacy with captain delmar for somehow or another there always is somebody who knows something wherever doubts or surmises arise and so it was in this case but if people indulged in illnatured remarks when she was not there they did not in her presence on the contrary the friendship of so great a man as the honourable captain delmar appeared rather to make my mother a person of more consequence she was continually pointing out to me the propriety of securing the good will of this great personage and the more she did so the more i felt inclined to do the reverse indeed i should have broke out into open mutiny if it had not been for captain bridgeman who sided with my mother and when i went to him to propose playing another trick upon the noble captain not only refused to aid me but told me if i ever thought of such a thing he would never allow me to come to his rooms again why what good can he do to me inquired i he may advance you properly in lifewho knowshe may put you on the quarterdeck and get you promoted in the service what make a middy of me yes and from a midshipman you may rise to be a postcaptain or admirala much greater rank than i shall ever obtain said captain bridgeman so take my advice and do as your mother wishes be very civil and respectful to captain delmar and he may be as good as a father to you thats not saying much replied i thinking of my father ben id rather have two mothers than two fathers and here the conversation ended i had contracted a great alliance with mr dott the midshipman who followed captain delmar about just as bob used to follow me and generally remained in the shop or outside with me when his captain called upon my mother he was a little wag as full of mischief as myself and even his awe of his captain which as a youngster in the service was excessive would not prevent him from occasionally breaking out my mother took great notice of him and when he could obtain leave which indeed she often asked for him invited him to come to our house when he became my companion during his stay we would sally out together and vie with each other in producing confusion and mirth at other peoples expense we became the abhorrence of every old fruitwoman and beggar in the vicinity captain delmar heard occasionally of my pranks and looked very majestic and severe but as i was not a middy i cared little for his frowns at last an opportunity offered which i could not resist and not daring to make known my scheme either to captain bridgeman or aunt milly i confided it to tommy dott the little middy who regardless of the consequences joined me in it heart and soul the theatre had been opened at chatham and had met with indifferent success i went there once with my aunt milly and twice with mr dott i therefore knew my locale well it appeared that one of the female performers whose benefit was shortly to take place was very anxious to obtain the patronage of captain delmar and with the usual tact of women had applied to my mother in the most obsequious manner requesting her to espouse her cause with the gallant captain my mother pleased with the idea of becoming as it were a patroness under the rose did so effectually exert her influence over the captain that in a day or two afterwards playbills were posted all over the town announcing that the play of the stranger with the farce of raising the wind would be performed on friday evening for the benefit of miss mortimer under the patronage of the honourable captain delmar and the officers of his majestys ship calliope of course the grateful young lady sent my mother some tickets of admission and two of them i reserved for tommy dott and myself captain delmar had made a large party of ladies and of course all the officers of the ship attended the house was as full as it could hold my mother and aunt were there in a retired part of the boxes tommy dott and i entered the theatre with them and afterwards had gone up to what is at the theatres at seaports usually denominated the slips that is the sides of the theatre on the same range as the gallery there was captain delmar with all his ladies and all his officers occupying nearly the whole of the side of the dress circle below us we having taken our position above him so that we might not be observed the performance commenced miss mortimer as mrs haller was very effective and in the last scene was compelling the eyes of the company to water when we thought we would produce a still greater effect we had purchased a pound of the finest scotch snuff which we had enclosed in two pasteboard cases similar in form to those of squibs only about six times the size and holding half a pound of snuff each our object was in doing this that by jerking it all out with a heave we might at once throw it right into the centre of the theatre above so that in its descent it might be fairly distributed among all parties there was no one in the slips with us except midshipmen and a description of people who would consider it a good joke and never would peach if they perceived we were the culprits at a signal between us just as mrs haller was giving a paper to her husband did we give our shower of snuff to the audience jerking it right across the theatre in a few minutes the effect was prodigious captain delmars party being right beneath us probably received a greater share for they commenced sneezing fast then the boxes on the other side the pit followed and at last mr and mrs haller and the stranger were taken with such a fit of sneezing that they could no longer talk to each other the children were brought out to their parents to effect their reconciliation but they did nothing but sneeze poor things and at last the uproar was tremendous and the curtain was dropped not to loud plaudits but to loud sneezings from every part of the theatre never was there anything so ludicrous the manager sent officers up to discover the offenders but no one could tell who had played the trick he then came before the curtain to make a speech upon the occasion but having sneezed seven or eight times he was obliged to retire with his handkerchief to his nose and the audience finding it impossible to check the titillation of the olfactory nerves abandoned the theatre as fast as they could leaving the farce of raising the wind to be performed to empty beaches i hardly need say that as soon as we had thrown the snuff mr dott and i had gone down and taken our places very demurely in the box by the side of my mother and appeared just as astonished and indeed added as much as possible to the company of sneezers captain delmar was very furious at this want of respect of certain parties unknown and had we been discovered whatever might have been my fate it would have gone hard with tommy dott but we kept our own counsel and escaped that i was suspected by aunt milly and captain bridgeman is certain and my aunt taxed me with it but i would not confess my mother also had her suspicions but as captain delmar had none that was of no consequence the success of this trick was a great temptation to try another or two upon the noble captain he was however saved by the simple fact of hm ship calliope being reported manned and ready for sea orders were sent down for his going round to portsmouth to await the commands of the lords commissioners of the admiralty and captain delmar came to pay his farewell visit the report from the schoolmaster had been very favourable and captain delmar then asked me for the first time if i would like to be a sailor as captain bridgeman had advised me not to reject any good offer on the part of the honourable captain i answered in the affirmative whereupon the captain replied that if i paid attention to my learning in a years time he would take me with him on board of his frigate he then patted my head forgot to give me half a crown and shaking hands with my mother and aunt quitted the house followed by tommy dott who as he went away turned and laughed his adieu i have not mentioned my grandmother lately the fact is that when captain delmar made his appearance for some cause or another which i could not comprehend she declared her intention of going away and paying a visit to her old acquaintances at the hall she did so as i afterwards found out from what i overheard she had a very great aversion to the noble captain but the cause of her aversion was never communicated to me soon after the sailing of the calliope she again made her appearance took her old seat in the easychair and resumed her eternal knitting as before chapter twelve another year of my existence passed rapidly away i was nearly thirteen years old a sturdy bold boy well fitted for the naval profession which i now considered decided upon and began to be impatient to leave school and wondered that we heard nothing of captain delmar when news was received from another quarter one morning captain bridgeman came much earlier than usual and with a very grave face put on especially for the occasion i had not set off for school and ran up to him but he checked me and said i must see your mother directly i have very important news for her i went in to tell my mother who requested captain bridgeman to come into the parlour and not being aware of the nature of the communication ordered aunt milly and me into the shop we waited for some minutes and then captain bridgeman made his appearance what is the matter said milly read this newspaper said he there is a despatch from india it will tell you all about it and you can show it to your sister when she is more composed curious to know what the matter could be i quitted the shop and went into the parlour where i saw my mother with her face buried in the sofa pillow and apparently in great distress whats the matter mother said i oh my child my child replied my mother wringing her hands you are an orphan and i am a lonely widow hows that said i hows that said my grandmother why are you such a fool as not to understand that your father is dead fathers dead is he replied i ill go and tell aunt milly and away i went out of the parlour to milly whom i found reading the newspaper aunt said i fathers dead only to think i wonder how he died he was killed in action dear said my aunt look here here is the account and the list of killed and wounded dye see your fathers namebenjamin keene marine let me read all about it aunt milly replied i taking the paper from her and i was soon very busy with the account of the action my readers must not suppose that i had no feeling because i showed none at my fathers death if they call to mind the humble position in which i had always seen my father who dared not even intrude upon the presence of those with whom my mother and i were on familiar terms and that he was ordered about just like a servant by my mother who set me no example of fear or love for him they will easily imagine that i felt less for his death than i should have for that of captain bridgeman or many others with whom i was on intimate terms what did puzzle me was that my mother should show so much feeling on the occasion i did not know the world then and that decency required a certain display of grief aunt milly appeared to be very unconcerned about it although occasionally she was in deep thought i put down the paper as soon as i had read the despatch and said to her well i suppose i must go to school now aunt oh no dear replied she you cant go to school for a few days now it wouldnt be proper you must remain at home and wait till you have put on mourning im glad of that at all events replied i i wonder where captain delmar is and why he dont send for me i begin to hate school i dare say it wont be long before you hear from him dear replied my aunt stay here and mind the shop while i go in to your mother if the truth was told i am afraid that the death of ben was a source of congratulation to all parties who were then in the parlour as for me i was very glad to have a few days holiday being perfectly indifferent as to whether he was dead or alive when i went in i found them in consultation as to the mourning my mother did not in the first place wish to make any a parade about a husband of whom she was ashamed in the second she did not like widows weeds and the unbecoming cap so it was decided as ben had been dead six months and if they had known it before they would have been in mourning for him all that time that halfmourning was all that was requisite for them and that as for me there was no reason for my going into mourning at all three days after the intelligence my mother reappeared in the shop the reason why she did not appear before was that her dress was not readyshe looked very pretty indeed in halfmourning so did my aunt milly and the attentions of the marine corps especially captain bridgeman and lieutenant flat were more unremitting than ever it appeared that as the death of ben had removed the great difficulty to my aunts being married to an officer my grandmother had resolved to ascertain the intentions of captain bridgeman and if she found that he cried off to persuade milly to consent to become mrs flat whether she consulted my mother or my aunt on this occasion i cannot positively say but i rather think not my mother and my aunt were walking out one evening when captain bridgeman came in and my grandmother who remained in the shop whenever my mother and milly went out together which was very seldom requested him to walk into the back parlour desiring me to remain in the shop and let her know if she was wanted now when they went into the parlour the door was left ajar and as i remained at the back part of the shop i could not help overhearing every word which was said for my grandmother being very deaf as most deaf people do talked quite as loud as captain bridgeman was compelled to do to make her hear him i wish captain bridgeman as a friend to ask your advice relative to my daughter amelia said the old lady please to take a chair if there is any opinion that i can offer on the subject madam i shall be most happy to give it replied the captain sitting down as requested you see my daughter amelia has been well brought up and carefully educated as was indeed my daughter arabella through the kindness of my old patron mrs delmar the aunt of the honourable captain delmar whom you have often met here and who is heir to the title of de versely that is to say his eldest brother has no children i have been nearly fifty years in the family as a confidential captain bridgeman the old lord was very fond of my husband who was his steward but he died poor man a long while ago i am sure it would have broken his heart if in his lifetime my daughter arabella had made the foolish marriage which she did with a private marinehowever whats done cant be helped as the saying isthats all over now it was certainly a great pity that mrs keene should have been so foolish replied captain bridgeman but as you say that is all over now yes gods will be done captain bridgeman now you see sir that this marriage of bellas has done no good to the prospects of her sister amelia who nevertheless is a good and pretty girl though i say it who am her mother and moreover she will bring a pretty penny to her husband whoever he may be for you see captain bridgeman my husband was not idle during the time that he was in the family of the delmars and as her sister is so well to do why little amelia will come into a greater share than she otherwise wouldthat is if she marries well and according to the wishes of her mother at this interesting part of the conversation captain bridgeman leant more earnestly towards my grandmother a pretty penny madam you said i never heard the expression before what may a pretty penny mean it means first and last pounds captain bridgeman part down and the other when i die indeed replied captain bridgeman i certainly never thought that miss amelia would ever have any fortune indeed shes too pretty and accomplished to require any now sir continued my grandmother the point on which i wish to consult you is this you know that lieutenant flat is very often here and for a long while has been very attentive to my daughter he has i believe almost as much as proposedthat is in his sort of way but my daughter does not seem to care for him now captain bridgeman mr flat may not be very clever but i believe him to be a very worthy young man still one must be cautious and what i wish to know before i interfere and persuade my daughter to marry him is whether you think that mr flat is of a disposition which would make the marriage state a happy one for you see captain bridgeman love before marriage is very apt to fly away but love that comes after marriage will last out your life well madam replied the captain i will be candid with you i do not think that a clever girl like miss amelia is likely to be happy as the wife of my good friend mr flatstill there is nothing against his character madam i believe him harmlessvery harmless hes a very finelooking young man captain bridgeman yes nothing to be found fault with in his appearance very goodnatured yes hes not very quick in temper or anything else hes what we call a slowcoach i hear hes a very correct officer captain bridgeman yes i am not aware that he has ever been under an arrest well we cannot expect everything in this world he is handsome goodtempered and a good officeri cannot see why amelia does not like him particularly as her affections are not otherwise engaged i am satisfied with the answer you have given captain bridgeman and now i shall point out to amelia that i expect she will make up her mind to accept mr flat here captain bridgeman hesitated indeed madam if her affections are not otherwise engagedi sayare not engaged madam i do not think she could do better would you like me to sound miss amelia on the subject really captain bridgeman it is very kind of you you may perhaps persuade her to listen to your friend mr flat i will at all events ascertain her real sentiments madam said the captain rising and if you please i will say farewell for the present as my grandmother anticipated the scale which had been so long balanced by captain bridgeman was weighed down in favour of marriage by the death of my father ben and the unexpected fortune of pounds the next day the captain proposed and was accepted and six weeks from that date my aunt milly became his wife the wedding was very gay some people did sneer at the match but where was there ever a match without a sneer there are always and everywhere people to be found who will envy the happiness of others some talked about the private marine this attack was met with the pounds or rather pounds per annum for rumour as usual had doubled the sum others talked of the shop as infra dig the setoff against which was the education and beauty of the bride one or two subs wives declared that they would not visit mrs bridgeman but when the colonel and his lady called to congratulate the newmarried couple and invited a large party in their own house to meet them then then subs wives left their cards as soon as they could in a few weeks all was right again my mother would not give up her shopit was too lucrative but she was on more intimate terms with her customers and when people found that although her sister was a captains lady my mother had too much sense to be ashamed of her position why they liked her the better indeed as she was still very handsome one or two of the marine officers now that she was a widow paid her very assiduous court but my mother had no intention of entering again into the holy stateshe preferred state in quo she had no one to care for but me and for me she continued her shop and library although i believe she could have retired upon a comfortable independence had she chosen so to do my mother whatever she might have been when a girl was now a strongminded clever woman it must have been a painful thing for her to have made up her mind to allow me to go to sea i was her only child her only care i believe she loved me dearly although she was not so lavish of her caresses as my aunt milly but she perceived that it would be for my advantage that i should insure the patronage and protection of captain delmar and she sacrificed self to my interest chapter thirteen about a month after my aunts marriage a letter was received from captain delmar who had arrived at spithead requesting my mother to send me to portsmouth as soon as she could and not go to the trouble or expense of fitting me out as he would take that upon himself this was but short notice to give a fond mother but there was no help for it she returned an answer that in three days from the date of the letter i should be there i was immediately summoned from school that she might see as much of me as possible before i went and although she did not attempt to detain me i perceived very often the tears run down her cheeks my grandmother thought proper to make me very long speeches every three or four hours the substance of which may be comprehended in very few wordsto wit that i had been a very bad boy and that i was little better now that i had been spoiled by overindulgence and that it was lucky my aunt milly was not so much with me that on board a manofwar i dare not play tricks and that i would find it very different from being at home with my mother that captain delmar was a very great man and that i must be very respectful to him that some day i should thank her very much for her being so kind to me that she hoped i would behave well and that if i did not she hoped that i would get a good beating such was the burden of her song till at last i got very tired of it and on the third evening i broke away from her saying law granny how you do twaddle upon which she called me a goodfornothing young blackguard and felt positively sure that i should be hanged the consequence was that granny and i did not part good friends and i sincerely hoped that when i had come back again i should not find her above ground the next morning i bade farewell to my dear aunt milly and captain bridgeman received a very ungracious salute from granny who appeared to think as she kissed me that her lips were touching something poisonous and set off with my mother in the coach to portsmouth we arrived safe at portsmouth and my mother immediately took lodgings on the common hard at portsea the next day having dressed herself with great care with a very thick veil on her bonnet my mother walked with me to the george hotel where captain delmar had taken up his quarters on my mother sending up her card we were immediately ushered upstairs and on entering the room found the honourable captain delmar sitting down in full uniformhis sword and hat and numerous papers lying on the table before him on one side of the table stood a lieutenant hat in hand on the other the captains clerk with papers for him to sign my friend tommy dott was standing at the window chasing a bluebottle fly for want of something better to do and the steward was waiting for orders behind the captains chair my mother who had pulled down her veil so that her face was not visible made a slight courtesy to captain delmar who rose up and advanced to receive her very graciously requesting that she would be seated for a minute or two till he had time to speak to her i have thought since that my honourable captain had a mind to impress upon my mother the state and dignity of a captain in his majestys service when in commission he took no notice whatever of me tommy dott gave me a wink of his eye from the window and i returned the compliment by putting my tongue into my cheek but the other parties were too much occupied with the captain to perceive our friendly recognition captain delmar continued to give various orders and after a time the officers attending were dismissed as soon as we were alone my mother was addressed in i thought rather a pompous way and very much in contrast with his previous politeness before others captain delmar informed her that he should take me immediately under his protection pay all my expenses and if i behaved well advance me in the service at this announcement my mother expressed a great deal of gratitude and shedding a few tears said that the boy would in future look up to him as a parent to this speech captain delmar made no reply but changing the conversation told her that he expected to sail in about three or four days and that no time must be lost in fitting me out that all things considered he thought it advisable that she should return at once to chatham and leave the boy with him as she could not know what was requisite for me and would therefore be of no use at the idea of parting with me my mother cried bitterly captain delmar did then rise off his chair and taking my mother by the hand speak to her a few words of consolation my mother removed her handkerchief from her eyes and sighed deeply saying to captain delmar with an appealing look oh captain delmar remember that for you i have indeed made great sacrifices do not forget them when you look at that boy who is very dear to me i will do him justice replied the captain somewhat affected but i must insist upon inviolable secrecy on your part you must promise me that under any circumstances i have obeyed you for thirteen years replied my mother i am not likely to forget my promise now it is hard to part with him but i leave him in the hands of you forget the boy is there interrupted captain delmar take him away now tomorrow morning i will send my coxswain for him and you must go back to chatham god bless you sir replied my mother weeping as captain delmar shook her hand and then we left the room as we were walking back to our lodging i inquired of my motherwhats the secret between you and captain delmar mother the secret child oh something which took place at the time i was living with his aunt and which he does not wish to have known so ask me no more questions about it after our return my mother gave me a great deal of advice she told me that as i had lost my father ben i must now look upon captain delmar as a father to me that ben had been a faithful servant to the captain and that she had been the same to mrs delmar his aunt and that was the reason why captain delmar was interested about me and had promised to do so much for me begging me to treat him with great respect and never venture to play him any tricks or otherwise he would be highly offended and send me home again and then i should never rise to be an officer in his majestys service i cannot say the advice received the attention it deserved for i felt more inclined to play tricks to my honourable captain than any person i ever met with however i appeared to consent and in return begged my mother to take care of my dog bob which she promised to do my mother cried a great deal during the night the next morning she gave me five guineas as pocketmoney recommending me to be careful of it and telling me i must look to captain delmar for my future supply she tied up the little linen i had brought with me in a handkerchief and shortly after the coxswain knocked at the door and came upstairs to claim me for his majestys service im come for the youngster if you please marm said the coxswain a fine tall seaman remarkably clean and neat in his dress my mother put her arms round me and burst into tears i beg your pardon marm said the coxswain after standing silent about a minute but could not you do the piping after the youngsters gone if i stay here long i shall be blowed up by the skipper as sure as my names bob cross i will detain you but a few seconds longer replied my mother i may never see him again well thats a fact my poor mother never did me replied the coxswain this observation did not raise my mothers spirits another pause ensued during which i was bedewed with her tears when the coxswain approached again i ax your pardon marm but if you know anything of captain delmar you must know hes not a man to be played with and you would not wish to get me into trouble its a hard thing to part with a child im told but it wouldnt help me if i said anything about your tears if the captain were to go to the boat and find me not there hed just say what were my orders sir and after that you know marm there is not a word for me to say take him then my good man replied my mother pressing me convulsively to her hearttake him heaven bless you my dear child thanky marm thats kind of you replied the coxswain come my little fellow well soon make a man of you i once more pressed my lips to my poor mothers and she resigned me to the coxswain at the same time taking some silver off the table and putting it into his hand thanky marm thats kinder still to think of another when youre in distress yourself i shant forget it ill look after the lad a bit for you as sure as my names bob cross my mother sank down on the sofa with her handkerchief to her eyes bob cross caught up the bundle and led me away i was very melancholy for i loved my mother and could not bear to see her so distressed and for some time we walked on without speaking the coxswain first broke the silencewhats your name my little trojan said he percival keene well im blessed if i didnt think that you were one of the delmar breed by the cut of your jib howsomever its a wise child that knows its own father fathers dead replied i dead well fathers do die sometimes you must get on how you can without one i dont think fathers are of much use for you see mothers take care of you till youre old enough to go to sea my father did nothing for me except to help mother to lick me when i was obstropolous the reader from what he has already been informed about ben the marine may easily conceive that i was very much of bob crosss opinion i suppose you dont know anybody on boarddo you yes i know tommy dotti knew him when the ship was at chatham oh mr tommy dott i dare say youre just like him for you look full of mischief hes a very nice young man for a small party as the saying is there is more devil in his little carcase than in two womens and thats not a trifle youll hunt in couples i dare say and get well flogged at the same gun if you dont take care now here we are and i must report my arrival with you under convoy bob cross sent a waiter for the captains steward who went up to captain delmar i was ordered to go upstairs and again found myself in the presence of the noble captain and a very stout elderly man with a flaxen wig this is the lad said captain delmar when i came into the room and walked up to him you know exactly what he requires oblige me by seeing him properly fitted out and the bill sent in to me your orders shall be strictly obeyed captain delmar said the old gentleman with a profound bow you had better not order too many things as he is growing fast it will be easy to make good any deficiencies as they may be required your orders shall be most strictly obeyed captain delmar replied the old gentleman with another bow i hardly know what to do with him for today and tomorrow until his uniforms are made continued the captain i suppose he must go on board if you have no objection captain delmar said the old gentleman with another low bow i am sure that mrs culpepper will be most proud to take charge of any protege of yours we have a spare bed and the young gentleman can remain with us until he is ready to embark in the uniform of his rank be it so mr culpepper let your wife take care of him until all is complete and his chest is ready youll oblige me by arranging about his mess your wishes shall be most strictly attended to captain delmar replied mr culpepper with another profound inclination which made me feel very much inclined to laugh if you have no further orders captain delmar i will now take the young gentleman with me nothing more mr culpeppergood morning replied captain delmar who neither said how dye do to me when i came in or good bye when i went away in company with mr culpepper i had yet to learn what a thing of no consequence was a sucking nelson i followed mr culpepper down stairs who desired me to remain with the coxswain who was standing under the archway while he spoke to the captains steward well said bob cross whats the ticket youngsterare you to go abroad with me no said i i am to stay on shore with that old chap who does nothing but bob his head up and down who is he thats our nipcheese nipcheese yes nipcheese means purser of the shipyoull find all that out byandby youve got lots to larn and by way of a hint make him your friend if you can for he earwigs the captain in fine style perceiving that i did not understand him bob cross continued i mean that our captains very fond of the officers paying him great respect and he likes all that bowing and scraping he dont like officers or men to touch their hats but to take them right off their heads when they speak to him you see hes a sprig of nobility as they call it and whats more hes also a postcaptain and thinks no small beer of himself so dont forget what i sayhere comes the purser mr culpepper now came out and taking my hand led me away to his own house which was at southsea he did not speak a word during the walk but appeared to be in deep cogitation at last we arrived at his door chapter fourteen why is it that i detain the reader with mr culpepper and his family i dont know but i certainly have an inclination to linger over every little detail of events which occurred upon my first plunging into the sea of life just as naked boys on the new river side stand shivering a while before they can make up their minds to dash into the unnatural element for men are not ducks although they do show some affinity to geese by their venturing upon the treacherous fluid the door was opened and i found myself in the presence of mrs culpepper and her daughterthe heiress as i afterwards discovered to all mr culpeppers savings which were asserted to be something considerable after thirty years employment as purser of various vessels belonging to his majesty mrs culpepper was in person enormousshe looked like a featherbed standing on end her cheeks were as large as a dinnerplate eyes almost as imperceptible as a moles nose just visible mouth like a round o it was said that she was once a great devonshire beauty time who has been denominated edax rerum certainly had as yet left her untouched reserving her for a bonne bouche on some future occasion she sat in a very large armchairindeed no commonsized chair could have received her capacious person she did not get up when i entered indeed as i discovered she made but two attempts to stand during the twentyfour hours one was to come out of her bedroom which was on the same floor as the parlour and the other to go in again miss culpepper was somewhat of her mothers build she might have been twenty years old and was for a girl of her age exuberantly fat yet as her skin and complexion were not coarse many thought her handsome but she promised to be as large as her mother and certainly was not at all suited for a wife to a subaltern of a marching regiment who have we here said mrs culpepper to her husband in a sort of low croak for she was so smothered with fat that she could not get her voice out well i hardly know replied the gentleman wiping his forehead but ive my own opinion mercy on me how very like exclaimed miss culpepper looking at me and then at her father would not you like to go into the garden little boy continued she there through the passage out of the dooryou cant miss it as this was almost a command i did not refuse to go but as soon as i was in the garden which was a small patch of ground behind the house as the window to the parlour was open and my curiosity was excited by their evidently wishing to say something which they did not wish me to hear i stopped under the window and listened the very picture of him continued the young lady yes yes very like indeed croaked the old one all i know is said mr culpepper captain delmar has desired me to fit him out and that he pays all the expenses well thats another proof said the young lady he wouldnt pay for other peoples children he was brought down here by a very respectablelooking i may say interesting and rather pretty womani should think about thirty then she must have been handsome when this boy was born replied the young lady i consider that another proof where is she went away this morning by the daycoach leaving the boy with the captain who sent his coxswain for him theres mystery about that rejoined the daughter and therefore i consider it another proof yes said mr culpepper and a strong one too captain delmar is so high and mighty that he would not have it thought that he could ever condescend to have an intrigue with one beneath him in rank and station and he has sent her away on that account depend upon it just so and if that boy is not a son of captain delmar im not a woman i am of that opinion replied the father and therefore i offered to take charge of him as the captain did not know what to do with him till his uniform was ready well replied miss culpepper ill soon find out more ill pump everything that he knows out of him before he leaves us i know how to put that and that together yes croaked the fat mother medea knows how to put that and that together as well as any one you must be very civil and very kind to him said mr culpepper for depend upon it the very circumstance of the captains being compelled to keep the boy at a distance will make him feel more fond of him ive no patience with the men in that respect observed the young lady how nobility can so demean themselves i cant think no wonder they are ashamed of what they have done and will not acknowledge their own offspring no indeed croaked the old lady if a woman has the misfortune to yield to her inclinations they dont let her off so easily exclaimed miss medea no indeed croaked the mamma again men make the laws and break them continued miss culpepper mere brute strength even in the most civilised society if all women had only the spirit that i have there would be a little alteration and more justice i cant pretend to argue with you medea replied mr culpepper i take the world as i find it and make the best of it i must go now my steward is waiting for me at the victualling office just brush my hat a little medea the wind has raised the nap and then ill be off i walked very softly from the window a new light had burst upon me young as i was i also could put that and that together i called to mind the conduct of my mother towards her husband ben the dislike of my grandmother to captain delmar the occasional conversations i had overheard the question of my mother checked before it was finishedif i knew who it was that i had been playing the trick to the visits my mother received from captain delmar who was so haughty and distant to everybody his promise to provide for me and my mothers injunctions to me to be obedient and look up to him as a father and the remarks of the coxswain bob crossif i were not of the delmar breed all this added to what i had just overheard satisfied me that they were not wrong in their conjectures and that i really was the son of the honourable captain my mother had gone i would have given worlds to have gained this information before that i might have questioned her and obtained the truth from her but that was now impossible and i felt convinced that writing was of no use i recollected the conversation between her and the captain in which she promised to keep the secret and the answer she gave me when i questioned her nothing then but my tears and entreaties could have any effect and those i knew were powerful over her neither would it be of any use to ask aunt milly for she would not tell her sisters secrets so i resolved to say nothing about it for the present and i did not forget that mr culpepper had said that captain delmar would be annoyed if it was supposed that i was his son i resolved therefore that i would not let him imagine that i knew anything about it or had any idea of it i remained more than an hour in deep thought and it was strange what a tumult there was in my young heart at this discovery i hardly comprehended the nature of my position yet i felt pleased on the whole i felt as if i were of more importance nay that i was more capable of thinking and acting than i was twentyfour hours before my reveries were however disturbed by miss medea who came to the backdoor and asked me if i was not tired of walking and if i would not like to come in are you not hungry master keene would you like to have a nice piece of cake and a glass of currant wine before dinner we shall not dine till three oclock if you please replied i for i would not refuse the bribe although i had a perfect knowledge why it was offered miss medea brought the cake and wine as soon as i had despatched them which did not take very long she commenced her pumping as i had anticipated and which i was determined to thwart merely out of opposition you were sorry to leave your mamma werent you master keene yes very sorry miss wheres your papa dearest hes a very pretty boy mamma aint he continued the young lady putting her fingers through my chestnut curls yes handsome boy croaked the old lady papas dead dead i thought so observed miss medea winking at her mother did you ever see your papa dearest oh yes he went to sea about eighteen months ago and he was killed in action after this came on a series of questions and crossquestions i replied to her so as to make it appear that ben was my father and nobody else although i had then a very different opinion the fact was i was determined that i would not be pumped and i puzzled them for i stated that my aunt milly was married to captain bridgeman of the marines and not till then did miss medea ask me what my father was my reply was that he had also been in the marines and they consequently put him down as a marine officer as well as captain bridgeman this added so much to the respectability of my family that they were quite mystified and found that it was not quite so easy to put that and that together as they had thought as soon as they were tired of questioning they asked me if i would not like to take another turn in the garden to which i consented and placing myself under the window as before i heard miss medea say to her mother fathers always finding out some mares nest or another and because there is some likeness to the captain he has in his great wit made an important discovery its quite evident that hes wrong as he generally is its not very likely that captain delmar should have had an intrigue with the wife of a marine officer and her sister married also into the corps the widow has brought him down herself it is true but that proves nothing who else was to bring him down if it was not his mother and the very circumstance of her going away so soon proves that she felt it improper that she should remain and in my opinion that she is a modest interesting young woman in whom captain delmar has taken an interest i wish father would not come here with his nonsensical ideas telling us to make much of the boy very true medea replied the mother you might have saved that cake and wine thinks i to myself you have not pumped me and i never felt more delighted than at having outwitted them i thought it however prudent to walk away from the window shortly afterwards mr culpepper returned accompanied by one of the numerous portsmouth fittingout tailors i was summoned the tailor presented a list of what he declared to be absolutely necessary for the outfit of a gentleman mr culpepper struck out twothirds of the articles and desired the remainder to be ready on the friday morning it being then wednesday the tailor promised faithfully and mr culpepper also promised most faithfully that if the articles were not ready they would be left on his hands as soon as the tailor had gone miss medea asked me if i would not like to take another run in the garden i knew that she wished to speak to her father and therefore had a pleasure in disappointing her i therefore replied that i had been there nearly the whole day and did not wish to go out any more never mind whether you wish it or not i wish you to go replied miss medea tartly medea how can you be so rude cried mr culpepper surely mr keene may do as he pleases im surprised at you medea and im surprised at you papa finding out a mystery when there is none replied miss medea very cross all you said this morning and all your surmises have turned out to be all moonshine yes you may look papa i tell youall moonshine why medea what nonsense you are talking replied mr culpepper medeas right croaked mrs culpepper all moonshine so you need not be so very particular papa i can tell you rejoined miss medea who then whispered in her fathers ear loud enough for me to hear no such thing nothing but a regular marine pooh nonsense replied the purser in a low voice the boy has been taught to say ithes too clever for you medea at this very true remark of her fathers miss medea swelled into a towering passion her whole face neck and shouldersfor she wore a low gown in the morningturning to a fiery scarlet i never saw such a fury as she appeared to be she rushed by me so roughly that i was thrown back a couple of paces and then she bounced out of the room medea knows how to put that and that together mr culpepper croaked out mrs culpepper medeas wise in her own conceit and youre a regular old fool rejoined mr culpepper with asperity one too knowing and the other not half knowing enough master keene i hope you are hungry for we have a very nice dinner do you like ducks and green peas yes sir very much replied i were you born at chatham master keene no sir i was born at the hall near southampton my mother was brought up by old mrs delmar the captains aunt i gave this intelligence on purpose as i knew it would puzzle miss medea who had just returned from the kitchen mr culpepper nodded his head triumphantly to his daughter and wife who both appeared dumbfounded at this new light thrown upon the affair miss medea paused a moment and then said to mei wish to ask you one question master keene i will not answer any more of your questions miss replied i you have been questioning me all the morning and just now you were so rude as nearly to push me down if you want to know anything more ask captain delmar or if you wish it i will ask captain delmar whether i am to answer you and if he says i am i will but not without this was a decided blow on my part mother and medea both looked frightened and mr culpepper was more alarmed than either of the females it proved to them that i knew what they were inquiring for which was to them also proof that i also knew who i was and further my reference to captain delmar satisfied them that i felt sure of his support and they knew that he would be very much irritated if i told him on what score they had been pumping me you are very right master keene said mr culpepper turning very red to refuse to answer any questions you dont like and medea im surprised at your behaviour i insist upon it you do not annoy master keene with any more of your impertinent curiosity no no croaked the old lady hold your tongue medea hold your tongue miss medea who looked as if she could tear my eyes out if she dared swallowed down her rage as well as she could she was mortified at finding she had made a mistake annoyed at my answering her so boldly and frightened at her fathers anger for the old gentleman was very apt to vent it in the argumentum ad feminam and box her ears soundly fortunately dinner was served just at this moment and this gave a turn to the conversation and also to their thoughts mr culpepper was all attention and miss medea gradually recovering her temper also became affable and condescending the evening passed away very agreeably but i went to bed early as i wished to be left to my own reflections and it was not till daylight that i could compose my troubled mind so as to fall asleep chapter fifteen although the aversion which i had taken to the whole culpepper family was so great that i could have done anything to annoy them my mind was now so fully occupied with the information which i had collected relative to my supposed birth and parentage that i could not think of mischief i walked on the common or in the little garden during the whole of the following day plunged in deep thought and at night when i went to bed i remained awake till the dawn during these last two days i had thought and reflected more than i had perhaps done from the hour of my birth that i was better off than i should have been if i had been the son of a private in the marines i felt convinced but still i had a feeling that i was in a position in which i might be subjected to much insult and that unless i was acknowledged by my aristocratic parent my connection with his family would be of no use to meand captain delmar how was i to behave to him i did not like him much that was certain nor did this new light which had burst forth make me feel any more love for him than i did before still my mothers words at chatham rung in my ears do you know who it is that you have been etcetera i felt sure that he was my father and i felt a sort of duty towards him perhaps an increase of respect these were anxious thoughts for a boy not fourteen and the culpeppers remarked that i had not only looked very pale but had actually grown thin in the face during my short stay as i was very quiet and reserved after the first day they were very glad when my clothes were brought home and i was reported ready to embark so was i for i wanted to go on board and see my friend tommy dott with whom i intended if the subject was brought up to consult as to my proceedings or perhaps i thought it would be better to consult bob cross the captains coxswain i was not sure that i should not advise with them both i had made up my mind how to behave to my mother i knew that she would never acknowledge the truth after what had passed between the captain and her when i was present but i was resolved that i would let her know that i was in the secret and i thought that the reply to me would be a guide as to the correctness of the fact which with all the hastiness of boyhood i considered as incontrovertible although i had not the least positive proof the day that i was to go on board i requested miss culpepper to give me a sheet of paper that i might write to my mother she supplied me very readily saying you had better let me see if you make any mistake in your spelling before the letter goes your mamma will be so pleased if you write your letter properly she then went down into the kitchen to give some orders as i had not the slightest intention that she should read what i wrote and resolved to have it in the post before she came up again i was very concise in my epistle which was as follows dear motheri have found it all outi am the son of captain delmar and everyone here knows what you have kept a secret from me i go on board today yours truly p keene this was very short and it must be admitted direct to the point i could not perhaps have written one which was so calculated to give my mother uneasiness as soon as it was finished i folded it up and lighted a taper to seal it old mrs culpepper who was in the room croaked out no no you must show it to medea but i paid no attention to her and having sealed my letter put on my hat and walked out to the postoffice i dropped it into the box and on returning found mr culpepper coming home accompanied by bob cross the captains coxswain and two of the boats crew as i presumed they were sent for me i joined them immediately and was kindly greeted by bob cross who said well mr keene are you all ready for shipping weve come for your traps all ready replied i and very glad to go for im tired of staying on shore doing nothing we were soon at the house the seamen carried away my chest and bedding while bob cross remained a little while that i might pay my farewell to the ladies the ceremony was not attended with much regret on either side miss culpepper could not help asking me why i did not show her my letter and i replied that there were secrets in it which answer did not at all add to her good temper our adieus were therefore anything but affectionate and before the men with my effects were a hundred yards in advance bob cross and i were at their heels well master keene said bob as we wended our way across south sea common how do you like the pursers ladies not at all replied i they have done nothing but try to pump me the whole time i have been there but they did not make much of it women will be curious master keenepray what did they try to pump about i hardly knew how to reply and i hesitated i felt a strong inclination towards bob cross and i had before reflected whether i should make him my confidant still i was undecided and made no reply when bob cross answered for me look ye childfor although youre going on the quarterdeck and i am before the mast you are a child compared to mei can tell you what they tried to pump about as well as you can tell me if you choose according to my thinking theres no lad on board the frigate that will require good advice as you will and i tell you candidly you will have your cards to play bob cross is no fool and can see as far through a fog as most chaps i like you for yourself as far as i see of you and i have not forgotten your mothers kindness to me when she had her own misery to occupy her thoughts not that i wanted the moneyit wasnt the money but the way and the circumstances under which it was given i told you id look after you a bita bit means a great deal with me and so i will if you choose that i shall if not i shall touch my hat to you as my officer which wont help you very much so now you have to settle my lad whether you will have me as your friend or not the appeal quite decided me bob cross replied i i do wish to make you my friend i thought of it before but i did not know whether to go to you or to tommy dott tommy dott well master keene thats not very flattering to put me in one scale and tommy dott in the other im not surprised at its weighing down in my favour if you wish to get into mischief you cant apply to a better hand than tommy dott but tommy dott is not half so fit to advise you as you are i expect to advise him so make him your playmate and companion if you please but as to his advice its not worth asking however as you have given me the preference i will now tell you that the culpepper people have been trying to find out who is your father aint i right yes you are replied i well then this is no time to talk about such things we shall be down to the boat in another minute so well say no more at present only recollect when you are on board if they talk about appointing a man to take charge of your hammock say that bob cross the captains coxswain is you understand to be the person say that and no more i will tell you why byandby when we have time to talk together and if any of your messmates say anything to you on the same point which the culpeppers have been working at make no reply and hold yourself very stiff now here we are at the sally port so theres an end to our palaver for the present my chest and bedding were already in the boat and as soon as cross and i had stepped in he ordered the bowman to shove off in half an hour we arrived alongside the frigate which lay at spithead bright with new paint and with her pennant proudly flying to the breeze youd better follow me sir and mind you touch your hat when the officers speak to you said bob cross ascending the accommodation ladder i did so and found myself on the quarter deck in the presence of the first lieutenant and several of the officers well cross said the first lieutenant ive brought a young gentleman on board to join the ship captain delmar has i believe given his orders about him mr keene i presume said the first lieutenant eyeing me from head to foot yes sir replied i touching my hat how long have you been at portsmouth three days sir i have been staying at mr culpeppers well did you fall in love with miss culpepper no sir replied i i hate her at this answer the first lieutenant and the officers near him burst out alaughing well youngster you must dine with us in the gunroom today and wheres mr dott here sir said tommy dott coming from the other side of the quarterdeck mr dott take this young gentleman down below and show him the midshipmens berth let me see who is to take care of his hammock i believe that bob cross is to take care of it sir said i the captains coxswainhumph well thats settled at all events very goodwe shall have the pleasure of your company to dinner mr keene why mr dott and you look as if you knew each other dont we tommy said i to the midshipman grinning i suspect that there is a pair of you said the first lieutenant turning aft and walking away after which tommy and i went down the companion ladder as fast as we could and in a few seconds afterwards were sitting together on the same chest in most intimate conversation my extreme resemblance to our honourable captain was not unobserved by the officers who were on the quarterdeck at the time of my making my appearance and as i afterwards heard from bob cross he was sent for by the surgeon on some pretence or another to obtain any information relative to me what were bob crosss reasons for answering as he did i could not at that time comprehend but he explained them to me afterwards who brought him down cross said the surgeon carelessly his own mother sir he has no father sir i hear did you see her what sort of a person was she well sir replied bob cross ive seen many ladies of quality but such a real lady i dont think i ever set my eyes upon before and such a beautyid marry tomorrow if i could take in tow a craft like her how did they come down to portsmouth why sir she came down to portsmouth in a coach and four but she walked to the george hotel as if she was nobody this was not a fib on the part of the coxswain for we came down by the portsmouth coach it did however deceive the surgeon as was intended did you see anything of her cross not when she was with the captain sir but at her own lodgings i did such a generous lady i never met with a few more questions were put all of which were replied to in much the same strain by the coxswain so as to make out my mother to be a very important and mysterious personage it is true that tommy dott could have contradicted all this but in the first place it was not very likely that there would be any communication upon the point between him and the officers and in the next i cautioned him to say nothing about what he knew which as he was strongly attached to me he strictly complied with so bob cross completely mystified the surgeon who of course made his report to his messmates mr culpeppers report certainly differed somewhat from that of bob cross there was my statement of my aunt being married to a marine officerbut it was my statement there was also my statement of my mother residing with captain delmars aunt altogether there was doubt and mystery and it ended in my mother being supposed to be a much greater person than she really waseverything tending to prove her a lady of rank being willingly received and all counterstatements looked upon as apocryphal and false but whoever my mother might be on one point every one agreed which was that i was the son of the honourable captain delmar and on this point i was equally convinced myself i waited with some anxiety for my mothers reply to my letter which arrived two days after i had joined the frigate it was as follows my dear percival you little know the pain and astonishment which i felt upon receipt of your very unkind and insulting letter surely you could not have reflected at the time you wrote it but must have penned it in a moment of irritation arising from some ungenerous remark which has been made in your hearing alas my dear child you will find now that you have commenced your career in life that there are too many whose only pleasure is to inflict pain upon their fellowcreatures i only can imagine that some remark has been made in your presence arising from there being a similarity of features between you and the honourable captain delmar that there is so has been before observed by others indeed your uncle and aunt bridgeman were both struck with the resemblance when captain delmar arrived at chatham but this proves nothing my dear childpeople are very often alike who have never seen each other or heard each other mentioned till they have by accident been thrown together so as to be compared it may certainly be as your father was in the service of captain delmar and constantly attended upon him and indeed i may add as i was occasionally seeing him that the impression of his countenance might be constantly in our memory andbut you dont understand such questions and therefore i will say no more except that you will immediately dismiss from your thoughts any such idea you forget my dearest boy that you are insulting me by supposing any such thing and that your mothers honour is called in question i am sure you never thought of that when you wrote those hasty and inconsiderate lines i must add my dear boy that knowing captain delmar and how proud and sensitive he is if it should ever come to his knowledge that you had suspected or asserted what you have his favour and protection would be lost to you for ever at present he is doing a kind and charitable action in bringing forward the son of a faithful servant but if he imagined for a moment that you were considered related to him he would cast you off for ever and all your prospects in life would be ruined even allowing it possible that you were what you so madly stated yourself in your letter to be i am convinced he would do so if such a report came to his ears he would immediately disavow you and leave you to find your own way in the world you see therefore my dear boy how injurious to you in every way such a ridiculous surmise must prove and i trust that not only for your own sake but for your mothers character you will so far from giving credence indignantly disavow what must be a source of mischief and annoyance to all parties captain bridgeman desires me to say that he is of my opinion so is your aunt milly as for your grandmother of course i dare not show her your letter write to me my dear boy and tell me how this unfortunate mistake happened and believe me to be your affectionate mother arabella keene i read this letter over ten times before i came to any conclusion at last i said to myself there is not in any one part of it any positive denial of the fact and resolved some future day when i had had some conversation with bob cross to show it to him and ask his opinion chapter sixteen the next morning at daylight the blue peter was hoisted at the foremast and the gun fired as a signal for sailing all was bustle hoisting in clearing boats of stock and clearing the ship of women and strangers at ten oclock captain delmar made his appearance the hands were piped up anchor and in half an hour we were standing out for st helens before night it blew very fresh and we went rolling down the channel before an easterly wind i went to my hammock very sick and did not recover for several days during which nobody asked for me or any questions about me except bob cross and tommy dott as soon as i was well enough i made my appearance on deck and was ordered by the first lieutenant to do my duty under the signal midshipman this was day duty and not very irksome i learnt the flags and how to use a spyglass we were charged with despatches for the fleet then off cadiz and on the tenth day we fell in with it remained a week in company and then were ordered to gibraltar and malta from malta we went home again with despatches having been out three months during this short and pleasant run i certainly did not learn much of my profession but i did learn a little of the ways of the world first as to captain delmar his conduct to me was anything but satisfactory he never inquired for me during the time that i was unwell and took no notice of me on my reappearance the officers and young gentlemen as midshipmen are called were asked to dine in the cabin in rotation and i did in consequence dine two or three times in the cabin but it appeared to me as if the captain purposely took no notice of me although he generally did say a word or two to the others moreover as the signal mids were up in the morning watch he would occasionally send to invite one of the others to breakfast with him but he never paid me that compliment this annoyed me and i spoke of it to bob cross with whom i had had some long conversations i had told him all i knew relative to myself what my suspicions were and i had shown him my mothers reply his opinion on the subject may be given in what follows you see master keene you are in an awkward position the captain is a very proud man and too proud to acknowledge that you are any way related to him its my opinion from what you have told me and from other reasons particularly from your likeness to the captain that your suspicions are correct but what then your mother is sworn to secrecythats clear and the captain wont own youthats also very clear i had some talk with the captains steward on the subject when i was taking a glass of grog with him the other night in this berth it was he that brought up the subject not me and he said that the captain not asking you to breakfast and avoiding you as it were was another proof that you belonged to him and the wishing to hide the secret only makes him behave as he does you have a difficult game to play master keene but you are a clever lad and you ask advicemind you follow it or its little use asking it you must always be very respectful to captain delmar and keep yourself at as great a distance from him as he does from you that im sure i will replied i for i dislike him very much no you must not do that but you must bend to circumstances byandby things will go on better but mind you keep on good terms with the officers and never be saucy or they may say to you what may not be pleasant recollect this and things will go on better as i said before if captain delmar protects you with his interest you will be a captain over the heads of many who are now your superiors on board of this frigate one thing be careful of which is to keep your own counsel and dont be persuaded in a moment of confidence to trust anything to tommy dott or any other midshipman and if any one hints at what you suppose deny it immediately nay if necessary fight for it that will be the way to please the captain for you will be of his side then and not against him that this advice of bob cross was the best that could be given to one in my position there could not be a doubt and that i did resolve to follow it is most certain i generally passed away a portion of my leisure hours in bobs company and became warmly attached to him and certainly my time was not thrown away for i learnt a great deal from him one evening as i was leaning against one of the guns on the main deck waiting for cross to come out of the cabin i was amused with the following conversation between a boatswains mate and a foretop man i shall give it verbatim they were talking of one that was dead and after the boatswains mate had said well hes in heaven poor fellow after a pause the foretop man said i wonder bill whether i shall ever go to heaven why not replied the boatswains mate why the parson says its good works now i certainly have been a pretty many times in action and i have killed plenty of frenchmen in my time well thats sufficient i should think i hold my hopes upon just the same claims ive cut down fifty frenchmen in my life and if that aint good works i dont know what is i suppose nelsons in heaven of course if so be he wishes to be there i should like to know who would keep him out if he was determined on it no no depend upon it he walked slap in on our return to portsmouth the captain went up to the admiralty with the despatches the frigate remaining at spithead ready to sail at a moments notice i was now quite accustomed to the ship and officers the conviction i had of my peculiar position together with the advice of bob cross had very much subdued my spirit perhaps the respect created by discipline and the example of others which produced in me a degree of awe of the captain and the lieutenants assisted a littlecertain it is that i gained the goodwill of my messmates and had not been in any scrape during the whole cruise the first lieutenant was a stern but not unkind man he would blow you up as we termed it when he scolded for half an hour without ceasing i never knew a man with such a flow of words but if permitted to go on without interruption he was content without proceeding to further punishment any want of respect however was peculiarly offensive to him and any attempt to excuse yourself was immediately cut short with no reply sir the second day after our return to spithead i was sent on shore in the cutter to bring off a youngster who was to join the ship he had never been to sea before his name was green and he was as green as a gooseberry i took a dislike to him the moment that i saw him because he had a hooked nose and very small ferrety eyes as we were pulling on board he asked me a great many questions of all kinds particularly about the captain and officers and to amuse myself and the boats crew who were on the full titter i exercised my peculiar genius for invention at last after i had given a character of the first lieutenant which made him appear a sort of marine ogre he asked how it was i got on with him o very well replied i but im a freemason and so is he and hes never severe with a brother mason but how did he know you were a mason i made the sign to him the very first time that he began to scold me and he left off almost immediately that is when i made the second sign he did not when i made the first i should like to know these signs wont you tell them to me tell them to you oh no that wont do replied i i dont know you here we are on boardin bowrowed of all men now mr green ill show you the way up mr green was presented and ushered into the service much in the same way as i was but he had not forgotten what i said to him relative to the first lieutenant and it so happened that on the third day he witnessed a jobation delivered by the first lieutenant to one of the midshipmen who venturing to reply was ordered to the masthead for the remainder of the day added to which a few minutes afterwards the first lieutenant ordered two men to be put both legs in irons mr green trembled as he saw the men led away by the masteratarms and he came to me i do wish keene you would tell me those signs said he cant you be persuaded to part with them ill give you any thing that i have which you may like well said i i should like to have that long spyglass of yours for its a very good one and as signalmidshipman will be useful to me i will give it you with all my heart replied he if you will tell me the signs well then come down below give me the glass and i will tell them to you mr green and i went down to the berth and i received the spyglass as a present in due form i then led him to my chest in the steerage and in a low confidential tone told him as follows you see green you must be very particular about making those signs for if you make a mistake you will be worse off than if you never made them at all for the first lieutenant will suppose that you are trying to persuade him that you are a mason when you are not now observe you must not attempt to make the first sign until he has scolded you well then at any pause you must make it thus you see you must put your thumb to the tip of your nose and extend your hand straight out from it with all the fingers separated as wide as you can now do it as i did it stopwait a little till that marine passes yes that is it well that is considered the first proof of your being a mason but it requires a second the first lieutenant will i tell you frankly be or rather pretend to be in a terrible rage and will continue to rail at you you must therefore wait a little till he pauses and then you observe put up your thumb to your nose with the fingers of your hands spread out as before and then add to it your other hand by joining your other thumb to the little finger of the hand already up and stretch your other hand and fingers out like the first then you will see the effects of the second sign do you think you can recollect all this for as i said before you must make no mistake green put his hands up as i told him and after three or four essays declared himself perfect and i left him it was about three days afterwards that mr green upset a kid of dirty water upon the lower deck which had been dry holystoned and the mate of the lower deck when the first lieutenant went his round reported the circumstance to exculpate himself mr green was consequently summoned on the quarterdeck and the first lieutenant who was very angry commenced as usual a volley of abuse on the unfortunate youngster green recollecting my instructions waited till the first lieutenant had paused and then made the first freemason sign looking up very boldly at the first lieutenant who actually drew back with astonishment at this contemptuous conduct hitherto unwitnessed on board of a manatwar what sir cried the first lieutenant why sir are you madyou just come into the service treating me in this manner i can tell you sir that you will not be three days longer in the serviceno sir not three days for either you leave the service or i do of all the impudence of all the insolence of all the contempt i have heard of this beats alland from such a little animal as you consider yourself as under an arrest sir till the captain comes on board and your conduct is reported go down below sir immediately the lieutenant paused and now green gave him sign the second as a reply thinking that they would then come to a right understandingbut to his astonishment the first lieutenant was more curious than ever and calling the sergeant of marines ordered him to take mr green down and put him in irons under the halfdeck poor green was handed down all astonishment at the want of success of his masons signs i who stood abaft was delighted at the success of my joke while the first lieutenant walked hastily up and down the deck as much astonished as enraged at such insulting and insolent conduct from a lad who had not been a week in the service after a time the first lieutenant went down below when bob cross who was on deck and who had perceived my delight at the scene which was to him and all others so inexplicable came up to me and said master keene im sure by your looks you knew something about this that foolish lad never had dared do so if he knew what it was he had done now dont look so demure but tell me how it is i walked aft with bob cross and confided my secret to him he laughed heartily and said well tommy dott did say that you were up to any thing and so i think you are but you see this is a very serious affair for poor green and like the fable of the frogs what is sport to you is death to others the poor lad will be turned out of the service and lose his chance of being a post captain so you must allow me to explain the matter so that it gets to the ears of the first lieutenant as soon as possible well replied i do as you like bob if any ones to be turned out of the service for such nonsense it ought to be me and not green poor snob no fear of your being turned out the first lieutenant wont like you the worse and the other officers will like you better especially as i shall say that it is by your wish that i explain all to get mr green out of the scrape ill go to the surgeon and tell himbut master keene dont you call such matters nonsense or youll find yourself mistaken one of these days i never saw such disrespect on a quarterdeck in all my lifeworse than mutiny a thousand times here bob cross burst out into a fit of laughter as he recalled greens extended fingers to his memory and then he turned away and went down below to speak to the surgeon as soon as cross had quitted the deck i could not restrain my curiosity as to the situation of my friend green i therefore went down the ladder to the halfdeck and there on the starboard side between the guns i perceived the poor fellow with his legs in irons his hands firmly clasped together looking so woeful and woebegone every now and then raising his eyes up to the beam of the upper deck as if he would appeal to heaven that i scarcely could refrain from laughing i went up to him and said why green how is all thiswhat has happened happened said the poor fellow happened see what has happened here i am did you make the freemasons signs replied i didnt i yesi did oh what will become of me you could not have made them right you must have forgotten them im sure i made them as you told me im quite sure of that then perhaps i did not recollect them exactly myself however be of good heart i will have the whole matter explained to the first lieutenant pray do only get me out of this i dont want the glass back ill have it done directly replied i as i went away bob cross came up and said i was wanted by the first lieutenant in the gunroom dont be afraid said he theyve been laughing at it already and the first lieutenant is it a capital humour still hell serve you out well you must expect that shall i make him the sign cross replied i laughing no no youve gone far enough and too far already mind what i say to you i went down into the gunroom when a tittering ceased as the sentry opened the door and i walked in did you want me sir said i to the first lieutenant touching my hat and looking very demure so mr keene i understand it was you who have been practising upon mr green and teaching him insult and disrespect to his superior officers on the quarterdeck well sir i made no reply but appeared very penitent because a boy has just come to sea and is ignorant of his profession it appears to be a customwhich i shall take care shall not be followed upto play him all manner of tricks and tell him all manner of falsehoods now sir what have you to say for yourself mr green and i have both just come to sea sir and the midshipmen all play us so many tricks replied i humbly that i hardly know whether what i do is right or wrong but sir it was you who played this trick to mr green yes sir i told him so for fun but i didnt think he was such a fool as to believe me i only said that you were a freemason and that freemasons were kind to each other and that you gave one another signs to know one another by i heard you say you were a freemason sir when i dined in the gunroom well sir i did say so but that is no reason for your teaching him to be impudent he asked me for the signs sir and i didnt know them exactly so i gave him the signs that mr dott and i always make between us mr dott and youa pretty pair as i said before ive a great mind to put you in mr greens placeat all events i shall report your conduct when the captain comes from london there sir you may go i put on a penitent face as i went out wiping my eyes with the back of my hands after i went out i waited a few seconds at the gunroom door and then the officers supposing that i was out of hearing gave vent to their mirth the first lieutenant laughing the loudest cross is right thought i as i went up the ladder a minute afterwards mr green was set free and after a severe reprimand was allowed to return to his duty you are well out of that trick my hearty said bob cross the first lieutenant wont say a word to the captain never fear but dont try it again but an event occurred a few hours afterwards which might have been attended with more serious consequences the ship was during the day surrounded by shore boats of all descriptions containing jews sailors wives and many other parties who wished to have admittance on board it was almost dusk the tide was running strong flood and the wind was very fresh so that there was a good deal of sea all the boats had been ordered to keep off by the first lieutenant but they still lingered in hope of getting on board i was looking over the stern and perceived that the boat belonging to the bumboat woman who was on board of the ship was lying with her painter fast to the stern ladder the waterman was in her as well as one of the sailors wives who had left her own wherry in hopes of getting on board when the waterman went alongside to take in the articles not sold when the bumboat woman left the ship which would be in a few minutes as it was nearly gunfire for sunset the waterman who thought it time to haul alongside and wished to communicate with his employer on board was climbing up by the stern ladder thats against orders you know cried i to the man yes sir but it is so rough that the boat would be swamped if it were to remain alongside long and i hope you wont order me down again theres some nice cakes in the boat sir just under the stern sheets if you would like to have them and think it worth while to go down for them this was a bribe and i replied no i dont want your cakes but you may come up the man thanked me and walked forward as soon as he had gained the deck on second thoughts i determined that i would have the cakes so i descended by the stern ladder and desiring the woman who was left in the boat to haul upon the rope contrived to get into the boat what is it you want my dear said the woman i come for some of those cakes under the stern sheets replied i well ill soon rummage them out said she and i hope you will let me slip on board when the boat is alongside mind sir how you step youll smash all the pipes give me your hand im an old sailor i should not think so replied i looking at her i could hardly make out her face but her form was small and if an old sailor she certainly was a very young woman we had a good many articles to remove before we could get at the cakes which were under the stern sheets and the boat rocked and tossed so violently with the sea which was running that we were both on our knees for some little while before we obtained the basket when we did to our surprise we found that the boats painter somehow or another had loosened and that during our search we had drifted nearly one hundred yards from the ship mercy on mewhy we are adrift exclaimed the woman what shall we do its no use hailing theyll never hear us look well round for any boat you may see it is getting so dark that we shall not see far replied i not much liking our position where shall we go to go toclean out to st helens if the boat does not fill before we get there and further than that too if i mistake not with this gale of wind we may as well say our prayers youngster i can tell you cant we make sail upon her replied i cant we try and pull on shore somewhere had we not better do that and say our prayers afterwards well said my little bantam replied the woman you would have made a good officer if you had been spared but the fact is boy that we can do nothing with the oars in this heavy sea and as for the sail how can you and i step the mast rolling and tossing about in this way if the mast were stepped and the sail set i think i could manage to steer if the weather was smoother but not in this bubble and this gale it requires older hands than either you or i well then what must we do why we must sit still and trust to our luck bale out the boat and keep her from swamping as long as we can and between times we may cry or we may pray or we may eat the cakes and red herrings or the soft bread and other articles in the boat lets bale the boat out first said i for shes half full of water then well have something to eat for i feel hungry and cold already and then we may as well say our prayers well and i tell you what well have something to drink too for i have a drop for jem if i could have got on board i promised it to him poor fellow but its no use keeping it now for i expect well both be in davys locker before morning the woman took out from where it was secreted in her dress a bladder containing spirits she opened the mouth of it and poured out a portion into one of the milkcans having drunk herself she handed it to me but not feeling inclined and being averse to spirits i rejected it not just now said i byandby perhaps during the time of this conversation we were swept by a strong tide and strong wind right out of the anchorage at spithead the sea was very high and dashed into the boat so that i was continually baling to keep it free the night was as dark as pitch we could see nothing except the lights of the vessels which we had left far away from us and they were now but as little twinkles as we rose upon the waves the wind roared and there was every appearance of a heavy gale little hopes of our weathering this storm said the woman we shall soon be swamped if we do not put her before the wind ill see if i cannot find the lines she did so after a time and by means of a rudder put the boat before the wind the boat then took in much less water but ran at a swift rate through the heavy sea there we shall do better now out to sea we go thats clear said the woman and before daylight we shall be in the channel if we do not fill and go down and then the lord have mercy upon us thats all wont you take a drop continued she pouring out some spirits into the can as i felt very cold i did not this time refuse i drank a small quantity of the spirits the woman took off the remainder which with what she had previously drunk began to have an effect upon her thats right my little trojan said she and she commenced singing a long pull a strong pull and a pull altogether in spite of wind and weather boys in spite of wind and weather poor jem continued she hell be disappointed he made sure of being glorious tonight and i made sure to sleep by his sidenow hell be quite soberand ill be food for fishes its a cold bed that i shall turn into before morning thats certain hand me the cakes boy if you can fumble them out the more we fill ourselves the less room for salt water well then wind and waves are great bullies they fly slap back in a fright when they bang against a great ship but when they get hold of a little boat like this how they leap and topple in as if they made sure of us here a wave dashed into the boat yes thats your sort come along swamp a little boat you washy cowards its only a woman and a boy poor jim hell miss me something but hell miss the liquor more who cares lets have another drop give me the lines then said i as i perceived she was letting them go or we shall be broadside to the waves again i took the rudder lines from her and steered the boat while she again resorted to the bladder of spirits take another sip said she after she had filled the milkcan it wont harm you i thought the same for i was wet through and the wind as it howled pierced me to the bones i took a small quantity as before and then continued to keep the boat before the wind the sea was increasing very much and although no sailor i felt fully convinced that the boat could not live much longer in the meantime the woman was becoming intoxicated very fast i knew the consequence of this and requested her to bale out the boat she did so and sang a mournful sort of song as she baled but the howling of the wind prevented me from distinguishing the words i cannot well analyse my feelings at this timethey were confused but this i know selfpreservation and hope were the most predominant i thought of my mother of my aunt of captain bridgeman captain delmar and bob cross but my thoughts were as rapid as the gale which bore us along and i was too much employed in steering the boat and preventing the seas from filling it to have a moment to collect my ideas again the woman applied to the bladder of spirits and offered some to me i refused i had had enough and by this time she had had too much and after an attempt to bale she dropped down in the stern sheets smashing pipes and everything beneath her and spoke no more we had now been more than four hours adrift the wind was as strong as ever and i thought the sea much higher but i kept the boat steady before the wind and by degrees as i became more accustomed to steer she did not take in so much water still the boat appeared to be sinking deeper down and after a time i considered it necessary to bale her out i did so with my hat for i found it was half full of water and then i execrated the woman for having intoxicated herself so as to be useless in such an emergency i succeeded in clearing the boat of the major portion of the water which was no easy task as the boat having remained broadside to the wind had taken in the sea continually as i baled it out i then once more resumed the helm and put the boat before the wind and thus did i continue for two hours more when the rain came down in torrents and the storm was wilder than ever but a portsmouth wherry is one of the best boats ever built and so it proved in this instance still i was now in a situation most trying for a lad between fourteen and fifteen my teeth chattered with the cold and i was drenched through and through the darkness was opaque and i could see nothing but the white foam of the waves which curled and broke close to the gunwale of the boat at one moment i despaired and looked for immediate death but my buoyant spirit raised me up again and i hoped it would be daylight in a few hours and oh how i looked and longed for daylight i knew i must keep the boat before the wind i did so but the seas were worse than ever they now continually broke into the boat for the tide had turned which had increased the swell again i left the helm and bailed out i was cold and faint and i felt recovered with the exertion i also tried to rouse the woman but it was useless i felt for her bladder of liquor and found it in her bosom more than half empty i drank more freely and my spirits and my courage revived after that i ate and steered the boat awaiting the coming daylight it came at last slowlyso slowly but it did come and i felt almost happy there is such a horror in darkness when added to danger i felt as if i could have worshipped the sun as it rose slowly and with a watery appearance above the horizon i looked around me there was something like land astern of us such as i had seen pointed out as land by bob cross when off the coast of portugal and so it wasit was the isle of wight for the wind had changed when the rain came down and i had altered the course of the boat so that for the last four hours i had been steering for the coast of france but although i was cold and shivering and worn out with watching and tired with holding the lines by which the wherry was steered i felt almost happy at the return of day i looked down upon my companion in the boat she lay sound asleep with her head upon the basket of tobacco pipes her bonnet wet and dripping with its faded ribbons hanging in the water which washed to and fro at the bottom of the boat as it rolled and rocked to the motion of the waves her hair had fallen over her face so as almost to conceal her features i thought that she had died during the night so silent and so breathless did she lie the waves were not so rough now as they had been for the flood tide had again made and as the beams of the morning sun glanced on the water the same billows which appeared so dreadful in the darkness appeared to dance merrily i felt hungry i took up a red herring from one of the baskets and tore it to pieces with my teeth i looked around me in every quarter to see if there was any vessel in sight but there was nothing to be seen but now and then a screaming seagull i tried to rouse my companion by kicking her with my foot i did not succeed in waking her up but she turned round on her back and her hair falling from her face discovered the features of a young and pretty person apparently not more than nineteen or twenty years old her figure was slight and well formed young as i was i thought it a pity that such a nicelooking personfor she still was so although in a state of disorder and very dirty should be so debased by intoxication and as i looked at the bladder still half full of spirits i seized it with an intention to throw it overboard when i paused at the recollection that it had probably saved my life during the night and might yet be required i did not like to alter the course of the boat although i perceived that we were running fast from the land for although the sea had gone down considerably there was still too much for the boat to be put broadside to it i cannot say that i was unhappy i found my situation so very much improved to what it was during the darkness of the night the sun shone bright and i felt its warmth i had no idea of being lostdeath did not enter my thoughts there was plenty to eat and some vessel would certainly pick us up nevertheless i said my prayers more devoutly than i usually did about noon as near as i could guess the tide changed again and as the wind had lulled very much there was little or no swell i thought that now that the motion was not so great we might possibly ship the foremast and make some little sail upon the boat and i tried again more earnestly to rouse up my companion after a few not very polite attempts i succeeded in ascertaining that she was alive be quiet jim said she with her eyes still closed its not five bells yet another kick or two and she turned herself round and stared wildly jim said she rubbing her eyes and then she looked about her and at once she appeared to remember what had passed she shrieked and covered her face up with her hands i thought it was a dream and was going to tell jim all about it at breakfast said she sorrowfully but its all truetrue as gospel what will become of me we are lost lost lost we are not lost but we should have been lost this night if i had been as drunk as you have been replied i ive had work enough to keep the boat above water i can tell you thats truth replied she rising up and taking a seat upon the thwart of the boat god forgive me poor wretch that i am what will jim think and what will he say when he sees my best bonnet in such a pickle are you quite sure that youll ever see jim again or that youll ever want your best bonnet replied i thats true if ones body is to be tossed about by green waves its little matter whether theres a bonnet or shawl on where are we do you know i can just see the land out there replied i pointing astern the sea is smooth i think we could ship the foremast and get sail upon her the young woman stood up in the boat yes said she im pretty steady i think we could last night in the dark and the tossing sea i could do nothing but now i can what a blessing is daylight to cowards like mei am only afraid in the dark we must put some sail upon the boat or nobody will see us what did you do with the bladder of liquor threw it overboard replied i had you courage to do thatand watching through the the night so wet and cold well you did righti could not have done it oh that liquorthat liquor i wish there wasnt such a thing in the world but its too late now when i first married james pearson and the garland was hung to the mainstay of the frigate nobody could persuade me to touch it not even james himself whom i loved so much instead of quarrelling with me for not drinking it as he used to do he now quarrels with me for drinking the most if youll come forward sir and help me well soon get up the foremast this is it you see with the jib passed round it jim often says that id make a capital sailor if id only enter in mans clothesbut as i tell him i should be put up at the gangway for not being sober before id been on board a week we contrived to ship the mast and set the jib and foresail as soon as the sheets were hauled aft my companion took the steering lines saying i know how to manage her well enough now its daylight and im quite sober you must be very tired sir so sit down on the thwart or lie down if you please and take a nap alls safe enough nowsee we lie up well for the land and such was the case for she had brought the boat to the wind and we skimmed over the waves at the rate of three or four miles an hour i had no inclination to sleep i baled the boat out thoroughly and put the baskets and boxes into some kind of order i then sat down on the thwarts first looking round for a vessel in sight but seeing none i entered into conversation with my companion what is your name said i peggy pearson i have my marriage lines to show they can throw nothing in my face except that im fond of liquor god forgive me and what makes you so fond of it now since you say that when you were married you did not care for it you may well say that it all came of sipping james would have me on his knee and would insist on my taking a sip and to please him i did although it made me almost sick at first and then after a while i did not mind it and then you see when i was waiting at the sallyport with the other women the wind blowing fresh and the spray wetting us as we stood on the shingle with our arms wrapped up in our aprons looking out for a boat from the ship to come on shore they would have a quartern and make me take a drop and so it went on then james made me bring him liquor on board and i drank some with him but what finished me was that i heard something about james when he was at plymouth which made me jealous and then for the first time i got tipsy after that it was all over with me but as i said before it began with sippingworse luck but its done now tell me what has passed during the night has the weather been very bad i told her what had occurred and how i had kicked her to wake her up well i deserved more than kicking and youre a fine brave fellow and if we get on board the calliope againand i trust to god we shall ill take care to blow the trumpet for you as you deserve i dont want any one to blow the trumpet for me replied i dont you be proud a good word from me may be of use to you and its what you deserve the ships company will think highly of you i can tell you a good name is of no small valuea captain has found out that before now youre only a lad but youre a regular trump and the seamen shall all know it and the officers too we must get on board the ship first replied i and we are a long way from it just now were all right and i have no fear if we dont see a vessel we shall fetch the land somewhere before tomorrow morning and it dont look as if there would be any more bad weather i wonder if they have sent anything out to look after us whats that said i pointing astern its a sail of some kind yes said peggy so it is its a squarerigged vessel coming up the channelwe had better get on the other tack and steer for her we wore the boat round and ran in the direction of the vessel in three hours we were close to her i hailed her as she came down upon us but no one appeared to hear us or see us for she had lower studdingsails set and there was no one forward we hailed again and the vessel was now within twenty yards and we were right across her bows a man came forward and cried out starboard your helm but not in sufficient time to prevent the vessel from striking the wherry and to stave her quarter in we dropped alongside as the wherry filled with water and we were hauled in by the seamen over the gunwale just as she turned over and floated away astern touch and go my lad said one of the seamen who had hauled me on board why dont you keep a better look out said peggy pearson shaking her petticoats which were wet up to the knees paint eyes in the bows of your brig if you havent any yourself now youve lost a boatful of redherrings eggs and soft tommyno bad things after a long cruise we meant to have paid our passage with themnow you must take us for nothing the master of the vessel who was on deck observed that i was in the uniform of an officer he asked me how it was we were found in such a situation i narrated what had passed in few words he said that he was from cadiz bound to london and that he would put us on shore at any place up the river i would like but that he could not lose the chance of the fair wind to land me anywhere else i was too thankful to be landed anywhere and telling him that i should be very glad if he could put me on shore at sheerness which was the nearest place to chatham i asked leave to turn into one of the cabin bedplaces and was soon fast asleep i may as well here observe that i had been seen by the sentry abaft to go down by the stern ladder into the boat and when the waterman came back shortly afterwards to haul his boat up and perceived that it had gone adrift there was much alarm on my account it was too dark to send a boat after us that night but the next morning the case was reported to the admiral of the port who directed a cutter to get under weigh and look for us the cutter had kept close in shore for the first day and it was on the morning after i was picked up by the brig that in standing more out she had fallen in with the wherry bottom up this satisfied them that we had perished in the rough night and it was so reported to the portadmiral and to captain delmar who had just come down from london i slept soundly till the next morning when i found that the wind had fallen and that it was nearly calm peggy pearson was on deck she had washed herself and smoothed out with an iron the ribbons of her bonnet and was really a very handsome young woman mr keene said she i didnt know your name before you told it to the skipper here youre in a pretty scrape i dont know what jim pearson will say when you go back running away with his wife as you have done dont you think i had better go back first and smooth things over oh you laugh now replied i but you didnt laugh the night we went adrift because it was no laughing matter i owe my life to you and if i had been adrift by myself i should never have put my foot on shore again do you know said she to me very solemnly ive made a vowyes a vow to heaven that ill leave off drinking and i only hope i may have strength given me to keep it can you keep it said i i think i can for when i reflect that i might have gone to my account in that state i really feel a horror of liquor if james would only give it up im sure i could i swear that i never will bring him any more on boardthats settled he may scold me he may beat me i dont think he would do that for he never has yet but let him do what he pleases i never will and if he keeps sober because he hasnt the means of getting tipsy i am sure that i shall keep my vow you dont know how i hate myself and although im merry its only to prevent my sitting down and crying like a child at my folly and wickedness in yielding to temptation i little thought to hear this from you when i was with you in the boat i thought you a very different person a woman who drinks mr keene is lost to everything ive often thought of it after ive become sober again five years ago i was the best girl in the school i was the monitor and wore a medal for good conduct i thought that i should be so happy with james i loved him so and do so still i knew that he was fond of liquor but i never thought that he would make me drink i thought then that i should cure him and with the help of god i will now not only him but myself too and i will here state that peggy pearson whose only fault was the passion she had imbibed for drinking did keep her vow the difficulty of which few can understand who have not been intemperate themselves and she not only continued sober herself but by degrees broke her husband of his similar propensity to liquor it was not till the evening of the fourth that we arrived at the nore i had four pounds in my pocket at the time that i went adrift which was more than sufficient even if i had not intended to go and see my mother a wherry came alongside and peggy pearson and i stepped into it after i had thanked the captain and given a sovereign to the seamen to drink my health as soon as we landed at sheerness i gave another of my sovereigns to peggy and left her to find her way back to portsmouth while i walked up to chatham to my mothers house it was past eight oclock and quite dark when i arrived the shop was closed and the shutters up at the front door so i went round to the back to obtain admittance the door was not fast and i walked into the little parlour without meeting with anybody i heard somebody upstairs and i thought i heard sobbing it then struck me that my supposed loss might have been communicated to my mother there was a light on the parlour table and i perceived an open letter lying near to it i looked at it it was the handwriting of captain delmar the candle required snuffing i raised the letter to the light that i might read it and read as follows my dear arabella you must prepare yourself for very melancholy tidings and it is most painful to me to be compelled to be the party who communicates them a dreadful accident has occurred and indeed i feel most sincerely for you on the night of the th percival was in a boat which broke adrift from the ship in a gale of wind it was dark and the fact not known until too late to render any assistance the next day a cutter was despatched by the admiral to look for the boat which must have been driven out to sea there was a woman in the boat as well as our poor boy alas i regret to say that the boat was found bottom up and there is no doubt but that our dear child has perished you will believe me when i say that i deeply lament his loss not only on your account but because i had become most partial to him for his many good qualities and often have i regretted that his peculiar position prevented me from showing him openly that regard which as his father i really felt for him i know that i can say nothing that will alleviate your sufferings and yet i fain would for you have been so true and anxious to please me in every point since our first acquaintance and intimacy that there is nothing that you do not deserve at my hands comfort yourself dear arabella as well as you can with the reflection that it has been the will of heaven to whose decrees we must submit with resignation i am deeply suffering myself for had he lived i swear to you that i intended to do much more for him than ever i had promised you he would have made a good and gallant sailor had it pleased heaven to spare him and you would have been proud of him but it has been decided otherwise and we must bow in obedience to his will god bless you and support you in your afflictions and believe me still yours most sincerely and faithfully percival delmar then it is so thought i here i have it under his own hand i immediately folded up the letter and put it into my bosom you and i never part that is certain murmured i i had almost lost my breath from emotion and i sat down to recover myself after a minute or two i pulled the letter out and read it over again and he is my father and he loves me but dare not show it and he intended to do more for me than even he had promised my mother i folded up the letter kissed it fervently and replaced it in my bosom now thought i what shall i do this letter will be required of me by my mother but never shall she get it not tears nor threats nor entreaties shall ever induce me to part with it what shall i do nobody has seen menobody knows that i have been here i will go directly and join my ship yes that will be my best plan i was so occupied with my own reverie that i did not perceive a footstep on the stairs until the party was so far down that i could not retreat i thought to hide myself i knew by the list shoes that it must be my grandmother a moment of reflection i blew out the light on the table and put myself in an attitude one arm raised aloft the other extended from my body and with my mouth wide open and my eyes fixed i awaited her approach she came insaw meuttered a fearful shriek and fell senseless on the floor the candle in her hand was extinguished in the fall i stepped over her body and darting out into the backyard gained the door and was in the street in a minute chapter seventeen i was soon in the high road and clear of the town of chatham as my object was that it should not be supposed that i had been there i made all the haste i could to increase my distance i therefore walked on in the direction of gravesend where i arrived about ten oclock a return chaise offered to take me to greenwich for a few shillings and before morning dawned i had gained the metropolis i lost no time in inquiring when the coaches started for portsmouth and found that i was in plenty of time as one set off at nine oclock much as i wished to see london my curiosity gave way to what i considered the necessity of my immediate return to the frigate at seven oclock in the evening i arrived at portsmouth i hastened down jumped into a wherry and was on board of the frigate again by eight it may be imagined that my sudden and unexpected appearance caused no little surprise indeed the first lieutenant considered it right to send the gig on shore at that late hour to apprise the captain of my return and bob cross had just time to give me a wring of the hand before he jumped into the boat and went away to make the report i gave a history of my adventures to the officers leaving them however to suppose that i had never been to chatham but had gone up to london in the merchant vessel pearson the boatswains mate came to make inquiries about his wife and soon after bob cross came on board with the captains orders that i should go on shore to him in the gig on the following morning i wished very much to consult bob cross previous to my seeing the captain i told him so and he agreed to meet me on the gangway about ten oclock as by that time the officers would be almost all in bed and there would be less chance of interruption it was a fine clear night and as soon as we found ourselves alone i narrated to him in a low voice all that had taken place and gave him the contents of the letter which i had taken possession of i then asked him what he thought i ought to do now that i was certain of being the son of the captain why master keene you have done it very cleverly thats the truth and that letter which is as good as a certificate from captain delmar must be taken great care of i hardly know where it ought to be put but i think the best thing will be for me to sew it in a sealskin pouch that i have and then you can wear it round your neck and next your skin for as you say you and that must never part company but master keene you must be silent as death about it you have told me and i hope i may be trusted but trust nobody else as to saying or hinting anything to the captain you mustnt think of it you must go on as before as if you knew nothing for if he thought you had the letter in your possession he would forget you were his son and perhaps hate you he never would have been induced to acknowledge you under his own hand as his son had he not thought that you were dead and gone as everybody else did so behave just as respectful and distant as before its only in some great emergency that that letter will do you any good and you must reserve it in case of need if your mother is suspicious why you must blind her your granny will swear that it was your ghost your mother may think otherwise but cannot prove it she dare not tell the captain that she suspects you have the letter and it will all blow over after a cruise or two i agreed to follow the advice of bob cross as i saw it was good and we parted for the night the next morning i went on shore to the captain who received me very stiffly with mr keene you have had a narrow escape how did you get back i replied that the vessel which picked me up was bound to london and that i had taken the coach down well i never had an idea that we should have seen you again and i have written to your mother acquainting her with your loss have you sir replied i it will make her very unhappy of course it will but i shall write by this post stating that you have been so fortunately preserved thanky sir replied i have you any further orders sir no mr keene you may go on board and return to your duty i made my bow and quitted the room went down below and found bob cross waiting for me well said he as we walked away stiff as ever replied i told me to go on board and tend to my duty well i knew it would be so replied bob its hard to say what stuff them great nobs are made of never mind that youve your own game to play and your own secret to keep his secret replied i biting my lips to keep or to tell as may happen dont let your vexation get the better of you master keene youve the best of it if you only keep your temper let him play his cards and you play yours as you know his cards and he dont know yours you must win the game in the endthat is if you are commonly prudent you are right cross replied i but you forget that i am but a boy you are but a boy master keene but youve no fools head on your shoulders i hope not replied i but here we are at the boat yes and as i live heres peggy pearson well peggy how did you like your cruise with master keene if i ever go on another i hope he will be my companion master keene will you allow me to go on board with you to see my husband oh yes peggy replied cross the first lieutenant would not refuse you after what has happened nor captain delmar either stiff as he is for although he never shows it he dont want feeling jim will be glad to see you peggy you havent an idea how he took on when he heard of your loss he borrowed a pockethandkerchief from the corporal of marines i suspect hed rather borrow a bottle of rum from the purser replied peggy recollect peggy said i holding up my finger mr keene i do recollect i pledge you my word that i have not tasted a drop of spirits since we partedand that with a sovereign in my pocket well only keep to itthats all i will indeed mr keene and whats more i shall love you as long as i live we pulled on board in the gig and peggy was soon in the arms of her husband as pearson embraced her at the gangwayfor he could not help itthe first lieutenant very kindly said pearson i shant want you on deck till after dinner you may go below with your wife now may god bless you for a crosslooking kindhearted gentleman said peggy to the first lieutenant peggy was as good as her word to me she gave such an account of my courage and presence of mind of her fears and at last of her getting tipsyof my remaining at the helm and managing the boat all night by myself that i obtained great reputation among the ships company and it was all reported to the officers and worked its way until it came from the first lieutenant to the captain and from the captain to the port admiral this is certain that peggy pearson did do me a good service for i was no longer looked upon as a mere youngster who had just come to sea and who had not been tried well sir said bob cross a day or two afterwards it seems by peggy pearsons report that youre not frightened at a trifle peg pearsons report wont do me much good you ought to know better master keene than to say that a mouse may help a lion as the fable says where did you learn all your fables cross ill tell you theres a nice little girl that used to sit on my knee and read her fables to me and i listened to her because i loved her and does she do so now oh no shes too big for thatshed blush up to the temples but never mind the girl or the fables i told you that peggy had reported your conduct as we say in the service now do you know that this very day i heard the first lieutenant speaking of it to the captain and youve no idea how proud the captain looked although he pretended to care nothing about it i watched him and he looked as much as to say thats my boy well if that pleases him ill make him prouder yet of me if i have the opportunity replied i that you will master keene if im any judge of fizonomy and thats the way to go to a parents heart make him feel proud of you i did not forget this as the reader will eventually discover i had written to my mother giving her a long account of my adventures but not saying a word of my having been at chatham i made her suppose as i did the captain that i had been carried up to london my letter reached her the day after the one announcing my safety written to her by captain delmar she answered me by return of post thanking heaven for my preservation and stating how great had been her anguish and misery at my supposed loss in the latter part of the letter was this paragraph strange to say on the night of the th when i was on my bed in tears having but just received the news of your loss your grandmother went downstairs and declares that she saw you or your ghost in the little back parlour at all events i found her insensible on the floor so that she must have seen something she might have been frightened at nothing and yet i know not what to think for there are circumstances which almost make me believe that somebody was in the house i presume you can prove an alibi that my mother had been suspicious perhaps more than suspicious from the disappearance of the letter i was convinced when i replied to her i said my alibi is easily proved by applying to the master and seamen of the vessel on board of which i was old granny must have been frightened at her own shadow the idea of my coming to your house and having left it without seeing you is rather too absurd granny must have invented the story because she hates me and thought to make you do the same whatever my mother may have thought she did not again mention the subject i had however a few days afterwards a letter from my aunt milly in which she laughingly told the same story of granny swearing that she had seen me or my ghost at first we thought it was your ghost but since a letter from captain delmar to your mother has been missing it is now imagined that you have been here and have taken possession of it you will tell me my dearest percival im sure if you did play this trick to granny or not you know you may trust me with any of your tricks but i was not in this instance to be wheedled by my aunt i wrote in return saying how much i was amazed at my grandmother telling such fibs and proved to her most satisfactorily that i was in london at the time they supposed i might have been at chatham that my aunt had been requested by my mother to try to find out the truth i was well convinced but i felt my secret of too much importance to trust either of them and from that time the subject was never mentioned and i believe it was at last surmised that the letter might have been destroyed accidentally or purposely by the maidservant and that my grandmother had been frightened at nothing at allan opinion more supported as the maid who had taken advantage of my mothers retiring to her room and had been out gossiping declared that she had not left the premises three minutes and not a soul could have come in moreover it was so unlikely that i could have been in chatham without being recognised by somebody my grandmother shook her head and said nothing during all this canvassing of the question but my aunt milly declared that i never would have been at chatham without coming to see her and it was her opinion that the servant girl had read the letter when left on the table and had taken it out to show to her associates and somebody who wished to have a hold upon my mother by the possession of the letter had retained it i think my mother came to that opinion at last and it was the source of much uneasiness to her she dared not say a word to captain delmar and every day expected to have an offer made of returning the letter upon a certain sum being paid down but the offer was never made as the letter had been sewed up by bob cross in the piece of sealskin and was worn round my neck with a ribbon with as much care as if it had been a supposed bit of the wood of the true cross possessed by some old female catholic devotee but long before all these discussions were over hm ship calliope had been ordered to sail and was steering down the channel before a smart breeze chapter eighteen although i have so much to say as to oblige me to pass over without notice the majority of my companions i think i ought to dedicate one chapter to a more particular description of those with whom i was now principally in contact on board of the calliope i have already spoken much of the honourable captain delmar but i must describe him more particularly when young he must have been a very handsome man even now although nearly fifty years of age and his hair and whiskers a little mixed with grey he was a finelooking personage of florid complexion large blue eyes nose and mouth very perfect in height he was full six feet and he walked so erect that he looked even taller there was precision i may say dignity in all his motions if he turned to you it was slowly and deliberately there was nothing like rapidity in his movement on the most trifling occasions he wrapped himself up in etiquette with all the consequence of a spanish hidalgo and showed in almost every action and every word that he never forgot his superiority of birth no one except myself perhaps would ever have thought of taking a liberty with him for although there was a pomposity about him at the same time it was the pomposity of a highbred gentleman who respected himself and expected every one to do the same that sometimes a little mirth was occasioned by his extreme precision is true but it was whispered not boldly indulged in as to his qualities as an officer and seaman i shall only say that they were considered more than respectable long habit of command had given him a fair knowledge of the duties in the first instance and he never condescended indeed it would have been contrary to his character to let the officers or seamen know whether he did or did not know anything about the second as to his moral character i can only say that it was very difficult to ascertain it that he would never do that which was in the slightest degree derogatory to the character of a gentleman was most certain but he was so wrapped up in exclusiveness that it was almost impossible to estimate his feelings occasionally i may say very rarely he might express them but if he did it was but for a moment and he was again reserved as before that he was selfish is true but who is not and those in high rank are still more so than others not so much by nature but because their self is encouraged by those around them you could easily offend his pride but he was above being flattered in a gross way i really believe that the person in the ship for whom he had the least respect was the obsequious mr culpepper such was the honourable captain delmar mr hippesley the first lieutenant was a broadshouldered ungainlylooking personage he had more the appearance of a master in the service than a first lieutenant he was a thorough seaman and really for a first lieutenant a very goodnatured man all that was requisite was to allow his momentary anger to have free escape by the safetyvalve of his mouth if you did not an explosion was sure to be the result he was as we use the term at sea a regular ship husbandthat is to say he seldom put his foot on shore and if he did he always appeared anxious to get on board again he was on good terms but not familiar with his messmates and very respectful to the captain there was no other officer in the service who would have suited captain delmar so well as mr hippesley who although he might occasionally grumble at not being promoted appeared on the whole to be very indifferent about the matter the men were partial to him as they always are to one who whatever may be his peculiarities is consistent nothing is more unpleasant to men than to sail under a person whom to use their own expression they never knew where to find the second and third lieutenants mr percival and mr weymss were young men of good family and were admitted to a very slight degree of familiarity with captain delmar they were of gentlemanly manners both good seamen and kind to their inferiors mr culpepper the purser was my abominationa nasty earwigging flattering bowing old rogue the master mr smith was a very quiet man plain and unoffending but perfectly master of and always attentive to his duty the marine officer mr tusk was a nonentity put into a red jacket the surgeon was a tall and very finicking sort of gentleman as to dress but well informed friendly in disposition and perfectly acquainted with his profession my messmates were most of them young men of good birth with the exception of tommy dott who was the son of a warrant officer and mr green whose father was a bootmaker in london i shall not however waste my readers time upon them they will appear when required i shall therefore now proceed with my narrative it is usually the custom for the midshipmen to take up provisions and spirits beyond their allowance and pay the purser an extra sum for the same but this mr culpepper would not permitindeed he was the most stingy and disagreeable old fellow that i ever met with in the service we never had dinner or grog enough or even lights sufficient for our wants we complained to the first lieutenant but he was not inclined to assist us he said we had our allowance and it was all we could demand that too much grog was bad for us and as for candles they only made us sit up late when we ought to be in bed he was moreover very strict about the lights being put out this however was the occasion of war to the knife between the midshipmen and mr culpepper but it was of no avail he would seldom trust his own steward or the mate of the main deck whenever he could he superintended the serving out of all provisions and mixing of the grog no wonder that he was said to be a rich man the only party to whom he was civil was mr hippesley the first lieutenant and the captain both of whom had the power of annoying him and reducing his profits to the captain he was all humility every expense that he required was with his proffered bow cheerfully submitted to but he gained on the whole by this apparent liberality as the captain was rather inclined to protect him in all other points of service except those connected with his own comforts and luxuries and many a good job did mr culpepper get done for him by humbly requesting and obsequiously bowing we had been at sea for about a week and were running down towards the island of madeira which we expected to reach the next morning our destination was a secret as our captain sailed with sealed orders to be opened when off that island the weather was very fine and warm and the wind had fallen when at sundown high land was reported from the masthead at about forty miles distant i was as on the former cruise signal midshipman and did day dutythat is i went down with the sun and kept no night watch i had been cogitating how i could play some trick to mr culpepper the midshipmen had often proposed that we should do so but i had made up my mind that whenever i did i would make no confidant tommy dott often suggested an idea but i invariably refused as a secret is only a secret when it is known to one person for that reason i never consulted bob cross because i knew that he would have persuaded me not to do so but after anything was happily executed i then used to confide in him i observed before that mr culpepper wore a flaxen wig and i felt sure from his penuriousness that he was not likely to have more than one on board i therefore fixed upon his wig as the object of my vengeance and having made up my mind on the night that we made the island of madeira i determined to put my project in execution for convenience the first lieutenant had a small ladder which went down through the skylight of the gunroom so that they could descend direct instead of going round by the afterhatchway and entering by the gunroom doors where the sentry was placed i went to my hammock and slept till the middle watch was called i then got up and dressed myself without being perceived as soon as the lieutenant of the middle watch had been called by the mate who lighted his candle and left him to dress himself i came up by the afterladder and watching an opportunity when the sentry at the captains cabin door had walked forward i softly descended by the skylight ladder into the gunroom the light in the cabin of the lieutenant who was dressing was quite sufficient and the heat of the weather was so great that all the officers slept with their cabin doors fastened back for ventilation i had therefore no difficulty in putting my hand on the pursers wig with which i escaped unperceived and immediately turned in again to my hammock to consider what i should do with my prize should i throw it overboard should i stuff it down the pumpwell or slip it into the ships coppers that it might reappear when the peasoup was baled out or dinner or should i put it into the manger forward where the pigs were in the meantime while i was considering the matter the midshipman of the first watch came down and turned in and all was again quiet except an occasional nasal melody from some heavy sleeper at last quite undecided i peeped through the clews of my hammock to see what the sentry at the gunroom door was about and found that he had sat down on a chest and was fast asleep i knew immediately that the man was in my power and i did not fear him and then it was that the idea came into my head that i would singe the pursers wig i went softly to the sentrys light took it from the hook and went down with it into the cockpit as being the best place for carrying on my operations the wig was very greasy and every curl as i held it in the candle flared up and burned beautifully to within a quarter of an inch of the caul it was soon done and i replaced the sentrys light and finding that the gunroom door was ajar i went in softly and replaced the wig where i had taken it from repassed the sentry who was still fast asleep and regained my hammock intending to undress myself in it but i had quite forgotten one thing i was soon reminded of iti heard the voice of the officer of the watch i calling out to the sentry at the cabin door sentry whats that smell of burning i dont know sir replied the sentry i was just thinking of going forward for the ships corporal the smell which had gradually ascended from the cockpit now spread from deck to deck and became stronger and stronger the gunroomdoor sentry jumped up at the voice of the lieutenant and called out that there was a very strong smell in the cockpit the lieutenant and mate of the watch came down and it was immediately supposed that the spiritroom had caught fire for the smell was really very powerful the first lieutenant who had wakened up at the voices was out in a minute he put his head over the cockpit and ordering the officer of the watch to call the drummer and beat to quarters ran up to inform the captain the drummer was out in a moment and seizing his drum which hung up by the mainmast ran up in his shirt and beat the tattoo the whole ships company rose up at the sound which they knew was the signal for something important and the beat of the drum was followed up by the shrill piping of the boatswains mates at each hatchway at that moment some frightened man belonging to the watch cried out that the ship was on fire and the lower decks were immediately a scene of bustle and confusion perhaps there is nothing more awful than the alarm of fire at sea the feeling that there is no escapethe only choice being by which element fire or water you choose to perish but if it is awful in daylight how much more so is it to be summoned up to await such peril when you have been sleeping in fancied bounty the captain had hurried on his clothes and stood on the quarterdeck he was apparently calm and collected but as usual the first lieutenant carried on the duty and well he did it wheres the gunner mr hutt bring up the keys from my cabin and have all ready for clearing the magazines if required firemen get your buckets to bear carpenters rig the pumps silence there fore and aft but the confusion became very great and there evidently was a panic the captain then interposed calling out to the boatswain and his mates to send every man aft on the quarterdeck this order was obeyed the men came thronging like a flock of sheep huddling together and breathless silence there my men cried captain delmarsilence i say is this the conduct of menofwarsmen every man of you sit down on deck pass the word there for every man to sit down the order was mechanically obeyed and as soon as the ships company were all seated the captain said i tell you what my lads im ashamed of you the way to put out a fire is to be cool and calm obeying orders and keeping silence now collect yourselves all of you for until you are all quiet and cool you will sit where you are after a pause of a few seconds now my men are you more steady recollect be cool and keep silence carpenter are the pumps rigged yes sir replied the carpenter now firemen go for your buckets let nobody else move silencenot a word three foremast guns maindeck to your quarters silence and quiet if you please now are you all steadythen to your quarters my men and wait for orders it was astonishing how collected the ships company became by the judicious conduct of the captain who now continued to command when the men had gone down to their stations he directed the two junior lieutenants to go and examine where the fire was and to be careful not to lift the hatches if they discovered that it was in the spiritroom i had been on the quarterdeck some time and being aware of the cause of course was not at all alarmed and i had exerted myself very assiduously in keeping the men cool and quiet shoving the men down who were unwilling to sit down on the deck and even using them very roughly showing a great deal more sang froid than any other of the officers which of course was not to be wondered at mr culpepper who was most terribly alarmed had come up on deck and stood trembling close to the side of the captain and first lieutenant he had pulled on his wig without discovering that it had been burnt and as i passed him the burnt smell was very strong indeed so thought the captain and the first lieutenant who were waiting the return of the officers i smell the fire very strong just now said the captain to the first lieutenant yes sir every now and then it is very strong replied the first lieutenant the pursers wig was just between themno wonder that they smelt it after two or three minutes the officers came up and reported that they could discover no fire and that there was very little smell of fire down below and yet i smell it now said captain delmar so do i sir said the second lieutenant and it really smells stronger on deck than it does down below its very odd let them continue the search the search was continued the first lieutenant now going down and after a time they said that the strongest smell was from the pursers cabin mr culpepper they say the smell is in your cabin said captain delmar go down if you please they may want to open your lockers mr culpepper who still trembled like an aspen went down the ladder and i followed him but in descending the second ladder his foot slipped and he fell down the hatchway to the lower deck i hastened down after him he was stunned and i thought this a good opportunity to pull off his wig which i did very dexterously and concealed it he was taken into the gunroom and the surgeon called while i walked up on deck and quietly dropped the wig overboard at the gangway my reason for doing this was that having no idea that my trick would have created so much confusion and have turned up the officers and men as it did i thought that the pursers wig would the next morning account for the smell of fire and an investigation take place which although it might not lead to discovery would certainly lead to suspicion so the wig was now floating away and with the wig went away all evidence after a search of nearly half an hour nothing was discovered the drummer was ordered to beat the retreat and all was quiet again i went to bed quite satisfied with the events of the night and slept the sleep of innocenceat least i slept just as soundly this mysterious affair ever remained a mystery the only loss was the pursers wig but that was nothing as mr culpepper acknowledged that he did not know himself what he was about and for all he knew to the contrary he might have thrown it overboard my conduct on this occasion again gained me great credit it had been remarked by the captain and officers and i rose in estimation how i might have behaved had i really supposed that the ship was on fire is quite another affairi presume not quite so fearlessly as it was i was resolved to take all the credit given to me and for that reason it was not till a long while afterwards that i hinted the secret even to bob cross chapter nineteen the next morning when we arrived at funchal we found that our orders were for the west indies we stayed one day to take in wine and then hove up the anchor and went on to our destination we soon got into the trades and run them fast down till we arrived at carlisle bay barbadoes where we found the admiral and delivered our despatches we were ordered to water and complete as soon as possible as we were to be sent on a cruise tommy dott my quondam ally was in disgrace he had several times during the cruise proposed that i should join him in several plots of mischief but i refused as i did not consider them quite safe you are not the keen fellow i thought you were said he you are up to nothing now theres no fun in you as there used to be he was mistaken there was fun in me but there was also prudence and from what i had latterly seen of tommy dott i did not think he was to be trusted the day after we anchored at carlisle bay tommy came to me and said old culpepper serves out plums and suet this afternoon i heard him tell steward now i think we may manage to get somei never saw better plums on board of a ship well said i i like raisins as well as you do tommybut what is your plan why ive got my squirt and old culpepper never lights more than one of his pursers dips small candles in the stewards room ill get down in the cockpit in the dark and squirt at the candlethe water will put it out and hell send the steward for another light and then ill try and get some it was not a bad plan but still i refused to join in it as it was only the work of one person and not two i pointed that out to him and he agreed with me saying that he would do it himself when mr culpepper went down into the stewards room tommy reconnoitred and then came into the berth and filled his squirt although i would not join him i thought i might as well see what was going on and therefore descended the cockpit ladder soon after tommy keeping out of the way in the foremost part of the cockpit where it was quite dark tommy directed his squirt very dexterously hit the lighted wick of the solitary candle which fizzed sputtered and finally gave up the ghost bless me said mr culpepper what can that be a leak from the seams above i suppose said the steward i will go to the gallery for another light yes yes be quick said mr culpepper who remained in the stewards room in the dark until the return of the steward tommy dott then slipped in softly and commenced filling all his pockets with the raisins he had nearly taken in his full cargo when somehow or another mr culpepper stepped forward from where he stood and he touched tommy whom he immediately seized crying out thieves thievescall the sentrysentry come here the sentry of the gunroom door went down the ladder as mr culpepper dragged out tommy holding him fast by both hands take him sentrytake him in charge call the masteratarmslittle thief mr dott hahwell well see the consequence was that mr tommy dott was handed from the sentry to the masteratarms and taken up on the quarterdeck followed by mr culpepper and his steward there was no defence or excuse to be made the pockets of his jacket and of his trowsers were stuffed with raisins and at the bottom of his pocket when they were emptied by the masteratarms was found the squirt as soon as the hue and cry was over and all the parties were on the quarterdeck as the coast was clear i thought i might as well take advantage of it and therefore i came out from my hidingplace went into the stewards room filled my handkerchief with raisins and escaped to the berth unperceived so that while tommy dott was disgorging on the quarterdeck i was gorging below mr dott was reported to the captain for this heinous offence and in consequence was ordered below under arrest his place in the captains gig being filled up by me so that in every point of view tommy suffered and i reaped the harvest what pleased me most was that being midshipman of the captains boat i was of course continually in the company of the coxswain bob cross but i must not delay at present as i have to record a very serious adventure which occurred and by which i for a long while was separated from my companions and shipmates in ten days we sailed in search of a pirate vessel which was reported to have committed many dreadful excesses and had become the terror of the mercantile navy our orders were to proceed northward and to cruise off the virgin islands near which she was said to have been last seen about three weeks after we had left carlisle bay the lookout man reported two strange sail from the masthead i was sent up as signal mid to examine them and found that they were both schooners hove to close together one of them very rakish in their appearance all sail in chase was made immediately and we came up within three miles of them when one evidently the pirate we were in search of made sail while the other remained hove to as we passed the vessel hove to which we took it for granted was a merchantman which the pirate had been plundering the captain ordered one of the cutters to be lowered down with a midshipman and boats crew to take possession of her the men were all in the boat but the midshipman had gone down for his spyglass or something else and as it was merely with a view of ascertaining what the vessel was and the chief object was to overtake the pirate vessel to prevent the delay which was caused by the other midshipman not being ready mr hippesley ordered me to go into the boat instead of him and as soon as i was on board of the schooner to make sail and follow the frigate the captain did say he is too young mr hippesley is he not id sooner trust him than many older sir was the reply of the first lieutenant jump in mr keene i did so with my telescope in my hand lower away my ladsunhook and sheer off and away went the frigate in pursuit of the pirate vessel leaving me in the boat to go on board of the schooner we were soon alongside and found that there was not a soul on board of the vessel what had become of the crew whether they had been murdered or not it was impossible to say but there were a few drops of blood on the deck the vessel was an american bound to one of the islands with shingle and fir planks not only was her hold full but the fir planks were piled up on each side of the deck between the masts to the height of five or six feet the pirate had apparently been taking some of the planks on board for her own use we dropped the boat astern let draw the foresheet and made sail after the frigate which was now more than a mile from us and leaving us very fast the schooner was so overloaded that she sailed very badly and before the evening closed in we could just perceive the topgallant sails of the calliope above the horizon but this we thought little of as we knew that as soon as she had captured the pirate she would run back again and take us out there were some hams and other articles on board for the pirates had not taken everything although the lockers had been all broken open and the articles were strewed about in every direction in the cabin and on the deck just before dark we took the bearings of the frigate and stood the same course as she was doing and then we sat down to a plentiful meal to which we did justice i then divided the boats crew into watches went down into the cabin and threw myself on the standing bedplace of which there was but one with all my clothes on the men who had not the watch went down and turned in in the cuddy forward where the seamen usually sleep it was not till past midnight that i could obtain any sleep the heat was excessive and i was teased by the cockroaches which appeared to swarm in the cabin to an incredible degree and were constantly running over my face and body i little thought then why they swarmed i recollect that i dreamt of murder and tossing men overboard and then of the vessel being on fire and after that i felt very cool and comfortable and i dreamed no more i thought that i heard a voice calling my name it appeared that i did hear it in my sleep but i slept on at last i turned round and felt a splashing as of water and some water coming into my mouth i awoke all was dark and quiet i put my hand out and i put it into the waterwhere was iwas i overboard i jumped up in my fright i found that was still on the standing bedplace but the water was above the mattress i immediately comprehended that the vessel was sinking and i called out but there was no reply i turned out of the bedplace and found myself up to my neck in water with my feet on the cabindeck half swimming and half floundering i gained the ladder and went up the hatchway it was still quite dark and i could not perceive nor hear anybody i called out but there was no reply i then was certain that the men had left the vessel when they round her sinking and had left me to sink with her i may as well here observe that when the men had found the water rising upon them forward they had rushed on deck in a panic telling the man at the wheel that the vessel was sinking and had immediately hauled up the boat to save their lives but they did recollect me and the coxswain of the boat had come down in the cabin by the ladder and called me but the cabin was full of water and he receiving no answer considered that i was drowned and returned on deck the boat had then shoved off and i was left to my fate still i hoped that such was not the case and i hallooed again and again but in vain and i thought it was all over with me it was a dreadful position to be in i said my prayers and prepared to die and yet i thought it was hard to die at fifteen years old although i do not consider that my prayers were of much efficacy for there was but little resignation in them praying had one good effect it composed me and i began to think whether there was any chance of being saved yes there were plenty of planks on the deck and if it were daylight i could tie them together and make a raft which would bear me up how i longed for daylight for i was afraid that the vessel would sink before i could see to do what was requisite the wind had become much fresher during the night and the waves now dashed against the sides of the waterlogged vessel as i watched for daylight i began to reflect how this could have happened and it occurred to me that the pirates had scuttled the bottom of the vessel to sink her and in this conjecture i was right at last a faint light appeared in the east which soon broke into broad day and i lost no time in setting about my work before i began however i thought it advisable to ascertain how much more water there was in the vessel since i had quitted the cabin which it appeared to me must have been about two hours i therefore went down in the cabin to measure it i know how high it was when i waded through it i found to my surprise and i may say to my joy that it was not higher than it was before i thought that perhaps i might be mistaken so i marked the height of the water at the cabin ladder and i sat down on deck to watch it it appeared to me not to rise any higher this made me reflect and it then struck me that as the vessel was laden with timber she would not probably sink any lower so i deferred my work till i had ascertained the fact three hours did i watch and found that the water did not rise higher and i was satisfied but the wind increased and the vessels sails instead of flapping to the wind as she drove without any one at the helm were now bellied out and the vessel careened to leeward i was afraid that she would turn over and finding an axe on the deck i mounted the rigging with it and commenced cutting away the lacing of the sails from the mast i then lowered the gaffs and cleared away the canvass in the same way so that the sails fell on the deck this was a work of at least one hour but when the canvass was off the vessel was steady it was well that i had taken this precaution for very soon afterwards the wind was much fresher and the weather appeared very threatening the sea also rose considerably i was very tired and sat down for some time on the deck abaft it then occurred to me that the weight of the planks upon the deck must not only keep the vessel deeper in the water but make her more topheavy and i determined to throw them overboard but first i looked for something to eat and found plenty of victuals in the iron pot in which the men had cooked their supper the night before as soon as i had obtained from the cask lashed on the deck a drink of water to wash down the cold fried ham which i had eaten i set work to throw overboard the planks on deck when i had thrown over a portion from one side i went to the other and threw over as many more that i might as much as possible keep the vessel on an even keel this job occupied me the whole of the day and when i had completed my task i examined the height of the water at the cabin ladder and found that the vessel had risen more than six inches this was a source of great comfort to me and what pleased me more was that the wind had gone down again and the water was much smoother i made a supper off some raw ham for the fire had been extinguished and committing myself to the protection of heaven lay down as the sun set and from the fatigue of the day was soon in a sound sleep i awoke about the middle of the night the stars shone brightly and there was but a slight ripple on the water i thought of my mother of my aunt milly of captain delmar and i felt for the sealskin pouch which was fastened round my neck it was all safe i calculated chances and i made up my mind that i should be picked up by some vessel or another before long i said to myselfwhy i am better off now than i was when in the wherry with peggy pearson i was saved then why should i not be now i felt no desponding and lay down and was soon fast asleep it was broad daylight when i awoke i took my spyglass and looking round the horizon discovered a vessel several miles off standing towards me this gave me fresh spirits i made a raw breakfast and drank plenty of water as before the wind which was very light increased a little the vessel came nearer and i made her out to be a schooner in two hours she was close to me and i waved my hat and hallooed as loud as i could the schooner was full of men and steered close to meshe was a beautiful craft and although the wind was so light glided very fast through the water and i could not help thinking that she was the pirate vessel which the frigate had been in chase of it appeared as if they intended to pass me and i hallooed schooner ahoy why dont you send a boat on board i must say that when the idea struck me that she was a pirate vessel my heart almost failed me shortly afterwards the schooner rounded to and lowered a boat which pulled to the vessel the boats crew were all negroes one of them said jump in you white boy next jump he take be into the sharks mouth continued the man grinning as he addressed himself to the others in the boat i got into the boat and they rowed on board the schooner i did then think that i was done for for what mercy could i expect being a kings officer from pirates which the words of the negro convinced me they were as soon as i was alongside of the schooner they ordered me to go up the side which i did with my spyglass in my hand i leaped from the gunwale down on the deck and found myself on board of an armed vessel with a crew wholly composed of blacks i was rudely seized by two of them who led me aft to where a negro stood apart from the rest a more fierce severe determinedlooking countenance i never beheld he was gigantic in stature and limbed like the farnesian hercules well boy who are you said he and how came you on board of that vessel i told him in very few words then you belong to that frigate that chased us the day before yesterday yes replied i what is her name the calliope she sails well said he yes replied i she is the fastest sailer on this station thats all the information i want of you boy now you may go go where replied i go wherego overboard to be sure replied he with a grin my heart died within me but i mustered courage enough to say much obliged to you sir but id rather stay where i am if its all the same to you the other negroes laughed at this reply and i felt a little confidence at all events their goodhumour gave me courage and i felt that being bold was my only chance the negro captain looked at me for a time as if considering and at last said to the men overboard with him goodbye sir youre very kind said i but this is a capital spyglass and i leave it to you as a legacy and i went up to him and offered him my spyglass merciful heaven bow my heart beat against my ribs when i did this the negro captain took the glass and looked through it it is a good glass said he as he removed it from his eyes it was poor greens spyglass which he had given me for showing him the masons signs well white boy i accept your present and now good bye goodbye sir do me one kindness in return said i very gravely for i felt my hour was come and what is that replied the negro tie a shot to my heels that i may sink quickly it wont take them long you dont ask me to spare your life then replied the negro he de very first white dat not ask it said one of the negroes dat really for true said another yes by gum replied a third oh how i wished to know what to say at that moment the observations of the negroes made me imagine that i had better not ask for it and yet how i clung to life it was an awful momenti felt as if i had lived a year in a few minutes for a second or two i felt faint and giddyi drew a long breath and revived you dont answer me boy said the negro captain why should i ask when i feel certain to be refused if you will give me my life i will thank you i dont particularly wish to die i can assure you i have taken an oath never to spare a white man for once i am sorry that i cannot break my oath if that is all i am a boy and not a man replied i keep me till i grow bigger by golly captain that very well said keep him captain said one of the negroes yes captain replied another keep him to tend your cabin proper you have white slave boy the negro captain for some time made no reply he appeared to be in deep thought at last he said boy you have saved your life you may thank yourself and not me prossa let him be taken below give him a frock and trousers and throw that infernal dress overboard or i may change my resolution the negro who was addressed and who wore a sort of uniform as an officerwhich he was being second mateled me belownothing loth i can assure my readers when i was between decks i sat down upon a chest my head swam and i fainted the shock had been too powerful for a lad of my age they brought water and recovered me when i revived i felt that i might have lost in their good opinion by thus knowing my weakness and i had sufficient presence of mind to ask for something to eat this deceived them they said to one another that i must have been on board that vessel for two days without food and of course i did not deny it they brought me some meat and some grog i ate and drank a little they then took off my uniform and put on me a check frock and white trousers after which i said i wished to lie down a little and they left me to sleep on the chest where i had been seated i pretended to sleep although i could not and i found out by their conversation that i gained the goodwill not only of the crew but of the captain by my behaviour i considered that i had gained my life at least for the present but what security could i have in such company after an hour or two i felt quite recovered and i thought it advisable to go on deck i did so and went right aft to the negro captain and stood before him well boy said he why do you come to me you gave me my life youre the greatest friend i have here so i come to you can i do anything yes you may assist in the cabin if your white blood does not curdle at the idea of attending on a black man not at all i will do anything for them who are kind to me as you have been and think it no disgrace not the least is it a disgrace to be grateful the reader will observe how particularly judicious my replies were although but fifteen years old my dangerous position had called forth the reflection and caution of manhood go down into the cabin you may amuse yourself till i come i obeyed this order the cabin was fitted up equal to most yachts with spanish mahogany and gold mouldings a beaufet full of silver there was no glass occupied nearly onehalf of it even the plates and dishes were of the same material silver candelabras hung down from the middle of the beams a variety of swords pistols and other weapons were fixed up against the bulkhead a small bookcase chiefly of spanish books occupied the afterbulkhead and the portraits of several white females filled up the intervals a large table in the centre a stand full of charts half a dozen boxes of cigars and two most luxurious sofas completed the furniture a door from the starboard side led i presumed to the stateroom where the captain slept but i did not venture to open it i surveyed all this magnificence wondering who this personage could be and more still how it was that the whole of the crew were as well as the captain of the negro race we had heard that the pirate we were in search of was a wellknown charactera spaniardwho went by the name of chico and that his crew consisted of americans english and spaniards that this was the vessel i knew from the conversation of the men when i was below for they called her the stella now it appeared that the vessel had changed masters the crew were chiefly spanish negroes or other negroes who spoke spanish but some of them spoke english and a few words of spanish these i presumed were american or english runaways but the captainhis language was as correct as my own spanish he spoke fluently for i heard him giving orders in that language while i was in the cabin neither was he flatnosed like the majority had he been white his features would have been considered regular although there was a fierceness about them at times which was terrible to look at well thought i if i live and do well i shall know more about it yes if i live i wish i was on the quarterdeck of the calliope even as tommy was with his pockets stuffed full of the pursers raisins and looking like a fool and a rogue at the same time i had been down in the cabin about half an hour when the negro captain made his appearance well said he i suppose you would as soon see the devil as meeh boy no indeed replied i laughingfor i had quite recovered my confidencefor you were about to send me to the devil and i feel most happy that i still remain with you youre exactly the cut of boy i like replied he smiling how i wish that you were blacki detest your colour i have no objection to black my face if you wish it replied i its all the same to me what colour i am how old are you i was fifteen a few months back how long have you been to sea about eighteen months he then asked me a great many more questions about the captain the officers the ship and myself to all of which i answered in a guarded way a negro brought down his supper it was hot and very savoury without any order on his part i immediately attended upon him during his meal he told the negro not to wait and conversed with me during the time that he was eating at last he told me how he had doubled the frigate during the night i then remarked that we had been informed that the vessel was called the stella that the captains name was chico and the crew were composed of white men of different nations a month or two ago it was the case replied the captain now i have done and you may clear away continued he rising from his chair and throwing himself down on one of the sofas stop you are hungry i dont doubt you can sit down and eat your supper and remove the things afterwards i did as he told me it was the first time in my life i had supped off massive platebut i was in strange company however it did not spoil my appetite and i did not forget to drink a goblet of wine by way of washing down my repast thank you sir said i rising and then performing my office of attendant at his order i rang the bell for the negro who assisted me in clearing away and then went out with the remains of the supper am i to stay or go said i respectfully you may go now find the man who came in just nowjose he is called tell him to give you something to sleep upon goodnight sir said i goodnight boy as i went forward looking for the negro servant i was accosted more than once very kindly by the negro seamen at last i went up on the forecastle and they asked me to tell them how i was left on board the schooner i did so to those who spoke english and one of them who could speak both languages translated into spanish for the benefit of the others you be first white he hab spared i tell you said the american negro who had translated into spanish what i had told them after the other had left me with him the captain says he wishes i were black said i to the negro i wish i was too while i am on board of this vesselmy colour makes him angry i see that could not i be stained black well i do think it will be a very safe thing for you if it could be for you have not seen him sometimes in his moods and if tomorrow morning he was chased and hard pressed by the frigate you would stand a poor chance suppose his eyes light upon you i cant tink what make him to let you off only but cause you give him de spyglass in dat hold way i tink i know a chap on board who understand dati go seeyou wait here till i come back the negro left me and in a few minutes returned with a sort of halfindian halfnegrolooking cut of fellow with whom he conversed in spanish he say he know how to make brown like himself but not dark same as me suppose you wish he do it tonightbegin now yes i do wish it replied i and so i did sincerely for i felt that it might be the saving of my life and i had a great aversion to be torn to pieces by the sharks which followed the vessel that being anything but an agreeable mode of going out of the world the american black remained with me and we conversed for about half an hour by which time we were joined by the spanish main negro who brought up with him some decoction or another boiling hot they stripped me and rubbed me all over with a bit of sponge not only the face and hands but every part of my body and then i was left standing quite naked to dry the crew had gathered round us and were very merry at the idea of changing my colour as soon as the warm air had dried me the application was created and when i was again dry the american told me to put on my clothes and that he would call me early to have two more applications of the stuff and that then i should be quite dark enough i asked for jose and told him what the captain had said he gave me a bundle of matting for a bed and i was soon fast asleep about three oclock in the morning i was called up and the staining repeated twice and i then lay down again when the hands were turned up at five bells for everything was very regular on board jose brought me a glass to look at myself and i was quite satisfied that my colour would no longer annoy the captain i was not as black as a negro but i was as dark as a mulatto i asked the spanish negro through jose who could speak both languages whether i might wash myself he replied all day long if i pleased that i should not get the colour off it would wear off in time and the stuff must be applied once a month and that would be sufficient i went to the forecastle and washed myself the negro crew were much amused and said that i now was a bel muchacoa handsome boy i dare say they thought soat all events they appeared to be very friendly with me and my staining myself gave them great satisfaction i was sitting with jose between decks when the cabin bell rang you go said he showing his white teeth as he grinned i go after see what captain tink i went into the cabin and knocked at the stateroom door come in said the captain i went in and met him face to face what said he looking earnestly at meyet it must beit is you is it not yes sir replied i it is me ive turned dark to please you and i hope it does please you it does boy i can look at you now and forget that you are white i can i feel that i can love you nowyouve got rid of your only fault in my eyes and im not sorry im only glad that i did not give me to the sharks said i finishing his sentence exactly so say no more about it i immediately turned the conversation by asking him what he required and i attended him while dressing from that time he became very friendly towards me constantly conversing with me i did my duty as his servant for more than a fortnight during which time we became very intimate and i may as well confess it i grew very fond of my new master and thought less about the ship and my shipmates we were going into a port i knew but what port i did not know i often had conversations with jose and the american black and gained a great deal of information from them but i could not discover much of the history of the captain on that point they refused to be communicative occasionally hints were given and then as if recollecting themselves they stopped speaking it was about three weeks before we made the land of cuba and as soon as we did so the schooner was hove to till night when sail was again made and before ten oclock we saw the lights of the havannah when about three miles off we again hove to and about midnight we perceived under the land the white sails of a schooner which was standing out sail was made and we ran down to her and before she was aware that we were an enemy she was laid by the board and in the possession of our crew the people belonging to the vessel were handed up and she was examined she proved to be a vessel fitted out for the slave trade with the manacles etcetera on board of her and was just sailing for the coast i was on the deck when the white men belonging to the slaver were brought on board and never shall i forget the rage and fury of the captain all sail was made upon both schooners standing right off from the land and at daylight we had left it a long way astern jose said to me you better not go to captain dis day keep out of his wayperhaps he recollect dat you white from what i had seen the night before i thought this good advice and i not only did not go into the cabin but i did not show myself on deck about eight oclock in the morning i heard the boat lowered down and orders given to scuttle the vessel as soon as she had been well searched this was done and the boat returned having found several thousand dollars on board of her which they handed upon deck i remained below i heard the angry voice of the negro captainthe pleadings and beggings for mercy of the prisonersbusy preparations making on deck and several men came down and handed up buckets of sand an iron grating was handed up the countenances of the negroes who were thus employed appeared inflamed as if their wrath was excited now and then they laughed at each other and looked more like demons than men that some dreadful punishment was about to be inflicted i was certain and i remained crouched behind the foremast on the lowerdeck at last the men were all on deck again and i was left alone and then i heard more noise begging for mercy weeping and wailing and occasionally a few words from the mouth of the negro captain then rose shrieks and screams and appeals to heaven and a strong smell which i could not comprehend came down the hatchways the shrieks grew fainter and at last ceased and something was thrown overboard then the same tragedy whatever it was was acted over againmore attempts to obtain mercymore shrieksagain the same overpowering smell what could it be i would have given much to know but something told me that i must remain where i was ten times was this repeated and then as evening came on there was a bustle on deck and after a time the crew descended the hatchways i caught the eye of the american with whom i was intimate and as he passed me i beckoned to him he came to me what has been done said i in a whisper captain punish slave traders replied he always punish them so why what did he do to them doroast em alive dis third slave vessel he take and he always serve em so serve em right captain very savage no go to him till morrow morningyou keep close so saying the american negro left me as i afterwards found out the long boat on the booms had been cleared out the sand laid at the bottom to prevent the fire from burning the boat the captain and crew of the slave vessel laid on one after the other upon the iron grating and burnt alive this accounted for the horrible smell that had come down the hatchways it may be considered strange that i really did not feel so much horror as perhaps i ought to have done had this dreadful punishment been inflicted upon any other persons than slave dealers and by any other parties than negroes i should not have been able to look at the captain without abhorrence expressed in my countenance but i know well the horrors of the slave trade from conversation i had had with bob cross and i had imbibed such a hatred against the parties who had carried it on that it appeared to me to be an act of retaliation almost allied to justice had the negro captain only warred against slave dealers i do not think i should have cared about remaining in the vessel but he had told me and fully proved to me that he detested all white men and had never spared them except in my own instance i must acknowledge that i felt very much like going into the lions den when the next morning on his ringing the cabin bell i presented myself to the captain but so far from being in an illhumour he was very kind to me after breakfast as i was going out he said to me you must have a name i shall call you catorecollect that and now i have a question to ask youwhat is that which you carry round your neck on a ribbon a letter sir replied i a letter and why do you carry a letter because it is of the greatest importance to me indeed now cato sit down on the other sofa and let me know your history i felt that i could not do better than to make this man at once my confidant he might take a strong interest in me and it was not likely to go farther i therefore told him everything connected with my birth and parentage what my suspicions had been and how the letter had confirmed them i unsewed the sealskin and gave him the letter to readwithout being aware that he could read he took it and read it aloud yes said he thats proof under his own hand and now cato never be afraid of me for however i may wreak my vengeance upon others i swear by my colour that i never will hurt you or permit others to do so i am a tigeri know it but you have often seen a little spaniel caressed by the tiger whose fangs are turned against every other living thing you are quite safe i feel i am since you say so replied i and since i am to be your pet i shall take liberties and ask you in return to tell me your history i am glad that you have asked it as i wish you to know it i will begin at once i was born in america in the state of pennsylvania of free parents my father was a sailmaker and was worth money bet a free black in america is even worse treated and more despised than a slave i had two brothers who went to school with me my father intended to bring me up for the church you look astonished but in the states we have clergymen of our colour as well as white ones looked down upon and despised i grant although they do teach the word of god but i was very unfit for that profession as you may suppose i was very proud and haughty i felt that i was as good as a white man and i very often got into scrapes from my resenting injuries however my education went on successfully much more so than that of my brothers who could not learn i could and learnt rapidly but i learnt to hate and detest white men and more especially americans i brooded over the injuries of people of colour as we were called and all my fathers advice and entreaty could not persuade me to keep my thoughts to myself as i grew up to manhood i spoke boldly and more than once nearly lost my life for so doing for most americans think no more of taking the life of one like me than of a dog in the street more than one knife has been directed to my heart and more than once was i then up before the judge and sentenced to imprisonment for no fault my evidence and the evidence of those of my colour not being permitted to be received in a court of justice any white villain had only to swear falselyand there is no want of that class in america and there was no appeal at last i was sentenced to be whipped then my blood boiled and i vowed a vengeance which i have fearfully adhered to i do not wonder at that said i i would have done the same the man who had sworn falsely against me in this last instance had come up from the south i obtained what money i could from my father and went away in pursuit of him i found himdogged him and one evening i accosted him and plunged my bowieknife into his heart i fled that state and crossed the mississippi i had not been long in arkansas before a mana cottongrower who owned about a hundred and fifty slavesinquired who i was and whether i had a pass i replied that i was a free man born in pennsylvania and was there on my own affairs the next day i was taken up brought before the magistrate and this scoundrel swore that i was his slave and had absconded from him ten years before my defencethe proof which i offered to bring was not listened to i was made over to him and the rascal grinned as the constables brought me away with him his plantation was at the red river it was difficult to escape and indeed almost useless to attempt it but the fact was that i did not wish to do so i remained to have my revenge i tried to make the other slaves rise against him but they were too cowed they even informed against me and i was tied down and flogged by the drivers until the flesh fell from my shoulders as soon as i recovered i determined to door die i heard that there were some pirate vessels in the barataria lagoons on the other side of new orleans i resolved to join the crews but first to have my revenge i did so i set fire to the plantation housestruck the scoundrel who had made me a slave senseless as he attempted to escape and threw his body into the flames i then made the door fast and fled i was met by one of the overseers who was armed and who would have stopped me i beat his brains out with his own musket and then gained the woods you see that i am powerful you hardly know how much so after several days travelling i arrived at the lagoons i found this very vessel at anchor i offered myself and they accepted me immediately there were several of my colour on boardrunaway slavesand all good determined men these were the people i required for they understood me even on board of a pirate vessel the same contempt was shown towards usstill considered as inferior beings all the heavy work all the dirty work was for the negro race and we often worked like slaves while the captain and the rest of the crew caroused i was three years on board of this vessel our rendezvous where we are going to now is a small landlocked bay on the island of cuba no vessel in it can be seen from seaward and there is but one narrow pass by which it communicates with the interior and it is far from any habitation a better retreat for a pirate vessel could not well be found we used very often to go in to refit and take in provisions and water for in a cave there we keep the provisions which we take from other vessels in a desperate fight which we had with an english manofwar brig we lost nearly forty of our men the captain chico as he was called was obliged to fill up with black men until he could procure others the consequence was that with the ten before on board there were fifty blacks to seventy whites it was then that i made up my mind that i would retaliate for all that my race had suffered i was sure of the ten with whom i had sailed so long i sounded the others and found them all willing we sailed from the mexican gulf and made for the rendezvous bay in cuba as soon as we arrived of course as with all pirate vessels the first day was dedicated to revelling and intoxicationthat is by the white portion of the crew we negroes were employed in getting the casks ashore for water that very night when they all lay asleep and drunk we put every soul of them to death and the stella belonged to me and my brave black who chose me for their captain and swore by their wrongs eternal enmity to the european race as you may suppose i was shortmanned but we soon found plenty of men and have now as fine a crew as ever trod a deck how long is it since you took possession of the vessel about eight or nine months during which time i have spared none except you the usual death is drowning but if i fall in with a slaver thenyou know what took place yesterday i was silent for a time i do not wonder said i at last at your hatred of the whites especially of the americans as for your wreaking your vengeance upon those employed in the slave trade dreadful as it is i scarcely pity them but in your general warfare against the whites recollect that you may murder those who are your friends and who have done all they can to put an end to slavery even in america there are many who are opposed to it it is impossible to make a distinction replied the negro what is your name said i musing why do you ask you may as well know i wish it to be known it is james vincent but tell me if you were to meet with a very superior force what would you do run if i could if not fight but you might be captured and then never boy never well said i as you have begun by sparing me i hope you will spare others now i dont know why i spared you had you shown any fear of death i should not have done so but i felt that you would not care about it i believe it was that about ten days after we made the east end of the island of cuba and ran into the bay of rendezvous as it was named by the pirate it was very small but completely landlocked and the land so high on every side that the masts of the vessel could not be seen from the seaward the bay on the land side was met by a deep narrow ravine between mountains which were almost perpendicular the ravine itself being accessible from the main land by only one narrow path known to the pirates and which they seldom made use of except when a spy was sent to the havannah to ascertain what vessels were about to sail on the high land which shut in the bay from the sea the pirates had a man constantly on the lookout to report any vessel which might be in the offing and vincent himself passed much of his time there as the breeze was fresh and the air cool to what it was down in the landlocked bay i was for the same reason very fond of being on the lookout hill and generally followed up the captain when he went out there he certainly now showed a strong affection for me and i liked him better than i ever thought i could have done he was constantly telling me of the treatment he and the other poor blacks had received in america and i could not help feeling my blood boil and a conviction that had i been so treated i should probably have been equally under the influence of revenge it is the world and the treatment we receive from it which makes us chiefly what we are one day the captain told me he was going that evening to obtain information as the spy he had sent had returned unsuccessful and that he should be absent for three or four days although i was not discontented with my position still as the reader may well suppose i had a strong wish to be out of it as soon as possible and i had determined to escape if i could it immediately occurred to me that his absence would give me the opportunity i replied with a laugh had you not better take me with you very likely indeed you would be so very useful i shall have quite enough to do to take care of myself besides you might betray me added he with a fierce and penetrating look thank you for your good opinion replied i indignantly so you think because you have saved my life that i would take yours i am not yet such a rascal whatever i may become by keeping bad company well well replied the negro captain i believe i am wrong so dont get into a passion but at all events you must see that it is impossible i can take you with me if you dont choose i cant help it said i but i dont like remaining here without you i shall run away if i can so i give you fair warning you wont find that quite so easy replied he laughing and i recommend you not to attempt it here the conversation dropped about midnight the captain commenced his ascent of the ravine and i resolved that i would not lose the opportunity if it offered of following him i watched him as long as i could see him that i might know the direction of the secret path and then i joined the crew who were lying down by the tents which they had pitched on the shore shortly afterwards the spanish indian who had coloured me passed by me and as i intended to make the attempt before it was quite dark i thought that i would remove any suspicion and i therefore requested him to stain me again this he consented to do and in half an hour i was again naked among the negroes and undergoing the operation having received the two applications as before i then quitted them as soon as it was quite dark i armed myself with a pair of pistols and crawled underneath the back of the captains tent in which i always slept and without being perceived gained the narrow path in the brushwood by which the captain had left i continued in the path for some time by feeling the brushwood on either side but before i had crawled half way up the ravine i found that the brushwood had not been cut away any farther and i was at a loss how to proceed all traces were gone and all i had to do was to climb up to the summit and to take my chance of finding any egress i toiled on with difficulty sometimes stopped by a rock which would take me minutes to climb over at others holding on by the brushwood for my life by twelve oclock i had gained more than twothirds of the ascent and then the moon rose and assisted me with her light i must say that when i looked up and saw the rocks towering above me and overhanging my path i felt that escape was nearly impossible however i recommenced my labour and gained some ground when as i was clinging to the side of a rock by a small shrub it gave way and i rolled and fell down many feet between that rock and another opposite to it i was not much hurt and i regained my legs looking up and about me i found that i was in a narrow passage between the rocks leading both up and downin fact i had tumbled into the secret path that i had been in search of delighted with this discovery i now set off with great spirit and in half an hour found myself on the other side of the lull which formed the ravine and looking down upon an expanse of country in the interior being very tired i sat down that i might recover my strength before i continued my journey i am free at last thought i and my memory wandered back to my mother my ship and my captainold culpepper tommy dott and bob cross i shall see them all i thought and what a story i shall have to tell as soon as i had rested myself and recovered my breath i thought i might as well start i had not proceeded more than a hundred yards before i thought heard a noise as if some one was approaching i listenedi felt sure that such was the case and i also heard the deep baying of a hound the noise increased rapidlyit was that of one forcing his way through the brushwood which covered the side of the hill in a minute afterwards i perceived a man coming up the hill at a swift pace directly towards me as he approached i could almost swear that it was vincent the negro captain but when within ten yards of me i perceived him turn round and flourish his sabre in the air while at the same time three large bloodhounds sprang at him one fell by the blow of his sabre but the other two flew at his throat and fastened on him tearing him to the around and holding him in spite of all his struggling and his immense strength i recollected my pistols i cocked them ran up and putting one to the head of the nearest dog blew out its brains i was equally successful with the otherthey both lay dead by his side and vincent was released he started up it is me cato said i cato replied he but there is not a moment to be lost i understand it all he seized me by the arm and dragged me with him to the narrow entrance of the pass and as soon as we came in he rolled three large rocks which had evidently been used for such purpose before so as completely to block up the entrance there said he leaning back quite exhausted be quiet cato we are safe now they will be on the top of the hill directly we remained where we were about ten minutes when we heard voices not very far from us they were the pursuers of the negro captain who were evidently baffled after a time the sounds receded from us and we heard them no more vincent then spoke you were escaping cato i had escaped replied i i told you that i would strange that you should have discovered the path did any one betray it to you no one replied i and i then told him how i had fallen into it well you have returned all obligations and more than ever you owed me said he you have saved my life this time and that when all chance was over then replied i although i shall be very sorry to part with you give me that liberty which i had gained and which i lost in defending you from the dogs i would have let you go then cato replied he but your life would have been sacrificed my pursuers would have hurried you to prison before you could have explained who you were you forget your colour is changed they were not seeking me but a runaway slave and the bloodhounds came upon my track those white men show no mercy they have more pleasure in seeing a runaway slave torn to pieces by those dogs than in recovering possession of him it is a sort of foxchase to them continued he grating his teeth after he had said so cato i will give you your liberty if you wish it and i know you do wish it as soon as i can with any prudence that i promise you and you know that i will keep my word i am quite satisfied replied i and do you promise me that you will not attempt to escape a second time i promise you that i will not replied i enough said vincent now let us go down the hill for i am very much torn by those infernal brutes and must have the wounds washed and attended to we descended the hill in silence and in a quarter of an hour had gained the tent vincent was severely bitten and torn as soon as his wounds had been dressed he lay down on his mat and i did the same it was some days before vincent recovered from the severe injuries which he had received from the bloodhounds and he did not appear to be inclined to run any more risks of that sort although he said little i could perceive that he was brooding over future vengeance and he was now nearly the whole of the day with his glass on the lookout hill one morning a schooner hove in sight steering from the havannah to the southward and eastward either for the islands of the spanish main the stella had for many days been ready for instant sailing and having watched her till near sunset vincent sent down orders for every soul to be on board and the anchor hove up just as it was dark we towed out of the bay and made all sail at daylight the schooner was but a few miles ahead of us and not being a fast sailer in little more than an flour we were alongside of her she proved to be bound to the island of curacao being the property of an old dutch gentleman who was on board with his daughter a little girl about seven years old the crew consisted chiefly of negroes slaves to the owner the master of the vessel and the mate being with the exception of the old gentleman and the little girl the only white people on board as usual the crew were brought on board by the pirates who reported to the captain that the vessel was in ballast and of no value as the crew of the stella were already more than requisite vincent did not require the negroes he told them that they might go on board the schooner again and take her into any port they pleased with the white people however it was another affair i had remained below not wishing to witness a scene of butchery but i was induced to look up the ladder in consequence of jose telling me that there was a little white girl come on board at the time that i did so vincent had just done speaking with the negroes belonging to the captured vessel they had fallen back and there was then standing before vincent the master and mate of the vessel the old dutch gentleman and the little girl a more interesting child i never had seen and my heart bled at the idea of her being sacrificed i could not help hoping that vincent would have a similar feeling but i was mistaken the master and mate were pointed at and immediately seized by negroes and tossed over into the sea the old gentleman bowed his head over the beautiful child and she knelt to him as if for his blessing before she died at that very moment vincent gave the signi could remain quiet to longeri sprang on the deck stop cried i to the men who were about to seize the old gentlemanstop the negroes did fall back at my voice what is this cried vincent captain vincent cried i do you call yourself a man to war with children and old greyheaded men you must not shall not touch these two you have wreaked your vengeance upon the white men be content let these go cato replied vincent fiercely it is well that it is you that have dared to snatch the prey from the fangs of the wild beast had it been another this pistol should have sent a ball whizzing through his brain as it is go down below immediately i do not fear your pistol captain vincent nor will i go below that very pistol in my hand saved you from the fangs of the bloodhound i tell you therefore that you must not destroy that innocent childif you love me you must not for i will hate detest and scorn you ever afterwards i entreat youi implore you to let them go they are not fit objects for your vengeance and if you destroy them i tell you you are a coward what roared the tiger a coward and no longer able to contain himself he levelled his pistol at me and drew the trigger it missed fire vincent looked very confusedhe tossed the pistol on deck folded his arms and turned his face away there was a dead silence the negro crew looked first at me and then at the captain as if awaiting orders and uncertain of the issue the dutch gentleman seemed to be so lost in surprise as to almost forget his impending fate while the little girl clung to him and stared at me with her deep blue eyes it was what on the theatres they would call a tableau i followed up my advantage stepping forward and placing myself before the old man and the child i first broke the silence captain vincent said i you did once promise me that you would never injure me or attempt my life that promise you have broken since that you have made me another promiseyou may recollect itwhich was that you would allow me to leave you on the first favourable opportunity there cannot be any opportunity more favourable than the present the negroes whom you are to send back to the schooner do not know how to navigate her i request therefore to know whether you intend to keep this second promise or to break it as you have the first i ask my liberty if i broke my promise just now it was your fault replied vincent coolly i am sorry for it and i can say no more i intended to keep it and to prove so i now keep my secondyou may go i thank you for that i only wish that now i leave you i could leave you with feelings of goodwill and not ofi must say itof horror and disgust captain vincent once more let me beg as a last favour that you will spare these poor people since you are so particularly interested about this useless old man and still more useless child replied vincent sarcastically i will now make a proposal to you you have your liberty do you choose to give it up and remain here provided i let them go away in the schooner come nowtake your choice for i swear by my colour that if you go away in the schooner the moment you shove off they shall go over the gunwale my choice is then made replied i for i knew that when he swore by his colour he was in earnest release them and i will remain here i little knew what i was to undergo in consequence of this decision be it so said vincent then turning to one of the mates let them go back with the negroes hoist the boat up when she returns and sail for the rendezvous so saying he went down into the cabin you are saved said i going up to the old dutch gentleman lose no time get into the boat as fast as possible and make sail on your vessel as soon as you get on board good bye little girl said i taking her hand i thank you replied the gentleman in good englishi cannot say how much i am so surprised at what i have seen but recollect the name of vanderwelt of curacao and if ever we meet again you will find me grateful i will but ask no more questions nowinto the boatquick said i shaking his proffered hand they were handed down into the boat by the negroes i remained on deck until they were put on board the boat returned was hoisted up the schooner made sail again and then i went down into the cabin i found the negro captain stretched upon the sofa his face covered up with both his hands he remained in the same position taking no notice of my coming down although my confidence in him was destroyed after his snapping the pistol at me yet when i reflected how i had bearded him in his rage i did make some excuse for him moreover i knew that it was my interest to be on the best terms with him and if possible make him forget what had passed for i felt that his proud spirit would make it difficult for him to forgive himself for having been induced by his passion to break an oath which he had sworn to by his colour i therefore after a little reflection went up to him and said i am sorry that i made you so angry captain vincent you must forgive me but i thought that deed beneath you and i could not bear to have a bad opinion of you do you mean to assert that you have not a bad opinion of me now replied he fixing his eyes upon me no certainly not you have released those i pleaded for and i am very grateful to you for having done so you have made me do what i never did before replied he raising himself and sitting with his feet on the deck i know i have i have made you spare those of my colour i did not mean that you have irritated me so as to make me break my oath that was my own doingmy fault rather than yours i had no right to speak as i did but i was in a great rage and that is the truth i do believe that if i had had a pistol in my hand i should have fired it at you so we may cry quits on that score i am angry with myselfthe more so that i little imagined that you would have remained with me after my breaking my oath either you must have felt great interest about those people or you must have great confidence in me a confidence winch i have proved that i do not deserve that you did forget yourself i grant but i have that confidence that it will be a warning to you and you will not forget yourself again i therefore remain with you with perfect confidence feeling i am quite safe until you think proper to give me my liberty you will wish to leave me then i have relations and friendsa profession to follow what can i gain by remaining here except your friendship i never will be a pirate you may be assured i wish from my heart that you were not one and who should be pirates if the blacks are not replied vincent have they not the curse of cain are they not branded ought not their hands to be against every one but their own race what is the arab but the pirate of the desertthe sea of sand black is the colour for pirates even the white pirates feel the truth of this or why do they hoist the black flag at all events its a profession that seldom ends well and what matter does that make we can die but oncei care not how soon i have not found life so very sweet as to care for it i assure you cato there is but one thing sweet in existenceone feeling that never clogs and never tires and that is revenge are not love and friendship sweet i certainly know nothing about the first i know no more than you do of it they say friendship is the more lasting and as a proof of how lasting that is i snapped my pistol at you and had it not missed fire should have killed the only one for whom i ever felt friendship in this world thats a bad habit you have of carrying your pistols at all times they are too handy and give no time or reflection only suppose now you had blown out my brains you would have been very sorry cato i have many lives on my hands and hope to have many more before i die i never have repented one act of my lifea murder as you may call itand i never shall but i tell you frankly that had i destroyed you in my passion i should have been a miserable man i know it i feel it lets say no more about it that im just as glad as you are that you did not kill me i assure you most positively heres jose coming with the dinner here ended our conversation which i have given just to show the peculiar disposition of this extraordinary man with whom i had become domesticated verily and truly was i as he said like a little dog in the cage of a tiger and from familiarity just as bold as dogs become under such peculiar circumstances before morning we were again at anchor in the rendezvous bay and the tents were pitched as before we remained there for more than a fortnight during which my intimacy with the captain was even greater than before he appeared to endeavour to do all in his power to restore my confidence in him and he succeeded still i must say that i began to be weary of this sort of life my dreams were ever of murder and bloodshed and more than once i felt inclined to make my escape but i had promised and the remembrance of my promise prevented me one afternoon the man on the lookout made the usual signal for a vessel in sight vincent went up immediately and i followed him it was a schooner very long with very taut raking masts vincent examined her for some time and then gave me the glass and asked me what i thought of her i replied that i thought she was a manofwar schooner you are right said he i know her well it is the arrow and she has come out to cruise for me this is the third time that she has been sent after me once we exchanged a few broadsides but another manofwar hove in sight and i was compelled to leave her she shall not accuse me of running from her now that she is alone and by tomorrow morning i will give her the opportunity of making the report of my capture if she can but if i capture her you may guess the rest we remained till nearly sunset watching the motions of the schooner vincent then went down the hill to give orders for sailing leaving me with the glass i again directed it to the schooner and perceived that she was making signals then she is not alone thought i and vincent may not capture her quite so easily as he expects i looked in vain for the other vessel i could not see her i therefore concluded that she must be somewhere under the land and hidden by it from my sight the signals were repeated till dusk when i went down the hill and found that all was bustle and activity vincent superintending himself the preparations for sailing i did not interrupt him to tell him that i had perceived the schooner making signals i had an idea somehow or another that i should regain my liberty and was as anxious as vincent that the stella should be under weigh before ten oclock everything was ready vincent had told his men that the english manofwar schooner was outside and that he intended to fight her the men appeared delighted at the proposal and as resolute and determined as men should be as soon as the stella was clear of the bay everything was got ready for action and i must say that nothing could be more rapid or more quiet than their movements we stood out until we had gained an offing of five miles and then made a reach along the shore towards the havannah as soon as the stella had laid her head towards the havannah vincent came down below i had latterly slept on one of the cabin sofas but had this night remained with my clothes on for i was not sure that we might not be in action before the morning the arrow had gained the knowledge that our rendezvous bay was somewhere about the east end of the island and had cruised accordingly but could not discover it vincent threw himself on the other sofa and i pretended to asleep as i did not wish to enter into conversation with him was too much occupied with my own thoughts and felt that there would be nothing in common between us at such a moment he was very soon asleep and he talked in his sleep he was evidently in action and gave his orders every now and then speaking a few words aloud and then it appeared as if he had taken the english schooner and that he was fulfilling his vows of retaliation i shuddered as i heard the halfbroken menacesthe exulting laugh which occasionally burst from his lips i arose and watched him as he slept his hands were continually in motion and his fists clenched and he smiled merciful heaven what a tale of savage cruelty that smile foretold if he were successful i knelt down and prayed that he might be foiled in his endeavours as i rose i heard a noise and talking on deck and one of the mates came down in the cabin how does she bear cried vincent starting up from his couch as if he instinctively knew what was to be told two points on the weather bow captain replied the negro i think she has her foresheet to windward whats the time one bell in the morning watch it will be daylight in an hour very good how far is she off about four miles pipe to quarters i will be up directly vincent took down his sword and buckled on his belt then his pistols which after having examined the primings he fixed in his girdle i still remained as if asleep and as he was going out of the cabin he turned to me he sleeps poor boy well why should i wake himthe guns will rouse him up soon enough so saying he went on deck i considered what i should do to be on deck was hardly safe for me as a white person and indeed what business had i there why should i expose myself to the shot of my countrymen or run the risk of losing my life from the rage of the negroes i therefore resolved on remaining where i wasat all events for the present the negroes now came into the cabin for the aftermagazine was under the forepart of it the hatch was taken up the screens let down and all was dark i had nothing to do but to catch now and then the commands given by the negro captain and draw my inference as to what was taking place although for the first halfhour i gained little information after that time had elapsed i knew what was going on i heard a voice hailing us from another vessel and the reply of the stella was a broadside there could be no mistake in that the stella was then put about and the other broadside given without a return from her opponent at last it came and as the shot whizzed over or tore up the planking of the gunwales i certainly did feel very strangely i had never been in action before and the sensation was i confess that of alarm but it was so mingled with curiosity as to what was going on that it was impossible to say what my feelings were i longed to be on deck and certainly would have been if i had thought that i was safe with the pirate crew that alone prevented me i remained therefore in a most unpleasant state of ignorance and suspense the broadsides were now exchanged rapidly and the wounded brought down between decks every minute told me that the action was severe the orders of the negro captain were occasionally heardthey were cool and determined every minute some fresh manoeuvre was executed and the guns still worked as if there was nothing else to attend to at last the daylight came down the hatchway and i left the cabin and walked forward between decks i found the deck strewed with wounded and dying men calling for water i was glad to be able to do something which i could consistently do and i brought water from the cask and gave it to them one after another as fast as i could i think there were at least thirty men lying about the lower deck some in pools of their own blood and sinking fast for there was no surgeon on board of the stella some more wounded men were brought down and a conversation took place between one of the mates of the schooner who was hurt and the men who brought down the wounded and listening to them i found that at daylight they had discovered that an english frigate was under all sail beating up to them and about five miles to leeward that in consequence the stella was now carrying on a running fight with the schooner who was to windward of her and trying to escape this accounted for the signals which i had perceived that the english schooner was making the evening before my anxiety at this intelligence was naturally much increased the stella was trying to escape and her sailing powers were so remarkable that i was afraid she would succeed the action was still continued between the two schooners but now the shot no longer hit the stella nor were there any more wounded men brought down it was evident that the two vessels were now firing at each others masts and rigging the one to prevent and the other to effect her escape by dismantling her antagonist i felt as if i could have given my left hand to have gone on deck i waited half an hour more and then curiosity conquering my fear i crept gradually up the fore ladder the men were working the guns to windward the leeside of the deck was clear and i stepped forward and got into the head where i could see both to windward and to leeward to leeward i perceived the frigate about four miles distant with every stretch of canvass that she could set on a wind i knew her directly to be the calliope my own ship and my heart beat quick at the chance of being once more on board of her to windward as the smoke occasionally cleared away i saw the arrow schooner close hauled on the same tack as the stella and distant about a mile every ten seconds the smoke from her guns booming along the waters surface and the shot whizzing through our rigging she had not suffered much from our fire her sails were full of shotholes it is true but her spars were not injured i then turned my eyes upon the masts and rigging of the stella apparently the damage done was about equal to that received by the arrow our sails were torn but our spars were unscathed the water was smooth although the breeze was fresh and both schooners were running at the rate of six or seven miles an hour but the stella had evidently the advantage of sailing and forereached upon her opponent i perceived that everything depended upon a lucky hit and having satisfied myself with what i had seen i hastened down below for more than half an hour the firing continued without advantage on either side when a yell was given by the negro crew and i heard them cry on the deck that the arrows foretopmast was shot away i heard the voice of vincent cheering his men and telling them to be steady in their aim my heart sunk at the intelligence and i sat down on a chest the firing now slackened for the stella had shot ahead of the english schooner and the negroes on deck were laughing and in high goodhumour for a few minutes the firing ceased altogether and i took it for granted that the stella had left her pursuers far behind when of a sudden a whole broadside of guns were poured into us and there was a terrible crashing and confusion on the deck i ran up the ladder to see what had happened it appeared that as the stella was crossing the bows of the arrow the latter had as a last chance thrown up in the wind and discharged her whole broadside into us two shots had struck our mainmast which had fallen by the board i perceived at once that the stellas chance was overnothing could save her she might resist the schooner but could not escape the frigate i ran down below and went into the cabin i was afraid that the negroes might perceive the joy in my countenance i heard the angry voice of the negro captaini heard him stamping with rage and i thanked god that i was not by his side the wreck of the mast was soon cleared away i heard him address his negroes point out to them that it was better to die like men at the guns than swing at the yardarm like dogs some of them came down and took on deck a quartercask of spirits which was plentifully supplied to all the english schooner had borne down upon us and the action now commenced at pistolshot never shall i forget what took place for nearly threequarters of an hour the negroes most of them intoxicated fought with rage and fury indescribabletheir shoutstheir screams their cursing and blasphemy mingled with the loud report of the guns the crashing of the spars and bulwarks the occasional cry of the wounded and the powerful voice of vincent it was terrific between decks the smoke was so thick that those who came down for the powder could not see but felt their way to the screen every two seconds i heard the men come aft toss off the can of liquor and throw it on the deck hen they went to resume their labour at their guns at the end of the time i have mentioned the shot flew from to leeward as well as from to windward the frigate had got within range and was pouring in her broadside still the firing and the shouting on the deck of the stella continued but the voices were fewer and as the firing of the frigate became more severe they became fainter and fainter and at last but an occasional gun was fired from our decks i became so uneasy that i could remain where i was no longer i went forward on the lower deck again and tumbling over the wounded and the dead i crept up the foreladder i looked over the coamings of the hatchway the decks were clear of smoke for not a gun was being fired merciful heaven what a scene of slaughter many of the guns were dismantled and the decks were strewed with the splinters and plankings of the gunwale broken spars and negroes lying dead or drunk in all directionssome cut and torn to pieces others whole but mixed up with the fragments of other bodies such a scene of blood i have never since witnessed out of the whole crew i do not think there were twenty men left unhurt and these were leaning or lying down exhausted with fatigue or overcome with liquor on various parts of the deck the fighting was over there was not one man at his gunand of those who remained still alive one or two fell while i was looking up from the shot which continued every minute to pierce the bulwarks where was vincent i dare not go aft to see i dare not venture to meet his eye i dived down below again and i returned aft to the cabin there was no more demand for powder not a soul was to be seen abaft suddenly the afterhatchway grating was thrown off i heard some one descend i knew it was the hurried tread of the negro captain it was so dark and the cabin so full of smoke that coming from the light he did not perceive me although i could distinguish him he was evidently badly wounded and tottered in his walk he came into the cabin put his hand to his girdle and felt for his pistol and then he commenced pulling down the screen which was between him and the magazine his intentions were evident which were to blow up the vessel i felt that i had not a moment to lose i dashed past him ran up the ladder sprung aft to the taffrail and dashed over the stern into the sea i was still beneath the surface having not yet risen from my plunge when i heard and felt the explosionfelt it indeed so powerfully that it almost took away my senses so great was the shock even when i was under the water that i was almost insensible i have a faint recollection of being drawn down by the vortex of the sinking vessel and scrambling my way to the surface of the water amidst fragments of timbers and whirling bodies when i recovered myself i found that i was clinging to a portion of the wreck in a sort of patch as it were upon the deep blue water dark as ink and strewed with splintered fragments there i remained some minutes during which time i gained my recollection i looked around and perceived the arrow schooner lying about one hundred yards off totally dismantled and my own frigate about a quarter of a mile to leeward as bright and as fresh as if she had just been refitted i observed a signal made by the calliope to the schooner which was answered i looked in vain towards the schooner expecting her to lower down a boat the fact was that the calliope had made the signal for her to do so and the schooner had replied that she had no boat that could swim i then perceived that the frigate had lowered down a boat which was pulling towards me and i considered myself as safe in a few minutes during which i had quite recovered myself the boat pulled into the mass of floating fragments and then the sailors ceased rowing to look about them they perceived and pulled towards me hoisted me in over the gunwale and laid me at the bottom of the boat i scrambled on my feet and would have gone aft when the midshipman of the boat said to the men pass that cursed young pirate forward dont let him come aft here oh oh mr lascelles thinks iso you dont know me you shall know me byandby i quite forgot that i was stained black till one of the men who seized me by the collar to pass me forward said hand along the nigger hes a young one for the gallows any how they handed me forward and i did not choose to say who i was my love of fun returned the moment that i was again with my shipmates after looking well round and ascertaining that i was the only one left alive they pulled back to the frigate and the midshipman went up to report i was handed up the side and remained at the break of the gangway while the captain and first lieutenant were talking with mr lascelles during which mr tommy dott came up to me and putting his finger to his left ear gave a cluck with his tongue as much as to say youll be hanged my good fellow i could not help giving the first masons sign which i taught to mr green in return for tommys communication to wit putting my thumb to my nose and extending my finger out towards him at which tommy dott expressed much indignation and called me a precious impudent varmin the men who were near us laughed and said that i was game at all events no one knew me for not only was my face well stained but i was covered from head to foot with a solution of salt water and gunpowder which made me still more indistinguishable i had remained at the gangway about two minutes when the first lieutenant said bring the prisoner here i immediately went aft and as soon as i was standing before captain delmar and the first lieutenantand behind were all the officers anxious to hear what i had to disclosei put my hand to my head having no hat as may be supposed and said come on board sir reporting myself as is usually the custom of officers when they return from leave or duty good heavens that voicewhy who are you cried captain delmar starting back a pace mr keene sir replied i again putting my hand to my head bob cross who was with many of the seamen close to me quite forgetting etiquette ran up and caught me round the waist looking me full in the face it is him sirit is him huzzah huzzah and all the seamen joined in the huzzahs which were however mingled with a great deal of laughter merciful heaven and so you have been blown up in that vessel said the first lieutenant coming to me with great kindness are you much burnt why hes quite blackwheres the surgeon arent hurt at all sir replied i let him be taken down and examined said the captain with some emotion if not hurt let him come into the cabin to me the captain went down the ladder and then i shook hands with tommy dott and all the other officers and midshipmen and i will say that my reappearance appeared to give unusual satisfaction i went down into the gunroom and was stripped they were much surprised to find that i was not hurt and even more when they discovered that i was black all over and that washing would not restore my colour why keene said the first lieutenant how is it that you have changed your colour oh sir ive been playing the nigger for these last three months it is a long story but i will go with you to the captain and i will tell it there as soon as i had put on my uniform i went up with mr hippesley to the cabin and having at the captains request taken a chair i entered into a full explanation which lasted more than an hour as soon as i had finished mr hippesley who had plenty to do on deck but who could not leave until he had heard my story quitted the cabin and i found myself alone with the captain i must say that i gave you up for lost said captain delmar the boats crew were picked up the next morning and reported that you were drowned in the cabin of the vessel scoundrels to desert you in that way i do not think they were to blame sir the water being so high in the cabin and my not answering to their call but did they call you yes sir i heard them call when i was half asleep and i did not answer well i am glad to hear you say so but so convinced have we been of your loss that i have written to your mother on the subject strange this is the second time that she has been distressed in this way you appear to have a charmed life mr keene i hope i shall long live to do credit to your protection sir replied i i hope so too mr keene replied the captain very kindly i sincerely hope so too in all this business you have conducted yourself very manfully it does you great credit and your mother ought to be proud of you thanky sir replied i for i was overjoyed at such language from captain delmar and i thought to myself if he says my mother ought be proud of me he feels so himself of course you cannot do duty under such a masquerade as you are at present continued the captain who referred to my stained skin i presume it will wear off byandby you will dine with me today now you may go to your messmates i left the cabin bowing very respectfully and pleased with what had occurred i hastened to join my messmates not however until i had shaken hands with bob cross who appeared as delighted to see me as if he was my father i leave the reader to imagine the sort of levee which i held both on the quarterdeck and below mr hippesley could not get any of the officers to mind their duty i certainly was for two or three days the greatest personage in the ship after that i had time to tell the whole of my history quietly to bob cross bob cross when he had heard me without interruption said well master keene theres no telling what a mans born to till after hes dead and then its all known but it does appear to me that you are born to something out of the common here you are not sixteen not only playing a mans part but playing it manfully you have been put in most difficult situations and always have fallen upon your feet in the end you appear to have an old head upon very young shoulders at one moment to be a scampish boy full of mischief and at another a resolute cool and clever man sarcumstances they say make men and so it appears in you but it does seem strange for one and the same lad to be stealing the pursers plums at one moment and twisting a devil of a nigger pirate round his finger the very next and then you have had such escapestwice reported dead at headquarters and twice come to life again now master keene ive very good news to tell you you dont know how high you stand with the captain and officers theres a feeling of envy against a lad who goes ahead as well as a man which blinds people to his real merits but when he is supposed to be dead and gone and no longer in the way of others then every one tells the real truth and i do assure you that not only the officers but the captain himself grieved most sorely at your loss i saw the captains eyes wink more than once when speaking of you and the first lieutenant was always telling the other mids that he had not one worth his salt now that you were gone and now that you have come back and gained so much credit for what has passed i do really think that the captain is proud of you i overheard a little conversation between the captain and first lieutenant the day you came on board after you had been in the cabin telling your adventures and all that i can say is that the game is in your own hands if you only play your cards well and never let captain delmar have the least idea that you know that you have such claims upon him that i certainly will not replied i as it might check his feeling towards me exactly ive often thought about you and now that i like you so much i watch the captain for your sake and listen particularly to what he says after dinner especially when ive the opportunity for you see when gentlemen drink wine they speak more freely as to what they really think just as we foremastmen do when we get our grog on board the greatest misfortune which could happen to you in your position would be the captain marrying and having children on the right side of the blanket as they call it now ive often heard the captain express a dislike to matrimony and laugh at peoples getting married which has pleased me very much for your sake master percival you see a man dont think much of marrying after forty and the captain must be fifty if not more yes but if his brother diesand he is a very infirm manthe captain will then be viscount de versely and inherit very large estates and then he will marry to have an heir to the title and estates even if there is no love in the case so he may replied crosstheres no saying but still even if he does it aint certain that he has a family chickens must not be counted before they are hatched all you have to pray for then is that the brother may prove as tough as our old admirals whose senses get tired of staying any longer in their bodies and leave them long before their hulks are worn out why do admirals live so long well i suppose it is for the same reason that salt meat keeps so much longer than fresh they have been forty or fifty years with the salt spray washing in their faces and wetting their jackets and so in time dye see they become as it were pickled with brine talking about that how long will it be before you get that tanning off you i dont know but as the captain says im to do no duty while it lasts i hope it wont wear off too soon spoken like a midshipman now take my advice although not ordered to your duty come up on deck and take your spyglass ive lost it unfortunately that was a good glass for it saved my life yes it turned out as good for you as a freemasons sign which is more than mr green can say i dont think hell ever make a sailorhed better bear up for clerk and then he might do very well for a purser byandby theres eight bells master keene so i think we had better say good night chapter twenty the arrow schooner had suffered very severely in the contest having lost her commanding officer and thirteen men killed and wounded indeed had not the calliope been at hand it was the general opinion that the stella would have overpowered her notwithstanding that the latter had lost her mainmast for the arrow was completely dismantled and would not have been able to have made sail the calliope sent her carpenters and best seamen on board to repair her damages and the next day we stood away for port royal jamaica to announce the destruction of the pirate vessel in the morning captain delmar sent for me mr keene as you cannot do duty for the present and as i do not wish you to be idle i think you had better pay a little attention to navigation you send in your days work i perceive but i suppose you have never regularly gone through a course of study no sir replied i i fudge my days work and i should be very glad to learn navigation properly so i presume well then i have spoken with mr smith the master who has promised me to give you the necessary instruction you will commence tomorrow you can sit at the table in the forecabin where you will have nothing to distract your attention you may go now i bowed and left the cabin and meeting bob cross on the main deck i told him what the captain had said im glad of it master keene it shows that the captain does now take a strong interest in you he has never taken any trouble of that kind with any midshipman before it will be of great service to you so pay attention it will please the captain if the master gives a good report of you who knows but you may be sent away in a prize and i sent with you to take care of you wouldnt that be a capital spree the next day i commenced accordingly under the tuition of the master and as i had not tommy dott to play with i gave satisfaction and continued to do so until our arrival at port royal when the captain went up to the admirals stating all the particulars of the action and by way of sequel my adventures on board of the pirate vessel the admiral was so much interested that he requested captain delmar to bring me on shore to dine with me the next day i was still very black but that made me i presume more interesting i told my story over again and it afforded great amusement to the company particularly to the ladies and i have reason to believe that many compliments were paid me behind my back by the admiral and officers who dined there at all events captain delmar was much pleased my strange history soon got wind the governor heard of it and asked captain delmar about it the consequence was that i received another invitation from the governor and captain delmar again informed me that i might tell my own story which i did modestly as before i say modestly for i never was a boaster at any time and i really believe that i thought much less of the circumstances than those did to whom i narrated them i had at that time but one wish which was to find favour in the sight of captain delmar i felt that all my prospects in life depended upon that and aware of his disposition and the deference that he expected humility had become as it were habitual during the time that we remained at port royal i continued my studies in the cabin and as the captain remained almost altogether on shore i found the run of the cabin very pleasant but as i had no inclination to study the whole of the day i was not sorry that tommy dott was very often my companion in the cabin an entrance to which as he could not pass the sentry at the door he obtained by climbing down the mizen chains and creeping into the port windows as soon as the captains boat was seen coming off tommy was out again by the port as quick as a monkey and i was very studiously poring over rightangled triangles i rose of course as the captain entered the cabin sit down mr keene he would saysit down the master has reported favourably of you and i am glad to hear of it one morning when as usual tommy dott had come through the port we were so busily employed with a caricature which we were making of old culpepper that the captains boat came alongside without our being aware of it and the captains voice speaking to the first lieutenant as he was descending the afterladder was the first intimation we received of his being on board it was impossible for tommy dott to escape without being seen as he climbed out the table which was in the centre of the cabin was covered with a blue cloth large enough for the table when all the additional leaves were put to it and in its present reduced size the cloth fell down to the deck i pointed it out to tommy as the sentrys hand upon the handle of the door announced the immediate entrance of the captain and he darted underneath the table that he might escape detection intending as soon as the captain went into the aftercabin to make his retreat by the cabindoor or windows the captain entered and i rose as usual from my chair mr keene said he i have occasion to speak to the first lieutenant on important private business oblige me by leaving the cabin till that is done you may as well tell mr hippesley that i wish to see him yes sir replied i making a bow and leaving the cabin i felt very much alarmed lest tommy should be discovered in his hidingplace and after the captain had stated that he had particular business with the first lieutenant it was my duty knowing that mr dott was there to have said so i hardly knew what to do or how to act after all it was no great crime as it stood tommy dott had come into the cabin without leave and had concealed himself but if i was to allow tommy to remain there and listen to important and particular business evidently of a secret nature i should forfeit the good opinion and confidence of the captain nevertheless i was very unwilling to betray him i was dreadfully puzzled and when i went to the first lieutenant he perceived my confusion why what is the matter with you mr keeneyou look quite frightened said he well sir i am replied i and i think it my duty to tell you why i am so i then informed him that tommy dott was under the cabintable and would of course hear the secret communications of the captain you have done very right mr keene and i know how unpleasant it is to you to inform against your messmate but at present there is no harm done he then laughed and said however mr dott shall never know that you have said anything about it and i will frighten him out of the cabin for the future he then went down the ladder and into the forecabin i expected that he would have discovered tommy as if by accident but such was not the case the captain had just gone into the aftercabin and mr hippesley immediately followed him and shutting the door informed him of mr dotts position and why i had made it known the captain could not help laughing as after all it was no great offence he then gave the necessary information to the first lieutenant and they both walked into the forecabin the first lieutenant saying if you please then captain delmar i will send a boat immediately with the letter certainly replied the captain sitting down and who evidently was inclined to join in the joke with mr hippesley sentry send the officer on deck to man the jollyboat and tell mr dott to come here immediately i was on deck when the sentry put his head up the ladder and gave the order and i immediately perceived the plan of the first lieutenant and the state of alarm in which tommy dott must have been put the jollyboat was manned and mr dott called for in every quarter of the ship but he did not make his appearance after a delay of several minutes the officer on deck went down into the cabin reporting that the jollyboat had been manned some time but that mr dott was not to be found not to be found replied the captain why he cant have fallen overboard not he sir replied the first lieutenant he has gone to sleep somewhere either in the tops or the foretopmast staysail netting he appears to be a very troublesome boy replied the captain very useless indeed sir replied the first lieutenant sentry have they found mr dott no sir quartermasters have been everywhere hes not in the ship very odd observed the captain oh hell turn up soon sir but really captain delmar if you were to give him two or three dozen at the cabin gun it would bring him to his senses that i most certainly will do replied captain delmar and i authorise you to do it mr hippesley as soon as he makes his appearance it will be of some service to him but i hope no accident has happened to him i have no fear of that sir replied the first lieutenant if the pursers stewards room had been open today i should have sent to see if he was not locked up in another attempt to steal raisins but that has not been the case bytheby the spiritroom was open this morning and he may have been down there and may have had the hatches put over him well we must send another midshipman call mr keene said captain delmar the sentry called me and i made my appearance mr keene youll go on shore to the dockyard in the jollyboat give that letter to the master attendant and wait for an answer yes sir replied i have you seen anything of mr dott said the first lieutenant you are constantly together i saw him just before captain delmar came on board sir but i have not seen him since well well we will settle accounts with the young gentleman as soon as he turns up replied the captain you may go mr keene i perceived that the captain and first lieutenant both smiled as i left the cabin it appeared that soon after they left it and the captain went on shore but tommy was so frightened that he remained in his hidingplace as he made sure he would be flogged if he made his appearance and he resolved to remain where he was until my return that he might consult me as soon as i had reported myself and given the answer to the first lieutenant i hastened to the cabin and then poor tommy crawled from under the table the tears were still wet on his cheeks i shall be flogged keene as sure as i stand here tell me what can i dowhat can i say tell the truth thats the best way replied i tell the captain that i was hid under the table that would never do depend upon it its the best plan replied i and it is the only advice i can give you you may be flogged if you tell the truth but you are sure to be flogged if you tell a lie it will only add to your offence well ive been thinking about itim sure that mr hippesley will flog me if he catches me today or tomorrow but if i remain hid for a day or two they will really think that i have fallen overboard and then they will say poor tommy dott and perhaps be so glad when i do make my appearance that they will forgive me yes replied i delighted at the idea im sure they will if you do tell the truth when you appear again then that is what ill do the first lieutenant said that i might be in the spiritroom where shall i go to why said i you must remain under the table till dark and then you may easily slip down into the coalhole where it is so dark that they never will see you even if they go down for coals it is the only place i know of stay there all tomorrow and next day and come up in the evening or the next morning perhaps will be better well its a very good place replied tommy anything better than being flogged but will you bring me something to eat and drink depend upon me tommy replied i ill contrive to bring you something every night well then ill do that replied he yes and tell the truth when you come out said i yes upon my honour i will and so saying tommy hearing a noise again dived under the cabin table soon afterwards i went out of the cabin the first lieutenant beckoned me to him and asked me where mr dott was and i told him what had been arranged between us he laughed very much and said well if master tommy punishes himself by two days confinement in the coalhole and tells the truth when he comes out i think i may promise he will get off his flogging but dont you say that i have spoken to you about it and let him do as he proposes when it was dark i supplied tommy with provisions and he gained the coalhole without being discovered the next day the speculations at his disappearance were general and it was now believed that poor tommy had fallen overboard and as the sharks are thick enough in port royal that he was safely stowed away in one of their maws i will say that the whole of the ships company were very sorry for him with the exception of mr culpepper who observed that no good ever came of a boy who stole raisins so you think that because a lad steals a few of your confounded plums observed the second lieutenant he deserves to be eaten by the sharks if i were tommy dott i would haunt you if i could im not afraid of dead men replied mr culpepper they are quiet enough perhaps so but recollect you make them chew tobacco and therefore they ought to rise up in judgment against you if they do against any one as this conversation passed on the quarterdeck it put an idea in my head that night i went to tommy whom i found terribly tired of sitting on the coals i brought him a bottle of mixed grog and some boiled beef and biscuit i consoled him by telling him that every one was sorry at his disappearance and that i was convinced that he would not be punished if he told the truth tommy was for leaving the coalhole immediately but i pointed out to him that the captain had not been on board that a and that it was necessary that the captain should believe that he had fallen overboard as well as the officers or his compassion would not be roused tommy saw the propriety of this and consented to remain another day i then told him what mr culpepper had said and i added now tommy if mr culpepper should see you by any chance pretend to be your ghost that i will replied tommy if i get six dozen for it i then left him on my return on deck i saw bob cross he was on shore during the major portion of the day attending upon the captain and as i was no longer in the captains gig i saw but little of him well mr keene said he i think you have quite recovered your colour by this time and i hope to see you in the gig again i do not think i shall yet awhilei have not yet learnt navigation enough but the master says he will be done with me in a fortnight if i go on as well as i do now yes i heard him tell the captain that you were very quick and would be a good navigator but i cant get over the loss of poor tommy dott he was a little scampish thats sartin but still he was a merry kindhearted boytoo good for the sharks at all events you must feel his loss mr keene for you were always together no i dont bob replied i well im sorry to hear you say that mr keene i thought you had a kinder heart so i have bob but ill tell you a secret known only to the first lieutenant and me and that is tommys in the coalhole very dirty but quite safe bob cross burst into a fit of laughing which lasted some time well mr keene you have really taken a weight off my mind now tell me all about it you know im safe i then told bob what had happened and of tommys intention to make his appearance on the following evening or the next morning well said bob youre mischief itself master keene and thats a fact however its all right this time and you have the captain and first lieutenant as your confidants and partners in the joke you did perfectly right and im sure the captain and first lieutenant must be pleased with you but recollect master keene keep your distance as before dont presume never fear bob replied i but now i have told you that i want you to assist me i then repeated the conversation of mr culpepper with the second lieutenant now continued i you see cross i cant do anything myself mr culpepper hates me and would suspect me but if we could only frighten him you might for he would not think you were playing him a trick i see replied bob it will be a good thing for tommy dott and a nice windup of this affair let me alone when i come on board tomorrow evening ill manage it if i can after a little more conversation we separated for the night the next morning the captain came on board he remained on deck with the first lieutenant for some minutes during which of course he was made acquainted with tommy dotts position when he came down into the cabin i moved from my seat as respectful and serious as before and when ordered to sit down again resumed my studies with great apparent diligence he did not say a word to me about tommy dott and as he was going out of the cabin mr culpepper was announced by the sentry if you please captain delmar said mr culpepper with his usual profound bow what are we to do with the effects of mr dott who has fallen overboard by the regulations of the service they should be sold before the mast and i also wish to know whether he is to be continued to be victualled or whether it is your pleasure that he is discharged as dead the captain smiled and turned his face towards me but i continued with my eyes down on my book perhaps we had better wait till tomorrow mr culpepper replied the captain and then you may sell his effects and put dd to his name poor fellow and having made this reply the captain went out of his cabin mr culpepper followed and shortly afterwards the captain went on shore again before dusk the captains gig as usual returned on board and i was at the gangway to meet bob cross the boat was hoisted up and then bob came to me i must first go down and see mr dott that i may be able to swear to the fact bob did so and then returned on deck mr culpepper was abaft walking by himself when bob went up and accosted him if you please sir said bob touching his hat did the captain say anything to you about coals for i expect we shall not stay here much longer no replied mr culpepper then he must have forgot it i suppose sir well theres plenty of coals replied mr culpepper well sir i dont know but i think i heard the cooks mate say as how they were getting rather low getting rather low then there must have been great waste exclaimed mr c who was very careful of his expenses i dont know how far it may be so but i think it might be as well to know how matters stand and if so be theres plenty why i can tell captain delmar when i go on shore tomorrow ill see ill go down myself tonight replied mr culpepper the midshipmen are allowed a stove to themselvesvery unusualand they are cooking all day talking about midshipmen sir replied cross you may think its very odd but as i stand hereand you know mr culpepper i am not easily scaredi saw that young tommy dott or his ghost this very evening it was now quite dark and mr culpepper stared at the coxswain and then replied pooh nonsense its no nonsense i do assure you i saw him with these eyes sure as i stand here where exclaimed mr c right forward sir i only mention it to you but dont say a word about it for i should only be laughed at but i do assure you that i would kiss the bible to it if it was required i never did before believe in anything of that sort thats sartain but its no use talking about it sir i think i had better get a lantern and get over this coal business at once yes yes replied mr culpepper but you wont know how much coals there are i must go myself and see bob cross was soon ready with the lantern and went forward with mr culpepper the hammocks had been piped down and they were obliged to bend double under them to get along the lower deck i followed unperceived the descent into the coalhole was by battens and not very easy for an old man like mr c but cross went down first holding the light for the purser to follow which he did very slowly and with great caution as soon as they both stood on the coals below the purser took the light to make his survey why theres plenty of coals for three months coxswain said he i thought there was you see they are nearly up to the beams abaft look sirlook exclaimed cross starting back whats that where exclaimed mr c alarmed there sirthere he is i told you so the pursers eyes were directed to where bob pointed and then he beheld tommy dott standing immovable with his arms extended as if denouncing himhis eyes staring and his mouth wide open mercymurder cried the purser dropping the lantern which went out and left them in the dark and he tumbled down on the coals bob cross stepped over him and hastened up to the lower deck followed by tommy dott who first by way of revenge jumped several times upon the pursers face and body before he climbed up the cry of the purser had given the alarm the masteratarms hastened forward with his lantern just as tommy had made his appearance above the coamings seeing tommy as black as a sweep he too was frightened the men had put their heads out of their hammocks and some of them had seen tommy bob cross as he crawled aft cried out tommy dotts ghost i had pretended to be terrified out of my wits as i ran aft and all was confusion on the lower deck the first lieutenant had come out of the wardroom and seeing me he inquired what was the matter i replied that mr culpepper had gone down into the coalhole and had seen mr dotts ghost he laughed heartily and went back tommy had in the mean time made his appearance in the mids berth at which they had all rushed from him in dismay just as i entered when i caught him by the hand saying tommy my boy how are you they then perceived that it was tommy himself and order was restored mr culpepper was hoisted up out of the coalhole master tommy having jumped upon his face he looked a very miserable object as he was well blackened as well as much bruised from the soles of tommys shoes and his nose had bled profusely he was very incoherent for some time but the doctor gave him an opiate and put him to bed the next morning the whole affair was explained on the quarterdeck master tommy well reprimanded and desired to return to his duty the captain was very much amused at the winding up of this affair as it was a capital story to tell at the governors tommy never had an idea that i had blown upon him nor did mr culpepper imagine that their meeting was premeditated i had now completed the usual course of navigation under the master and had no longer any cause for remaining in the cabin i therefore returned to my berth but as i had taken a liking to navigation i now was employed daily in working sights and rating the chronometer we remained three weeks longer in port royal and then were ordered out on a cruise on the south american coast there we continued for nearly six months without anything occurring worth relating except our having captured four good prizes we were returning to jamaica when we fell in with a schooner which gave us the intelligence of the capture of the island of curacao by four english frigates as we were near to the island and short of water captain delmar resolved to touch at it and remained two or three days the reader will perhaps recollect that the old dutch gentleman whose life i had saved in the pirate vessel had stated that his name was vanderwelt and that he lived at curacao the next evening we entered the harbour and it was astonishing to every one how so strong a place could have been taken by so small a force the commodore who had plenty of work on hand requested or rather ordered our captain to remain with him for ten days or a fortnight to assist him on the third day after our arrival i obtained leave to go on shore as i wished to find out the old dutch gentleman as i was again in the captains gig i had very often landed but had not had an opportunity of making inquiries as i could not leave my boat and boats crew this afternoon i landed in the gig and went up through the gate into the town but i could not find anyone who spoke english at last by asking for the house of mynheer vanderwelt it was pointed out to me and i went up to the door it was a very large house with a verandah all round it painted bright green and while alternately there were several slaves sitting down at the entrance and i asked for mynheer vanderwelt they stared at me and wondered what i wanted but as i was in midshipmans uniform they were of course very civil and one of them beckoned me to follow him which i did and was introduced to the old gentleman who was sitting in a cane armchair with his pipe in his mouth and fanned by two slave girls about twelve years old as he had spoken to me in english on board of the pirate i immediately went up to him and said how do you do sir i am very well sir replied he taking the pipe out of his mouth what do you want do you come from the english commodore what is his pleasure no sir replied i i do not come from the commodore but i came up to see you oh that is all replied the old gentleman putting his pipe in his mouth again and resuming his smoking i felt rather nettled at his treatment and then said dont you know me sir no sir replied he i have not that honour i have never seen you in my life before and i do not know you my blood was up at this cool declaration then i wish you a good morning sir replied i and turning on my heel i was strutting out with all the dignity of an offended midshipman when i was met face to face by the little girl his daughter she stared at me very much and i passed her in sovereign contempt she followed me timidly and looked into my face then panting for breath seized me by the arm i turned to her at being stopped in this manner and was about to shake her off with anything but politeness when she screamed out and in a moment had sprung up and was hanging with both arms round my neck fader fader she cried out as i struggled to disengage myself the old gentleman came out at the summons stop him fader dont let him go away cried she in dutch it is he it is he who my child asked the old gentleman the pirateboy replied the little girl bursting into a paroxysm of tears on my shoulders mein gott it cannot be he was black my child yet continued the old gentleman looking at me he is like him tell me sir are you our preserver yes replied i i was but that is of little consequence now will you oblige me by removing this young lady continued i for i was highly offended sir i ask your pardon replied the old gentleman but i am not to blame how could i recognise you in a white person when you were so darkcoloured at our meeting on board of that vessel i am not to blame indeed i am not my dear young friend i would have given ten thousand rix dollars to have met you that i might prove my gratitude for your noble defence of us and our preservation at such a risk come sir you must forgive the mistake of an old man who was certainly not inclined to be civil to an officer who belonged to the squadron who had within these few days so humiliated us by their astonishing bravery and success let my little girl whose life you saved persuade you if i cannot in the mean time the little girl had dropped from my shoulder and was on the floor embracing my knees and still sobbing i felt convinced that what the old gentleman said was true and that he had not recognised me i had forgotten that i had been stained dark at the time that i had met them on board of the stella i therefore held out my hand to the old gentleman and raising the little girl we all three went in together to where we had found the old gentleman on my first introduction to him if you knew how delighted i am to see you and be able to express my thanks said mynheer vanderwelt and poor minnie too how often have we talked over that dreadful day and wondered if ever we should see you again i assure you on my honour that now i no longer regret the capture of the island minnie stood by me during the time her father was speaking her large blue eyes beaming through the tears with which they brimmed and as i turned to her our eyes met and she smiled i drew her towards me she appeared as if she only required some encouragement for she immediately kissed me several times on the cheek nearest to her every now and then saying a word or two in dutch to her father which i could not understand i hardly need say that after this intimacy was soon brought about if i thought that at first i had been treated with ingratitude ample amends was made afterwards the old gentleman said during the evening good heaven if my daughters eyes had not been sharper than mine if you had gone away thinking that i did not choose to recognise youhad i found it out afterwards it would have broken my heart and poor minnies too oh i am gratefulvery grateful to god that it was not so that i passed a very pleasant evening the reader may imagine the household who had been told who i was appeared to almost worship me the old gentleman asked me a hundred questions as to my parentage etcetera about captain delmar and the service and begged of me to remain with him altogether while the frigate was in port i told him that was impossible but that i would come as often as i could obtain leave at nine oclock i bade them good night and was escorted to the boat by six of the slaves carrying lanterns captain delmar as well as all the other captains of the frigates had taken up his quarters on shore for the harbour was so narrow and landlocked that the heat on board was excessive i found that the next day old mr vanderwelt had paid his respects to captain delmar giving him an account of what had occurred on board of the pirate much more flattering to me than what i had stated myself the steward was present at the time and he had told bob cross who communicated it to me mynheer vanderwelt had also begged as a favour that i might be permitted to stay on shore with him during the time that the frigate was in harbour but to this captain delmar had not consented promising however that i should have occasional leave when the service would permit of it the reader may recollect that the island of curacao had been surrendered to the english in and restored to the dutch in during that interval several english merchants had settled there and remained after the restoration and now at the second capture we found them still on the island from these we received the information that mr vanderwelt was the richest man on the island and that the dutch government was indebted to him in very large sums that he had long retired from business although he had large property in the havannah which he received with his wife who had been a spanish lady and that it was his intention to have gone back to holland by the first manofwar which should have arrived we remained three weeks at curacao during which time the first lieutenant gave me leave to go on shore almost every evening after the captain had dismissed his gig and to remain at mr vanderwelts till halfpast eight the following morning when i joined my boat and attended on the captain by this plan my duty was not interfered with and i had many pleasant meetings with my new friends and became as may be imagined very intimate with little minnie i may as well describe her she was about ten years old tall for her age she was very fair with deep blue eyes and very dark hair her countenance was very animated and expressive and she promised to be a very handsome woman her father doted upon her for he had no other child he had married late in life and his wife had died a few days after minnie was born she was very affectionate in disposition and very sweettempered up to the present she had received but little education and that was one principal reason for mr vanderwelts wishing to return to holland i soon became as one of the family and certainly was treated as such minnie was very curious to know what it was that i carried about my neck in the sealskin pouch but i never could tell either her or her father what it really was mr vanderwelt very often asked me if i liked being at sea and i invariably replied in the affirmative at last the frigate was to sail and i had but one more evening to pass with them mr vanderwelt appeared very grave and little minnie would every now and then during the evening burst into tears at the idea of our separation at last the hour of parting arrivedit was very painful i promised to write to them and mr vanderwelt told me that his house was always ready to receive me and begged that if i wanted anything i would let him know i cried myself when i left the housethe first time that i ever cried i believe on such an occasion the next morning we were again under weigh to rejoin the admiral at jamaica bob cross had told me that he wished to have a little talk with me in the first watch and i met him on the gangway our usual rendezvous master keene i have some news for you which i gained from the steward last night i will say that his ears are always open not that i think he is generally what is called an eavesdropper but he likes you and when you are concerned he does care to find out what is going on now you see sir that dutch gentleman whom you saved from the nigger pirate came to call on captain delmar yesterday morning and after some palaver he told the captain that he wished you to remain with him altogether and leave his majestys service and he begged the captain to allow you to be discharged and then he would be a father to you as you had no father there was a great deal more which the steward could not make out but it was all to that effect well the captain said that it was very true that you had lost your father but that he considered you as his own son and could not part with you on any account and he stated that you were so promising an officer that it be very wrong that you should leave the service and that it must not be thought of the old gentleman said a great deal and tried very hard to persuade the captain but it was of no use the captain said he would never let you go till you were a postcaptain and commanded a fine frigate and then you would of course be your own master and act as you please i am very glad to hear all this bob i can assure you yes sir it is very good news but master keene i only hope knowing captain delmar as you do that you will act towards him as if you had never heard it i will depend upon it cross as for leaving the service that i would not have done even if captain delmar had agreed to it im an englishman and i dont want to be under dutch protection thats right sirthats rightjust as i wished you to feel how time flies away why master keene you have been afloat nearly three years within a month bob and youre growing such a tall fellow they wont keep you much longer in the captains gig i expect i shall be sorry for that so master tommy dott is in another scrape howi heard nothing of it no because its only within this halfhour that hes got in it tell me why sir mr culpepper had fallen fast asleep on the gunroom table under the skylight which as you know is always open and his head had fallen back and his mouth was wide open there was no other officer in the gunroom except mr culpepper and tommy dott who perceived him asked timothy jenkins the maintopman to give him a quid of tobacco well jenkins takes it out of his cheek redhot as you may suppose and hands it to master tommy who takes his perpendicular very accurately and drops the quid into the pursers open mouth mr culpepper was almost choked but after a terrible coughing the quid comes up again notwithstanding he turns as sick as a dog and is obliged to run to the basin in his cabin well sir as soon as he comes out again he goes up under the half deck and inquires of the sentry who it was that did it and the sentry who is that sulky fellow martin instead of knowing nothing about it says directly it was master tommy and now theres a formal complaint made by mr culpepper on the quarterdeck and master tommy will get it as sure as a gun he dont know how to play a trick replied i he is always found out and punished the great point is not to be discoveredthats the real pleasure in playing a trick well you certainly do manage well master keene but i think its almost time you left them off now youre getting an oldster why you must be seventeen sir yes bob not very far from it well i suppose i must say mister keene for the future you may call be what you like bob you have been a good friend to me well sir i only hope that captain delmar will make you a postcaptain as he says and that youll get a fine frigate and ill be your coxswain but thats a long way to look to and we shant have any more councils of war on the gangway then no but we may in the cabin cross a large sail on the starboard bow cried the lookout man forward a large sail on the starboard bow reported the mate of the watch my glass was on the capstern and i ran for it and went forward to examine the vessel although my duty as signal midshipman was ended at sunset what do you make of it mr keene said the officer of the watch i think she is a manofwar but it is so dark that i cannot make her out very clearly is she standing this way yes sir under topsails and topgallantsails i think the officer of the watch went down to report to the captain who had not yet turned into his cot captain delmar had been informed that a dutch frigate was expected at the island but not until the following month still we had no reason to suppose that there were any of our frigates down in these latitudes except those lying in the harbour at curacao the wind was light about a three knot breeze and there being no moon till after twelve oclock it was very difficult to make out what she was some said she was a twodecked vessel the captain went down to look at his private signals for the night and before he came up i was all ready with the lanterns two lights over one in a triangle be quick mr keene aye aye sir replied i the lights were soon hoisted at the peak but as they could not well be seen by the other vessel as we were standing towards her we went about and hove to across her hawse for a quarter of an hour she continued to stand towards us without noticing the signals at last the captain said they must be all asleep on board of the vessel no captain delmar replied i keeping my telescope on the vessel they are not all asleep for i saw lights on the maindeck through the bowports i see them again now so do i said the first lieutenant then well beat to quarters mr hippesley rejoined the captain the men were summoned to quarters and hammocks piped up and stowed in a very short time the guns cast loose and every man at his post but the ports not opened waiting the coming down of the stranger now about a mile distant when suddenly she rounded to the wind on the same tack that we were and set her royals and flyingjib she does not answer our signals observed the captain i suspect by that and her present manoeuvre she must be an enemy i have no doubt of it sir observed the first lieutenant an english frigate would not behave in that way open the ports and get up the fighting lanterns then said the captain for up to the present we had been careful not to show any lights it was now plain to see that her men were at their quarters and that she was prepared for action when everything was ready on deck the royals and flyingjib were set and we gave chase the strange vessel was about threequarters of a mile on our weatherbeam in half an hour we had gained upon her considerably and our sailing was so superior that we were satisfied should she prove an enemy that in an hour more we should be engaged of course we might have engaged her at the distance we were from her but you cannot be too careful in a night action and ought never to engage without first hailing the vessel to make sure that she is an enemy as circumstances may and have occurred by which an english vessel may not be able to answer the private signal and of course a vessel belonging to a neutral power would be in the same position the incertitude which existed as to whether the strange vessel was an enemy or not created great excitement my duty as signal midshipman placed me abaft on the quarterdeck and bob cross who was really a quartermaster although doing duty as captains coxswain was at the wheel at last we had brought the chase well on our weather quarter and when we tacked we found that we lay well up she being about a point on our lee bow another halfhour brought us within two cables length of her when we kept away so as to pass her to leeward close enough to have thrown a biscuit on board the stranger still remaining on the opposite tack captain delmar then hailed from the gangway ship ahoy there was a deathlike silence on board of both vessels and his voice pierced sonorously through the night wind ah yaw was the reply what ship is that continued captain delmar during this time every man was at his gun the captains with the lanyards of the locks in their hands ready to pour in a broadside the reply from the other vessel wasvat chip is dat his britannic majestys ship calliope replied captain delmar and then he repeatedwhat ship is that let every man lie down at his quarters said captain delmar the order was hardly obeyed when the stranger frigate poured in her broadside and as we were then very close with great execution to our hull and rigging but as the men had been lying down very few of them were hurt as soon as the crash was over captain delmar cried outup men and fire as i round to under her stern in a few seconds we had passed through the volumes of smoke and luffed up under her stern we poured in our whole broadside let her go off againflatten in there forward reedy about was the next order given we ran away from her about three cables length until we had sufficient way to tack and then we went about and stood towards her steering for her weather quarter as if we were going to engage her to windward over to the larboard guns my lads hands by after bracings and howlings mr hippesley aye aye sir all ready as soon as we were near enough the afteryards were shivered the jib sheet to windward and the helm put up the calliope worked beautifully she paid sharp off and we again passed under her stern and gave another raking broadside very unexpected on the part of the dutchman who presumed that we were going to engage him to windward and had his men all ready at his larboard guns in consequence the dutch captain was evidently much annoyed he stood at the taffrail and much to our amusement cried out in bad english you cowardnot fight fair as we shot ahead of her to leeward she gave us a portion of her starboard broadside but the men having been over at the guns on the other side were not quick enough and they did us no injury whereas her mizzenmast fell over the side a few minutes after we passed her she then raid off and so did we so that she might not rake us and broadsides were exchanged on equal terms but before we had exchanged these broadsides both ships running with the wind on the quarter we found that our superiority in sailing free was so great that we shot ahead of him out of his fire and we were enabled to luff up and rake him again the last raking broadside brought down his maintopmast and then she was all our own as bob cross said as she could not round to with no after sail and we could from our superiority in sailing take our position as we pleased which we did constantly keeping ahead of him and raking him broadside after broadside and receiving but one broadside in return until his foremast went by the board and he had nothing but his mainmast standing this bettered his condition on the whole as although hardly manageable with so little wind he had more power over his vessel as far as rounding to the wind which he did and the action continued but our fighting under sail gave us great advantage and although an occasional shot would come in and we had to carry some men into the cockpit for one shot we received we certainly returned ten the action had continued about an hour when by the continual cannonading the light wind was beaten down and it fell dead calm this put us again upon a more equal footing as the calliope had not steerage way we were then about a quarter of a mile apart lying head and stern but both ships had fallen off during the calm so that only the quarter guns of each could be brought to bear the major portion of the ships company being therefore not able to use their guns were employed in repairing the damages we had received which were very considerable especially in the sails and rigging i was standing by bob cross who was looking out for cats paws as we call slight breaths of wind when he said in a low voice master keene i never had an idea that the captain could handle his ship so well he really knows what hes about as well as any man in the service i thought so too replied i whew theres a nasty shot cried i as one came in and upset half a dozen of the marines who were hauling upon the mizzentopsail sheet which had just been spliced yes sir that chap is made of good stuff depend upon itall the dutchmen are if they could only keep their hands out of their breeches pockets they would be rummer customers than they are now as it is they are not to be played with and depend upon it were a long way off having him yet we must pray for wind to come up and he must pray for the calm to continue wheres mr keene said the captain who was on the other side of the deck here sir said i running up and touching my hat mr keene go down quietly and ascertain how many men we have hurt the doctor will be able to tell you pretty nearly aye aye sir replied i and i dived down below just as i did so a shot came in and cut away the lower rail of the copper stanchions which were round the hatchway about a foot beyond my hat had i not gone down so quickly it would have taken my head off i went down into the gunroom for the doctor preferred being there to the cockpit as there was so much more room to operate and i gave him the captains message he was very busy taking off a poor fellows leg it was a horrible sight and made me sick and faint as soon us the bone had been sawed off he said you will find all the wounded i have dressed in the steerage those they have brought me down dead are in the cockpit there have been five amputations already the master is badly wounded and mr williams the mate is killed those whom i have not been able to attend to yet are here in the gunroom you must ascertain what the captain wishes to know yourself mr keene i cannot leave a leg with the arteries not taken up to count heads mr rivers the tenaculumease the tourniquet now as i felt what the doctor said to be true i got a lantern and commenced my examinations i found fourteen wounded men waiting the doctors care in the gunroom which was almost a pool of blood in the steerage there were nine who had been dressed and four in their hammocks who had undergone amputation of the arm or leg i then went down into the cockpit where i counted eleven of our best men lying dead having obtained the information required i was proceeding up the cockpit ladder when i turned towards the pursers stewards room and saw mr culpepper the purser on his knees before a lantern he looked very palehe turned round and saw me whats the matter cried he nothing sir only the captain wishes to know how many men are killed and wounded tell him i do not know surely he does not want me on deck he wants to know how many men are hurt sir replied i for i perceived that he thought that the message was sent to him mercy on me stop a minute mr keene and ill send up word by you i cant stop sir replied i going up the ladder mr culpepper would have called me back but i preferred leaving him in his error as i wished to see which he most dreaded the captains displeasure or the shot of the enemy i returned on deck and made my report the captain looked very grave but made no reply i found that the two frigates were now lying stern to stern and firing occasional guns which raked fore and aft except the men who worked the guns aft our people were lying down at their quarters by the order of the captain if we only had but a capful of wind said the captain to the first lieutenant but i see no appearance of it i touched my hat and said the moon will rise in about ten minutes sir and she often brings the wind up with her thats true mr keene but its not always the case i only hope she will if not i fear we shall lose more of our men the firing continued and our mainmast had received so many shots that we were obliged to hold it for its support while so employed the moon rose and the two vessels had now a good view of each other i directed my glass to the horizon under the moon and was delighted to perceive a black line which promised wind i reported it to the master and the promise was kept good for in a quarter of an hour our sails flapped and then gradually filled she has steerage way sir reported bob cross thank heaven for that replied captain delmar jump up men brace round the yards mr hippesley the enemys main yard is cut in two in the slings sir reported i after i had my glass upon her then her last hope is gone replied mr hippesley haul over the starboard jibsheet forwardlet her come to quartermaster larboard guns my lads now my men cried captain delmar make short work of her this injunction was obeyed we had now a good sight of the enemy and brought our whole broadside to bear upon her stern and after a quarter of an hour more firing i perceived that her ensign was no longer on the staff where it had been hoisted after the fall of the mizenmast neither had she for the last five minutes given us a gun in return she has struck sir i think said i to captain delmar her ensign is down pass the word cease firing mr hippesley but let the guns be all reloaded in case of accidents have we a boat that can swim examine the cutters mr keene i found the cutter on the larboard quarter with her bottom out she could not swim that was clear the starboard one was in better condition the starboard cutter will float sir her gunwale is all torn away but there are rollocks enough to pull let her be cleared away and lowered down mr hippesley send for the second lieutenant i believe hes not on deck sir replied the first lieutenant not much hurt i hope a splinter i was told sir wheres mr weymss the third lieutenant mr weymss jump into the boat and take possession of the prize take as many men as you can and mr keene with mr weymss and as soon as you have gained the necessary information come back with the boat and two hands i followed the third lieutenant info the boat and we pulled on board of our antagonist a junior officer received us on the deck and presented his sword his left arm was bound up and he was very pale from loss of blood he spoke pretty good english and we found that we had captured the dort dutch frigate of thirtyeight guns bound to curacao with a detachment of troops for the garrison and a considerable quantity of ammunition and specie on board for the use of the colony we inquired whether the captain was much hurt as he did not appear on deck he is dead gentlemen replied the young officer he was my father our loss has been very great i am only a cadet yet i am commanding officer a tear rolled down his cheek as he said that the captain was his father and i felt for him shortly afterwards he staggered to a carronade slide and dropped down on it and very soon was in a state of insensibility the carnage had been dreadful and the bulwarks of the vessel had been shattered to pieces the scene was almost as had as the stellas decks before she was blown up by the negro captain several of the guns were dismounted and two of them had burst i had only time to go round the gundeck and then i ordered two hands into the boat that i might make my report to captain delmar i asked the third lieutenant to allow me to take on board the young officer who still remained lifeless on the carronade slide and as it was proper for me to bring back with me the commanding officer he consented we lowered him with a rope into the boat and then i returned on board of the calliope and went up to the captain to make my report and present him with the sword of the officer commanding the prize just as i was commencing my story mr culpepper came up without his wig and in a state of great disorder with a piece of dirty paper in his hand he trembled very much from the effects of his alarm but made a very profound bow and said to captain delmar here is the state of killed and wounded captain delmar as far as i have been able to collect them i could not possibly get them ascertained before although i have been an hour or two employedever since mr keene came down the captain who did not like the interruption replied very haughtily mr culpepper its the duty of the surgeon to send in the report of killed and wounded you had better go down below get your dress in a little better order now mr keene old culpepper slunk away as i proceeded to give the information and the captain now asked the carpenter if the pinnace was sufficiently repaired in a few minutes sir was the reply mr hippesley you must then send forty hands on board the prize to repair her damages as far as we can mr weymss must remain on board in the meantime the young officer had been taken down below to the surgeon who had now some leisure to attend to him he was soon restored and the surgeon expressed his opinion that it would be possible to save his arm i went down to see him and i gave him my hammock to sleep in for the present and as soon as he was comfortably arranged under the halfdeck i returned to the quarterdeck and made myself as useful as i could for we had plenty to do on board of our own frigate knotting and splicing having only made temporary repairs it was now dawn of day and very soon afterwards broad daylight the men were ordered aft with the buckets and the decks which were smeared and black with powder and the blood of the wounded were washed down that we were all very tired i hardly need say but it was not yet time for repose the magazines had been secured and the fires lighted another boat with the carpenter and assistantsurgeon had been sent on board the prize to remedy any serious damage and to assist in dressing the wounded i was sent with the boat mr weymss the third lieutenant had not been idle jurymasts were in preparation the decks had been cleared the dead thrown overboard and the wounded taken below on mustering the remainder of the dorts ships company and calling over the musterroll of the troops on board we found that she had lost the captain lieutenants and officers seamen and soldiers killed and the firstlieutenant officers and wounded killed and wounded total she had received several shot between wind and water and had a good deal of water in the hold this was however soon remedied by the carpenter and his crew and the frigate pumped out by the prisoners i returned on board of the calliope with this intelligence to the captain and found that the surgeon had just sent in the report of our own loss which was officer and men killedmaster lieutenants midshipmen and wounded do you know who are the midshipmen wounded said the captain to me i heard that mr james was killed sir but not the names of those who are wounded but i think one of them must be mr dott or we certainly should have seen him about i should not be surprised replied the captain sentry ask who are the young gentlemen wounded the sentry replied mr castles and mr dott well replied the captain hell be in no more mischief for some time i heard of his trick to the purser as the captain was saying this i perceived the piece of paper which the purser had brought up as his report of killed and wounded lying on the table with the other reports it had apparently not been examined by the captain but my eye caught it and i observed written in a shaking hand pieces of beef ditto pork raisins marines i could not help smiling what are you amused with mr keene may i ask said the captain rather gravely i beg your pardon sir for venturing so in your presence replied i but it is mr culpeppers report of killed and wounded which i then took up and handed to the captain this proof of mr culpeppers state of mind during the conflict was too much for even captain delmar who laughed outright the old fool muttered he you may go now mr keene if breakfast is ready tell mr hippesley to let the men have it as soon as possible aye aye sir replied i and bowing respectfully i quitted the cabin for i felt that captain delmar thought that he had not been quite so reserved towards me as he always wished to be as soon as i had given the captains orders i went down to find out tommy dott he was in his hammock next to mine in which i had put the young dutch officer dott was wide awake and apparently very feverish where are you hurt tommy i am sure i dont know said he get me some water keene i got a pannikin of water and he drank it dont you know where you are hurt i believe its my sidesomewhere about the body i know but im so stiff all over that i cant tell exactly where something hit me and i fell right down the hatchway thats all i know about it until i found myself in my hammock well at all events you wont be punished now for dropping the quid into mr culpeppers mouth no replied tommy with a smile in spite of his pain but i would have played him a better trick than that if i had had any idea that we should have been so soon in action i wish i could turn round keenei think i should be easier i turned poor tommy in his hammock and then left him i looked at the son of the dutch captainhe was slumbering he was a very slight youth with very beautiful but very feminine features i felt a kindness towards him poor fellow for he had lost his father and he was about to pass his best years in prison but the boatswains mates piped to breakfast and i hastened down into the berth to get my share of the cocoa as soon as the men had finished their breakfast the hands were again turned up the lower deck cleared and washed new sails bent and the guns properly secured screens were put up round the halfdeck where the wounded were in their beds the dead were brought up and sewed up in their hammocks laid out on gratings and covered with the ensign and union jack preparatory to their being committed to the deep another party was sent to assist on board of the prize and the prisoners were brought on board and put down in the forehold which had been cleared for their reception by noon everything was so far ready that we were enabled to take the prize in tow and make sail on the calliope after which the men who were exhausted went to dinner and were permitted to sleep during the remainder of the day until the evening when the ships company was ordered up and the dead were committed to the deep blue sea with the usual ceremonies the breeze was steady but the water was smooth during the night and glad i was to throw myself on one of the lockers in the midshipmens berth after so many hours of excitement i slept till four in the morning and finding the planks not quite so soft as they might be i then turned into the hammock of the midshipman of the morning watch and remained till six hells when bob cross came down and told me that the captain would soon be on deck well cross said i as i came on deck and went aft to look at the prize in tow this is a nice business and our captain will gain a great deal of credit and he deserves it master keene replied cross as i said before i never had an idea that he could handle his ship so wellno nor none of the ships company we all thought mr hippesley the best officer of the two but we have found out our mistake the fact is mr keene captain delmar wraps himself an in his dignity like a cloak and theres no making him out till circumstances oblige him to take it off thats very true bob replied i it is only this very morning that he laughed himself and i laughed also and he pulled up immediately afterwards twice as stiff to me as before i then told bob of mr culpeppers report which amused him very much i am sure that he is pleased with you mr keene and i must say that you were very useful and very active do you know that the carpenter says that we have received injuries that cannot be well repaired without the ship going into dock and i should not be surprised if we were to be sent home if the survey confirms his report i hope we shall i am tired of the west indies and i should like to see my mother we have a nice breeze now and we are two points free if it lasts we shall be at jamaica in a fortnight or less the captain coming on deck put an end to our conversation before night the prize had got up jurymasts and sail set upon them and we went through the water more rapidly in ten days we arrived at port royal with our prize the captain went on shore and what was still more agreeable we got rid of all our prisoners and wounded men a survey in consequence of the carpenters report was held upon the calliope and the result was she was ordered home to be repaired the dort was commissioned by the admiral and mr hippesley received an acting order to the sloop of war which had become vacant by the commander of her being promoted into the dort which was now christened the curacao in ten days after our arrival we were ready and made sail for old england tommy dott and the second lieutenant remained on board and were both convalescent before we entered the channel tommy dotts wound by the bye was a splinter in the back added to severe bruises from tumbling down the hatchway captain delmar had shown great kindness to the son of the dutch captain and he did not send him on shore with the rest of the prisoners but permitted him to remain and come home in the calliope he recovered slowly but was soon out of danger and was walking about with his arm in a sling long before we arrived in england it appeared to me that during the passage home old culpepper was not so much in the good graces of captain delmar as he used to be he was however more obsequious than ever we had a fine run home and in seven weeks from our leaving port royal we dropped our anchor at spithead i may have been wrung but it certainly did appear to me that as we neared the coast of england the behaviour of captain delmar was more reserved to me i may say it was harsher than ever it had been before hurt at treatment which i felt i did not deserve i tried to analyse the cause as i walked up and down the deck and at last i decided that his pride was again alarmed on the one hand he was returning to his own country to meet with his aristocratical connections and on the other he was reminded of my mother and his mesalliance with herif such a term can be used to a woman who had sacrificed herself to one above her in rank at all events i was the result of that connection and i presumed that he was ashamed of it and consequently kept me at a distance and checked his feelings towards me perhaps he thought that my mother might be induced to disclose to me that which i had under his own handwriting and wore next my heart or he might consider i was no longer a boy but a tall young man and one who might be induced to claim his protection such were my reflections and my resolutions were taken accordinglyi wanted no bob cross to counsel me now when the captain left the ship i made no request as did the other midshipmen for leave to see my friends nor even when he returned on board which he did several times after the ship had gone into harbour and was stripping preparatory to being docked one thing however gave me great satisfaction which was that when the despatch which we brought home was published i found my name honourably mentioned in conjunction with other officers and but three midshipmen were named when the calliope went into dock the report of the dockyard was very unfavourable she required a thorough repair which would take some months she was therefore ordered to be paid off in the mean time the captain had gone to london during his sojourn at portsmouth i had never spoken to him except on duty and he had left me without a word of explanation as to his intentions towards me as soon however as the order came down for paying off the ship i received a letter from him very cold and stiff stating that i might if i pleased join any other ship and he would recommend me to the captain or i might remain on the books of the guardship and wait until he commissioned another vessel when he would be happy to take me with him my reply was immediate i thanked him for his kindness and hoped i might remain on board the guardship until he took the command of another vessel as i did not wish to sail with any other captain i had been brought forward by him in the service and preferred waiting for months rather than lose his kind protection the only reply to my letter was an order from the admiralty for me to be discharged into the guardship when the calliope was paid off i hardly need say that i had written and received letters from my mother who was delighted at my name being mentioned in the despatches but i will defer family news till the proper opportunity as i must first tell all that occurred in the calliope before she was paid off the reader will recollect that the son of the dutch captain whose name was vangilt had been permitted to come home in the ship instead of being sent to prison he and i were very intimate and when i discovered that he was the cousin of minnie vanderwelt i became more partial to him he was very melancholy during the passage home how indeed could he be otherwise with the prospect of being a prisoner during the remainder of the war and he often expressed his feelings on the subject could you not escape said i one evening i fear not replied he if once out of prison i have no doubt but that i could get a conveyance over the channel by means of the smugglers indeed i have connections in england who would assist me when captain delmar went away to town he had quite forgotten the poor fellow and mr weymss who was the commanding officer did not make any special report of him as he thought he might defer it till the last moment as every day out of prison would be so much gained by young vangilt who was a general favourite in this instance my regard for the young man made me quite forget my duty as an officer and the articles of war i knew that i was about to do wrong but i considered that with so many thousand prisoners which we had in england one more or less could be of no consequence and i set to work to see if i could not effect his escape after much cogitation i found i could do nothing without bob cross and i consulted with him bob shook his head and said it was he believed hanging matter but after all it was a pity that such a nice lad should be peeping between iron bars besides continued he he lost his father in the action and he ought not to lose his liberty also well mr keene show me how i can help you why bob theres a very pretty little girl who very often comes alongside with the old woman and you go down into the boat and talk with her yes sir replied bob thats the little girl i told you of that used to repeat her fables on my knee the fact is i hope to splice her some of these days its her mother who is with her and she will not let her come on board to mix with the other women because she is good and modest too good for me im afraid in one sense of the word how do you mean bob why sir when i first knew her she and her mother were living upon what they could earn for the father was killed in action many years ago and i used to help them as far as i could but now i find that although they are not changed things are most confoundedly her uncle lost his wife he is considered a rich man and being stone blind and having no one to take care of him after his wifes death he sent for this girl and her mother to keep his house and he is very fond of the girl and declares that he will leave her all his money and that she shall marry well now sir if she was to marry me a petty officer only it would not be considered that she married well so you see sir theres a hitch who and what was he he was a smuggler sir and a very successful one he has six or seven houses all his own property besides the one he lives in himself he lives about a quarter of a mile out of gosport i know all about him although i have never seen him soon after he left off smuggling he lost his eyesight and somehow or another he considered it was a judgment upon himat least his wife who had joined the ranters persuaded him soand so he took a religious turn and now he does nothing but pray and call himself a poor blind sinner well bob but i do not see why you should give up the girl no sir nor will she or her mother give me up i could marry her tomorrow without his consent but i do not like to do her that injury he is stoneblind you say yes sir well talk your affair over another time what i want at present is to help this poor young vangilt to escape he says that if once clear the smugglers would put him on the other side of the water now it appears to me that it would be very easy for him to get out of the ship unperceived if he were dressed in womans clothes so many women are going and coming all day long very true sir especially on payday when nobody keeps any lookout at all i see now you want some of marys clothes for him they would fit very well exactly and i think that as her uncle had been a smuggler we might go and consult him as to his escape over the water vangilt will pay pounds with pleasurehe told me so that will be an introduction for you as well as for me to the old fellow i think we had better let the old fellow suppose its a womandont you sir but what shall we call ourselves why i will be a sort of agent for ships an you shall be a captain a captain mr keene yes a captain who has had a ship and expects another why you were a captain of the foretop before you were rated coxswain well sir i must consult mary and her mother and then ill let you know they will come this afternoon perhaps in helping mr vangilt i may help myself that night bob cross told me that mary and her mother were quite willing to assist and that they thought it would be a very good introduction to old waghorn that we must expect some religious scruples at first but we must persevere and they had no doubt that the old man would contrive to get the young man over to cherbourg or some other place on the other side that we had better call on him in the evening and they would be out of the way as soon as the work was over for the day bob cross and i obtained leave and set off for mr waghorns house we were met by mary and her mother who pointed it out to us and then continued their walk we went to the door and found the old man smoking his pipe whos there cried he as we lifted the latch of the gate friends sir replied cross two persons who come to talk on business business ive no businessive done with business long ago i think of nothing but my perishing soulpoor blind worm that i am he was a very finelooking old man although weatherbeaten and his silver locks hung down on his collar his beard was not shaved but clipped with scissors his want of sight gave him a mournful look nevertheless sir i must introduce myself and my friend the captain replied i for we want your assistance my assistance poor blind beetlehow can i assist you the fact is sir that a young woman is very anxious to return to her friends on the other side of the water and knowing that you have acquaintance with those who run to and fro we thought you might help the poor young woman to a passage thats to say youve heard that i was a smuggler people do say so but gentlemen i now pay customs and excisemy tea has paid duty and so has my tobacco so does everythingthe king has his own the bible says render under caesar the things which are caesars gentlemen i stand by the bible i am a poor sinful old wretchgod forgive me we ask nothing against the bible mr waghorn its our duty to assist those who are in distress its only a poor young woman a poor young woman if shes poor people dont do such work for nothing besides its wrong gentlemenive given up all thative a precious soul to look after and i cant divert my attention from it i wish you goodbye gentlemen at this moment mary and her mother returned and we rose up mrs james is that you and mary heres a captain and his friend come to me but its a fools errand and so ive told them i then stated to mrs james what we had come for and begged that she would persuade mr waghorn well mr waghorn why wont youits a good action and will have its reward in heaven yes but shes a poor young woman and cant pay her passage so its no use on the contrary replied i the captain here will become security that pounds shall be paid down as soon as she arrives in any part of france or holland will he but whos the captain i havent a ship just now but i expect one soon replied bob the money shall be paid at once if you will only receive the young woman until she can be sent off well let me seetheres james martin no he wont do theres will simpson yes thats the man well its a good act and captain when will you bring the money now the ship was to be paid off on wednesday and as we had each three years pay due there was no difficulty about that so i replied on wednesday the captain will give the money to this lady or whoever comes with us to receive the young woman will you not captain cross oh certainly the money is ready at an hours notice replied bob im sure that shell pay me back if she can and if she cant its of no consequence well well its a bargain replied the old man im a poor blind beetle a sinful old soul ive nothing to do but to make my peace with heaven its charitycharity covereth a multitude of sins saith st paul recollect poundsthats the bargain ill send mrs james to you you must not call again till shes on the other side of the water many thanks sir replied bob i wont call till i hear she is safe and then ill bring you some tobacco to smoke such as you dont often pick up nowadays happy to see you captain cross and your friend there replied the old man we then took our leave mrs james after we were gone praised the appearance of captain cross as such a nicelooking man and old waghorn evidently thought well of him by the answer he made mary however pretended to prefer me as soon as i returned on board i told young vangilt what i had been about he wrung my hand and the tears started in his eyes you as an officer are indeed risking much for me as to the money you know me i trust too well not to be sure of receiving it as soon as i can send it but i never can repay your kindness perhaps you may be able to help me one of these days i replied who knows its fortune of war my good fellow but its as well not to be seen too much together so saying i left him the next day mrs james came off with the necessary garments and bonnet for his escape and they were given me by bob cross the day after was payday and the ship was in such a state of confusion and there were so many people on board that there was no difficulty whatever vangilt changed his clothes in the midshipmens berth which was empty and bob cross handed him down the side into the boat where mrs james waited to receive him bob and i had both been paid and we gave her the pounds for old waghorn the boat shoved off vangilt arrived safe at waghorns house where he was kept concealed for eight days when for the sum of pounds he was safely landed on the french coast old waghorn having pocketed pounds by the transaction which considering he acted out of pure charity was a pretty good reward having thus successfully managed by being guilty of high treason in aiding and abetting the enemy i bade farewell to bob cross leaving him to follow up his amour while i went to chatham to pay my respects to my mother i had made up my mind how to act i was no longer a child but a man in reflection as well as appearance i arrived and hastened to the house from which i had escaped so mysteriously the last time i was in it my mother threw herself in my arms embracing me and then looking at me with surprise and pleasure three years and a half had changed me she hardly knew me for her association of ideas had still pictured me as the smart stripling whom she had with so much anguish consigned into the hands of bob cross she was proud of memy adventures my dangers my conduct and my honourable mention in the gazette were all known to her and she had been evidently congratulated by many upon my successful career my grandmother who had grown much older in appearance seemed to be softened towards me and i had sense enough to receive her advances with great apparent cordiality my aunt and the captain were delighted to see me and i found that my two cousins of whose appearance i had been duly apprised were very pretty children i found that my mother had two assistants in her business and everything appeared to be on a grander scale and more flourishing than ever the first two or three days were devoted to narratives communications explanations and admirations as is usually the case after so long an absence after which we quietly settled down in the relative positions of mother and son and she assumed or rather would have assumed her control over me but this was not my wish i had made up my mind that although a clever woman i must in future control her and i took the first opportunity of a long teteatete to let her know that such was my intention speaking of captain delmar i at once told her that i knew he was my father and that i had his own handwriting to prove it she denied it at first but i told her that all denial was useless that i had possession of the letter he had written to her upon my supposed death and that it was no ghost but i who had frightened my grandmother this was my first blow and a heavy one to my poor mother for what woman can bear to be humiliated by her offspring being acquainted with her indiscretion i loved my mother and would fain have spared her this pang had it not been that all my future plans were based upon this one point and it was necessary she should aid and abet me in them my poor mother was bowed to the earth when she found that it was in vain to deny my parentage she covered her face with her hands in deep shame before her child but i consoled and caressed and told her what i really felt that i was indebted to her for not being the son of a private marine that at all events i had noble blood in my veins and would prove myself worthy of my descent whether it were acknowledged or not but from that hour i took the command over herfrom that hour it was i that dictated and her authority as a parent was gone for ever let it not be imagined that i treated her harshly on the contrary i was more kind and before other people more dutiful than ever i was before she was my only confidant and to her only did i explain the reasons of my actions she was my adviser but her advice was not that of a parent but that of an humble devoted and attached friend and during the remainder of her days this position was never altered as soon as my mother had acknowledged the fact there was no longer any reservation on my part i told her what was the conduct of captain delmar towards me i pointed out his checking any display of paternal feelings towards me and also the certainty that i had that he was partial to and proud of me i explained to her the line of conduct which i had pursued and was determined still to pursue towards him percival said my mother i see the judiciousness of what you say and of your behaviour towards him but allow me to ask you what is the object you are aiming ati mean particularly aiming at of course you hope to obtain advancement from his interest and perhaps if he becomes more attached to you he may not forget you when he dies but it appears to me that you have something nearer to your heart than all thistell me am i right you are my dear mother my great end is that captain delmar should acknowledge me as his son i fear that he will never do that percival nor indeed do i think you would gain by it when you are more advanced in the world your parentage may be considered as obscure but still being born in wedlock it will be more respectable than the acknowledgment you would seek from captain delmar you are not aware of the affronts you may meet with by obtaining what you evidently wish and once known as the son of captain delmar you may wish that it was never promulgated i was born in wedlock mother as you say and as many others are who now are peers of the realm and in virtue of their being born in wedlock succeed to property to which they would otherwise not be entitled your shame excuse me for using the word and my disgrace are equally covered by that wedlock which is an answer to any accusations of illegitimacy as to affronts i do not fear them or ever shall from those who know me i can defend and protect myself but it is a great difference to me to let the world suppose that i am the son of ben the marine when i know myself to be the son of the future lord de versely i wish to be acknowledged by captain delmar in such a way as to convince the world that such is the fact without the world being able to throw it up in my face that is easily done if captain delmar chooses to do it and if done as it ought to be done will lead to my benefit at all events it will satisfy my pride for i feel that i am not the son of your husband but have blood boiling in my veins which would satisfy the proudest aristocrat i prefer the half relation to that class such as it is with all its penalties to being supposed to be the son of the man whom from prudential motives alone you took to be your husband well percival i cannot blame you and do not you therefore blame your mother too much when you consider that the same feeling was the cause of her becoming your mother far from it my dear mother replied i only let us now act in concert i require your assistance allow me to ask you one question have you not realised a sufficient sum of money to enable you to retire from our business i certainly have my dear percival much more than is necessary for me to live in comfort and i may say some little luxury but i have thought of you and for your sake every year have continued to add to my profits then my dear mother for my sake give up your business as soon as possible money is not my object tell me what your reasons are for this demand my dear mother i will be candid with you i wish you to retire from business and leave this place for any distant part of england i wish you to change your name and in one word i wish captain delmar should believe that you are dead an why so percival i cannot see how that will benefit you it was on my account that he took charge of you you are not sure that he may not be severed from you and who knows but that my supposed death may occasion him to desert you altogether you assist my cause my dear mother by what you say if it is on your account that captain delmar is my friend and if as you say he might desert me when you are dead or supposed to be so it is evident that his motive of action must be fear you have the secret of my birth which he supposes to be known only to you and to him i am convinced that if you were supposed dead and that the secret was his own if he thought that there was no proof whatever against him he would then not care showing towards me that regard which he is inclined to feel as a father and which is now checked by his pride captain delmar is naturally of a kind and affectionate dispositionthat i am sure of your memory would do more for me than your existence ever can and as for the rest leave that to me at all events if he should as i do not believe he will be inclined to throw me off i have still his written acknowledgment that i am his son to make use of in case of necessity now my dear mother you must consent to do as i wish give up your business as soon as possible and retire to another part of the country when i consider it a proper time to do so your death shall be made known to him i have no doubt that he will be afloat again in a few months and when we are out of england i will bide the proper time but your grandmother percivalmust i tell her no tell her only that you intend to retire from business and go away from chatham say that you will in future reside in devonshire and ask her to accompany you depend upon it she will be pleased with your intentions as to what we arrange relative to captain delmar say nothing to hershe hates his very name and is not likely to talk about him well percival you will allow me till tomorrow to think about it before i give a decided answer certainly my dear mother i wish you so to do as i am convinced that you will agree with me and i infinitely prefer that you should decide on conviction than be induced by maternal regard as i was well assured my mothers decision was favourable to my wishes she consulted with my grandmother who approved of her intentions and then it was made public that mrs keene intended to retire from business and that the goodwill was to be disposed of along with the stock my aunt milly and captain bridgeman appeared well content that my mother should take the step which she proposed in short all the family approved of the measure which is not a very usual circumstance in this world i now employed myself in assisting my mother in her affairs in a month we found a purchaser of the stock and goodwill and when the sum paid was added to my mothers former accumulations she found herself possessed of pounds in the three per cents the interest of which pounds was more than sufficient for her living comfortably in devonshire especially as my grandmother had still remaining an income very nearly amounting to pounds per annum in another month everything was arranged and my mother bade farewell to her sister and all her friends and left chatham after having resided there more than seventeen years long before my mother had removed from chatham i received a letter from young vangilt announcing his safe arrival in amsterdam and enclosing an order to receive the money advanced from a house in london his letter was very grateful but as i had cautioned him not one word was in it which could implicate me had it fallen into other hands i may as well here observe that in the hurry of paying off the ship vangilt was never missed and although it did occur to the commanding officer after he had gone on shore that mr vangilt had not been sent to prison he thought it just as well not to raise a question which might get himself into a scrape in short nothing was thought or said about it by anybody a few days before my mother quitted chatham i went up to london to receive the money and then went to portsmouth to repay the portion belonging to bob cross i found that bob had made good use of his time and that the old smuggler now received him as a suitor to his niece as however mary was still very youngnot yet seventeenand bob had acknowledged that he had not laid by much money as yet the old man had insisted that bob cross should get another ship and try a voyage or two more before he was spliced and to this arrangement both the mother and mary persuaded him to consent i went to call upon them with bob and did all i could without stating what was not true to give the old man a favourable opinion of cross i even went so far as to say that if he could not procure another vessel i was ready to put down a sum of money to assist him and so i was and had it been requisite i have no doubt but that my mother would have advanced it but bob a fine seaman not yet thirty years old was always sure of a shipthat is a manofwar to save himself from impressment cross had dressed himself in long toggery as a captain of a merchant vessel and was believed to be such having satisfied myself that everything went on favourably in that quarter i again returned to chatham that i might escort my mother and grandmother into devonshire we bade farewell to my aunt and captain bridgeman and set off for london where we remained a few days at an hotel and then took the day coach down to ilfracombe where my mother had decided upon taking up her future residence changing her name to ogilvie which had been my grandmothers maiden name ilfracombe was then a beautiful retired spot and well suited to my mother from its cheapness with their joint incomes my grandmother and she could command anything they wished we soon hired a very pretty little cottage ornee ready furnished as my mother would not furnish a house until she had ascertained whether there were no drawbacks to the locality i ought to observe that my grandmother now appeared quite as partial to me as she had before been otherwise i treated her with great respect although it was not difficult to obtain a renewal of leave from a guardship after i had remained six weeks with my mother it was necessary that i should make my appearance at portsmouth it was arranged that i should take my departure for portsmouth in three days when on reading the plymouth newspaper i learnt that the newlylaunched frigate manilla of guns was put in commission and that the honourable captain delmar had come down and hoisted his pennant this of course changed my plans i resolved to set off for plymouth and wait upon captain delmar i wrote to bob cross enclosing an order for my chest and bedding on board of the guardship at portsmouth acquainting him with my intention but requesting him not to act until he heard from me again i had a long conversation with my mother from whom i obtained a renewal of her promise to abide and act by my instructions i took a respectful farewell of my grandmother who gave me pounds which i did not want as my mother had given me a similar sum and then set off for plymouth the reader may perhaps inquire how it was that captain delmaras he had promised to pay my expenseshad not made any offer of the kind or communicated with me on the subject but the fact was that he knew i had three years pay due besides the prizemoney for the dutch frigate which however i had not yet received although it was payable in pecuniary matters i was certainly well off as my mother desired that i would draw for any money that i required feeling convinced that being aware of her circumstances i should not distress her by any extravagancies in that she did me justice i was now eighteen years old and just starting again on my career as i grew up my likeness to captain delmar became more remarkable every day my mother could not help observing it even to me i almost wish that it was not so my dear mother i fear it will be the cause of annoyance to captain delmar but it cannot be helped at all events it must satisfy him allowing that he has any doubt which i am sure he has not that i am his own child that i believe to be quite unnecessary replied my mother with a deep sigh i should think so too my dear mother replied i caressing her kindly at all events i will prove whether i ever obtain it or not that i am not unworthy of the name of delmar but i must wait no longerthe coach is about to start adieu and may god bless you on my arrival at plymouthor plymouth dock as devonport was then calledi inquired at which hotel captain delmar had taken up his quarters it was the one to which i had intended to have gone myself but i immediately had my luggage taken to another for i really believe that delmar would have considered it a great liberty for any one of his officers to presume to lie down in the same caravanserai as himself the next morning i sent up my name and was admitted good morning mr keene said the captain i presume that you have come down to request to join my ship and i therefore consent before you make the request i trust you will always show the same zeal and deference to your officers that you did in the calliope you have grown very much and are now a young man i shall give you the rating of mate and i trust you will not do discredit to my patronage i trust not captain delmar replied i i have but one wish in the world which is to please you who have so befriended me from my boyhood i should be very ungrateful if i did not do my duty with zeal and fidelity i am indebted to you for everything and i am aware i must look to you for every future prospect i have to thank you sir for your great kindness in publishing my name in the public gazette you deserved it mr keene and it certainly will be of great advantage to you when you have served your time has your time gone on since the calliope was paid off yes sir i am still on the books of the salvadore how much time have you served nearly four years and a half sir well the rest will soon be over and if you do your duty my patronage shall not be wanting here there was a bow on my part and a pause and i was backing out with another bow when the captain said how is your mother mr keene she has been advised to retire from business and to settle in the country replied i mournfully her health is such that here i stopped as i preferred deceiving him by implication or rather allowing him to deceive himself i am sorry to hear that replied he but she never was strong as a young woman here the captain stopped as if he had said too much no sir replied i when in the service of mrs delmar she could not be put to anything that required fatigue very true replied the captain you may go on board mr keene and desire my clerk to make out a letter requesting your discharge from the salvadore into the manilla do you require anything no sir i thank you i need not trespass on your generosity just now good morning sir good morning mr keene i beg your pardon captain delmar said i as i held the door ajar but should you like robert cross your former coxswain should join you in the same capacity i know where he is yes mr keene i should like to have him he was a steady good man you will oblige me by writing to him and requesting him to join immediately where is he at portsmouth captain delmar very well tell him to come round as fast as he can by the bye you will have two of your old messmatesmr smith the master and mr dott i hope the latter is a little more steady than he was i was in hopes to have had your old acquaintance mr culpepper with us but he died about six weeks backa fit or something of that kind thank heaven for that thought i again i made my most respectful bow and quitted the room i returned to my own hotel and sitting down i began to reflect upon the interview i recalled all that had passed and i made up my mind that i was right in preparing him for the report of my mothers death his reception of me was all that i could have expected from himit was cordial but my blood boiled when i called to mind that he had only made a casual inquiry after my mother as i was leaving the room and then his checking himself because he had inadvertently said that she was not strong when she was a young woman yes thought i he cannot bear the remembrance of the connection and it is only for myself and not from any natural affection of a parent that he cares for me or if he does care for me as his son it is because i have his blood in my veins and he despises and looks down upon the mother i am sure that he will be anything but sorry to hear that my mother is dead and he shall be gratified i will now write to her i could not help observing that there was some change in the appearance of captain delmar strange to say he looked more youthful and as i compared our two faces in the mirror on the mantelpiece behind him when i stood up he appeared more like me in appearance than ever what was it oh thought i i have it his hair is no longer mixed with grey he must wear a wig this was the fact as i afterwards ascertained the colour of his wig was however much darker than my own hair by the same post i wrote to bob cross acquainting him with what had passed and begging him to come round by the first water conveyance and bring my chest and bedding with him i then walked down to the dockyard to have a look at the manilla which was as i had heard a splendid vessel went up again to order a mates uniform and returned to the hotel it was useless going to the ship at that time as the marines and boys had only been drafted into her that morning and there was nothing to do until she was clear of the shipwrights who were still on board of her and employed in every part of her the first lieutenant had not yet come down the master was the only officer who had joined and he had hoisted the pennant i was delighted to find that he was to sail with us and we passed that evening together during the evening the master said i hear there are plenty of good men stowed away by the crimps at different places i wish we could only find out where they are and get hold of them i fear if we do not we shall either be badly manned in haste from the tower tender or have to wait a long while before we sail now keene dont you think you could manage so as to get us some men ive got one already replied i bob cross the captains coxswain and a real good one too replied the master the best helmsman we had in the calliope you and he were very thick together yes replied i when i came on board a mere lad he was very kind to me and i am very partial to him in consequence that night after the master and i had parted i thought over the question he had put to me as to obtaining good seamen for the ship and i made up my mind that i would wait till cross arrived and consult with him as to a project which i had in my head in the mean time i went to a slopshop by the dockyard wall and provided myself with a common sailors toggery of the real cut with a banyan covered hat and all complete three days afterwards cross joined me having found a passage round in a cutter and as soon as i had talked over his affairs i proposed my plan to him in which he heartily coincided that i did this to please the captain is certain i had no other view it was necessary however that i obtained the captains permission and i went to him and explained my ideas the captain was too willing to let me try it and thanked me for my zeal go on board mr keene and tell them i have given you six weeks leave of absence and then you can do as you propose i did so for it was absolutely necessary that as few as possible should be acquainted with what i was about as i ran a great risk i have no hesitation in saying that i should have been made away with by the crimps had they discovered me i dressed myself as a common seaman darkened my face and dirtied myself a little especially on the hands and bob cross and i then went at night into one of the low public houses with which the town is filled there we pretended to be much alarmed lest we should be pressed and asked for a backroom to smoke and drink in we called in the landlord telling him we were second mates of vessels and not secure from the impress that we never were at plymouth before our ships having put in damaged and that the crew were discharged and asked if there was no safe place where we could be stowed until we could find another vessel ready to start he replied that there was a house at stonehouse where we could be quite safe but that of course we must pay the crimps well for our board and lodging and that they would find us a ship when we wished to go and further that we must give him something handsome for taking us there to this we agreed and at midnight we set off in company with our landlord each of us carrying our bundles and in less than an hour arrived at a sort of farmhouse detached from the road after a short parley we obtained entrance and were taken into a small room where the crimp inquired of us what money we had and then told us what his charges were the reason of his doing this was because if we had no money or very little he would have disposed of us very soon by sending us on board of some ship and obtaining an advance of our wages from the captain as his indemnification but if we had plenty of money he would then keep us as long as he could that he might make his profit of us his charges were monstrous as may be supposed and we had replied that we had very little money we contrived to look as careless and indifferent as we could agreed to everything paid the landlord of the pothouse a guinea each for taking us to the house and were then ushered into a large room where we found about twenty seamen sitting at a long table drinking and playing cards and dominoes they did not appear to notice us they were so busy either playing or looking on cross called for a pot of ale and we sat down at the farther end of the table what a dislike the men must have to the press said cross to me when they submit to be mured up here in prison yes and cheated by such a scoundrel as the crimp appears to be dont talk so loud jack replied cross for i had insisted upon his calling me jack lest we should be overheard we then asked to go to bed and were shown by the crimp into a room which had about fourteen beds in it you may take your choice of those five said he pointing to five nearest the door i always come up and take away the candle as we found some of the other beds occupied we did not resume our conversation but went to sleep the next morning we found that we mustered about thirtyfive many of the more steady men having gone to bed before we arrived after breakfast cross and i each entered into conversation with a man and pumped them very cleverly our chief object was to ascertain the houses of the other crimps and as the men knew most of them having invariably resorted to them at the end of their voyages we obtained the locality of five or six all apparently publichouses but having back premises for the concealment of seamen all these were carefully noted down as we became more intimate the seamen who were glad to talk from weariness of confinement asked us many questions we said that we had deserted from a manofwar and then a hundred questions were asked us as to our treatment i allowed bob cross to be spokesman and his replies were very sensible he told them that all depended upon what sort of captains and first lieutenants were on board that he had been pressed twice the first time he was comfortable enough and made pounds prizemoney in eight months but in the last manofwar he was very uncomfortable and had therefore cut and run altogether he made the service appear much more favourable than they supposed although the crimp who had stood by did all he could to persuade the men to the contrary we remained in this house for more than a week and then declared that we had no more money and must find a ship the crimp said that he had a berth for one of us as second mate of a brig and i agreed to take it leaving bob cross to get a berth for himself as soon as he could as i raid up there was no demand upon the owners of the vessel and it was arranged that i should be down at a certain wharf at three oclock in the morning when i should find a boat waiting for me i waited up with bob cross until the clock had struck two and then the crimp let me out he did not offer to go down with me as he had no money to receive and as it was pitchdark there was little chance of my being picked up by a pressgang at that hour i wished cross goodbye and set off for plymouth dock with my bundle on my stick not knowing where to go at such an hour i walked about to see if i could perceive a light in any house i did so at last through the chinks of the shutters of a small alehouse and tapped at the door it was opened i was ushered in and the door closed immediately upon me i found myself in the presence of several marines with their sidearms and seamen with cutlasses an officer started up from his seat and collaring me said youre just the fellow we want were in luck tonight in fact i was in the hands of a pressgang and i was pressed myself yes hell do hell make a capital maintopman said a midshipman getting up and surveying me i looked at him and perceived my old acquaintance mr tommy dott grown a great deal taller i perceived that he did not recognise me but sir said i to the officer of the party who was so disguised that i could not tell his rank suppose i belong to a manofwar already that you do not or if you do you must be a deserter my good fellow that is evident by your stick and bundle now sit down and drink some beer if you like you are going to serve in a fine frigateyou may as well make yourself comfortable for we shall not go on board yet for this hour i determined to keep up my incognito as it amused me i sat down and it then occurred to me that my not going on board of the vessel might lead to an explanation with the crimp and that an alarm might be created and the men dispersed in consequence there were still two hours to daylight and if i could take up the pressgang we might secure all the men in the house before the dawn of day as i had just made up my mind to act there was a stamping of feet outside and a knock at the door when it was opened another portion of the pressgang headed by another officer entered i counted heads and found that they mustered thirty handsquite sufficient as they were armed to secure all my late companions i therefore went up to the officer and begged to speak with him aside i then told him that i had just come from a crimps house near stonehouse where i left in their beds thirtyfive as fine men as ever walked a plank and that as i was pressed myself i did not mind telling him where they were and he could take them all the officer curled up his lip as if to say youre a pretty scoundrel to betray your companions but immediately resolved to act upon it without stating his intentions he ordered all the men out and putting me between two marines so as to prevent my escaping i was desired to lead on i did so and we proceeded in silence until we arrived near to the house i then pointed out to the officer that it must be surrounded or the men would escape and that it must be done very carefully as there was a large dog which would be sure to give the alarm my advice was attended to and when all the men were at their stations the whole advanced slowly towards the house the dog commenced baying as i had foreseen and shortly afterwards the crimp put his head out of a window and perceived that the pressgang were below but all attempts to force an entrance were in vain every window below and the doors being secured with iron bars is there no way of getting into this den said the officer to me why sir ill try as bob cross had given another name i knew that i risked nothing in calling out his and i therefore requested the officer to impose silence and when it was obtained i cried out bob cross bob cross wheres bob cross after that i went to the small door at the side of the house which led to the homestead and again cried out bob crosswheres bob cross i then told the officer that we must wait patiently and that if it was daylight before we got in all the better about ten minutes after that as i remained at the small door i heard the bars quietly removed i then requested the officer to attempt to force the small door and it yielded almost immediately to their efforts now sir leave a guard at the other door that they may not open it and escape by it also five or six hands to catch any who may jump out of the upper windows and then enter with the rest of your party you know what you are about at all events said he giving the directions which i had pointed out and then entering with the remainder of his party with the exception of one marine that held me by the arm with his bayonet drawn the scuffle within was very severe and lasted for many minutes at last the armed force although not so numerous prevailed and one by one the men were brought out and taken charge of by the marines until the whole of them were discovered in their retreats and secured day now dawned and it was time to be off to make more secure the pressed men were lashed two and two with small rope which had been provided on purpose bob cross who of course had not mixed in the affray gave me a nod of recognition and we set off as fast as the men could be persuaded to move certainly not a very gay procession for although the wounds were not dangerous there was scarcely one of the party amounting in all to upwards of sixty men who was not bleeding hardly a word was exchanged we were all put into the boats and rowed off to the hulk appropriated to the crew of the frigate until she was rigged and as soon as we were on board we were put below under the charge of sentries what you here said some of the pressed men yes replied i they picked me up as i went to ship myself last night the crimp who had been brought on board with the others then started forward it is he who has blown upon us ill swear to it you may swear if you please replied i that will do you no good and me no harm the crimp talked with the other men and then indignation was levelled against me most of them swore they would be even with me and have my life if they could indeed they could hardly be prevented laying hands upon me but bob cross told the sentry and he interfered with his bayonet notwithstanding which fists continued to be shook in my face and vengeance threatened every minute i told you my lads said bob cross that i have been on board of a manofwar before this and youd better mind what youre about or youll repent it at all events if one of you touches him youll have five dozen lashes at the gangway before tomorrow morning this made the poor fellows more quiet most of them lay down and tried to sleep off their misery why dont you make yourself known mr keene said cross to me in a whisper i saw the master go on the quarterdeck just now i think i had better not there are more houses to examine and if my trick was known it would soon get wind from the women and i should be waylaid and perhaps murdered by the crimps the captain will be on board by ten oclock i have no doubt and then i will contrive to see him somehow or another but you could trust the masterwhy not see him ill think of itbut theres no hurry i was afraid that tommy dott would have discovered me and i kept out of his way as much as i could ill tell you what siras ive not joined the ship why not let it be supposed that i am impressed with the other men and then i can send for mr dott and make myself known the commanding officer will of course send for me and i will enter and then i shall be allowed to go about and can speak to the captain when he comes on board well that is not a bad idea talk to the sentry whos the captain of this ship sentry said bob cross captain delmar delmarwhy hes my old captain did not i see a mr dott a midshipman yes there is a mr dott on board well i wish you would just pass the word to mr dott to say that one of the pressed men wishes to speak to him the sentry did so and mr dott came down how dye do mr dott said bob cross while i turned away what cross is that you are you dressed yes sir cant be helped im glad im to sail with you sir whats become of mr keene oh i dont know but if hes not hanged by this time i believe that hes to join the ship wont i pull your ears for that thought i what other officers have we of the calliope sir theres the master mr smith and the surgeon well mr dott one must always make a virtue of necessity tell mr smith that i shall enter for the ship and ill put my name down at once instead of being penned up here thats right cross and i say you chaps youd better follow a good example sentry let this man go with me bob cross then went with tommy dott and entered for the service the master was very glad to see him again and said why cross mr keene said that you had promised him to join us why sir so i had but its a long story however its all the same in the end here i am and i hope i shall get my old rating soon after bob cross came down and said well my lads im free now and i advise you all to do the same come jack said he to me what dye say no no replied i i wont unless all the rest do bob then took me on one side and told me what had taken place and asked me what he should say to the captain i told him and then he left us at ten oclock the captain came on board bob cross went up to him and said he wished to say something to him in the cabin he followed the captain down and then explained to him that i was among the pressed men but as a means of obtaining plenty more men i had remained among them and had not made myself known for fear my trick should get wind also that i thought the crimp should be kept on board although he was of no use as a seaman mr keene has behaved very prudently replied captain delmar i understand his motivesleave the rest to me a few minutes after bob had communicated to me what the captain had said the pressed men were ordered up and ranged along the quarterdeck a finer set of men i never saw together and they all appeared to be as they afterwards proved to be prime seamen the captain called them one by one and questioned them he asked them to enter but they refused the crimp begged hard to be released their names were all put down on the ships book together the captain turning to mefor i had stood up the last of the row said i understand the officer of the impress agreed to release you if you would tell him where your comrades were i dont like losing a good man but still i shall let you go in consequence of the promise being made there you may take a boat and go on shore thank your honour replied i i went to the gangway immediately but i never shall forget the faces of the pressed men when i passed them they looked as if i had a thousand lives and they had stomach enough to take them all i went on shore immediately and going to my hotel washed the colour and dirt off my face dressed myself in my mates uniform and went to the hotel where the captain lived i found that he had just come on shore and i sent up my name and i was admitted i then told the captain the information which we had received with regard to nine or ten more houses and that i thought i might now go on board and never be recognised you have managed extremely well replied captain delmar we have made a glorious haul but i think it will be better that you do not go on board the pressgang shall meet you every night and obey your orders i bowed and walked out of the room the next night and several subsequent ones the pressgang came on shore and from the information i had received we procured in the course of a fortnight more than two hundred good seamen some of the defences were most desperate fort as one crimps house after another was forced they could not imagine how they could have been discovered but it put them all on their guard and on the last three occasions the merchant seamen were armed and gave us obstinate fights however although the wounds were occasionally severe there was no loss of life having expended all my knowledge i had nothing more to do than go on board which i did and was kindly received by the master and the other officers who had been prepossessed in my favour such was the successful result of my plan the crimp we did not allow to go on shore but discharged him into a gunbrig the captain of which was a notorious martinet and i have no doubt being aware of his character and occupation that he kept his word when he told captain delmar that he would make the ship a hell to himand sarve him right too said bob cross when he heard of it the money that these rascals obtain from the seamen mr keene is quite terrible and the poor fellows after having earned it by two or three years hard work go to prison in a crimphouse to spend it or rather to be swindled out of it it is these fellows that raise such reports against the english navy that frighten the poor fellows so they hear of men being flogged until they die under the lash and all the lies that can be invented not that the masters of the merchant vessels are at all backward in disparaging the service but threaten to send a man on board a manofwar for a punishment if he behaves illthat itself is enough to raise a prejudice against the service now sir i can safely swear that there is more cruelty and oppressionmore illtreatment and more hard work on board of a merchantman than on board any manofwar why so because there is no control over the master of a merchant vessel while the captain of a manofwar is bound down by strict regulations which he dare not disobey we see many reports in the newspapers of the illtreatment on of merchant vessels but for one that is made known ninetynine are passed over for a seaman has something else to do than to be kicking his heels at a magistrates office and when he gets clear of his vessel with his pay in his pocket he prefers to make merry and forget his treatment to seeking revenge i say again sarve that crimp right and i hope that hell get a lash for every pound which he has robbed from the poor seamen i may as well inform the reader that as it is mostly the case after the men have been impressed nearly the whole of them entered the service and when some time afterwards they ascertained that it was i that had tricked them so far from feeling the illwill towards me that they had on their first coming on board they laughed very much at my successful plan and were more partial to me than to any other of the officers our frigate was now well manned and nearly ready for sea i wrote to my mother enclosing the heads of a letter to her which she should send to captain delmar and in a day or two i received an answer with a copy of what she had sent it was to the effect that i was now going away for the second time and that it was possible she might never see me or captain delmar again that she wished him success and happiness and begged him in case she should be called away not to forget his promises to her or what she had undergone for his sake but she trusted entirely to him and that he would watch over me and my interests even more out of regard to her memory than if she were alive to support my claims upon him the letter was given to captain delmar when he was on the quarterdeck and he went with it down below he came on deck shortly afterwards i looked at him but did not perceive that he was in any way put out or moved by its reception claims for past services whether upon the country or upon individuals are seldom well received like the payment of a tavern bill after we have done with the enjoyments we seem inclined to cavil at each separate itemainsi va le monde it was reported down at mutton cove that our ship which sailed with sealed orders was to be sent to the west indies this the captain did not expect or wish as he had had enough of the tropics already when he however opened his orders it was found that mutton cove was correct and the captains instructions were to seek the admiral of the station with all possible dispatch we carried sail day and night and as the manilla proved a remarkably fast sailer we were very soon in carlisle bay barbadoes where we found the admiral and six sail of the line and a few smaller vessels as soon as the despatches were opened by the admiral our signal as well as that of all the smaller vessels was made and before the evening we had spread our canvas in every direction being sent to recall the whole of the disposable force to rendezvous at carlisle bay we knew that something was in the wind but what we had no idea of our orders were to proceed to halifax and we had a quick passage we found two frigates there and we gave them their instructions and then having remained only twentyfour hours we all made sail together for barbadoes on our arrival there we round the bay crowded with vessels twentyeight sail of pennants and a fleet of transports containing ten thousand troops three days afterwards the signal was made to weigh and the whole fleet stood out from carlisle bay it being now well known that the capture of the island of martinique was the object of the expedition on the third day we arrived off the island and our troops were disembarked at two points expecting to meet with strong opposition such however to our surprise was not the case it appeared that the militia of the island being composed of slaves and who were sent to oppose us did not consider that slavery was worth fighting for quite as well as liberty and therefore very quietly walked home again leaving the governor and regular troops to decide the question as to whether the island was for the future to belong to the french or english but the two following days there was some hard fighting and our troops although they advanced had a severe loss the french retired from the advanced posts to fort dessaix and we obtained possession of the fort on point salamon the next point to be attacked was pigeon island and there the navy were called into action we had to get the carronades and mortars up a hill almost inaccessible we did it much to the surprise of the troops who could hardly believe it when the battery opened fire after a brisk cannonading of ten hours pigeon island surrendered and then the admiral stood into and anchored the fleet in fort royal bay not however in time to prevent the french from setting fire to the frigates which were in the harbour a few days after the town of st pierre and the town of fort royal surrendered and fort dessaix only held out for more than a week we were very busy constructing batteries and landing cannon and mortars and when all was ready the bombardment of fort dessaix commenced and five days afterwards the french capitulated and the island was formally surrendered to the english i have hurried over the capture as it has oftentimes been described in detail all i can say is that it was very hard work for the seamen and that they had their full share of the fatigue but from the peculiar nature of the service an affair took place which was of much importance to me i said before that the sailors were employed in the hard duty of getting the guns etcetera on shore and up to where the batteries were to be erectedin short working like slaves in the heat of the sun while the troops remained quiet investing the fort there was no objection raised to this and the seamen worked very willingly but the staff and mounted officers of the army who rode to and fro giving orders were not quite as civil as they might bethat is some of them and a certain feeling of dissension and illwill was created in consequence the junior officers of the navy and the lieutenants who could be spared to direct the labour of the seamen on shore received occasionally very harsh language from some of the military officers and did not fail to give very prompt replies to those who they did not consider had any right to control them complaints were made to the captains of the menofwar and on being investigated the result generally was that the captains defended their officers and the military gentlemen obtained no redress the active service however did not admit of any notice being taken of it at the time but after the island had surrendered these unfortunate animosities were resumed a few days after the capture of the island the prisoners and troops were embarked an the fleet sailed a sufficient garrison being left upon the island for its defence the admiral also thought proper to leave two or three menofwar in the harbour and our frigate was one for the first few days everything went on smoothly the french inhabitants were soon on good terms with us and balls and parties had commenced but the seamen and soldiers when they met at the liquorstores began to quarrel as to which branch of the service had done most towards the taking the island this will always be the case with people so addicted to intoxication several severe wounds were received in the various skirmishes which took place and at last the seamen were interdicted from going on shore indeed as they were not armed and the soldiers carried their bayonets it was too unequal a contest when an affray took place but the illwill spread and at last arrived to the superior officers the consequence was that a challenge was given to one of the captains of the frigates by an adjutant it was accepted but not an hour after it was accepted the captain was taken with a fever and on the morning of the following day when the duel was to have taken place he was not able to quit his bed and the military gentlemen on arriving at the ground found an excuse instead of an antagonist whether it was really supposed that the fever was a mere excuse to avoid the duel or that the animosity prevailing gave rise to the report certain it is that there were many sneers on the part of the military men and great indignation on the tart of the naval officers who if they could have so done would have gone on shore on purpose to insult every officer they could meet who wore a red coat but in consequence of this excitement being known all leave was prohibited captain delmar who was the naval commanding officer had taken up his quarters on shore he had done all he possibly could to prevent the unpleasant feeling from continuing and had shown great forbearance and good sense but it so happened that being in company with some of the military staff observations were made in his presence relative to the conduct of the naval captain ill with the fever that he could not permit he gave a flat denial to them and the consequence was that language was used which left no alternative but a duel this was the monday night and as it was too late then it was agreed that the meeting should take place on the following evening at sunset i believe this was proposed by captain delmar in preference to the morning as he knew his antagonist was a regular duellist and he wished to have the next day to put his affairs in order previous to the meeting i should here observe that the captain had not been on anything like intimate terms with his lieutenants the surgeon and master were old shipmates and with them he was sociable whether it was that he did not choose to ask the favour of the commissioned officers certain it is that he sent for the master to be his second on the occasion and on the master returning on board he desired me to go on shore with the boat and take the captains pistols with me but not to allow them to be seen by any one a message was also sent for the surgeon to go on shore to the captain when the surgeon and i arrived at the house where the captain resided and were ushered up the sittingroom was empty i had put the case of pistols in a piece of canvas so as to look like despatches about to be sent to england and i uncovered them and placed them on one of the tables a few minutes afterwards the captain came out and i was very much surprised at his appearance he was very flushed and heated in the face and appeared to tremble as he walked the surgeon also looked at him with surprise we knew him to be incapable of fear and yet he gave us the appearance of a person very much troubled doctor said he i am glad that you are come i feel very unwell feel my pulse yes sir said the doctor that you certainly are you have the same fever on you as captain w singular yes but it will be rather too singular doctor poor w had obloquy enough on account of his illness and if a second captain in the navy were to be obliged to send a similar excuse we should be at a pretty discount with the redcoats if you can do any thing for me do but it must be perfectly understood that fight tomorrow evening i will even if i am carried to the ground certainly captain delmar if it is possible i think that a little blood must be taken from you immediately and probably the fever may subside but before his arm could be bound up the captain became incoherent in his discourse and after the bleeding had been performed when he attempted to look at his papers he was so confused that he found it impossible and was obliged to be put to bed immediately when the surgeon came out of his bedroom he said to us hell never get up to fight that duel depend upon it the fever increasesit may be that he may never rise againi fear it is the yellow fever a bad job replied the mastera very bad job indeed two captains in the navy receiving challenges and both sending excuses on account of illness the service will be disgraced ill fight the soldier myself that will never do replied the surgeon it will not help the captain that he has sent one of his officers in his stead steward make a bed up here in this room i shall not leave the house tonight its of no use my staying here observed the master nor you either keene lets go on board and we will be here early tomorrow morning confounded bad job this goodbye the master and i returned to the boat i had been reflecting a good deal on the disgrace which would at all events for a certain period be thrown upon the service and captain delmar by this unfortunate circumstance and before i had gone up the ships side i had made up my mind as soon as we were on board i requested the master to allow me to speak to him in his cabin and when we were there after canvassing the question and pointing out to him what discredit would ensue and working him up into a great state of irritation i then proposed to him what i considered to be the best course to pursue every one says how like i am to captain delmar mr smith said i if you were his own son you could not be more so replied the master well sir i am now as tall as he is the colour of my hair is lighter certainly but the captain wears a wig now sir i am perfectly sure that if i were to put on the captains uniform and wig as the duel is to take place in the evening they never could find out that it was not the captain and as for a good shot i think i can hit a button as well as the best duellist in existence the master bit his lips and was silent for a short time at last he said what you propose is certainly very easy but why should you risk your life for captain delmar why did you not offer to do it just now for the honour of the service i have that feeling and moreover wish to serve captain delmar who has been my patron whats the life of a midshipman worth even if i were to fallnothing thats true enough replied the master bluntly and then correcting himself he added that is midshipmen in general but i think you may be worth something byandby however keene i do think on the whole its a very good plan and if the captain is not better tomorrow we will then consider it more seriously i have an idea that you are more likely to pin the fellow than the captain who although as brave a man as can be he has not i believe fired twenty pistols in his life good night and i hardly need say we must keep our secret never fear sir good night i went to my hammock quite overjoyed at the halfconsent given by the master to my proposition it would give me such a claim on captain delmar if i survived and if i fell at all events he would cherish my memory but as for falling i felt sure that i should not i had a presentiment probably no more than the buoyant hope of youth that i should be the victor at all events i went to sleep very soundly and did not wake until i was roused up by the quartermaster on the following morning after breakfast the master requested a boat to be manned and we went on shore on our arrival at the house we found the surgeon in great anxiety the captain was in a state of delirium and the fever was at the highest how is he demanded the master more likely to go out of the world himself than to send another out of it replied the surgeon he cannot well be worse and that is all that i can say he has been raving all night and i have been obliged to take nearly two pounds of blood from him and mr keene continued the surgeon he talks a great deal of you and other persons you may go in to him if you please for i have as much as possible kept the servants awaythey will talk bob cross is down below sir replied i he is the safest man to wait upon him i agree with you keenesend for him and he shall remain at his bedside the master then spoke with the surgeon and communicated my proposition and the surgeon replied well from what i have learned this night there is no person who has so great a right to take his place and perhaps it will be as well both for the captains sake and his own at all events i will go with you and in case of accident do my best the matter was therefore considered as arranged and i went into the captains room he was delirious and constantly crying out about his honour and disgrace indeed there is no doubt but that his anxiety to meet his antagonist was one very great cause of the fever having run so high but at times he changed the subject and then he spoke of me and my mother where is my boymy own boy percival said hemy pridewhere is he arabella you must not be angry with meno arabella consider the consequence and then he would burst out in such fond expressions towards me that the tears ran down my cheeks as i planted a kiss upon his forehead for he was insensible and i could do so without offence bob cross who had for some time been at his bedside wiped the tears from his eyes and said master keene how this man must have suffered to have cloaked his feelings towards you in the way which he has done however i am glad to hear all this and if necessary i will tell him of itay if i get seven dozen for it the next minute i remained with bob cross at his bedside for the whole day during which he more than twenty times acknowledged me as his son as the evening closed in i prepared in silence for the duty i had to perform to the surprise of cross who was ignorant of what i intended i stripped off my own clothes and put on those of the captain and then put his wig over my own hair i then examined myself in the glass and was satisfied well said cross looking at me you do look like the captain himself and might almost go on board and read the articles of war but surely master keene added he looking at the captain as he lay senseless in bed this is no time for foolery of this sort it is no foolery bob replied i taking his hand i am going to represent the captain and fight a duel for him or the service will be disgraced i didnt know that the captain had a duel to fight replied bob although i heard that there had been words i then explained the whole to him you are right master keeneright in everything may god bless you and send you good luck i wish i might go with you no bob that must not be then god bless you and may you floor the soldier lord what a state i shall be in till i know what has taken place it will soon be known bob so goodbye and i trust we shall meet again i then went out of the bedroom the surgeon actually started when i made my appearance and acknowledged that the personation was exact taking the arm of the surgeon and the master we set off the master carrying the pistols which had been prepared and in a quarter of an hour we arrived at the place of meeting my disguise was so complete that we had not hesitated to walk out sooner than we had intended and we found ourselves the first on the field of action which i was glad of about dusk which was the time agreed upon and about five minutes after our arrival our antagonists made their appearance there was no time to be lost as there is little or no twilight in the west indies so a polite bow was exchanged and the ground marked out at eight paces by the master and the second of my opponent a very short parley then took place between mr smith and the other gentleman who officiated for the adjutant in which it was decided that we should turn back to back with our pistols ready and that on the words make readypresentfire given in succession we were to turn round to each other level and fire this made it more difficult to hit indeed it was almost impossible to take aim as the words were given so quick after each other and the great point was to fire as soon as the word was given the first discharge was not lucky for me i missed my antagonist and received his bullet in my left shoulder this did not however disable me and i said nothing about it the pistols were again loaded and handed to us and on the signal being given my adversarys pistol went off a little before the word fire was given and i felt myself again hit but i returned the fire with fatal success the ball went through his body and he fell the surgeon master and his second immediately went up and raised him in a sitting position but in a few minutes he was senseless in the meantime i remained where i was having dropped my pistol on the ground that i had an unpleasant pang at the idea of a fellowcreature having fallen by my hand in a duel i acknowledge but when i called to mind why i had fought the duel and that if had saved the honour of the captain may i not say at once my fathers honour for that was my feeling i could not and did not repent the deed but i had not time given me to analyse my feelings a sensation of faintness rapidly crept over me the fact was that i had been bleeding profusely and while the surgeon and the others were still hanging over the expiring adjutant i dropped and fell fainting on the ground when i recovered i found myself in bed and attended on by the surgeon the master and bob cross keep quiet keene said the surgeon and all will be well but keep quiet that we may have no fever here drink this and try if you cannot go to sleep they raised me up and i swallowed the mixture my head was so confused and i was so weak that i felt as if i hardly dared breathe lest my breath should leave my body and i was glad to find myself again on the pillow i was soon in a sound seep from which i did not arouse for many hours and as i afterwards was told had had a very narrow escape from the exhaustion arising from the excessive haemorrhage when i opened my eyes the next morning i could scarcely recall my senses i saw bob cross sometimes and i heard moaning and talking i thought the latter was my own voice but it was captain delmar whose fever still continued and who was in an alarming state it was not till the evening twentyfour hours after the duel that i could completely recall my senses then i did and motioned to cross that i wanted drink he gave me some lemonadeit was nectar he then went out for the surgeon who came to the bedside and felt my pulse youll do now my boy said he get another good sleep tonight and tomorrow morning you will have nothing to do but to get well where am i hit said i you had a ball in your shoulder and another in your hip but they are both extracted the one in the hip cut through a large vein and the haemorrhage was so great before you could be brought here that at one time i thought you were gone your life hung upon a thread for hours but we may thank god that all is right now you have no fever and your pulse is getting strong again hows the captain sir as bad as bad can be just now but i have hopes of a change for the better and captain w sir poor fellow he is dead and has so decidedly proved that his fever was not a sham the soldiers are a little ashamed of themselvesand so they ought to be but too often good feelings come too late now keene you have talked quite enough for tonight take your sedative mixture and go to sleep again tomorrow i have no doubt you will be able to ask as many questions as you like only one more siris the adjutant dead i have not heard replied the surgeon but we shall know tomorrow now go to sleep and goodnight when the surgeon left the room bob said i not an answer will i give tonight mr keene said bob cross tomorrow morning well have the rights and wrongs of the whole story you must obey orders sir and go to sleep as i knew bob would do as he said i laid my head down and was soon once more in forgetfulness it was not daylight when i again awoke and found cross snoring in the chair by the bedside poor fellow he had never lain down since he came on shore when the captain was first taken ill i felt much better although my wounds tingled a little and i was very anxious to know if captain delmar was out of danger but that could not be ascertained till i saw the surgeon i remained thinking over the events which had passed i called to mind that the captain in his delirium had called me his own boy his percival and i felt more happy about an hour after i had awoke the surgeon came into the room how is captain delmar sir said i i am glad to say that he is much better but i must wake up poor cross who is tired out cross who was awake the moment that we spoke was now on his legs you must go to the captain and keep the bedclothes on him cross he is now in a perspiration and it must not be checkeddo you understand yes replied bob walking away into the other room you are all right again keene said the surgeon feeling my pulse we will look at your wounds byandby and change the dressing tell me sir said i how have you managed nobody has found it out oh no it is supposed that captain delmar is badly wounded and that you have the yellow fever and we must keep it upthat is the reason why bob cross is the only one allowed to come into the sick rooms i have no doubt that captain delmar will be sensible in a few hours and then we shall be puzzled what to say to him must we tell him the truth not at present sir at all events tell him that he has fought the duel and killed his man he will think that he did it when he was out of his senses or else that the fever has driven it from his memory well perhaps that will be the best way just now it will relieve his mind for with his return to sensibility will also revive his feelings of disgrace and dishonour and if they are not checked the fever may come on again the surgeon gave me some breakfast this morning and then dressed my wounds which he pronounced were doing quite well and about twelve oclock the master came on shore with the first lieutenant the master came into my room after the first lieutenant went away who had been told by the surgeon that he could not see captain delmarand he of course did not wish to come into contact with me who he supposed had the yellow fever in the afternoon captain delmar woke up from his stuporthe fever had left him and he had nothing to combat with but extreme debility where am i said he after a pause and recollecting himself he continued to cross who was the only person in the room and who had received his instructions from the surgeon how long have i lain here ever since the duel sir the duelhow do you mean i mean ever since your honour fought the duel and killed the soldger officer killeddueli cant recollect having fought the duel dare say not your honour replied bob you were in a roaring fever at the time but you would not stay in bed all the surgeon could dogo you would but when you had fought we were obliged to carry you back again and so i really have foughti have not the least recollectioni must have been in a high fever indeed wheres the surgeon hes in the verandah below sir speaking to some soldger officers who have come to inquire after your health here he comes the surgeon came in and captain delmar then said to him is this all true that cross has been telling me have i really fought a duel and killed my adversary i regret to say sir that he is dead and was buried yesterday but if you please you must not talk any more at presentyou must be quiet for a few hours well doctor so that my honour is saved i am content to obey you its very odd here the captain was exhausted and was silent and in a few minutes he was again asleep and remained slumbering till the next morning when he was much better he then entered into conversation with the surgeon making him describe the duel and the latter did so so as to satisfy the captain and he also informed him that i had been taken ill with the fever and was in the next room next room replied the captain why was he not sent on board are all the midshipmen who are taken ill to be brought to my house to be cured i overheard this reply of the captain and it cut me to the heart i felt what an invincible pride had to be conquered before i could obtain my wishes the surgeon answered captain delmaras only you and mr keene were taken with the fever i thought it better that he should remain here than that the ships company should take it by his being sent on board i trust captain delmar i have done right yes i see replied the captain you did perfectly righti did not think of that i hope mr keene is doing well i trust that we shall get him through it sir replied the surgeon pray let him have anything that he requires mr let him want for nothing during his illness and convalescence he would be a heavy loss to the service added the captain he would indeed sir replied the surgeon here are the journals of st pierre in which there are several accounts of the duel most of them incorrect some say that you were twice wounded others once i dare say they thought so replied the captain for cross tells me that i was carried home its very singular that i should have fought in such a condition thank you mr i will read them when i have lain down a little for i am tired again already the surgeon then informed the captain of the death of captain w poor fellow replied captain delmar well i will not make any appointments until i am better the captain then lay down again leaving the newspapers on the coverlet a week now passed during which both the captain and i became nearly convalescent we had both been out of bed and had remained for a few hours on the sofas in our respective rooms the surgeon told me that it would be necessary to tell him the truth very soon and that he thought he would do so on the following day it did however happen that the discovery was not made to him by the surgeon in the afternoon when the latter was on board captain delmar felt so strong that he resolved to put on his clothes and go into the sittingroom he desired cross to give them to him and the first articles handed to him were his trowsers and bob quite forgot that i had worn them why hows this said the captainheres a hole through the waistband and they are bloody bob was so frightened that he walked out of the room as if he had not heard what the captain had said it appears that the captain took up his coat and discovered another hole in the shoulder with the same marks of blood this is quite a dream said the captain talking to himselfive no wound and yet the newspapers say that i was wounded twice cross crosswhere is cross bob who had taken refuge in my room where we overheard everything he said whispered its no use now mr keenei must tell it all never fear me i know how to do it and then he obeyed the captains summons leaving me in a state of great nervous anxiety cross said the captain sternly i insist upon knowing the truth i have been deceived by my officers did i or did i not fight this duel well sir replied cross the truth was only kept back from you till you were quite well again and i suppose i must tell it to you now you were too ill and you raved about our honour and that you were disgraced and that well go on sir i will captain delmar but i hope youll not be angry sir mr keene could not bear to see you in that way and he said he would lay down his life for you at any time and he begged mr smith the master to allow him to fight the duel because he said that he was so like you in person which somehow or other he is thats certain that no one would know it was him if he put on your honours wig and uniform thats how it was sir go on said the captain well sir the master could not bear the sneering of the sogers on shore and he consented that mr keene should take your place which he did sir and i hope you will not be angry with mr keene for its your old coat sir and i think it may have a piece let in that it wont be seen cross then went on describing the whole affairof course praising me and told the captain that everybody on board as well as on shore thought that he was wounded and that i had been taken with the yellow fever and that nobody knew the real truth except the master the surgeon and himself is mr keene seriously hurt inquired the captain after a pause no sir the doctor says he will do very well he was as near gone as ever a man was at one time his breath would not move a featherall the blood was out of his body for a minute the captain made no reply at last he said in a quiet tone you may leave the room cross what were the thoughts and feelings of captain delmar when he was left to reflect upon the information which he had received i cannot tell but that he was not angry i inferred by the tone in which he desired cross to leave the room i was absorbed in my own feelings when the surgeon entered the room and gave me a letter heres a schooner just come in with despatches from the admiral said the surgeon the second lieutenant has brought them on shore for the captain and among the letters from england i found this one for you i have seen cross continued the surgeon nodding his head significantly as he left the room the second lieutenant with despatches sir reported bob cross to the captain in the other roomshall i show him in no i am not well desire him to send them in by you replied the captain while the captain was busy with his despatches i read my letter which was from my mother enclosing a copy of one from my grandmother announcing my mothers death of course there were a great many dying wishes but that was a matter of course i felt happy that this letter to the captain arrived at such a propitious time as i knew that the announcement of my mothers death would be a great point in my favour that it ought not to have been i confess but i knew whom i had to deal with the captain was ashamed of his intimacy and the claims of my mother upon him but not so much ashamed of me and now that she was removed probably he might not be at all ashamed my mother was no relation and below himi was his own flesh and blood and half ennobled by so being the captain sent on board orders for getting under weigh it appeared that the admiral had written to him desiring him to sail for the coast of south america to look after a french frigate and that as there was no farther occasion for so large a force at martinique he was to leave the next senior officer in command but this was captain w who had died of the fever as senior in command captain delmar then filled up the vacancy the captain of a corvette was appointed to captain ws ship our first lieutenant to the command of the corvette but the lieutenants vacancy was not filled up much to the surprise of the officers of the squadron this was the work of the afternoon in the evening the master was sent for and a consultation held with him and the surgeon which ended in the captains consenting to go on board with his arm in a sling as if he had been wounded and my being put into a cot and removed on board to the captains cabin as if still too weak with the fever to quit my bed cross was enjoined silence and i was made acquainted by the surgeon with the result of the conference the next morning we were all embarked and we hove the anchor up and made sail to the southward it must be observed that i had neither seen nor had any communications with the captain during the whole of this time he was informed by the surgeon that i was in great distress of mind at the news of my mothers death and that my recovery would be retarded in consequence chapter twenty one it was not until three or four days after the ship had sailed from martinique that the captain spoke to me i had during that time remained in my cot which was hung up in the forecabin and when the surgeon dressed my wounds it was only in the presence of bob cross on the fourth morning after our sailing the captain came inside of the screen which was hung round my cotwell mr keene said he in a very kind voice how are you much better sir i thank you and hope you will look over the great liberty i ventured to take for the honour of the service why replied the captain smiling i think you have been sufficiently punished already for your temerity i appreciate your motive of action and feel obliged to you for your great zeal towards the service and towards me the only objection i may say annoyance i have on the subject is the mystery and secrecy compelled to be observed in consequence of your taking my place and still more that one of the seamen of the ship should be a party to the secret i certainly did not consider the consequences as i ought to have done sir when i ventured to act as i did replied i say no more about it mr keene i am very sorry to hear of your mothers death but it was not i believe unexpected no sir replied i and therefore the shock has not been so great well mr keene of course it is from the interest i took in your mother that i was induced to take you under my protection and her death will make no difference in that point so long as you conduct yourself as you have hitherto done you have now created a strong interest for yourself by your good conduct and i shall not lose sight of you how many months have you yet to serve before your time is out i have served five years and seven months as far as i can recollect so i thought now mr keene it was because i thought of you that i did not fill up the lieutenants vacancy which was made by the death of captain w and the promotion of the commander and my first lieutenant as soon as you are well i will give you an acting order as lieutenant of this ship and as we are now on a sort of roving commission i have no doubt but that you will have served your time and found the means of passing before we join the admiral your promotion will under such circumstances be i have no doubt confirmed so all you have to do now is to get well as fast as you can goodbye the captain gave me a most gracious nod and then went outside of the screen giving me no time for thanks i was indeed overjoyed not so much at the promotion as at the change in the captains manner towards me a change so palpable that it filled me with the fondest anticipations i remained for a long while reflecting upon my future prospects as a lieutenant of the same ship i should be more in contact with him he could now converse and take notice of me without its being considered remarkable nay he could be intimate with me i resolved to be most careful of my conduct so as not to alarm his pride by the least familiarity and hoped eventually to play my cards so as to obtain my earnest wish but i felt that there was a great deal of ground to go over first and that the greatest circumspection was necessary i felt that i had still to raise myself in his opinion and in the opinion of the world to a much higher position than i was in at present before i could expect that captain delmar would virtually acknowledge me as his son i felt that i had to wade through blood and stand the chance of thousands of balls and bullets in my professional career before i could do all this a bright vista of futurity floated before me and in the far distance i felt myself in the possession of my ambition and with my eyes still fixed upon it i dropped fast asleep revelling still in the same dreams which i had indulged in when awake in a fortnight i was quite recovered my wounds had healed up and i now walked about having had my uniform altered by the ships tailor and procured an epaulet from one of the lieutenants i took possession of my cabin in the gunroom and was warmly received by my new messmates but i did not return to my duty for nearly a month on account of a little lameness still remaining and which the surgeon declared was often the case after the yellow fever i ought to have observed that when my mother was so indulgent as to commit suicide for my sake she had taken every precaution and the letter of my grandmother informed captain delmar that my mother had bequeathed me pounds in the three per cents which she had laid by from her business and that therefore there was no longer any occasion that i should be an expense to captain delmar it must not however be supposed from my grandmother stating this that captain delmar was at all mercenary or stingy on the contrary considering that as the second son of a nobleman he had only pounds per annum besides his pay he was exceedingly liberal although not extravagant in all money matters at last i was well enough to return to my duty and glad i was to be once more walking the quarterdeck not as before on the lee but on the weather side with an epaulet on my shoulder strange to say there was not a midshipman in the ship although there were so many who had served so long as i had and in consequence there was not any heartburning or jealousy at my promotion and i continued on the best terms with my old messmates although gradually lessening the intimacy which existed between us but that was not intentional on my part it was the effect of my promotion and removal from the berth of a set of lads to the company of the senior and older officers i was now a man and had the feelings and thoughts of a man my frolics and tricks were discarded with the midshipmans coat and in respecting my new rank i respected myself now that i walked on the same side of the deck captain delmar very often entered into conversation with me and although at first it was with caution on his part yet when he found that i never presumed and was invariably most respectful he became on much more intimate terms with me during three months we continued cruising about without falling in with or having received any intelligence of the french frigate which we were sent in quest of at last captain delmar resolved to change the cruising ground and we ran up to ten degrees of latitude further north as we were running up we fell in with an american brig and brought her to a boat was sent for the captain who when he came on board was interrogated by captain delmar as to his having seen or heard of any french vessel on that coast as the conversation took place on the quarterdeck and i was officer of the watch i can repeat it well replied the american through his nose i reckon there is a frenchman in these parts have you fallen in with her inquired captain delmar well i may say i have for i lay alongside of her in cartagena when i was taking in my cargo of hides you havent such a thing as a spar as will make me a pole topgallant mast captain have you is she large or small well captain i dont care whether the spar be large or small ive two carpenters on board and ill soon dub it down into shape i inquired about the vesseli did not refer to the spar replied captain delmar haughtily and i referred to the spar which is my business and not to the vessel which is no consarn of mine replied the american captain you see master we have both our wants you want information i want a spar i have no objection to a fair swop well replied captain delmar rather amused give me the information and you shall have the spar thats agreed send for the carpenter and desire him to get out a small spar mr said captain delmar to the first lieutenant well captain that looks like business and so now ill go on the frenchman is as large as you may be said he looking round the deck he may be a bit larger but you wont mind that i suppose did you leave her in port when you sailed i reckon she was off two days before me and how many days is it since you sailed just four days i calculate and did you hear where she was going to yes i did and ive a notion i could put my finger upon her now if i choosed captain you havent got a coil of twoinch which you could lend mei aint got a topsail brace to reeve and mine are very queer just now i reckon theyve been turned end for end so often that theres an end of them you say that you know where the vessel iswhere is she captain thats tellingcant i have the two inch we have not a whole coil of twoinch left sir said the master touching his hat we might spare him enough for a pair of new braces well well im reasonable altogether and if so be you havent got it i dont expect it its very odd now but i cant just now remember the place that the french vessel was going to its slipped clean out of my memory perhaps the twoinch might help your memory replied the captain mr smith let the rope be got up and put into the boat well said the american captain as you say mister it may help my memory its not the first time that ive freshened a mans memory with a bit of twoinch myself continued he grinning at his own joke but i dont see it coming i have ordered it to be put in the boat replied captain delmar haughtily my orders are not disobeyed nor is my word doubted not by them as knows you i dare say captain but youre a stranger to me i dont think i ask much after alla bit of spar and a bit of ropejust to tell you where you may go and take a fine vessel and pocket a nation lot of dollars as prizemoney well theres the rope and now ill tell you she was going off berbice or surinam to look after the west indiamen who were on the coast or expected on it i dont know which there youll find her as sure as i stand here but i think that she is a bit bigger than this vesselyou dont mind that i dare say you may go on board now sir said captain delmar well thank ye captain and good luck to you the american captain went down the side and as soon as our boat returned and was hoisted up we made all sail for the coast of demerara she must be a fine vessel said captain delmar to me as he was walking the decka very fine vessel if she is bigger than we are you will excuse me captain delmar if i venture to observe that there was an expression in the eye of the american when he said a bit bigger which made me take it into my head that in saying so he was only deceiving us the americans are not very partial to us and would be glad of any revenge that may be mr keene but i do not see that he can be deceiving us by making her out to be larger as it is putting us on our guard had he said that she was smaller it would then have been deceiving us i did not take it in that sense sir replied i he said a bit bigger now i cant help thinking that a bit bigger was meant to deceive us and that it will prove that the frenchman is a lineofbattle ship and not a frigate he wished to leave us under the impression that it was a larger frigate than our own and no more it may be so replied captain delmar thoughtfully at all events mr keene i am obliged to you for the suggestion the captain took two or three more turns fore and aft in silence and then quitted the deck chapter twenty two in three days we had gained the latitude of berbice and on the fourth morning the men at the masthead were keeping a sharp lookout for any strange sail our head was then towards the land which being very low could not be seen the breeze was light the royals had been set and the men piped down to breakfast when the mastheadman reported three sail right ahead we soon made them out to be merchant vessels and as they separated and made all sail from us we made sure that they had been captured and so it proved when we took possession of them which we did not do of the third before nightfall upon interrogating the prisoners and the few english who had been left on board the prizes we found out that i had been right in my conjecture they had been captured by a french lineofbattle ship which they had left in shore the evening before the english reported her a very fast sailer and believed her to be an eighty gun ship indeed the french prisoners acknowledged that such was the case this was very important intelligence and captain delmar walked up and down deck in deep thought the fact was he was puzzled how to act to attempt to cope with such a force unless under peculiarly favourable circumstances would be madness to leave the coast and our mercantile navy exposed to her depredations was at the same time very repulsive to his feelings and sense of duty the prizes had been manned the prisoners were on board the boats hoisted up and the manilla still remained hove to the fact was the captain did not know which way to put the ships head and he walked up and down in deep thought mr keene is it your watch no sir oblige me by telling the master to work up the reckoning i wish to know exactly where we are it is done already sir replied i and pricked off on the charti have just left the gunroom then mr keene bring the chart into my cabin i followed into the cabin with the chart which i laid down on the table and pointed out the position of the ship you were right in your supposition mr keene said the captain and really this vessel turning out to be a lineofbattle ship has put me in a very awkward predicamenti really am puzzled fighting is of no use and yet run away i will not if i can possibly help it now i had been studying the chart and had made up my own mind how i should have acted under the circumstances had i been in captain delmars position the great point was to give him my ideas without appearing to offer advice i therefore replied we have one advantage at all events sir we have been cruising so long that we are flying lighti dont think we draw sixteen feet water yes that may give us the heels of her in light winds certainly replied the captain i think she cannot draw less than twentysix or twentyseven feet of water sir continued i to put him on the right scent which on this coast will be a great advantage i think sir when i was down below i measured from soundings to soundings and the water is so shallow and deepens so gradually that there is a distance of four miles between seventeen feet and twentyeight feet water i took up the compass so as to take in the two soundings laid down in the chart and then measuring the distance showed that my assertion was true the captain said nothing for a little while at last i perceived a smile on his lips tell the officer of the watch to lower down the cutter mr keene go on board of the prizes and tell them in addition to their present orders to follow us that in case of an enemy they are to run as close in shore as the water will allow them and drop their anchors aye aye sir replied i leaving the cabin this order satisfied me that the captain perceived what i would suggest which was that if we once got in shore and in shallow water we might laugh at the lineofbattle ship which in all probability would not be able to get near enough to reach us with her guns or if she attempted it she would run on shore and then we should have the best of it as soon as i had given the orders to the prizemasters and returned on board the boat was hoisted up and all sail made for the land at twelve oclock we sounded and found ourselves in ninefathom water by which we calculated we were about thirty miles from the land i hardly need say that a most careful lookout was kept up that we might not fall in with our formidable adversary at one oclock the moon rose and i having the middle watch surveyed the horizon on every side but without discovering the enemy but at halfpast three the day dawned and before my watch was over it was broad daylight and then just as i was going down having been relieved by the second lieutenant a strange sail was reported about eight miles to leeward two points before the beam the second lieutenant hastened down to the cabin to report to the captain and i went up to the masthead to make her out and i soon discovered that she was a lineofbattle ship i immediately descended and reported to the captain who had come on deck as we could distinguish the masts and sails of the enemy very well from the deck the glasses were fixed upon her at the gangway and she was seen to set her royals and flying jib in chase of us but we felt that we were safe as we should be in shallow water long before she could beat up to us all we had to fear for was the merchant vessels which we had retaken and which were two or three miles astern of us with all the sail that they could carry it was a fiveknot breeze and the water quite smooth which was very favourable for the lineofbattle ship and ourselves but not for the merchant vessels which with their cargoes required more wind to propel them through the water the state of affairs when the hands were piped to breakfast was as follows the french lineofbattle ship had stood in for the land under all sail until halfpastseven being then as she was when we first saw her exactly two points before the beam when probably being in shoal water she had tacked and was now a little abaft our beam and lying pretty well up for the merchant vessel the furthest astern of us since she had tacked she had risen her hull out of water so as to show her upper tier of guns two of the merchant vessels were about three miles astern of usthe other one five and stood a fair chance of being cut off the more so because when we discovered the enemy we were standing about two points free right for the coast whereas upon her hauling her wind in chase we of course did the same which made us approach the shallow water in a more slanting direction and consequently not get in quite so soon we were now in seven fathoms water and by our pricking off on the chart about eleven miles from land which was so low as to be barely visible from the masthead the men were allowed an hour to their breakfast and then we beat to quarters the captain did not however put out the fires so as to prevent the ships companys dinner being cooked as everything was ready and the magazines could be opened in a minute at ten oclock we had drawn into six fathoms water the frenchman was now nearly astern of us still on the opposite tack and passing about three miles to leeward of the merchant vessel which lagged most behind it was now considered certain that she would recapture this vessel which was at least seven miles astern of us and not impossible that she might take one if not both of the others as it was evident she was a prime sailer as fast almost as our own ship at a quarterpast ten the french lineofbattle ship tacked and stood right after us in our wake being now hull down about twelve miles from us hell soon have the starnmost vessel mr keene said bob cross to me mr dott has charge of her he is always in some scrape or other yes replied i but he gets out of them and i dare say he will out of this helm up there quartermasterflatten in forward the winds heading us sir said the master shes full again now thus boy and nothing off she has broken off two points sir all the better replied the captain its a squeak for mr dott in a few minutes we perceived that the other vessel had met the change in the wind and had broken off as well as ourselves the frenchman did not now lay up for the merchant vessel as she did before and the latter had some chance of escape it was very exciting for as the time drew nearer to noon the wind became more light and more variable and at one time all the vessels broke off another point shortly afterwards the wind flew back again to the point which it at first blew from and the enemy lay once more right up for the merchant vessels the french lineofbattle ship was still about four miles astern of the merchant vessel nearest to her i think we shall have a calm soon observed captain delmar square the mainyard we may as well be nearer to her as not now for if it falls calm she will recapture them with her boats and we shall be too far to give any assistance get the yard tackles up all ready mr aye aye sir replied the first lieutenant pipe the boats crew away and let them get their guns and ammunition on the gangway it was about a quarter to eleven when we hove to the breeze still continuing variable and light and the french lineofbattle ship did not come up so fast as before we sounded after we hove to and found that we were in five and a half fathoms water at twelve oclock in consequence of our having hove to the relative positions of the vessels were as followsthe two merchant vessels which had been about four miles astern of us were now alongside of us the third was about three miles astern of us and the frenchman was about the same distance astern of her so that our frigate was about six miles from the french lineofbattle ship captain delmar had given orders to pipe to dinner at seven bells halfpast eleven oclock that in case the boats were required the men might have dined before the were sent away a few minutes after twelve oclock it fell a dead calm the hands were turned up the boats hoisted out and lowered down the guns and ammunition put in them and everything in readiness we keeping our glasses upon the enemy and watching her manoeuvring which at the distance we were was now easily to be distinguished captain delmar was aware that he ran some risk in sending his boats away for it might so happen that a breeze might spring up from the seaward and the enemy have the advantage of it long before us if so it might bring her up to the vessel astern and the boats be captured indeed it might bring her up nearly alongside of us before we caught the wind it was necessary therefore to be very cautious and not send the boats away till the last momentthat is before we saw the french ship hoisting out or lowering down her own that the frenchman knew that our boats had been hoisted out could not be doubted as their eyes were quite as sharp as ours they however tried to double us for all of a sudden as i had my glass upon the french ship i perceived three boats coming round her quarter and pulling right for the merchant vessel the fact was that she had lowered down her stern and quarter boats to leeward which we could not perceive i reported this immediately to the captain who ordered the boats crews to be piped away who is to command the boats sir said the first lieutenant mr keene said the captain mr keene i wish to speak with you before you go captain delmar then walked to the capstern and in few words pointed out what i have just stated as the difficulty which might occur and the chances of capture you understand me mr keene perfectly sir replied i well then i trust to your discretion mr keene and hope i shall not be disappointed now you may go the french ship is getting up her yard tackles said the signal man then you have no time to lose mr keene as for the small boats they are of no consequence i went down the side and shoved off our men gave way cheerfully and manfully and the three boats of the frenchmen had but a little start of us in half an hour we were both within less than a mile of the merchant vessel but the french boats were the nearest of the two the affair now became very exciting in another ten minutes the french boats had gained the merchant vessel and the men were clambering up her sides while we were not more than three cables length from them that tommy dott was defending himself was to be presumed as a good deal of firing took place but before we could get alongside it was evident that he and his men had been mastered and the french were in possession of the vessel but now our turn came dividing my boats six in number into two divisions we boarded on both sides and very soon had regained the vessel and mastered the french who did not amount to more than thirtyfive men while we had more than seventy we found that the frenchmen had not spared our people on board of the vessel all of them being wounded or killed but the fact was that tommy dott had fought most nobly and resisted to the very last he himself poor fellowlay against the capstern with his head cut open by a blow of a cutlass and quite insensible as soon as we had secured the prisoners i turned my eyes to the lineofbattle ship and saw that her large boats had shoved off they were five in number but much larger and holding more men than we had a little reflection decided me that we should have a better chance of resisting them on board of the vessel than in the boats and i determined that i would get my boats guns up on board of the vessel and arm her in that way it was necessary however to secure our boats that they might not cut them away from alongside i therefore as soon as the guns and ammunition were on board lowered the iron chain cable down from the bows and passed it from one boat to the other under the fixed thwarts of each boat including those captured from the french hauling the end of the cable on board again through the stern port we had plenty of time to do this and make any other preparation on board before the french boats arrived it was a dead calm the sea was like a mirror and the advancing boats as their oars rose and fell in the water gave you the idea of creatures possessed of life and volition as they rapidly forced their way through the yielding fluid the vessels stern was towards the lineofbattle ship and the boats were pulling up a little on the starboard quarter the guns which i had hoisted on board had for want of any other means been sufficiently secured by ropes to the slides and breechings to enable us to fire them with effect when the boats were about a quarter of a mile from us we opened our fire not that we expected much from our guns as we knew we could not obtain more than two good shots at the boats before they were alongside still there was a chance of hitting and disabling them and no chance was to be thrown away our first shot was successful it struck one of the pinnaces and she swamped immediately our men cheered while the other french boats pulled to it and took up the men who were floating in the water before they could effect this another gun was fired with grape and round which apparently did some execution as there appeared to be much confusion on board of the two boats that had gone to the assistance of their comrades we now fully expected the boats to advance on the contrary they spread out on each quarter and opened their fire upon us with their gunsa very foolish act on their part as it gave us every advantage for they were far superior to us in number of men and should have boarded us at once instead of risking the loss of more of their boats so little did we expect this that at one time i was debating whether i should not leave the guns in the boats alongside instead of getting them on board that there might be no delay in case wind sprang up and it were necessary that we should be off of course as it was i was very glad that i had decided otherwise the action if it may be so termed now continued for about half an hour without any great casualty on either side we had five or six men wounded on board of the vessel but none killed i had occasionally looked round to see if there was any appearance of wind and just about this time i perceived a black line in the offing which promised not only wind but wind from the very quarter which would be most disastrous to us and i began to feel very anxious when i heard a bugle sounded from the largest french boat this was the signal to advance and i was very glad as the affair would now be soon decided as all our boats were secured on the starboard side of the vessel the frenchmen did not attempt to board on that side as in so doing it would have been at a double disadvantage they had therefore no alternative but to board all together on the larboard side two of the boats guns had been fixed on that sidedouble shotted and depressed so as to be fired at the moment one of the boats should pass beneath them they were both fired at the leading boat the launch which was very large and full of men and the shot went through her bottom this did not prevent her coming alongside but she filled and sank almost immediately afterwards while the men were climbing up the sides of the vessel the sinking of this boat prevented the men of the other boats outside of her from supporting their companions and we had therefore only to meet the force of the launch and the two other boats which had come alongside ahead of her and which was in number not equal to our own we always had an idea that the french would never do much in the way of boarding and so it proved they were beat down as fast as they made their appearance above the bulwarks the french lieutenant was attempting to get over the gunwale he was unsupported as almost all his men had tumbled back into the sea instead of cutting him down i caught him by the collar and hauled him on board and as soon as he was disarmed gave him in charge of a marine in ten minutes all was over two of the french boats remained alongside and the others shoved off half manned and dropped astern we gave them three cheers as a parting salutation but we had no time to losethe wind was evidently springing up fast already cats paws were to be seen here and there rippling the water and the line on the horizon was now dark and broad i ordered our boats to be ready for starting the guns to be got in and the wounded men divided among them as fast as possible the two large french boats which remained on the starboard side we cleared of the men who lay in them and then had their bottoms beat out to sink them the french lieutenant and two other officers i ordered into our own boats to take on board as prisoners the rest of the french who had been captured with their wounded we put into the three small french boats which had been captured in the first attack taking away their oars that when i shoved off and left the vessel they might drift about till they were picked up by the french ship every thing being in readiness i had now to decide what i should do with the merchant vessel the wind coming up so fast from the seaward gave her no chance of escape and i decided that i would set her on fire having so done in three different parts to ensure her destruction i then shoved off with our boats having first pushed off the frenchmen in their boats without oars and wished them goodbye they certainly did look very foolish and anything but pleased as we pulled for the frigate i perceived that the lineofbattle ships sails were filling and that it was touch and go with us but i also knew that she could not leave her boats and that it would take some time to pick them up two were halfmanned and pulling towards her the other three were without oars and must be picked by the other boats all of which would occasion delay notwithstanding we pulled as hard as we could and were halfway back before the breeze was sufficiently steady to enable the lineofbattle ship to make much progress through the water of course we could not well see what was going on when we had pulled away in the boats and were at a distance all we could see was that the french lineofbattle ship was not yet in chase from which we presumed that she had not yet picked up her boats in the meantime the merchant vessel burnt furiously and the columns of smoke very often hid the enemy from our view before we arrived on board the breeze had passed us and caught the sails of our frigate and the two merchant vessels so that we were more easy on that score captain delmar had been very anxious the yards tackles and stays and the tackles for hoisting up the quarterboats were already hanging down as we pulled alongside and all hands in boats was piped before we could get up the gangway there was no time to be lost the french lineofbattle ship had picked up her boats and was now in chase with studdingsails below and abaft the two merchant vessels had made all sail and were running inshore ahead of us i touched my hat to the captain and said come on board sirshall i see the quarterboats hoisted up if you please mr keene replied he the fact was it was very easy to tell my story after the boats were up and sail made upon the frigate and i knew there was no time for talking i never witnessed such a rapidity as was shown on this occasion in less than five minutes all the boats were on board and all sail made i looked at the french lineofbattle ship she was within four miles of us and bringing up a very steady breeze but we were now drawing through the water and as the recaptured vessels were three miles ahead of us there was nothing to fear captain delmar came aft to look at the frenchman who had already passed by the vessel which i had set on fire now then mr keene said he we will know what has taken place of course we have seen most of it i narrated what the reader already knows what do you suppose to have been the loss i should say three boats and about forty men sir i forgot sir to tell you that we have a lieutenant and two officers prisoners whom i brought on board with me desire them to be brought on deck said the captain mr keene you have done your work wellwith great gallantry and great judgment i touched my hat not a little pleased at such a compliment from captain delmar whats the last soundings mr smith inquired the captain and a quarter four sir said the master this chase wont last long observed the captain take in the lower studdingsail the french lieutenant was then questioned but with the exception of the name of the ship and captain there was little to be expected from him and he was dismissed and sent below this affair however was not without loss on our side principally arising from tommy dotts stout defence we had two men killed and we had altogether fourteen men woundedsome of them very severely my friend tommy dott came on board a miserable object his face and hair matted with blood but when it was washed away he proved to be not so much hurt as was supposed the cut was severe but the bones were not injured he was very soon out of his hammock again and his chief pleasure was to put his tongue in his cheek and make faces at the french lieutenant who at last became so annoyed that he complained to captain delmar who ordered mr tommy to leave off these expressions of national animosity if he had any wish to obtain his promotion but to return as the breeze freshened and the french ship had the first of it she rapidly gained upon us and in an hour and a half was about three miles from us we had now shoaled our water to three fathoms and a half which was quite near enough to the ground as it left but four feet between our keel and the bottom the studdingsails were taken in and we ranged the cable a few minutes afterwards the french lineofbattle ship was seen to shorten sail and haul to the wind she had followed us into as shoal water as far as she dared to venture in and as she rounded to out of spite i presume she fired a gun the evening was now closing in and as there was every appearance of fine weather we stood out till we were again in four fathoms and then dropped our anchor the next morning when the day broke the french lineofbattle ship was in the offing about eight miles distant it may easily be imagined that the french were very much annoyed at what had taken place their prizes recaptured three boats lost and their ships company weakened and all by an inferior force close to them and without any prospect of their having any revenge but we on the other hand were not very pleasantly situated it is true that we were safe but at the same time we were in prison and could not hope for escape unless some vessel came down to our assistance and how long we might be compelled to remain where we were or what the chapter of accidents might bring about no one could foresee about eight oclock the french ship again stood in and when as close as she dare come to us she ran up and down trying for deeper water on one side or the other but in vain she was within gunshot of us it is true as we had run out into four fathoms but we could always trip our anchor when we pleased and stand further in at last she tried a shot at us and it fell very close captain delmar did not however get under weigh and stand further in although he ordered the capstern bars to be shipped and the messenger passed a second and a third shot were fired and one went over us at last the frenchman anchored and set to work in good earnest he found that he was within range and as we did not move presumed that we were in as shallow water as we could run into as the wind was still to seaward we laid head on to him and one of his shot struck us in the forefoot captain delmar then ordered the cable to be hove in and the anchor tripped by which means we drifted in shore and increased our distance without his being aware of it and his firing still continued but without injury to us the reason for captain delmars doing this was evident he wished the french ship to continue firing as the report of her guns might be heard and bring down some vessel to our assistance at all events such was not our good fortune on the first day and i began to be tired of our situation so did captain delmar for on the second day he sent a boat to the recaptured vessels which were at anchor inshore of us directing them to heave up as soon as it was dark and make the best of their way to barbadoes keeping well in shore till they got more to the northward this they did and the following morning they were not in sight the french ship still remained at anchor and it appeared that she had been lightening so as to get further in for on that morning she weighed and stood in to a mile and a half of us and we were obliged to do the same and run inshore out of his reach to effect this we anchored in three and a quarter fathoms so that we actually stirred up the mud towards the evening the wind fortunately shifted to off shore and as soon as it was dark the captain ordered the anchor to be weighed and we made all sail to the northward trusting to our heels the following morning we had run seventy miles and as the french ship was not to be seen it was to be presumed that she was not aware of our having so done ten days afterwards we dropped our anchor in carlisle bay barbadoes we found two menofwar both captains junior officers to our own and i took this opportunity of passing my examination which was a mere matter of form having watered and taken in provisions we then sailed for jamaica to join the admiral who upon captain delmars representation immediately confirmed the acting order of lieutenant given to me by him a few days afterwards a packet arrived from england and letters were received by captain delmar informing him of the death of his elder brother and his succeeding to the title of lord de versely for his elder brother although married had no male issue upon this intelligence captain delmar immediately resigned the command of the manilla and another captain was appointed to her i did not much like this as i wished to remain with captain delmar and gain his goodwill i was however consoled by his sending for me previous to his sailing for england in a frigate ordered home and saying mr keene my duties in the house of lords and family affairs require my presence in england and i think it most probable that i now quit the service altogether but i shall not lose sight of you you have conducted yourself much to my satisfaction and i will take care of your advancement in the service if you only continue as you have begun i shall be happy to hear from you if you will write to me occasionally i wish you every success is there anything that i can do for you i am most grateful my lord replied i for all your kindness i had hoped to have been longer under your protection and guidance but i am aware that your high station must now prevent it if i might be so bold as to ask a favour my lord certainly keene replied his lordship keene not mr keene thought i it is sir that ithink i should have a better chance of doing something if i were to obtain the command of the firefly schooner the lieutenant commanding her is about to invalid i agree with you i will speak to the admiral this very day is that all yes my lord unless you think you could ask for cross your coxswain to be appointed to her i should like to have a man on board whom i knew and could trust i will see about it and so goodbye his lordship held out his hand i took it very respectfully he had never done so before and the tears ran down my cheeks as i was quitting him his lordship observed it and turned away i left the cabin quite overcome with his kindness and so happy that i would not have changed positions with the grand sultan himself lord de versely was faithful to his promise the next day i received from the admiral my appointment to the firefly and what was more unexpected bob cross received a warrant as her boatswain this was a very kind act of lord de versely and i was as much delighted as bob himself i also received an invitation to dinner with the admiral on that day on my arrival at the house a few minutes before dinner the admiral called me aside to the verandah and said to me mr keene i have not forgotten your cruise in the pirate schooner and lord de versely has told me of your good behaviour in many instances since particularly of your conduct in the boats off berbice in his despatches he has given you great praise and i have added mine to back it so that if you only keep steady you will command a sloop of war very soon you have now been seven months a lieutenant for your commission will be confirmed to your first appointment a few months more and i hope to see you with a commanders commission in your pocket i replied that i was very grateful and only hoped that he would send me out in the schooner to where i might prove myself deserving of his patronage never fear ill find something for you to do mr keene bythebye lord de versely told me last night when we were alone the history of the duel at martinique you did well mr keene i thank you in the name of our serviceit wont do for the soldiers to crow over us though they are fine fellows it must be admitted however that secret had better be kept most certainly sir replied i now then theres that black fellow come up to tell us dinner is ready so come along or youll be where the little boat wasa long way astern chapter twenty three the admiral was very kind to me and shook hands with me when i left him i returned on board of the manilla took leave of the surgeon and master and other officers and then of all my messmates and a boat was manned to take bob cross and me on board of the firefly after the boat shoved off and was a little distance from the frigate the men suddenly tossed up their oars what are you about men said i look there sir said bob cross pointing to the frigate i turned round and perceived all the men in the rigging who gave me three cheers from a pipe of the boatswain a compliment which i had not dreamt of and which moved me to tears i rose and took off my hat the men in the boat returned the cheers dropped their oars in the water and rowed to the schooner i stepped on board ordered the hands aft and read my commission and then crosss warrant after which i went down into the cabin for i wished to be alone i was now in command of a vessel and not more than twenty years old i reflected what a career was before me if i was fortunate and never neglected an opportunity of distinguishing myself and i vowed that i never would and prayed to heaven to assist my endeavours lord de verselys kindness to me had struck deep into my heart and my anxiety was that he should be proud of me and then i thought of the chances for and against me he might marry and have children that would be the worst thing that could happen to me if he did not marry his other brother had a large family and the title would go to the eldest son but that was nothing to me while i was summoning up all these contingencies in my mind there was a knock at the cabin door come in said i oh is it you cross im glad to see you sit down there you see i command a vessel at last bob yes sir and youll command a larger one before long i hope but as to your being in command of a vesseltheres nothing very surprising in that what is surprising is to find myself a warrant officerthe idea never came into my head i must write and tell my little girl of my good fortune it will make her and her mother very happy i must do the same cross my mother will be very much pleased to hear all i have to tell her i havent heard it myself yet mr keene and thats why i came in replied bob i know you dont want advice now but i cant help having a wish to know what took place between you and his lordship no one has a better right to know than you cross who have been such a sincere friend to me so now ill tell you i then entered into a detail of all that had passed between lord de versely and me and also what the admiral had said to me alls right mr keene replied bob and let the admiral only give us something to do and i think youll believe me when i say that the boatswain of the firefly will back you as long as he has a pin to stand upon that im sure of bob you will ever be my righthand man there are two midshipmen on board i perceive what sort of lads may they be i havent had time to find out but you have a capital ships company that the gunner and carpenter both say and a very fine vessel bob yes sir and a regular flyer they say if she is well managed you have never been in a schooner mr keene but i have and for nearly three years and i know how to handle one as well as most people so much the better cross for i know nothing about it come i will ring the bell i suppose some one will answer it a lad made his appearance were you mr williamss servant yes sir get me out a bottle of wine and some glassesthere that will do now bob lets drink success to the firefly heres success to the firefly mr keene and success to the captain may you do well in her and be soon out of her thank you bob heres your health and may we long sail together bob and i finished the bottle and then we parted the next day i was very busy in examining my vessel and my ships company the schooner was a beautiful model very broad in the beam and very low in the water she mounted one long brass thirtytwopounder forward on a circular sweep so that it could be trained in every direction abaft she had four brass ninepound carronades my ships company consisted of sixty men and officers that is myself two mids boatswain gunner and carpenter the mids were young lads of about sixteen years of age a mr brown and a mr black gawky tall boys with their hands thrust too far though the sleeves of their jackets and their legs pulled too far through their trowsers in fact they were growing lads who had nothing but their pay to subsist upon being both sons of warrant officers they bore very good characters and i resolved to patronise them and the first thing which i did was to present them each with a new suit of uniform and a few other necessaries so as to make them look respectable a most unheardof piece of patronage and which it is therefore my boast to record the fact is i was resolved that my schooner should look respectable my ships company were really a very fine body of men most of them tall and stout and i had received a very good character of them from the officer who had invalided i had taken all his stores and furniture off his hands for i had plenty of money and to spare as soon as i had examined my ships company i made them a speech the which although they were bound to hear it i shall not inflict upon the reader and i then went down and examined every portion of the vessel ascertained what there was in her and where everything was bob cross accompanied me in this latter duty which was not over till dinnertime the next morning my signal was made and i went up to the admiral mr keene said the admiral here are despatches to take down to the governor of curacao when can you be ready now sir replied i and if you will make the signal for the firefly to weigh anchor there will be so much time gained very good keene tell them to make the signal you must make all the haste you can as they are important here are your orders after you have delivered your despatches you will be allowed to cruise down in that quarter as i understand there are some very mischievous vessels in that direction i hope you will give me a good account of one or two of them if you fall in with them i will do my best sir replied i well i sent you on purpose i have ordered the senior officer at curacao to forward the return despatches by the mosquito that you may have a chance i wont ask you to stay to dinner as it is an affair that presses so of course you will carry a press of sail goodbye and i wish you success i took my leave of the admiral and hastened down to the town in an hour afterwards the firefly was driving along with a fine breeze on the quarter and long before night the vessels in the harbour were not to be distinguished the breeze freshened after the sun went down and i remained on deck carrying on to the last moment bob cross once or twice ventured to say that we had better reduce the sail but i told bob that the admiral was very anxious that i should make a quick passage yes mr keene but turning the turtle is not making a quick passage except to the other world and the admiral does not wish his despatches to go there she is a fine boat sir but there may be too much sail carried on a good vessel the men say she never has been so pressed before well you are right bob and so we will take a little off her yes sir its my watch coming on now and i will carry all she can bear with safety and i think she will go quite as fast as she does now we shall have more wind yet sir depend upon it well so long as it is fair i dont mind how much replied i send the watch aft we reduced the sail and then i went down to bed at daylight i awoke and went on deck the carpenter had the watch for the watches were entrusted to the warrant officers who were all good seamen and accustomed to the schooner i found that the wind had freshened but was steady from the same quarter and the schooner was darting through the water at a tremendous rate she sails well mr hayter said i yes sir that she does replied he and never sailed better than she does now i was a little alarmed for my sticks last night until you shortened sail admirals order to carry a press of sail mr hayter well sir then by jove you obey orders you half frightened the men although they had been so long in the vessel i felt by what the carpenter had said that i had been rash neither he nor bob cross would have ventured so much if i had not been so and they understood the vessel better than i did so i resolved to be guided by them until i felt able to judge for myself notwithstanding that sail was afterwards carried more prudently we had a most remarkably rapid passage for we took the breeze with us down the whole way not seeing a vessel during the run i had another cause of impatience which was to ascertain if mr vanderwelt and minnie had left the island on my arrival i went first to the naval commanding officer and then to the governors delivering my credentials they complimented me on my having been so active i accepted the governors invitation to dinner and then went to inquire after mr vanderwelt i walked first to his house but found it occupied by a scotch merchant who however was very polite he stated that he was an old friend of mr vanderwelt and could give me every information as he had received letters from him very lately and that in those letters mr vanderwelt had informed him that i had said in my last letter to them that i was again on the west india station and requested him if i came to the island to show me every attention so my dear sir continued mr fraser i trust you will enable me to comply with my friend mr vanderwelts injunctions and consider this house as your home during your stay here i thanked mr fraser and accepted the offer i sent for my portmanteau and slept there that night after i had dined with the governor at dinner i met captain c who told me he had orders to send me on a cruise and asked when i would be ready i replied that i should like a day or two to lift my rigging and overhaul it as i had been very much strained in my passage down no wonder replied he you must have flownindeed your log proves it well i will send you as soon as you are ready the naiad sloop is out and so is the driver brig both in pursuit of three vessels which have done a great deal of mischief one is a french brig of fourteen guns very fast and full of men she has her consort a large schooner who is also a regular clipper the other vessel is a brigantine a very fine vessel built at baltimoreof course under french colours she cruises alone i dont know how many guns she carries but i suspect that both she and the brig will be too much for you and unless you could catch the schooner away from her consort you will not be able to do much with the firefly i will do my best sir replied i i have a very fine set of men on board and i think very good officers well at all events if you cant fight you have a good pair of heels to run with replied captain c but dinners announced i left early that i might have some conversation with mr fraser on my return we sat down to some sangoree and cigars and then he told me that mr vanderwelt had left curacao about nine months before and that my last letter directed to him had been forwarded to holland he had often heard the history of my saving their lives on board of the pirate vessel from mr vanderwelt who made it a constant theme of his discourse and added mr fraser you do not know what a regard he has for you and little minnie sir inquired i it is now nearly five years since i saw her little minnie is no longer little minnie mr keene i can assure you she was fifteen when she left the island and had grown a tall and very beautiful girl all the young men here were mad about her and would have followed her not only to holland but to the end of the world i believe if they thought that they had the least chancebut from my intimacy with the family i tell you candidly that i think if you were to meet again you would not have a bad one for she talks incessantly of you when alone with her father but i must not divulge family secrets i fear there is little chance of my meeting again with her replied i i have to carve my way up in my profession and this war does not appear likely to be over soon that i should like to see her and her father again i grant for i have made but few friendships during my life and theirs was one of the most agreeable where is mr vanderwelt settled he is not in hollandhe is at hamburg well there is no saying accident may bring you together again as it did on board of the pirate and i hope it may shortly afterwards we went to bed i must say his description of minnie which was even much more in detail than i have narrated to the reader did prevent my going to sleep for a long while women as the reader may have seen never once troubled my thoughts i had fed upon one sole and absorbing idea that of being acknowledged by captain delmar this was and had been the source and spring of every action and was the only and daily object of reverie it was my ambition and ambition in any shape in whatever direction it may be led is so powerful as to swallow up every other passion of the human mind but still i had a strong affection for minniethat is for little minnie as i saw her first with her beautiful large eyes and madonna countenance clinging to her father with the exception of my own relations who were so much my seniors i had had nothing to bestow my affections on had not even made the acquaintance i may say of a woman unless my casual intercourse with bob crosss mary indeed might be so considered a passion for the other sex was therefore new to me but although new it was pleasing and perhaps more pleasing from being in the present case ideal for i had only a description of minnie as she was and a recollection of what she had been i could therefore between the two fill up the image with what was to my fancy the ideal of perfection i did so again and again until the night wore away and tired out at last i fell fast asleep the next day after i had been on board of the schooner and given my orders to bob cross i returned to mr fraser and sat down to write to mr vanderwelt i also wrote to minnie which i had never done before that my night reveries had an effect on me is certain for i wrote her a long letter whereas had i commenced one before my arrival at curacao i should have been puzzled to have made out ten lines i told her i was sitting in the same chair that i was sleeping in the same room that i could not look around me without being reminded of her dear face and the happy hours we passed together that mr fraser had told me how tall she had grown and was no longer the little minnie that used to kiss me in fact i wrote quite romantically as well as affectionately and when i read over my letter wondered how it was that i had become so eloquent i begged mr vanderwelt to write to me as soon as possible and tell me all about their doings i sealed my letter and then threw myself back in my chair and once more indulged in the reveries of the night before i had a new feeling suddenly sprung up in my heart which threatened to be a formidable rival to my ambition in two days the firefly was ready and i reported her as being so to captain c he gave me my orders which were to cruise for six weeks and then to rejoin the admiral at port royal unless circumstances should make me think it advisable to return to the island the boats of the menofwar were sent to tow me out of the harbour and i was once more on the wide blue seathe schooner darting along like a dolphin for a fortnight we cruised without seeing any vessel but the naiad i was very much afraid that the captain would have ordered me to keep company but as he considered his vessel quite a match for the brig and schooner if he should fall in with them and did not want the prizemoney to be shared with the crew of the firefly he allowed me to go my own way saying to me laughingly as i went over the side they will certainly take you if they meet you and we shall have to recapture you well i hope you will not forget your promise sir replied i i shall depend upon you during the fortnight that i had been out i had taken great pains in exercising the men at their guns the great gun particularly and i had had an excellent sight put on it which it had not and very much required during two or three days calm i had fired shot at a mark for three or four hours each day and i found that the men with this little practice were very expert and could hit a very small object now that the sight was put on the gun the two best shots however were the gunner and bob cross the night after we parted from the naiad i had run to the southward having heard from the captain that the driver was more to the northward than he was there was nothing in sight on the next day and when the evening set in the wind being very light and water smooth i said to cross suppose we furl sail at nightit is just as good as running about we then shall see them if they come in our way and they will not see us a very good idea mr keene we must keep a good lookout thats all i followed up my own suggestion we furled the sails and leaving two men with the officer of the watch to keep a sharp lookout allowed the rest of the ships company to remain in the hammocks during the whole of the night when day broke we had two lookout men at the masthead but remained with our sails furled as before for the same reason that we should discern a vessel by her sails long before she could discover us the more i thought of it the more convinced i was of the advantage to be gained by the following up of this plan i was on the exact cruising ground i wished to be and therefore could not do better while the weather remained so fine chapter twenty four four nights and three days we remained in this way during which my men had nothing to do but to exercise at the guns and of that i took care they should have a good spell on the fourth night the wind was a little fresher but the water quite smooth i had turned in about twelve oclock and had been asleep about an hour when cross came and called me well cross said i what is it here they are sir whatthe privateers yes sir the brig and schooner both coming down right before the wind they are on our weather quarter and will pass us within two miles if not nearer i left my bedplace and was dressed in a minute i went on deck with my glass and directed it to the vessels which were quite plain to the naked eye put out the binnacle light cross said i they might discover us the brig which was the headmost of the two vessels was now nearly crossing our stern the schooner was about a mile astern of her turn the hands up cross see all ready for action and making sail not yet sir surely no not yet we will let them run two or three miles dead to leeward and then follow them till daylight or till they see us when of course they will be after us its very fortunate sir that we did furl the sails for had they come down and we under sail they would have seen us and we should have been to leeward of them which would have given us a poor chance against such odds now we shall have the weathergage and may choose if our heels are as good as theirs which i expect they are if not better i shall fight them in some shape or another bob you may depend upon it of course you will mr keene or youll disappoint us all the ships company have every confidence in you i can tell you thanks to your long yarns bob i presume thanks to my telling the truth mr keene the schooner is right astern of us now so theres the weathergage gonethank god we remained as we were till i considered the two vessels sufficiently to leeward and the sails were then set upon the firefly and first running to the eastward so as to get right in the winds eye of them i put the helm up and followed them we had continued our course in their wake for about an hour when day dawned and the schooner who had discovered us fired a gun as a signal to her concert so youve found us out at last have you said bob crossat all events we keep a better lookout than you do old fellow shortly after the gun was fired both vessels hauled to the wind on the larboard tack and we did the same being about four miles to windward of the schooner and five or five and a half of the brig we could now examine our adversaries the schooner was apparently about the same tonnage as the firefly a very beautiful vessel with her masts raking over her stern she was painted black and we could not ascertain at first how many guns she carried as her ports were shut but after a short time she knocked out her half ports to prepare for action and then we discovered that she carried twelve guns but not a long gun on a swivel like the one on board of the firefly i observed this to cross who replied then sir all we have to do now is to try our rate of sailing with them and if we are faster than they are we have not much to fearunless we lose a spar indeed but lucks all mr keene the schooner has more sail on her than we have shall we set exactly the same no cross for i think we have forereached upon her already and if we can beat her with less sail set it will do just as well i think that the breeze is steady if anything we shall have more than less of it for an hour we continued running on the same tack with them by which time we found that we had not only brought the schooner one point abaft our beam but had weathered her at least half a mile we therefore were fully satisfied that we had sailed better than the schooner with the brig it was not so although we had brought the schooner two points abaft our beam the brig was much in her former position being still half a point abaft our beam and moreover had come in much closer to the schooner proving that we had neither weathered her nor forereached upon her as near as we could judge our sailing with the brig was much upon a par having ascertained this point more satisfactorily by allowing another hour of trial i desired the men to get their breakfasts while i and the officers did the same and as soon as that was done i ordered the firefly to be kept awayedging down till within good range of our long brass thirtytwopound gunthat is about one mile and a halfwhen we again hauled our wind and hoisted the english colours the tricolour was immediately thrown up by the two frenchmen and a shot was fired at us by the schooner it fell exhausted into the water about half a cables length from us now cross said i see if we cant return the compliment with a little better success cross who had been training the gun and had his eye on the sight waited for a second or two and fired we saw the shot pass through the first reef of his mainsail and dash into the water to leeward of him very good that cross but hull him if you can the schooner now returned the fire with the whole broadside apparently twelve pounders but they did not throw so far as our long thirtytwopounder and no shot went over us although one fell close under the stern at the distance therefore that we were we had everything in our favour and my object was to dismantle the schooner before any chance enabled the brig to assist her we continued to fire at her taking the greatest pains in our aim for the next hour during which we ascertained that we had hulled her more than once and had very much cut up her spars and rigging she continued to return the fire but without effect one or two shots hit us but their force was so much spent by the distance they were propelled that they did not enter the sides at last a shot fired by the gunner did the job it struck her foremast which shortly afterwards went by the board the fireflies gave three cheers at the good fortune shes done for sir said cross now for the brigwe must try what metal she carries stop a bit said i cross we must give the schooner a little more before she gets away they have lowered down the mainsail and i presume intend getting up some headsail so as to pay off and run under the lee of the brig for shelter put the helm up and run down so as to keep the schooner about two points on our larboard bow get the gun round and pitch it into her as we had supposed the schooner got a stay up from her bowsprit and to her mainmast head and hoisted a fore and aft sail upon it that she might pay off and run down to her consort for support but as we ran three feet to her one and now stood directly for her we were enabled to get close to her and put several shots into her from our long gun as we advanced she did not attempt to round to to give us her broadside and our raking shot must have had great effect when within half a mile of her we rounded to and gave her our broadside for had we followed her any further we should have been closer to the brig than might be agreeable indeed we were nearer than we thought for she had continued to hug the wind and was so weatherly that she was not more than a mile to leeward of us when we rounded to the wind again but as she had forereached upon the schooner she was distant from us about two miles as we rounded to the brig tacked and we immediately did the same and we now had a fair trial of sailing with her cross let the men go down and get what they can to eat said i and get up the grog we shall have plenty of work before the night is over i expect we must make a running fight of it sir i expect for she is too heavy for us i shall try her the same way as the schooner cross replied i if i can only knock away some of her spars without losing my own i shall then be able to do something if on the contrary we lose our spars and she gets alongside of us why then we must fight to the last i consider that schooner as our own replied bob she must haul down her colours when no longer protected by the brig yes i was afraid that she would run away to leeward altogether but i see she has rounded to and is no doubt getting up a jury foremast i allowed the men to remain an hour at their dinner and then they were summoned up during the hour we found the rate of sailing between us and the brig so nearly balanced that it was impossible to say which had the best of it now my lads we will wear round and get a little closer to this fellow and see what we can do with him the men were full of spirits and hope and were as anxious to decide the question as i was in ten minutes we passed the brig within a mile on opposite tacks and had given her our long gun three times and had received her broadside he has long twelvepounders i think sir said cross smart guns at all events theres a fore shroud and a back stay gone but thats no great matter as soon as the brig was three points abaft the beam we tacked and recommenced firing not a shot was thrown away by my men i believe the brig was hulled every time nor was her fire without effect upon us our rigging was much cut up several of her shots had gone through our sails and we had two men hurt i was annoyed at this as we had no surgeon on board the assistant surgeon who had belonged to the schooner was at the hospital and there was not one to replace him when we sailed however we had one of the men belonging to the hospitala sort of dispenserwho knew very well how to manage anything that was not very serious the breeze had gradually died away and we did not go more than three miles through the water and as our sails were much torn we did not hold so good a wind the consequence was that the distance between us and our antagonist was by two oclock decreased to half a mile and the fight became very warm our broadside guns were now called into play and assisted us very much as we directed them chiefly at her sails and rigging while our long thirtytwopounder was fired at her hull pointed below her waterline she had the advantage in number of guns certainly but our large shots from the long gun were more destructive about three we knocked away her foretopmast which enabled us to shoot ahead about a quarter of a mile and increase our distance which was a boon to us for we latterly had suffered very much we had eight men wounded and one of my poor middies killed and we had received several shots in the hull now that we had increased our distance we had a better chance as our long gun was more effective than those of the brig at five oclock it fell dead calm and both vessels lay with their heads round the compass this was also in our favour as we could train our long gun on its circular bend in any direction we pleased but the brig contrived by getting sweeps out of her bow ports to bring her broadside to bear upon us and the action continued till night closed in chapter twenty five as it may be supposed my men were completely worn out with the fatigue and excitement of the day and cross said theres no saying how this will end mr keene but at all events we have not the worst of it at present no bob replied i i wish the men were not so knocked up oh as for that sir ill answer for it that if you serve out some more grog make them eat half a biscuit at the tub before they drink it and make them a little bit of a speech that theyll go on for twentyfour hours more if that will have the effect im sure ill try it replied i which shall they have first oh biscuit first grog next and then a speech afterwards that fellow has not fired for this last five minutes perhaps he wishes to put it off till tomorrow morning but ill not so get up the grog make it pretty strong and ill get something to eat myself for i have had nothing to eat all day as soon as the ships company had had their refreshment i sent for them aft and said my lads you have behaved very well and i am much obliged to you we have had hard work and i dare say you are tired enough but i will tell you what my opinion is i think that we have peppered that frenchman very well and i am convinced that you have put a good many shots into him between wind and water now that he is anxious to leave off fighting till tomorrow morning that he may stop his leaks and repair his damages i have no doubt indeed he proves it by his having ceased to fire for the very reason that he wants to leave off i wish to go on for he is much heavier armed than we are and sails as well and if we permit him to get all right and all ataunt by tomorrow morning he may prove a very awkward customer yet now what i propose is this that we should first get up fresh sails and bend them and then renew the action through the night there will be no occasion for all of you to be on deck we will fight the schooner watch and watch till daylight thats my opinion mr keene said bob cross and mine replied the carpenter and all of us mr keene replied the ships company with one voice then my lads lets work hard and when we have settled that fellow we shall have plenty of time to sleep the men now set to with goodwill and the spare sails were got up and those which were shattered by the enemy unbent and replaced the new sails which we had bent we furledit was a dead calmand then we recommenced our fire for we were nearer to her than when we ceased firing and could distinguish her very well we fired the long gun four times before she returned a shot she then opened very briskly but none of her shots did us any damage our sails being furled prevented her distinguishing us as well as we could her after a time we manned the small guns on our broadside and worked them for our large gun was so hot that it was necessary to let it cool before we could reload it at last one of their shots came in through the bulwarks the splinters wounded me and the carpenter but i was not so much hurt as to oblige me to leave the deck i bound up my leg with my handkerchief the carpenter however was taken down below are you much hurt sir said bob cross oh no the flesh is lacerated a good deal but it is not very deep theres a little wind springing up sir from the right quarter said bob im glad to hear it replied i for it will soon be daylight now at this moment another shot struck the hammock rail and a piece of it about two feet long was sent with great force against bob crosss head he was stunned if not worse and fell immediately this was a severe blow to me as well as to poor bob i desired two of the men who were abaft to take him down into my cabin and do all they could for him and ordered the men to quit the broadside guns and renew their fire with the long pounder in a quarter of an hour afterwards the breeze came down very strong and i resolved to shoot ahead farther off from my antagonist as i should have a better chance by using my long gun at a greater distance the sails were set and the schooner went fast through the water leaving the brig who had also the benefit of the breeze and for a time the firing again ceased on reflection i determined that i would wait till daylight which would appear in less than half an hour before i renewed the action i contrived with some difficultyfor my leg was so numbed that i could scarcely feel that i had oneto go down into the cabin and see bob cross he was recovering but very wild and incoherent as far as i could judge his skull was not injured although the splinter had torn off a large portion of the scalp and he was drenched with his blood at all events he could be of no further assistance to me at present nor could i be to him so i regained the deck and sat down abaft for my leg had become so painful that i could not stand but for a few minutes at last the day dawned and i could distinctly make out both brig and schooner i was about a mile and a half distant from the brig she had since the wind sprung up driven a mile ahead of the schooner who had contrived to get up a jurymast during the night but as she could not stir without reducing her aftersail she had closereefed her mainsail so that she could make but little progress the brig was very much cut up in her sails and rigging and i saw at once that i had now the advantage in sailing i therefore wore round and stood towards them the brig did the same and went down to the schooner that she might have her support we immediately recommenced firing with our long gun and as soon as we were within a mile i hove to the brig and schooner then both bore up and gave us their broadsides they had just done so when the midshipman who was on deck with me cried out a large sail coming down before the wind mr keene i caught up my glass it was a sloop of war the cut of her sails and rigging evidently english it must be the naiad said i well im glad of it we shall lose some prizemoney but at all events we require her surgeon and that is of more consequence my men who were quite tired out were in great spirits at the appearance of a friend the brig had set studdingsails she had evidently seen the vessel to windward and was now trying to escape and the schooner was following her as well she could i immediately kept away in pursuit and when i fired into the schooner she hauled down her colours i did not wait to take possession but followed the brig who appeared to sail as well off the wind as she did when close hauled once or twice she rounded to return my fire but afterwards she continued running before the wind having got two of her guns aft with which she attempted to cut away my rigging in the meantime the strange vessel to windward had hoisted english colours and was bringing down with her a spanking breeze fortunately it was so for my foretopmast was knocked away by the fire of the brig and i now dropped fast astern we had scarcely got up a new foretopmast and set sail again when the naiad who had exchanged numbers with me passed the schooner without taking possession of her and was very soon not a mile from us in half an hour she was alongside and hailing me to haul my wind and take possession of the schooner continued in chase of the brig i obeyed my orders and by the time i had put my men on board of the schooner the brig had hove to and hauled down her colours to the naiad we ran down to her in company with the prize and then sent a boat requesting immediate surgical attendance the naiads surgeon and his assistant were brought on board in one of the sloopofwars boats and a lieutenant to obtain from me the particulars of the action which i gave to him the lieutenant told me that they had heard the firing about one oclock in the morning and had in consequence bore up but the brig had so many shot in her and was making so much water that they were almost afraid that they would not be able to get her into port but i was now quite faint with the pain of my wound and exhaustion and was carried below to have it dressed all our men had been attended to and i was glad to hear that bob cross was in no danger although his wound was very severe the surgeons assistant was allowed to remain on board and the captain of the naiad sent all my men back and manned the prizes giving me orders to keep company with him as soon as my wound was dressed and i was put into my bed i felt much relieved and soon afterwards fell fast asleep chapter twenty six the prizes proved to be the diligente brig of fourteen guns and two hundred and ten men and caroline schooner of eight guns and one hundred and twenty menthey had done a great deal of mischief and their capture was of importance the captain of the naiads orders were to return to curacao and we all made sail before sunset our loss had been severe commanding officer boatswain carpenter and twelve men woundedone midshipman and two men killed the next morning our signal was made to pass within hail and the captain of the naiad inquired how i was the surgeons assistant replied that i and all the wounded were doing well and there was no more communication till we arrived at curacao on the fourth day by which time i was rapidly recovering mr fraser as soon as he heard of my being hurt immediately came on board and insisted upon my being taken on shore to his house and i gladly consented the next day i had a visit from captain c the commanding officer and the captain of the naiad captain c asked me if i was well enough to write the account of the action i replied that i was and that i would send it the next day he and the captain of the naiad both paid me many compliments for having fought a superior force for so long a time and captain c said that as soon as i was well enough he would send me up to jamaica as bearer of my own despatches to the admiral i requested as a particular favour of mr fraser that he would allow bob cross to be sent ashore to his house and mr fraser immediately consented my friend bob was therefore brought up that evening and was soon established in very comfortable quarters we had been a fortnight at the island during which my wound was healing rapidly and i was able to hop about with a crutch cross also was out of bed and able to sit up for an hour or two on the verandah in the cool of which i spent the best part of the day with my wounded limb resting upon a sofa from the veranda we had a view of the harbour and one morning i perceived that there were two additional vessels which had anchored during the night they proved to be the driver and the brigantine privateer which she had captured after a chase and running fight of fortyeight hours i was glad of this as i knew what pleasure it would give to the admiral i now again indulged in my dreams of minnie who had been forgotten as soon as i had left the harbour and been engaged in active service stretched upon a sofa with my wounded leg i had nothing else to do or rather nothing else which was so agreeable to me i wrote to her again and also to my mother neither did i forget that lord de versely had requested at parting that i should write to him i did so in a very respectful manner detailing what had occurred when we had been three weeks at curacao all our wounded as well as myself had so far recovered that there was no reason for the firefly not proceeding to jamaica the commanding officer lent an assistantsurgeon to the schooner i received my despatches took a grateful leave of mr fraser and the firefly was once more skimming over the water in three weeks we arrived at port royal and i took up my despatches happy to see you keene said the admiral hollo what makes you limp in that way have you hurt your leg yes sir replied i im not quite well yet but the despatches of captain c will explain all as no vessel had sailed from curacao the admiral had no idea of what had happened well then said he sit down on that sofa mr keene while i read the despatches i watched the admirals countenance and was delighted to witness the evident signs of satisfaction which he expressed as he read on excellent said he as he closed them keene you have done me a great favour the remonstrances of the merchants the badgering i have received from the admiralty by every packet relative to the depredations on our commerce by these vessels have been enough to make a saint swear now they are happily disposed of and i have chiefly to thank you for it captain c informs me that the brig is well adapted for his majestys service but that the schooner is an old vessel the admiral then left the room in a few minutes he returned with a paper in his hand which he laid upon the table and taking up a pen he signed it and presented it to me sayingcaptain keene i trust you will give me the pleasure of your company to dinner and as you are still very lame i think you had better make a signal for your servant and traps and take up your quarters at the penn till you are quite recovered perceiving that i was too much agitated to reply he continued i must leave you now then extending his hand he said allow me to be the first to wish you joy on your promotion which you have so well deserved he then went out of the room it really was so unexpected so little dreamt of this sudden promotion that i was confused i had hoped that by a continuance of good conduct i might in a year or two obtain it but that i should receive it after only one cruise in the schooner was beyond all my imagination i felt grateful and as soon as i was more composed i returned thanks to heaven and vowed eternal gratitude to the admiral i felt that i was a step nearer to lord de versely and i thought of the pleasure it would give my mother and minnie i had been alone about half an hour when the admiral returned i have just sent for an old messmate of yours captain keene who was severely wounded in your action with the dutch frigate he has now passed and lord de versely recommended him to me as a deserving young officera mr dott oh yes admiral he was my first acquaintance when i went to sea he has been to sea longer than i have but he lost a good deal of his time well i am going to give him an acting order for your brig i hope he is a good smart officer yes admiral he is a very good officer indeed replied i laughing will you oblige me by not telling him that i am to be his captain till after we have met ah some mischief i suppose but if we make captains of such boys as you we must expect that are your wounded men all going on well all sireven bob cross the boatswain whose head was half knocked off is quite well again he was lord de verselys coxswain sir and you were kind enough to give him his warrant i recollecta good man is he not so good sir that the only regret i have in leaving the schooner is that i cannot take him with me he is my righthand man and i owe much to him and it will be a sore blow to him as well as to me i see you want him made boatswain of your brigthats it i assure you admiral i should be most grateful if you would have that kindness i am always ready to promote a good man your recommending him and his severe wound are sufficient he shall be your boatswain keene you are very kind sir replied i i hope i shall do justice to your patronage ive no fear of that keene and i know that a man to work well should as far as he can choose his own tools mr dott is waiting now and as soon as he has his acting order i will send him in to you about ten minutes afterwards mr tommy dott made his appearance he extended his hand to me saying in a hawhaw way keene my dear fellow im glad to see you he certainly did look two or three inches taller for he walked almost on tiptoe glad to see you tommy said i well whats the news nothing i believe except what you have brought i hear you had a bit of a brush and got winged even so tommy replied i pointing to my wounded leg the admiral has kindly asked me to stay here until im better i dine with him today replied tommy but as for staying here i should think that rather a bore by the bye keene what sort of a craft is that diligente brig which the naiad and you took a very fine craft tommy sails as well as the firefly oh you of course swear by your own vessel and theres nothing like the schoonerthats natural enough now i must say i prefer something a little larger and therefore im not sorry that i have my commission for the new brig indeed tommy i wish you joy replied i thank ye keene replied tommy very dignified i wonder said he what sort of a skipper we shall have theres the first lieutenant of the naiad has a good chance i saw him a very sharp sort of gentleman and carries his head remarkably high but that wont do for me ill not allow any captain to play tricks in a ship that im aboard of i know the rules and regulations of the service as well as any one and that the captain shall see if he attempts to go beyond his tether now tommy replied i you know that although you talk so big if you had been appointed a lieutenant into a ship commanded by lord de versely you would have been as much afraid of him as a lieutenant as you used to be as a midshipman lord de versely replied tommy who felt the truth of what i said hes a peculiar sort of man take my word for it tommy youll find all captains peculiar to one point which is that they expect respectful behaviour and not cavilling from their officers and our service is so peculiar that it is absolutely necessary that the officers should set this example to the men yes that may be very well but who knows but the captain of the brig may be some young fellow who has seen no more service than myself perhaps not been to sea so long that is no reason that you should not obey his orders indeed if not experienced you ought to do all you can to support him well if he was to ask my advice indeed but he may not require your advice tommy he may prefer deciding for himself now the first lieutenant of the naiad is a great tartar and im certain if he is your captain that on the first word he would have you under an arrest theres an old saying tommy its folly to kick against tenpenny nails and that every officer does who kicks against his superior i can assure you tommy that if ever i am a captain my officers shall obey me implicitly i will have no cavilling at my orders i will always treat them as gentlemen and support their authority as they ought to support mine but captain of my own ship i would be and i suspect that it would go hard with any officer who ventured to dispute my rights well i dare say you will be a martinet or rather that you are one now as you command a schooner however as i never intend to sail with you thats nothing to me im sure from what has passed that you and i should have a row before we were a week on board for im not to be played with well tommy im very glad we have had this explanation for now we both know what to expect i am resolved to be captain you to resist my authority no no i dont say thati only say that i wont be played withi wont be trifled with tommy i will neither play nor trifle with you nor will you ever play or trifle with me we have done that as midshipmen in our new relative situations it is not to be thought of for a moment read this i handed him my appointment as commander of the diligente tommy cast his eyes over it and at once saw that his promotion did not prevent his getting into scrapes as usual you a commander you captain of the diligente why i came to sea before you i know you did tommy but although you have been in the service longer you have not seen quite so much service as i have at all events im now your captain i flatter myself i shall make a very tolerable one and what is more i have an idea that you will make a very good lieutenant as soon as the vanity with which you have been puffed up since your receiving your promotion will have settled down a little and that you will find it much pleasanter to be on good terms with your captain than to be eternally in hot water especially with one who you know is not a person to be played with tommy looked very confused he said nothing but kept his eyes on my commission which he still held in his hand i had no idea that tommy dotts being ignorant of my being captain of the brig would have occasioned such a conversation as this i only wished to amuse myself with him and surprise him at the last tommy perceived that he had made a mess of it and he stammered out some explanation as he returned me the commission and i replied the fact is dott you were merely cutting a caper upon your new promotion you never meant what you said it was all talk you always have been very obedient to proper authority since i have known you and i am sure that you always will so lets say no more about it i wish you joy upon your promotion and whats more im very glad that we are to sail together saying this i held out my hand which tommy took very readily and we then began to talk on other subjects chapter twenty seven i had written to cross informing him of my promotion and his being appointed to the diligente i had been a fortnight with the admiral when the naiad arrived with the prizes in company and my wound being now cured i took leave of the admiral and went down that i might superintend the fitting out of my new vessel as there were supernumerary men expected out of england the admiral at my suggestion allowed me to turn over the crew of the firefly to form the nucleus of my ships company and made up my complement from his own ship in two months i was ready for sea and most anxious to be off the admiral perceived my impatience but as there was no other vessel in the harbour he would not let me go until another arrived to be at his disposal in case of emergency the weariness of so long remaining in harbour was however a little relieved by a circumstance which took place and which probably will make my readers imagine that my propensity for playing tricks was not quite eradicated i lodged at a sort of hotel kept by a mulatto woman of the name of crissobella as the negroes termed her originally christobela she was of spanish blood by the fathers side and had come down from the havannah she was very portly very proud and dignified in her carriage and demanded as much attention from her lodgers as a lady would who had received us as her guests so that to gain and retain admittance into her hostelry it was necessary not only to pay a large bill but compliments to an equal amount she was very rich possessed numerous slaves and was perfectly independent of keeping an hotel i believed she preferred to have something for her slaves and herself to do and moreover probably she felt that if she retired she should be thought a person of no consequence whereas in her present position she received a great deal of attention one thing was certain that if those who lodged and boarded with her were very polite and on their return from any other place brought her small presents she was very indifferent as to their paying their bill nay to those who were her favourites her purse was open and a handful of doubloons was freely tendered if required the living was the same as at a boardinghouse breakfast was ready in the large hall by nine oclock and remained there until every one had come down at their own hour dinner was always ready at five oclock and then crissobella presided at the table she admitted civilians army officers and navy down to midshipmen but warrant officers and captains of merchant vessels were considered too low on the whole it was a very pleasant establishment as the private rooms were well furnished the slaves numerous and the attendance very good considering the price of most eatables on that island it could not be considered as very dear although the wines etcetera made up a formidable bill at the end of the month this kind of exclusiveness on the part of signora crissobella made the hotel quite the fashion and certainly it was by far the best in the town the inmates of it at this time were besides me lieut thomas dott and lieut william maxwell both appointed to the diligente three or four young civilians on mercantile speculations from new york three midshipmen who had been left behind on account of fever and who were promising fair by the life they were now leading to be very soon sent to the hospital again and one or two planters from the other islands the latter and i were very well behaved but the civilians were noisy drinking and smoking from morning till night the midshipmen were equally troublesome and as for the newmade lieutenants they were so authoritative and so disagreeable and gave themselves such consequential airs that mammy crissobella as the slaves called her was quite indignantshe had never had such a disorderly set in her house she complained to me and i spoke to them but that was of little use i had no power over the young merchants and the three midshipmen did not belong to my ship as for my lieutenants i could not say much at their giving themselves airs at an hotel where they paid for what they had it was not an offence that a captain could remonstrate upon i therefore merely said that mammy crissobella could not have them in her house if they did not leave off their treatment of the slaves and if they continued to give her so much trouble and annoyance at last our hostess would stand their behaviour no longer and ordered them all to leave the hotel sending in their bills but they all were unanimous in declaring that they would not go and it was not very easy to use force on such occasions i tried all i could to make matters right but my efforts were of little avail at last mammy crissobella became quite furious she did not make any alteration in the meals as that would be punishing all of us but she refused wine and spirits this they did not care for as they sent for it elsewhere by their own servants and there was nothing but noise and confusion all day along mammy often came to appeal to me and wished to go to the governor but i persuaded her not to do so and the mutiny continued and every day there was nothing but altercation at the meals so help me god gemmen you no gemmen you make wish me dead dat you do i tak obeah water some day i not live like this said mammy crissobella i take pepperpoti kill myself pray dont do that replied tommy dott we shall be put to the expense of mourning and i shall weep my eyes out continued one of the mercantile gentlemen weep your eyes outis that all i shall blow my brains out said another and i will lie down on your grave and die said the third dat all very well gemmen you say dat and laughbut i no slave pose i not get you out my house i ab vengeance now i tell you so look to that yes continued mammy crissobella striking the table with her fist i ab revenge i have been thinking said one of the mids what i shall do if mammy crissobella takes pepperpot i shall marry leila and keep the hotel mammy youll leave me the plate and furniture leila was the head female slavea very wellfeatured young mulatto girl and a great favourite as she was always laughing always in good humour and very kind and attentive at this remark leila laughed and mammy crissobella who observed her showing her white teeth you laugh you huzzy what you laugh for leila get awayget out of room i give you nice flogging byby you dare laughyou take side against me you nigger i must here observe that mammy crissobella had been closeted with me for some time previous to this scene and that leila and the two planters were in the secret this was of course unknown and the hostesss anger appeared now to be extended towards me and the two planters with whom she had been on good terms shortly afterwards mammy rose and left the room and then i spoke to the party and told them that they were driving the poor woman to extremities the planters agreed with me and we argued the case with them but the majority were of course against us and the young merchants appeared to be very much inclined to be personal with me at last i replied very well gentlemenas you please but as i happen to be well known both to the admiral and governor i give you fair warning that if this continues much longer i will report the affair i should be very sorry to do so but the house is now very uncomfortable and you have no right to remain when the landlady insists upon your going at this reply of mine the naval portion of the guests were silent but the civilians more insolent than before i did not wish to come to open war so i said nothing more and left the table after i was gone the refractory parties made more noise than ever just before the dinner hour on the following day mammy crissobella sent a circular round to the young men stating that she could not receive them at dinner they all laughed and went down to table as before the dinner was better than usual and they complimented mammy upon it mammy who had taken her seat with a scowl on her brow and had not spoken a word merely bowed her head in reply to their observations dinner was over and then mammy desired leila to bring her a goblet which was on the sideboard and a small white jug which was in the buffet she appeared much distressed and hesitated a good deal putting the goblet to her lips and then putting it down on the table without tasting it this conduct induced us all to look seriously at her at last she took it up sighed deeply and drank the whole off at a draught for a few seconds she held her hand over her forehead with her elbows resting on the table at last she looked up and said gemmen i got a little speech to makei very sorry dat i not drink your health but it no usedat why you see me drink i tell plenty time you make me madyou make me drink obeah watermake me kill myself now i ab done iti drink pison water just now in two hour i dead woman at this communication the truth of which appeared confirmed by the womans behaviour all the company started from their chairs gemmen i dare say you all very sorry you be more sorry byandby captain i beg your pardon mr w mr g the two planters i beg your pardon i not mean hurt you but could not help it now i tell all company all drink the pison waterbecause i not like die on the jibbit i drink de pison watergemmen your dinner all pison and you all pisoned yes all pisoned cried mammy crissobella at the highest pitch of her voice and rushing out of the room at this announcement i started from my chair and clasped my hands as if in agony i looked round menever did i witness such a variety of horror as was expressed in the different faces at the hotel the old planter mr d who sat next to me and who was in the secret as well as mr g laid his head on the table with a groan the lord have mercy on my sins exclaimed mr g mr lieutenant maxwell looked me in the face and then burst into tears mr lieutenant dott put his fingers down his throat and with three or four more getting rid of their dinner as fast as they could at last i sprang up to ring the bell no one answered i rang again more furiously at last a slave appeared wheres my servant not here sar wheres all the people of the house all with missy sar mammy crissobella die run down then to the beach and desire the surgeon of the brig to come up immediately yes sar replied the negro leaving the room oh i feel it nowhere exclaimed i putting my hand to my chest im suffocating and so do i replied one of the midshipmen weeping the girl leila now entered the room in tears mammy dead said she oh captain keene i very sorry for you you come with me i give you something i know how stop pison do you leila then give it me quick quick yes yes give it us quick i not stuff enough but i make more when i gib what i ab to captain keene you all stay still not move pose you move about make pison work i come back soon as i can leila then took my arm and led me tottering out of the room when i went to mammy crissobella and laughed till i cried but the punishment was not over after remaining about ten minutes looking at each other but neither speaking nor moving in pursuance of leilas direction with the utmost despair in their countenances they were gladdened by the return of leila with a large jug out of which she administered a glass of some compound or another to each of them i watched at the door and the eagerness with which they jostled and pushed each other to obtain the dose before the rest was very amusing and never did they swallow any liquor with so much avidity little imagining that instead of taking what was to cure them they were now taking what was to make them very sick but so it was and in a few minutes afterwards the scene of groaning crying screaming writhing with pain was quite awful after a time the slaves came in and carried them all to their respective beds leaving them to their own reflections and the violent effects of the drugs administered which left them no repose for that night and in a state of utter exhaustion on the following morning at daylight i went into mr dotts room with the surgeon to whom i had confided the secret tommy was a miserable object thank heaven here is one still alive said the surgeon to me oh captain keene said tommy im glad to see that you are so well but you had the remedy given you long before we had yes replied i it was given me in good time but i hope it was not too late with you i feel very bad replied tommy doctor do you think i shall live the doctor felt his pulse and looked very grave at last he said if you get over the next twelve hours i think you may how many are dead inquired tommy i dont know you are the first that i have visited its a shocking business ive been thinking that we were very wrong said tommy we ought not to have driven the poor woman to desperation if i do recover her death will be on my conscience im glad to hear you say that tommy replied i but the doctor says you must remain very quiet and therefore i shall leave you goodbye i will see you again this evening goodbye sir and i hope youll forgive me for not having been so respectful as i should have been yes yes tommy we have been friends too long for that mammy crissobellas dose had certainly put an end to all tommys spirit of resistance all the others who had been victims to our plot were kept in the dark as to the real facts and as soon as they were able to be moved paid their bills to leila and left the house chapter twenty eight on the third day tommy dott and mr maxwell went on board imagining that they had had a miraculous escape and the two old planters and i were left the only inmates of the house to welcome the resurrection of mammy crissobella who was again as busy as before she said to me massy keene i really under great obligation to you suppose you want two three hundred five hundred pounds very much at your service never mind pay back i replied that i did not want any money and was equally obliged to her but the affair had already made a great noise it was at first really supposed that mammy crissobella had poisoned them as well as herself and i was obliged to refute it or the authorities would have taken it up as the admiral sent down to make inquiries i went up to him and told him the whole story i was obliged to do the same to the governor and it was the occasion of great mirth all over the island and no small mortification to those who had been the sufferers mammy crissobella was complimented very much upon her successful stratagem to clear her house and she was quite in ecstasies at the renown that she obtained one day the admiral sent for me and saidkeene i can wait no longer the arrival of another vessel i must send you to england with despatches you must sail tomorrow morning as i was all ready i took my leave of the admiral who promised me every assistance if on his station and his good word with the admiralty and said that he would send down my despatches at daylight i went on board gave the necessary orders and then returned to the hotel to pack up my portmanteau and pay my bill but mammy crissobella would not hear of my paying anything and as i found that she was beginning to be seriously angry i gave up the point so i gave the old lady a kiss as a receiptinfull and another to leila as i slipped a couple of doubloons into her hand and went on board the next morning shortly after daylight the despatches were on board and the diligente was under all the sail she could carry on her way to england the diligente sailed as well as ever and we made a very quick passage i found my ships company to be very good and had no trouble with my officers tommy dott was very well behaved notwithstanding all his threats of what he would do it was therefore to be presumed that he was not very ill treated we were now fast approaching the end of our passage being about a hundred miles to the south west of the scilly islands with a light wind from the southward when in the middle watch bob cross who had the charge of it came down and reported firing in the south east i went up but although we heard the report of the guns we could not distinguish the flashes i altered our course to the direction and we waited till daylight should reveal what was going on before daybreak we could see the flashes and make out one vessel but not the other but when the sun rose the mystery was cleared off it was a french schooner privateer engaging a large english ship apparently an eastindiaman the ship was evidently a good deal cut up in her spars and rigging bob cross who was close to my side when i examined them with my glass said captain keene that rascally frenchman will be off as soon as he sees us if we hoist english colours but if you hoist french colours we may get down and pin him before he knows what we are i think you are right bob says i hoist french colours he will make sure of his prize then and we shall laugh at his disappointment as cross turned away to go aft i perceived a chuckle on his part which i did not understand as there was nothing particular to chuckle about i thought it was on account of the frenchmans disappointment when he found that we were not a friend as he might suppose hadnt we better fire a gun captain keene to attract their attention yes replied i it will look as if we really were frenchmen the gun was fired and we continued to stand towards them with a good breeze about seven oclock we were within two miles and then we observed the englishman haul down her colours and the schooner immediately went alongside and took possession i continued to run down and in half an hour was close to her calling up the boarders i laid the brig alongside the schooner as half her men were on board the indiaman they were taken by surprise and we gained possession with very trifling loss on our side much to the astonishment of the crew of the privateer as well as that of the indiaman the captain who was on deck informed me that they had engaged the schooner for nine hours and that he had some hopes of beating her off until he saw me come down under french colours upon which he felt that further resistance was vain i told him i was afraid the schooner would escape if i had not deceived him and complimented him upon his vigorous defence the schooner was a very fine vessel mounting fourteen guns and of three hundred tons burthen in fact she was quite as large as the diligente while we were handing the prisoners over to the brig and securing them i accepted the invitation of the captain of the indiaman to go into the cabin with him where i found a large party of passengers chiefly ladies who were very loud in their thanks for my rescue in another hour we were all ready i left a party on board the indiaman to repair damages and my surgeon to assist the wounded men and hauled off the brig and schooner the latter i gave into the charge of tommy dott and we all made sail as i was walking the quarterdeck delighted with my success cross who had the watch and was by my side said i think captain keene you did very right in hoisting french colours why yes cross replied i she is a very fast sailer that is evident and she might have escaped us thats not what i mean captain keene what then cross why sir i would not tell you why i wished you to hoist french colours at the time because i was afraid that if i did you would not have done so but my reason was that it would make a great difference in our prizemoney and i want some if you do not even then i could not imagine what cross meant for it never came into my head and i turned round and looked at him for an explanation why captain keene if we had hoisted english colours the schooner would have made sail and gone off and even if she had not done so the indiaman would have held out till we came down but as he hauled down his colours and was taken possession of by the enemy he now becomes a recapture and i expect the salvage of that indiaman will be of more value to us than two or three of such schooners that certainly did not enter my head when i hoisted the colours cross i must confess no sir that i saw it did not but it did mine its hardly fair cross quite fair sir replied bob the company is rich and can afford to pay and we want it in the first place and deserve it in the next at all events its not upon your conscience and that schooner is such a clipper that i really think we should have lost her if she had run for it besides as she is as strong as we are we might have lost a good many men before we took her thats very true bob replied i and satisfies me that i was right in what i did the wind had sprung up much fresher from the westward and we were now all three running with a fair wind and as it continued we did not put into plymouth but continued our course for portsmouth and on the third day at a very early hour in the morning anchored at spithead chapter twenty nine as it was too soon to present myself to the admiral i dressed ready to go on shore and hoisted the number of the diligente as given by the admiral at jamaica but as i expected it was not known to the guardship and there was much surmise among the early risers as to what might be the large ship schooner and brigofwar which had entered we had just finished the washing of the decks and i was standing aft with cross who had the morning watch when he observed to me captain keene we are now at anchor as near as possible to where the calliope was when you went adrift in the boat with poor peggy some difference between your situation now and then yes bob replied i i was thinking the same when i was dressing this morning and i was also thinking that you would be very anxious to go on shoreso you may take a boat as soon as you please i will order one to be given to you thankey sir i am a little anxious to see the poor girl and i think matters will go smooth now i hope so with all my heart let the gigs be all dressed and cleaned and the boat manned at six bells pass the word for them to get their breakfast as it was better that i should wait for the admirals getting up than that he should wait for me i was on shore and up at the office at halfpast seven oclock and found that the admiral was in his dressingroom the secretary was there and i delivered my orders and despatches with which he went up to the admiral in about a quarter of an hour he came down again with the portadmirals request that i would wait for him and stay to breakfast the secretary remained with me extracting all the west india intelligence that i could give him as soon as the admiral made his appearance he shook me warmly by the hand captain keene said he i wish you joy i see you are following up your career in the west indies we know you well enough by the despatches and i am glad to be personally acquainted with you this last business will i have no doubt give you the next step as soon as you have been a little longer as commander mr charles desire them to make the signal for the diligente and schooner to come into harbour the indiaman may of course do as he pleases now then for breakfast the admiral of course asked me as many questions as the secretary and ended as i rose to take my leave in requesting the pleasure of my company to dinner on that day as the reader may suppose i had every reason to be satisfied with my reception as soon as i had left the admirals office i put into the postoffice with my own hands my letter to my mother and one to lord de versely in the latter i told him of my good fortune and enclosed a copy of my despatch to the admiralty although the despatch was written modestly still the circumstances in themselvesmy having recaptured an indiaman and carried by boarding a vessel of equal force to my own and superior in menhad a very good appearance and i certainly obtained greater credit than it really deserved it was not at all necessary to say that i hoisted french colours and therefore took the schooner unawares or that at the time most of her men were on board of the indiaman the great art in this world is to know where to leave off and in nothing more than when people take the pen in their hands as soon as i had finished my correspondencefor i wrote a few lines to mrs bridgeman at chatham and a postscript to my mothers letteri went down to the saluting battery when i found that the two vessels were just entering the harbour i went up and reported it at the admirals office and the admiral went on board of both vessels to examine them himself and he ordered a dockyard survey they were both pronounced fit for his majestys service with the necessary dockyard alterations the crew of the diligente were turned over to a hulk preparatory to unrigging and clearing her out for dock as soon as i left the admirals house i sat down at the george hotel where i had taken up my quarters and wrote a long letter to minnie vanderwelt cross called upon me the next morning i saw by his countenance that he had good news to tell me he had found his ladylove as constant as he could wish and having explained to the blind old smuggler that he had been offered and accepted the situation of boatswain in his majestys service during the time that he was in the west indies he had received his approbation of his conduct and a warm welcome to the house whenever he could come on shore i have not put the question to the old chap yet captain keene said he but i think i will very soon dont be in too great a hurry bob replied i give the old fellow a little more baccy and ask his advice as to what you are to do with your prizemoney you must also talk a little about your halfpay and your widows pension thats very good advice captain keene replied cross mercy on us how things are changed it appears but the other day that i was leading you down to this very hotel to ship you into the service and you was asking my advice and i was giving it to you and now i am asking your advice and taking it you have shot ahead in every way sir thats sartain you looked up to me then now i look up to you i laughed at crosss observation which was too true and then we went into the dockyard and were very busy during the remainder of the day the following morning i received an answer from lord de versely couched in most friendly terms he complimented me on my success and the high character i had gained for myself during so short a career and added that he should be happy to see me as soon as i could come to london and would himself introduce me to the first lord of the admiralty he advised me to request leave of absence which would be immediately granted and concluded his letter your sincere friend and wellwisher de versely as soon as i had laid down the letter i said to myself i was right the true way to create an interest in a man like lord de versely is to make him proud of you i have done well as yeti will try to do more but how long will this success continue must i not expect reverses may not some reaction take place and have i not in some degree deserved it yes i have used deceit in persuading him of my mothers death i began now to think that that was a false step which if ever discovered might recoil upon me i remained a long while in deep thought i tried to extenuate my conduct in this particular but i could not and to rid myself of melancholy feelings which i could not overcome i wrote a letter requesting leave of absence for a fortnight and took it myself to the admirals office this depression of spirits remained with me during the time that i remained at portsmouth when having obtained leave i set off for london and on arrival put up at a fashionable hotel in albermarle street chapter thirty the next morning i called at lord de verselys and sent up my card i was immediately ushered up and found myself in his presence lord de versely rose from his sofa and took my hand keene i am very glad to see you i am proud that an eleve of mine should have done me so much credit you have gained all your rank in the service by your own merit and exertions not quite all my lord replied i yes all for you are certain of your next stepthey cannot well refuse it to you they will not refuse your lordship i have no doubt replied i sit down keene we will have a little conversation and then we will go to the admiralty his lordship then asked me many questions relative to what had passed and i entered into more detail than i had done in my letters after an hours conversation carried on by him in so friendlyi may almost say affectionatea style as to make my heart bound with delight the carriage was announced and accompanied his lordship down to the admiralty his lordship sent up his card and was requested immediately to go upstairs he desired me to follow him and as soon as we were in the presence of the first lord and he and lord de versely had shaken hands lord de versely said allow me to introduce to you captain keene whose name at least you have often heard of lately i have brought him with me because he is a follower of mine he entered the service under my protection and continued with me until his conduct gave him his promotion i have taken this opportunity of introducing him to assure your lordship that during the whole time that he served with me as midshipman his gallantry was quite as conspicuous as it has been since the first lord took me by the hand and complimented me on my conduct captain keene has strong claims my lord what can we do now for him i trust you will acknowledge that captain keene has earned his post rank my lord replied lord de versely and i shall take it as a particular favour to myself if your lordship would appoint him to a frigate and give him an opportunity of doing credit to your lordships patronage i think i may promise you both replied the first lord but when we meet in the house tonight i will let you know what i can do after a few minutes conversation lord de versely rose and we left the room as soon as we were in the carriage his lordship said keene you may depend upon it i shall have good news to tell you tomorrow so call upon me about two oclock i dine out today with the premier but tomorrow you must dine with me i took leave of his lordship as soon as the carriage stopped and as i wished to appoint an agent which i had not yet done i had begged his lordship to recommend me one he gave me the address of his own and i went there accordingly having made the necessary arrangements i then employed the remainder of the day in fitting myself out in a somewhat more fashionable style than portsmouth tailors were equal to the next morning i sat down to write to my mother but somehow or another i could not make up my mind to address her i had thought of it over and over and had made up my mind that in future i would always correspond with my grandmother and i now determined to write to her explaining that such was my intention in future and requesting that all answers should be also from my grandmother i commenced my letter however with informing her that i had since i had last written obtained leave of absence and was now in london i stated the kindness shown me in every way by lord de versely and how grateful i was to him this continued down to the bottom of the first page and then i said what would i not give to bear the name of one i so much love and respect oh that i was a delmar i was just about to turn over the leaf and continue when the waiter tapped at the door and informed me that the tailor was come to try on the clothes which i had ordered i went into the bedroom which opened into the sittingroom and was busy with the foreman who turned me round and round marking alterations with a piece of chalk when the waiter tapped at the bedroom door and said lord de versely was in the sittingroom i took off the coat which was fitting as fast as i could that i might not keep his lordship waiting and put on my own desiring the man to wait my return i opened the door and found his lordship on the sofa and then for the first time when i again saw it recollected that i had left the letter on the table the very sight of it took away my breath i coloured up as i approached his lordship i had quite forgotten that i had addressed my grandmother i stammered out this is an honour my lord i came to wish you joy of your promotion and appointment to a fine frigate keene said lord de versely i have just received this from the admiralty and as i have business unexpectedly come to hand i thought i would be the bearer myself of the good news i leave you the letter and shall of course see you to dinner many thanks my lord replied i i am indeed grateful i believe you are keene replied his lordship by the bye you leave your letters so exposed that one cannot help seem them i see you are writing to your grandmother i hope the old lady is well my grandmother oh what a relief to my mind it was when i then recollected that it was to my grandmother that i had written i replied that she was very well when i last heard from her if i can be of any use in arranging your money affairs keene let me know i thank you my lord but i found that my agent perfectly understands business replied i i will not trouble your lordship who has so many important affairs to attend to very good replied he then now ill leave you to read what i have given you and i shall expect you at eight goodbye his lordship again shook me warmly by the hand and left me i was quite giddy with the reaction produced upon my feelings when his lordship left the room i dropped down on the sofa i forgot the letter in my hand and its contents and the tailor in the next room all i thought of was the danger i had escaped and how fortunate i was in not having addressed the letter to my mother as i had at first intended the agony which i felt was very great and as i remained with my hands covering my eyes i made a vow that nothing should induce me ever to use deceit again i then read over the letter there was nothing but gratitude to lord de versely and a wish that i had been born a delmar well if his lordship had run his eyes over it there was nothing to hurt me in his opinion on the contrary it proved that i was grateful and i then recollected that when i expressed my gratitude he said he believed it as for my saying that i wished my name was delmar it was nothing and it let him know what my wishes were on the whole i had great cause for congratulation i was here interrupted by the tailor who put his head out of the bedroom door i went to him and he finished his work and promised me that i should have a complete suit at halfpast seven oclock in the evening in time for dinner i then returned to the sittingroom and opened the letter which lord de versely had put into my hands it was from the first lord acquainting him that i might call at the admiralty the next day as my postcaptains commission was signed and i was appointed to a thirtytwo gun frigate which would be launched in two or three months well then thought i here i am at twentythree a postcaptain in his majestys service and commanding a frigate surely i have much to be thankful for i felt that i had and i was grateful to heaven for my good fortune now i had but one more wish in the world and that was instead of being captain keene to be captain delmar the reader may say whats in a name true but such was my ambition my darling wish and it is ardent longing for anything the ardour of pursuit which increases the value of the object so much above its real value the politician who has been manoeuvring all his life does not perhaps feel more pleasure in grasping the coronet which he has been in pursuit of than the urchin does when he first possesses himself of a nest which he has been watching for weeks this would indeed be a dreary world if we had not some excitement some stimulus to lead us on which occupies our thoughts and gives us fresh courage when disheartened by the knavery and meanness and selfishness of those who surround us how sad is the analysis of human naturewhat contradictions what extremes how many really brave men have i fallen in with stooping to every meanness for patronage court favour or gain slandering those whose reputation they feared and even descending to falsehood to obtain their ends how many men with splendid talents but with little souls up to the present i had run a career of prosperous success i had risen to a high position without interfering or being interfered with by others but now i had become of sufficient consequence to be envied now i had soon to experience that as you continue to advance in the world so do you continue to increase the number of your enemies to be exposed to the shafts of slander to be foiled by treachery cunning and malevolence but i must not anticipate i remained in london till my leave was expired and then went down to portsmouth to pay off the brig which had been ordered into dock to be refitted for his majestys service chapter thirty one the circe thirtytwo to which i had been appointed was a small but very beautiful frigate and as far as i could judge by her build as she lay on the stocks had every requisite for sailing well when i took my leave of lord de versely he told me that he should come down on the first of the following month september to madeline hall where his aunt miss de versely was still flourishing at a green old age here is a letter of introduction to her keene said he as she has not seen you since you were a few months old and therefore it is not very likely that she would recognise you take my advice and make yourself as agreeable to the old lady as you can you will find madeline hall a very pleasant place when you are tired of the dockyard and the smell of pitch and tar i thanked his lordship and we parted with much more cordiality shown by him than i had experienced i hardly need say that the first person who came to congratulate me on my arrival at portsmouth was my old friend an adviser bob cross well captain keene said bob as i shook him warmly by the hand im delighted at your success and i know you will not be sorry to hear that i am getting on as well as i could wish in my small way jane and i are to be married in a few days and i hope you will honour me by being present at the wedding that i will bob with pleasure replied i let me hear all that has taken place why sir its told in a few words i took your advice and brought the old gentleman presents and i sat with him and heard all his old stories at least fifty times over and laughed at his jokes as regularly the last time as the first and he told jane and her mother that i was a very pleasant sensible and amusing young manalthough he had all the talk and i had none the fact is sir it was he who first brought up the subject of my splicing his niece that is to say he hinted how he should like to see her well settled and that if she married according to his wishes he would leave her all he had well sir it was the opinion of jane and her mother that as he was a whimsical changeable old chap it would be right for her to refuse me at first and so she did very much to the old mans annoyance who then set his mind upon it and swore that if she did not marry me he would not leave her a farthing after a few days of quarrelling jane gave in and the old chap swears that we shall be married immediately and that he will give us half his property down at once strike the iron while its hot bob replied i is the day fixed not exactly sir but we are to be put up in church next sunday and it takes three sundays i hope you wont part with me sir continued bob the diligente will be paid off on tuesday they say and if you could get me appointed to the circe why cross you are thinking of going to sea again even before you are married i should advise you not to be in such a hurry you must not displease the old gentleman besides you must not leave a young wife so soon thats very true captain keene but i dont think i should be comfortable if i knew you were afloat without me i suppose you think that i cannot take care of myself yes i do sir but still i know that i should fret and sir it will be four months at least before the circe is ready for sea and i may just as well be appointed to her and i can decide whether i do go to sea or not when the time comes well cross i will certainly apply for you but if you take my advice you will give up the sea altogether and live on shore i have nothing to do sir yes you have you have to cherish your wife and look after the old gentleman well he is rather shakey they say sir the old woman is often called out to him at nights well cross i will do as you wish and time will decide how you are to act i am going over to southampton for a few days perhaps and will take care to be back by the wedding bythebye have you heard anything about prizemoney yes sir its payable for the diligente and schooner and all our recaptures in the west indies when we were in the firefly the dutch frigate has been for distribution some time but as i was only petty officer then it wont come to much well i can tell you that the government have taken the schooner which we captured in the chops of the channel and the east india company have given us salvage for the ship my agent has received already pounds on my account which i have ordered to be purchased into the funds as there were so few warrant officers your share will not be less than pounds perhaps more as you said the salvage of the indiaman has proved more valuable to us than all the rest of our prizemoney put together well captain keene if my prizemoney comes to as much as that i think i shall be nearly as well off as my little jane will be will you have the kindness to let your agent put it by for me in the same way that you have done yours yes cross i will see to it immediately i shall write to him tomorrow or the day after after a little conversation cross took leave the next day i took posthorses and went over to madeline hall having two or three days before received a note from the honourable miss delmar saying how glad she should be to see me as a friend and shipmate of her nephew lord de versely so that it appeared the old lady had been written to by lord de versely respecting me i arrived early in the afternoon and the postchaise drove up the avenue of magnificent chestnuttrees which led to the mansion chapter thirty two i must say that i was very much excited i was now arriving at the site of my birth and it brought to my mind the details given me by my poor mother when finding she could no longer conceal the truth from me she entered into a narrative to extenuate her conduct pointing out her temptations and how fatal to her were opportunity and seclusion her form was before me with the tears running down her cheeks as she made her humiliating confession to her own son and i could not help exclaiming as i cast my eye upon the beautiful grounds my poor mother the chaise stopped and the boys dismounted and rang the bell in a minute three or four servants made their appearance and on inquiring i found that the honourable miss delmar was at home and visible colonel delmar i presume sir said the old butler no replied icaptain keene the butler looked me full in the face and earnestly and then as if recollecting himself he bowed and went on captain keene madam said he as he introduced me into a large room at the end of which sat a venerablelooking old lady very busy with her knitting needle and another almost equally ancient sitting on a low stool beside her as i advanced the old lady made me a bow as she remained in in her chair and looked at me through her spectacles she certainly was the beauideal of old age her hair which was like silver was parted in braid and was to be seen just peeping from under her cap and pinners she was dressed in black silk with a snowwhite apron and handkerchief and there was an air of dignity and refinement about her which made you feel reverence for her at first sight as i approached to take the chair offered to me the other person who appeared to be a sort of attendant was shuffling her feet to rise but as soon as mrs delmar had said you are welcome captain keene sit still she continued my child there is no occasion to go away i could scarcely help smiling at the old lady calling a woman of past sixty if not even further advanced a child but the fact was that phillis had been her attendant as ladys maid for many years and subsequently promoted to the position of humble companion as for miss delmar as i afterwards found out from her own lips she was upwards of eightyseven years old but still in perfect good health and in full possession of all her faculties phillis therefore was much younger and as the old lady had had her in her employ ever since she was twentytwo it was not surprising that she continued to address her as she had done for so many years as a young person compared to herself indeed i have no doubt but that the old lady following up her association of former days and forgetting the halfcentury that had intervened did consider her as a mere child the old lady was very chatty and very polite and as our conversation naturally turned on lord de versely of whom i spoke in terms of admiration and gratitude i had soon established myself in her good graces indeed as i subsequently discovered her nephew was the great object of her affections his younger brother had neglected her and was never mentioned except when she regretted that lord de versely had no children and that the title would descend to his brother she requested me to stay for dinner which i did not refuse and before dinner was over i had made great progress in the old ladys esteem as when dinner was announced her companion disappeared we were then alone she asked me many questions relative to lord de versely and what had occurred during the time that i was serving with him and this was a subject on which i could be eloquent i narrated several of our adventures particularly the action with the dutch frigate and other particulars in which i could honestly do credit to his lordship and i often referred to his kindness for me well captain keene my nephew has often spoken to me about you and now you have done him credit in proving that he had made you a good officer and i have heard how much you have distinguished yourself since you have left him or rather he left me madam replied i when he was summoned to the house of peers very true replied the old lady i suppose you know that you were born in this house captain keene i have been told so madam yes i have no doubt your poor mother thats gone must have told you i recollect hera very clever active and pretty young woman here the old lady sighed and i held you in my arms captain keene when you were only a few days old you did me great honour madam replied i here the conversation took another channel which i was not sorry for after tea i rose to take my leave and then i received an invitation from the old lady to come and spend some time at madeline hall and to come a few days before the first of september that i might join the shooting party i expect my nephew lord de versely said she and there is colonel delmar of the rifles a cousin of lord de versely also coming and one or two others indeed i expect the colonel every day he is a very pleasant and gentlemanlike man i accepted the invitation with pleasure and then took my leave the chaise drove off and i was soon in a deep reverie i called to mind all my mother had told me and i longed to return to the hall and visit those scenes which had been referred to in my mothers narrative and more than that i wished to meet lord de versely on the spot which could not fail to call to his mind my mother then young fond and confiding how much she had sacrificed for him how true she had proved to his interests and how sacred the debt of obligation which he could only repay by his conduct towards me on my return to portsmouth i found that orders had come down for the paying off the diligente and recommissioning her immediately as the men would now be free until again caught by the impress which would not be long i turned up the ships company and asked how many of them would enter for the circe i pointed out to them that they would be impressed for other vessels before long but that i could give them each three months of absence upon which they would not be molested and that by three months all their money would be gone and if it were gone before that time the guardship would receive them when they had had enough of the shore by this method i proposed to myself to obtain the foundation of a good ships company i was not disappointed every man i wished to take with me volunteered and i wrote leave of absence tickets for three months for them all as belonging to the circe reporting what i had done to the admiralty the brig was then paid off and the next day recommissioned by a captain rose with whom i had some slight acquaintance as i was now my own master againfor although appointed to the circe i had nothing but my pennant to look ati thought that by way of a little change i would pass a few days at the isle of wight for this was the yachting season and i had made the acquaintance of many of the gentlemen who belonged to the club that i had no difficulty in getting into society may easily be imagined a postcaptains commission in his majestys navy is a certain passport with all liberal and really aristocratical people and as it is well known that a person who has not had the advantage of interest and family connections to advance in the service must have gained his promotion by his own merits his rank is sufficient to establish his claims to family connections or personal merit either of which is almost universally acknowledged i say almost universally because strange to say for a succession of reigns the navy never has been popular at court in that region where merit of any kind is seldom permitted to intrude the navy have generally been at a discount each succession of the house of hanover has been hailed by its members with fresh hopes of a change in their favour which hopes have ended in disappointment but perhaps it is as well the navy require no prophet to tell it in the literal sense of the word that one cannot touch pitch without being defiled but there is a moral pitch the meanness the dishonesty and servility of court with which i trust our noble service will never be contaminated i have however somewhat wandered from my subject which was brought up in consequence of a gentleman who had paid me every attention at a large club down at cowes to which i had been invited inquiring of me across the table if i were connected with the keenes of my reply was ready i did not think that i was my father had died a young man in the east indies i knew that he was of scotch descent which he was but i was too young to know anything about his connections whom he had quitted at an early age since that i had been educated and brought forward by lord de versely who had since the death of my mother treated me as if i were his own son this was said openly and being strictly true of course without hesitation on my part it was quite sufficient i had noble patronage and it was therefore to be presumed that i was somebody or that patronage would not have been extended i mention this because it was the only time that i was ever questioned about my family it was therefore to be presumed that my reply was considered satisfactory i accepted an invitation on board of the yacht and sailed about for several days very much amused and flattered by the attention shown to me by the noble commodore and others one day i fell in with an old acquaintance a small vessel of about twenty tons cutterrigged came down under the stern of the commodores yacht it was then very smooth water very light wind and moreover very hot weather and one of the squadron who was standing by me on the taffrail said keene do look at this craft coming down under our sterntheres quite a curiosity in it it is a yacht belonging to an irish major oflinn as he calls himself why the o i dont know but hes a good fellow and very amusing there he is abaft he has the largest whiskers you ever saw but it is not of him i would speak wait a little and as soon as the square sail is out of the way you will see his wife such a whapper i believe she weighs more than the rhinoceros did which was at postdown fair as the vessel neared i did behold a most enormous woman in a skyblue silk dress and a large skyblue parasol over her head the bonnet having been taken off i presume on account of the heat she is a monster replied i the major was a bold man i think i have seen the face before i am told that she was the daughter of a purser and had a lot of money continued my friend i recollected then and i replied yes i know now her name was culpepper that was the name replied he i recollect now the reader may probably recollect miss medea who knew so well how to put that and that together and her mother who i presumed had long ago been suffocated in her own fat a fate which i thought that mrs oflinn would meet with as well as her mother the lady did not recognise me which i was not sorry for i certainly should have cut her dead i walked forward and my thoughts reverted to the time when my mother first brought me down to embark and i was taken care of by bob cross this recollection of bob cross reminded me that i had promised to be at his wedding and that it was to take place on the following day which i had quite forgotten so that mrs oflinn did me a good turn at last as i should have neglected my promise if she had not made her appearance sailing along like an elephantine cleopatra chapter thirty three i had not called upon old waghorn the uncle of jane as i was fearful that he might recognise the pretended agent of former days with the now captain of the circe the blind are very acute in all their other sensesa species of reparation made by nature by way of indemnification for the severe loss which they have sustained as i grew older i grew wiser and i could not help remarking that the acts of deceit which as a midshipman i thought not only very justifiable but good fun were invariably attended with unpleasant results even in this trifle my heart misgave me whether on my appearance at the wedding i might not i be recognised and be the cause of creating a breach by raising suspicions on the part of the blind man which might prevent the wedding and i had stated my fears to bob cross well captain keene it was all done with good intentions and i do not think that there is much fear its a long while back and you were not so much of a man as you are now they do say that cheating never thrives and i believe that it seldom does in the long run jane will be much disappointed if you do not come there is no help for it bob i must disguise my voice i must cheat a little now to hide the first cheat thats always the case in this world i dont call it cheating sir my ideas are that if you cheat to get advantage for yourself then you do cheat but when you do so to help another theres no great cheating in the case i cannot agree with you bob but let us say no more about it i will be with you at ten oclock which you say is the hour that you go to church this conversation took place on the morning of the wedding about eight oclock i dressed and breakfasted and then took a wherry over to gosport and in half an hour was at the house which was full of people with white favours and in such a bustle that it reminded me of a hive of bees just previous to a swarm heres the captain come sir said bob who had received me for the bride was still in her room with her mother happy to see you sir i wish you joy mr waghorn replied i taking his hand youre captain keene then whose letters to the admiralty jane has so often read to me in the newspapers where have we met ive heard that voice before indeed sir replied i rather confused yes i have i always know a voice again let me seewhy captain you were here with cross the first time i ever heard himyou were an agent and now youre a captain continued the old man looking very grave hush sir replied i pray dont speak so loud do you recollect what i came about do you suppose that when i was a party to the escape of a prisoner i could let you know being a perfect stranger that i was an officer in his majestys service very true replied the old man i cannot blame you for that but was cross an officer in the service at that time no sir he was not replied i he was appointed boatswain to my ship by the admiral in the west indies im glad to hear that i thought cross might have deceived me also every one tries to cheat a blind manand the blind are suspicious im glad that cross did not deceive me or i would have seen my niece in her coffin beforebut say no more about it you could not do otherwise alls right sir and im very glad to see you and to have the honour of your company sit down sir i beg by the bye captain keene have you heard of the girl since my dear sir replied i glad to give him my confidence there are no secrets between us now it was no girl but the son of the captain of the dutch frigate and an officer whose escape you assisted in i dont wonder then at your not making yourself known replied the old man why if i had known it had been an officer i never would have had a hand in the jobbut a poor girl it was mere charity to assist her and i thought i was acting the part of a christian poor blind sinner that i am you did a kind act sir and heaven will reward you we are sad wicked creatures captain keene replied he i wish this day was over and my poor jane made happy and then i should have nothing to do but to read my bible and prepare for being called away its never too soon depend upon it sir the appearance of the bride with her bridesmaids put an end to our conversation which i was not sorry for the order of march was arranged and we started off for the church on foot making a very long and very gay procession in half an hour it was all over and we returned i then had an opportunity of telling cross what had passed between me and old waghorn it was touch and go sir thats sartin replied bob for if the old gentleman had not been satisfied he is so obstinate that the match would have been broken off at the church door well sir i always said that you were the best to get out of a scrape that i ever knew when you were a middy and you dont appear to have lost the talent it was well managed perhaps so bob but in future i do not intend to get into them which will be managing better still i then left cross and went to talk to jane who certainly looked very handsome the tables for dinner were laid out in the garden for it was a beautiful warm autumnal day we sat down about twenty and a merrier party i never was at old waghorn was the only one who got tipsy on the occasion and it was very ridiculous to hear him quoting scraps of scripture in extenuation and then calling himself a poor blind old sinner it was not till eight oclock in the evening that the party broke up and i had then some difficulty to persuade some to go away as for the old man he had been put to bed an hour before i staid a few minutes after all were gone and then kissing jane and shaking hands with bob i went back to portsmouth chapter thirty four as soon as i was at home again the events of the day from association of ideas naturally brought minnie vanderwelt into my head and i recollected that i had not written to her since my promotion and appointment to the circe i therefore sat down and indited a long letter ending with expressing my regret at not having received an answer from the many i had written especially the last which informed them of my arrival in england and gave them the knowledge where to address me i also requested to know what had become of young vangilt whose escape i had contrived having enclosed that letter to the agent and begged him to have it forwarded to hamburg i went to bed and after the excitement of the day had a variety of dreams in which minnies form was continually making its appearance the following morning brought me a long letter from my aunt mrs bridgeman very lively and very amusing the only news in it was the marriage of lieutenant flat to a tavernkeepers daughter which had given great offence to the marine corps as she was said to be rather light of carriage she begged me very much to pay them a visit but that was not all to my wishes i most candidly confess my pride revolted at it i even doubt if i would have fitted out a ship at chatham where people could point their finger at me and saythat postcaptains father was a marine in those barracks another letter from lord de versely announcing his arrival at madeline hall and requesting me to join him as soon as possible was infinitely more to my taste and i resolved to start next day which i did i was very cordially received by his lordship and very graciously by the old lady who expressed a hope that i would now make a long visit about an hour after i had arrived colonel delmar made his appearance he was a cousin of lord de verselys but i certainly should not from his appearance have supposed him to be a delmar for he was short roundshouldered and with a fat rubicund face apparently about forty years of age i observed after our introduction that his eyes were very often directed towards me but his manner was courteous and although his appearance at first sight was not prepossessing his conversation was very agreeable and he was very gentlemanlike before dinner was over i felt a great liking for him as the first of september had not yet arrived the birds had still two days of peace and quietness leading their broods through the stubbles and pointing out to them the corn which had spilled on the ground for their food that the old birds had some idea of a gun it is to be supposed from their having escaped the season before but the young coveys had still that pleasure to come in two days more they were to be initiated into the astonishing fact that fast as feathers could fly lead could fly faster and overtake them the two or three days before the shooting season begins are invariably very tedious in the country and i passed my morning chiefly in roaming through the park and pleasure grounds and i hardly need say that during those rambles my thoughts were chiefly occupied with the intimacy which had taken place between my mother and lord de versely on the third morning after my arrival i had been strolling for more than two hours when i came to a very retired sort of gothic cell formed of the distended limbs of an old oak intermixed with stones and grass it faced towards the park and was built up on the green lawn amidst clumps of laurel and other evergreens i threw myself on the benches it was just the place for a man to select for a rendezvous just the secret spot where a maiden could listen without trembling at intruders and it struck me that this must have been the trysting place of my parents for an hour i remained there castlebuilding for the future and musing on the past when i heard a voice close to me on the other side of the cell the back of which was turned towards the hall i knew the voice to be that of the old lady who it appears had as usual come out in her garden chair and was dragged by her attendant phillis the wheels had made no noise on the velvet lawn and until roused by her voice i was not aware of their approach nonsense phillis why child what should you know about such things said the old lady if you please to recollect maam replied phillis who certainly was old enough to recollect all the passages in a womans life i was your maid at the time that it happened and i was constantly in company with bella mason she was very respectful towards you but you did not know what her temper was there never was so proud a young woman or who considered herself of such consequence as she didso much so that she treated even mr jonas the butler and mrs short the housekeeper with disdain well well i know that she was proud her mother was always a proud woman mr mason in his younger days held property of his own at least his father did but he ran through it revelling and horseracing but what does that prove i only say madam what was said at the time by everybody that bella mason never would have married that marine whom she looked upon with contempt although he certainly was a goodlooking young man if she had not been obliged to do so but why obliged phillis to conceal her shame madam for if you recollect the child was born three months after marriage i recollect that very well replied miss delmar it was a sad thing and as my nephew said i ought to have looked out sharper after bella than i did and not have allowed her to be so much in company with that marine that marine maam he was innocent enough bella was not likely to listen to one like him who can you mean then phillis why lord de versely maam to be sure everybody in the hall was sure the child was his he and bella were for ever together for months before her marriage phillis phillis you dont know what you are sayingits impossible indeed i recollect talking the matter over with lord de versely who was then captain delmar and he was more shocked at the impropriety than even i was and offered to give the marine a good whipping that may be madam but still captain delmar was the father of that boy for if you recollect old mrs mason came to the hall and went away almost immediately well what of that she was displeased no doubt yes indeed she was madam but she had a private meeting with captain delmar and mrs short the housekeeper overheard what passed and i understand that the captain did not deny it to her one thing is certain that mrs mason as she was going away in her rage made use of language about captain delmar which otherwise she never would have dared and then madam only look at captain keenewhy he is the very image of his lordship he is very like him certainly said the old lady musing and then madam do you think his lordship would have brought the boy up in the service and made him a postcaptain if he had been the son of a marine and then madam see how fond his lordship is of him why he dotes upon him and would he ask the son of his own servant to come down to madeline hall as fit company for you no so madam depend upon it captain keene is a delmar and no wonder his lordship is so fond of him madam for he is his only child and i dare say his lordship would give him his right hand if he could leave him the barony and estates instead of them going away as they will to his younger brothers children well well phillis it may be so i dont know what to think of it i shall speak to lord de versely about it for if captain keene is a delmar he must be looked to he is a delmar although with the bar sinister i feel a little cold phillis so drag me to the terrace that i may get a little sunshine phillis i thank thee said i to myself as the chair wheeled away your love of chatting may be useful to me perhaps his lordship may now acknowledge my birth to his aunt and good may come of it i waited till the chair wheels were heard on the gravel walk and then quitted the grotto and bent my steps away from the hall that i might commune with my own thoughts without chance of interruption i had quitted the park and was now pacing over several fields one after another walking as if i had some important business in hand when in fact my legs were only trying to keep pace with my thoughts when i vaulted over a gate and found myself in a narrow lane sunk deep between two hedges indifferent as to the path i took i turned to the right and continued on my way walking as fast as before when i heard the low bellowing of an animal this induced me to raise my eyes and i witnessed a curious scene in front of me which i will narrate in the next chapter chapter thirty five as i said before the lane was very narrow not admitting more than one vehicle to go along it and was sunk between the hedges on each side so as to render it not very easy to climb up the bank the parties who presented themselves were first a cow with her tail turned towards me evidently a wicked one as she was pawing and bellowing in a low tone and advancing towards two people who were the object of her attack one was a very little man dressed in black the other a stout burly young fellow in a shootingjacket but what amused me most was that the stout young fellow instead of being in the advance to defend one so much smaller than himself not only kept behind the little man but actually now and then held him by the shoulders before his own person as a shield to ward off the expected attack of the vicious animal it is true that the little personage expostulated and spoke several times in a tone of command to his companion but his words were unheeded and the cow advanced and they retreated in the order which i have described i quickened my pace so as to gain rapidly upon them and was soon but a few yards from the animal i had no stick or weapon of any kind but still i knew how to manage unruly cattle as sailors do when they were sent on board ship alive indeed i had more than once put it into practice myself and although with a bull it was not a very easy matter with a cow i felt certain that i could effect my purpose the animal appeared now determined to come to close quarters and i therefore approached her until i was about a couple of feet from her flank all ready for a spring in case she should see me and turn round but she was too busy with the parties in front of her and at last she made a run the stout young man pushed the little man towards the cow and then ran for it the little one in his attempt to recoil fell on the turf and the cow made at him i sprang forward and catching the horn of the animal farthest from me in my right hand at the same time put my left knee on the horn nearest to me threw all my weight upon it so as to turn the animals nose up in the air and seizing it by the nostrils with the other hand i held her head in that position which of course rendered the animal harmless in that position the cow went over the prostrate man without doing him any injury plunging and capering so as to extricate herself from my weight i remained clinging to her for about ten yards further when i perceived the stout fellow ahead who hallooed out hold her tight hold her tight but that i would no longer do as it was fatiguing work so as a punishment for his cowardice i let go the animal springing clear off and behind it the cow galloping away as fast as she could down the lane and the fellow screaming and running before as fast as he could having thus rid myself of the cow and the coward i turned back to where the other party had been left on the ground and found him standing up and looking at what was passing youre not hurt sir said i no thanks to you but no thanks to that rascally clerk of mine who wanted to shove me on the cows horns to save himself he has a run for it now at all events replied i laughing and i let the cow loose on purpose for if i had held on and used all my strength i could have brought her down on her side and kept her down oh theres a break in the bank and he has climbed up it so he is safe for a good fright continued i and now we had better get away ourselves for the animal may come back and although one can pin her in that way from behind it is not to be done when she comes stem on to you well sir i have heard of taking the bull by the horns as not being a very wise thing but taking a cow by them has probably saved my life i thank you we manage them that way on board ship replied i laughing you are a sailor then sir replied the little man probably i have the pleasure of addressing captain keene that is my name replied i but here is the cow coming back and the sooner we get to the gate the better im not ashamed to run for it and i suppose you are not either so saying i took to my heels followed by my new companion and we very soon put the barred gate between us and our enemy i will wish you good day now sir said i i am going to the hall i am also bound there captain keene replied my companion and with your permission will accompany you egad we may meet another cow said he laughing and i prefer being in your company he then informed me that he was the solicitor and agent of the honourable miss delmar and had been sent for about some new leases and that his name was warden during our walk i found him a very cheerful merry little man and a very good companion on our arrival at the hall mr warden was informed that miss delmar was not able to receive him just then as she was very busy with lord de versely who was with her in her private room i therefore remained with mr warden for about an hour when lord de versely came down and joined us he appeared to be in a remarkable gay humour and shook me warmly by the hand when he came in now mr warden you are to go up and receive your instructions and recollect the sooner everything is executed the better mr warden left the room and i narrated to his lordship the adventure with the cow just as i had begun it colonel delmar came in and listened to my narration in about half an hour mr warden came downstairs and with a very smiling face well mr warden said his lordship have you your instructions yes my lord and i assure you that i never shall execute any with so much pleasure has captain keene told you how he saved my life this morning no he did not say that replied his lordship but he has told me about the cow and your clerk putting you foremost in the breach she would have made a breach in me i expect if it had not been for the captain replied mr warden and you may therefore believe me my lord when i say that i shall obey my instructions with pleasure i wish you good morning good morning captain keene colonel your most obedient so saying mr warden left the room i was very much struck with mr wardens observation that he would execute his instructions with so much pleasure and when i turned round i perceived that colonel delmar was looking very grave but the first dinner bell rang and we all went to our rooms to dress well thought i as i was dressing myself i presume the old lady has left me a thousand or two in her will i cared little about that and then i dismissed the subject from my thoughts but as i sat by miss delmar after dinner i could not help thinking that her manner towards me was more affectionate than it had been before the hauteur with which her civility and kindness had hitherto been blended appeared to have been thrown aside i presumed that lord de versely had been speaking in my favour and felt grateful to him for his kindness perhaps thought i he has revealed to her the secret of my birth and she now considers me as a relation perhaps she may have left me more than i supposed however it is of little consequence chapter thirty six the next day being the first of september we were all very busy and we continued to shoot every day for a week when i thought it time to return to portsmouth i mentioned my intentions to lord de versely and was pressed to stay until the following saturday it being then tuesday on wednesday mr warden made his appearance attended by his clerk who carried a bag of papers he remained half an hour and then went home but before he went he asked me to dine with him on the following day and i consented after we returned from shooting the next day i changed my clothes and leaving word with the butler that i dined out i took my way across the fields i was walking very quietly on the grass by the side of a high hedge when i perceived two other men on the opposite side one i recognised as colonel delmar the other i could not at first make out but as i approached them i perceived that the colonel was talking with the clerk of mr warden i passed them without notice for they were very earnestly engaged in conversation what they said i did not know but i thought it singular that so proud a person as colonel delmar should be so engaged with an inferior a little reflection however made me consider that there was nothing very surprising in colonel delmars entering into conversation with a man in the country they might be talking about the game or a hundred other things i had a very friendly dinner with mr warden who after dinner gave me a hint that i should not be the worse for the papers signed the day before he did not however say anything positive as it would have been a breach of trust when i spoke of my soon being afloat again he said that he would not fail to watch over my interests at the hall during my absence and he requested that i would write to him and consider him as my sincere friend of course my dear captain keene i do not expect that you will at present give me your entire confidence but i trust you will when you know me and at all events that you will not fail to do so when my advice may be of use to you i have a debt of obligation to pay and i shall be most happy to do so if it is in my power i thanked mr warden for his kind offers and promised to avail myself of them and we parted great friends the next day friday we had a large addition to our shooting party i had not been out more than an hour when as i was standing near lord de versely who was reloading his gun a report close to us was heard and i fell down close to his feet apparently dead a keeper who was with us ran to see who had discharged the gun and found that it was colonel delmar who now ran up to us stating in hurried terms to lord de versely that his gun had gone off accidentally as he was putting on a copper cap and bitterly lamenting the circumstance lord de versely was at the time kneeling down by my side as i was afterwards informed showing the greatest anxiety and grief my hat had been taken off it was full of blood and the back of my head was much torn with the shot i remained insensible although breathing heavily a gate was taken off its hinges and i was laid upon it and carried to the hall before the surgeon had arrived i had recovered my senses on examination i had had a very narrow escape the better part of the charge of shot had entered the back part of my head but fortunately not any had penetrated through the skull after a tedious hour employed in extracting this load my head was bound up and i was made comfortable in my bed i must say that lord de versely and colonel delmar vied with each other in their attentions to me the latter constantly accusing himself as the author of the mischief and watching by my bed the major part of the day this accident delayed my departure and it was not until three weeks afterwards that i was sufficiently recovered to leave my room in the meantime lord de versely assured that i was out of danger went back to london the colonel however remained his kindness and attention had given me great pleasure and we had become very intimate he had offered to go with me to portsmouth and i had expressed the pleasure i should have in his company the honourable miss delmar had shown the greatest feeling and anxiety for me during my illness so had mr warden who often called to see me in fact i found myself so surrounded by wellwishers and friends that i hardly regretted my accident at the end of the fifth week i was sufficiently recovered to be able to return to portsmouth where i was now very anxious to arrive as the circe had been launched and had already received her lower masts i took my leave of miss delmar who requested my early return to madeline hall and accompanied by colonel delmar was once more established at billetts hotel bob cross was the first who made his appearance for i had written to him to acquaint him with my intended return he had heard of my narrow escape as it had been put into the newspaper his information was trifling but to the purpose all was right as to the frigate she sat on the water like a duck the rigging was far advanced and the officers seemed of the right sort all was right also as to his matrimonial affairs his wife was every thing he wished the old gentleman was as sweet as molasses and he had laid the keel of a young cross we then entered upon business and i gave him some directions as to the rigging and he left me the next morning the first lieutenant called to pay his respects and his appearance and conversation proved him to be what he had been recommended as a good seaman and a brave man i went with him to the dockyard to look at the frigate in the basin and afterwards on board the hulk to see the other officers and the men who had been entered i had every reason to be satisfied and i then returned to the hotel to dine with colonel delmar this officer appeared to have taken a strong interest in me and ever since the accident of his gun going off which had so nearly been fatal to me was unbounded in his professions of regard i must say that a more gentlemanlike or more amusing companion i never met with a great intimacy was established between us he was constantly making me presents of value which i would fain have prevented his doing occasionally when we were alone he would hint something about my family and parentage but this was a subject upon which i was invariably silent and i immediately changed the conversation once only i replied that my father and mother were both dead on my arrival at portsmouth i found several letters waiting for me and among them two or three from my mother who had seen the report in the newspaper of the escape that i had had and of course was excessively anxious to hear from my own hand how i was had i thought that it would have come to her knowledge i certainly should have written to my grandmother from madeline hall but i imagined that she knew nothing about it until my return to portsmouth when her anxious letters proved the contrary for in her anxiety she had quite forgotten her promise that all communication should be through my grandmother as soon as i had read the letters i locked them up in my desk and hastened to reply to them assuring my mother of my perfect restoration to health and cautioned her not to break through the agreement we had made for the future pointing out to her that had these letters been forwarded to madeline hall her handwriting would have been recognised i said in conclusion i must say my dear mother that i now heartily repent that we should have resorted to the step we have done in pretending that you are dead that some advantage was gained by it at the time i really believe but i have a feeling that eventually some mischief may occur from it i hope i may be mistaken but if i am not it will only be the punishment which i deserve for an act of duplicity which i have repented of ever since chapter thirty seven my time was now fully employed during the day in fitting out the frigate but in the evening i generally dined out at the admirals or at the officers mess i received several invitations from the marine mess to dine with them but i always contrived to be engaged for i was fearful that something might be said relative to my putative father ben which might hurt my pride not that i had any reason to suppose that any of the officers would have been guilty of any such rudeness but as a great deal of wine was drank when company were at the mess and there were many young men there it was possible that having the knowledge they might in their cups say something which they never would have done when they were sober the colonel very often dined there and constantly asked me why i refused my reply was certainly not the truth for i said that i was not very partial to marine officers we had been three weeks at portsmouth when colonel delmar received a letter from a friend of his a major stapleton which he read aloud to me at breakfast it stated that the major would be down at portsmouth the next day and requested the colonel to procure him good rooms he is an excellent fellow the major continued the colonel and will be a great addition to our society i will prevail upon him to stay a week or ten days on my return from the dockyard on the following day i found the colonel and major stapleton in our sittingroom and was introduced to him he was a small neatlymade man with handsome features very well dressed and of very fashionable appearance still there was something in his eye which did not please me it was unsettled and wandering and never fixed upon you for more than a second he met me with great warmth and empressement shook me by the hand and declared what pleasure he had in making my acquaintance we sat down to dinner and were very merry the major had been with us a week when we had a large party to dinner the wine was passed freely and we all were more or less elated the major appeared particularly so and very much inclined to be quarrelsome and as he constantly addressed himself to me i was very cautious in what i said as i perceived that he was in the humour to take offence at anything several very offensive remarks were made by him as if to pick a quarrel between us but i parried them as well as i could and i was making an observation when the major started up and told me that what i said was a lie and that i was a scoundrel for having said so now as my observation was to my first lieutenant and was in reference to the hold of the frigate there could be no cause for this insult and it could only be ascribed to his being in a state of intoxication my reply was very cool and quiet major you do not know what you are saying but we will talk about it tomorrow morning i then rose and went to my bedroom and the whole party broke up immediately shortly afterwards colonel delmar came into my room and blaming the major very much for his conduct ascribed it to intoxication and said that he would make him send a proper apology which he had no doubt the next morning when the major was informed of what he had done he would be most anxious to offer himself i replied that i presumed so and he quitted my room indeed so fully was i convinced of this in my own mind that i gave it no further thought and was soon fast asleep and did not wake until colonel delmar entered my room at a late hour well colonel said i my dear keene said he i have been to the major and to my surprise when i stated to him what had passed at the table last night his reply was that he perfectly remembered all about it and that he would not retract what he had said i remonstrated with him but in vain he says that it is cowardly to retract and that he will never make an apology then replied i there is but one step for me to take as our friend i told him so and pressed him very hard to acknowledge his error but he continued steadfast in his refusal i then took upon myself to say that i was there as your friend and begged he would name an officer to whom i might address myself did i not right my dear keene certainly and i am very much obliged to you replied i putting on my dressinggown he must be mad utterly and positively mad exclaimed colonel delmar i regret very much that he has ever come here i know that some years ago when he was younger he fought two or three duels rather than make an apology but in this instance it was so unprovoked and i had hoped that he had got over all that nonsense and obstinacy are you a good shot keene because he is a notorious one i can hit my man colonel it is true that i have only fought one duel in my life and would make a great sacrifice rather than fight another but no alternative is left me in this case and if blood is shed it must be on the head of him who provoked it very true replied colonel delmar biting his lip i only hope you will be successful i have no particular animosity against major stapleton replied i but as he is such a good shot i shall in my own defence take good aim at him at all events i have sufficient acquaintance with firearms and have passed through too many bullets not to be cool and collected under fire and i therefore consider myself quite a match for the major now colonel if you will order the breakfast i will be down in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour as the colonel was going out of the room his servant knocked at the door and said that captain green wished to speak to him on particular business i therefore did not hurry myself but proceeded quietly with my toilet as i was well aware what the particular business was and that the conference might last some time on my descending into the sittingroom i found the colonel alone well keene said he everything is arranged for the major is deaf to all expostulation you are to meet this evening and to avoid interference captain green and i have agreed to say that the major has apologised and all is made up of course i had no objection to make to that and we parted for the present i walking to the dockyard and he remaining at the hotel to write letters the reader may think that i took matters very coolly but the fact was i had no preparations to make in case of accident having no wife or family and as to any other preparations at such a time i considered them as mockery i knew that i was about to do what was wrongto offend my creatorand knowing that and sinning with my eyes open much as i regretted that i was compelled to do so i was still resolved upon doing it how great may be the culpability in such cases when you are called upon to sacrifice all your worldly interests and to be despised among men or run the risk of involuntarily taking another persons life i could not pretend to judge but one thing was certain that however it may be judged in the next world in this among soldiers and sailors it will always be considered as venial i did therefore what most in my profession would have done under the same circumstances i drove it from my thoughts as much as possible until the time came to decide my fate i considered that i must be judged by the tenor of my whole life and that repentance under chance of death was of about the same value as deathbed repentance as soon as the dockyard men were mustered out i returned to the hotel and sat down to dinner with the colonel we had scarcely finished a bottle of claret when it was time to be off we walked out of the town to the place appointed where i found my adversary and his second the ground was marked out by the colonel and when i took my station i found that the setting sun was in my eyes i pointed it out to him and requested my position might be changed the other second heard me do so and very handsomely agreed that i was entitled to what i asked and the colonel immediately apologised for his remissness to my interests the ground was then marked out in another direction and the colonel took me to my place where i observed that one of the whitewashed posts was exactly behind me making me a sure mark for my antagonist i am not used to these things keene replied colonel delmar and i make strange mistakes i then pointed out a direction which would be fair for both parties the pistols were then loaded and put into our hands we fired at the signal i felt that i was hit but my adversary fell i was paralysed and although i remained on my feet i could not move captain green and the colonel went up to where my adversary lay the ball had passed through his chest he is dead said captain greenquite dead yes replied colonel delmar my dear keene i congratulate you you have killed the greatest scoundrel that ever disgraced his majestys uniform colonel delmar replied captain green the observation might well be spared our errors and our follies die with us very true captain green replied i i can only express my surprise that the colonel should have introduced to me a person whose memory he now so bitterly assails somehow or another from the commencement of the duel colonel delmars conduct had excited my suspicions and a hundred things crowded into my memory which appeared as if illumined like a flash of lightning i came suddenly to the conviction that he was my enemy and not my friend but i was bleeding fast some marines who were passing were summoned and the body of major stapleton was carried away by one party while i was committed to another and taken back to the hotel the surgeon was sent for and my wound was not dangerous the ball had gone deep into my thigh but had missed any vessel of magnitude it was extracted and i was left quiet in bed colonel delmar came up to me as before but i received his professions with great coolness i told him that i thought it would be prudent of him to disappear until the affair had blown over but he declared to me that he would remain with me at every risk shortly afterwards captain green came into my room and said im sure captain keene you will be glad to hear that major stapleton is not dead he had swooned and is now come to and the doctor thinks favourably of him i am indeed very glad captain green for i had no animosity against the major and his conduct to me has been quite incomprehensible after inquiry about my wound and expressing a hope that i should soon be well captain green left but i observed that he took no further notice of colonel delmar than a haughty salute as he quitted the room and then to my surprise colonel delmar said that upon consideration he thought it would be advisable for him to go away for a certain time i agree with you replied i it would be better i said this because i did not wish his company for it at once struck me as very strange that he should now that major stapleton was alive and promising to do well talk of departure when he refused at the time he supposed him to be killed i was therefore very glad when in an hour or two afterwards he took his leave and started as he said for london chapter thirty eight my recovery was rapid in less than a fortnight i was on the sofa the frigate was now rigged and had taken in her water and stores and was reported ready for sea in a month as we still required about forty men to make up our complement i saw a great deal of captain green who paid me a visit almost every day and once when our conversation turned upon the duel i made the same remark as i did when colonel delmar used such harsh language over the body of major stapleton yes replied captain green i thought it was my duty to tell him what colonel delmar had said he was very much excited and replied the greatest scoundrel did he saythen is the devil better than those he tempts however we are both in each others power i must get well first and then i will act there certainly is some mystery the attack was so unprovoked the determination so positive have you any reason to suppose that colonel delmar is your enemy captain keene for certainly he did appear to me to do all he could at the time of the duel to give your adversary the advantage i really have no cause to suppose that he has grounds for being my enemy but i cannot help suspecting that for some reason or reasons unknown he is so when captain green had left me i tried all i could to find out why colonel delmar should be inimical to me that he was the supposed heir to miss delmar i knew but surely her leaving me a few thousands was not sufficient cause for a man to seek my life lord de versely had nothing to leave i could come to no conclusion that was at all satisfactory i then thought whether i would write to lord de versely and tell him what had happened but i decided that i would not the initials had been put in the papers at the announcement of the duel and had he seen them he certainly would have written down to inquire about the facts my mother had so done and i resolved that i would answer her letter which had hitherto remained on the table i sent for my desk and when my servant brought it me the bunch of keys were hanging to the lock i thought this strange as i had locked my desk before i went out to meet major stapleton and had never sent for it since my return my servant however could tell me nothing about it except that he found it as he brought it to me but after a little time he recollected that the doctor had asked for a pen and ink to write a prescription and that the colonel had taken the keys to get him what he required this accounted for it and nothing more was said upon the subject of course although it was known no notice was taken of what had passed by the admiralty i had not even put myself down in the sick report but signed my daily papers and sent them into the admirals office as if nothing had happened in six weeks i was able to limp about a little and the circe was at last reported ready for sea my orders came down and i was to sail with the first fair wind to join the squadron in the texel and north sea i had taken up my quarters on board and was waiting two days while the wind still blew hard from the eastward when my promise to write to mr warden occurred to me and as i had closed all my despatches to lord de verselythe honourable miss delmar to whom i made my excuse for not being able to pay my respects before my departuremy mother and my aunt bridgemani resolved that i would write him a long letter previous to my sailing i did so in which i entered into the whole affair of the duel the conduct of colonel delmar and my suspicions relative to him stating at the same time that i could not comprehend why he should have sought to injure me i finished this letter late in the evening and the next morning the wind having come round we sailed for our destination once more on the water all my thoughts were given to the service we soon fell in with the north sea squadron and the day afterwards the circe was directed to go on shore in company with the dryad and watch the flotillas of gunboats which had been collecting in the various rivers and ports to sink burn and destroy to the utmost of our power this was an active and dangerous service as the enemy had every advantage in the sands and shoals and hardly a day passed in which we were not engaged with the flotillas and batteries it was however now fine weather for the winter had set in early and had passed away and for two months we continued in the service during which my skips company were well trained one morning a cutter from the fleet was reported from the masthead and we expected that we should soon have our letters from england when the dryad threw out the signal for six sail of praams in shore the two frigates made all sail in chase leaving the cutter to follow us how she could our masters were well acquainted with the shoals on the coast and we threaded our way through them towards the enemy we were within gunshot and had exchanged broadsides with the batteries when the flotillas gained a small harbour which prevented our making any further attempts the dryad made the signal to haul off it was quite time as we had not more than four hours daylight and were entangled among the shoals the breeze which had been fresh now increased very rapidly and there was every appearance of a gale we worked out as fast as we could and by nine oclock in the evening we were clear of the sands and in the open sea but the gale had sprung up so rapidly that we were obliged to reduce our sail to closereefed topsails with the sands under our lee it was necessary to draw off as fast as we could and we therefore carried a heavy press of sail all the nightat last the wind was so strong that we could only carry closereefed maintopsail and reefed foresail and with a heavy sea which had risen up we felt that we were in extreme danger daylight once more made its appearance our first object was to ascertain the position of the dryad for a long time we looked in vain at last a partial clearing up of the horizon on the lee bow discovered her looming through the heavy atmosphere more like a phantom ship than the work of mortal hands she was a deep grey mass upon a lighter grey ground her topmasts were gone and she was pitching and rising without appearing to advance under her courses and storm staysails there she is sir said mr wilson and if the gale lasts goodbye to her if the gale lasts mr wilson said i in a low voice i suspect you may sing our requiem as well but we must trust to heaven and our own exertions pass along the leadline mr hawkins aye aye sir replied the officer of the watch how much out sir forty fathoms the men ranged themselves along the leebulwarks chains and gangway and passed the deep sealines from aft to the anchor stock forward the deep sea lead was taken forward and as soon as it was bent and ready the ship was thrown up to the wind so as to check her way heave and the lead was thrown and as it descended the line was dropped from the hands of the men one after another as the line drew aft but when it came to the hands of the master who was on the quarter instead of finding as he expected forty fathoms of water he had to haul in the slack line for such a length of time that the lead was astern and no proper soundings could be obtained one thing was however certain which was that we were in much shallower water than we had any idea of and the master much alarmed desired the quartermaster to go into the chains and see if he could get soundings with the handlead while the men were hauling in the deep sealine the quartermaster was forestalled by bob cross who dropping into the chains cleared the line and swinging it but twice or thrice for there was little or no way in the vessel let it go the anxiety with which the descent of the line was watched by me the master and other of the officers who were hanging over the hammock rails it would be difficult to describe when sixteen fathoms were out the lead sounded cross gathered up the slack line and fourteen and a half fathoms was announced mr hillyer said i oblige me by coming down into the cabin the master followed me immediately the chart was on the table in the forecabin we must have gone to leeward dreadfully sir yes replied i but the sweep of the currents in heavy gales is so tremendous and so uncertain on this coast that i am not surprised we must have had a south east current and probably we are hereabouts continued i putting the point of the compass upon the spot it seems hardly possible sir replied the master but still i fear it must be so and if so continued he drawing a deep sigh im afraid its all over with us without a miracle in our favour i am of your opinion mr hillyer but say nothing about it replied i the gale may moderate the wind may shift and if so we may be saved at all events its no use telling bad news too soon and therefore youll oblige me by not saying anything on the subject a few hours will decide our fate but the dryad she is good four miles to the leeward of us and the soundings decrease here so rapidly that in an hour with the sail she is under she must go on shore she has no chance thats certain replied i i only hope it may be so thick that we may not see her not a soul will be saved sir replied the master shuddering i should say it were impossible mr hillyer but we all owe heaven a death and if they go first and we go after them at all events let us do our duty until the time comesbut never despair as long as there is life there is hope so now let us go on deck and put as good a face on it as we can chapter thirty nine i returned on deck followed by the master the barometer is rising said i aloud to the first lieutenant so i presume the gale will break about twelve oclock i am glad to hear of it sir for we have quite enough of it replied the firstlieutenant do you see the dryad no sir its quite thick again to leeward we have not seen her these ten minutes thank god for that thought i for they will never see her again what soundings had you last fourteen fathoms sir i expect we shall cross the tail of the bank in much less replied i but when once clear we shall have searoom as the captain is an oracle in times of danger the seamen caught every word which was uttered from my mouth and what they gathered from what i had said satisfied them that they were in no immediate danger nevertheless the master walked the deck as if he was stupefied with the impending crisis no wonder poor fellow with a wife and family depending upon him for support it is not to be expected that a man can look upon immediate dissolution without painful feelings a sailor should never marry or if he does for the benefit of the service his marriage should prove an unhappy one and then he would become more reckless than before as for my own thoughts they may be given in a few wordsthey were upon the vanity of human wishes whatever i had done with the one object i had in viewwhatever might have been my success had i livedwhether i might have been wedded to minnie some future day or what may have resulted good bad or indifferent as to future all was to be in a few hours cut short by the will of heaven in the next world there was neither marriage nor giving in marriagein the next world name titles wealth everything worldly was as nought and all i had to do was to die like a man and do my duty to the last trusting to a merciful god to forgive me my sins and offences and with this philosophy i stood prepared for the event about noon it again cleared up to leeward but the dryad was no longer to be seen this was reported to me as it was nearly three hours since we last had a sight of her i knew her fate too wellshe had plenty of time to go on shore and to be broken up by the heavy seas i did however point my glass in the direction and coolly observed she has rounded the tail of the bank i presume and has bore up it was the best thing she could do i then asked the master if he had wound his chronometers and went down into the cabin i had not however been examining the chart more than a minute when the officer of the watch came down and reported that we had shoaled to twelve fathoms very good mr hawkins we shall be in shallower water yet let me know if there is any change in the soundings as soon as the cabin door was again shut i worked up the tide to see when it would change against us i found that it had changed one hour at least then it will be sooner over thought i throwing down the pencil mr cross the boatswain wishes to speak to you sir said the sentry opening the cabin door tell him to come in replied i well cross whats the matter i was speaking to the first lieutenant about getting up a runner sir the forestay is a good deal chafed that is if you think its of any use how do you mean of any use cross why sir although no one would suppose it from youbut if the face of the master and he is not a fainthearted man neither is to be taken as a barometer we shall all be in kingdom come before long ive cruised in these seas so often that i pretty well guess where we are captain keene well cross its no use denying that we are in a mess and nothing but the wind going down or changing can get us out of it just as i thought sir well it cant be helped so its no use fretting about it i think myself that the gale is breaking and that we shall have fine weather by tomorrow morning that will be rather too late cross for i think we shall be done for in three or four hours if not sooner eleven fathoms sir said the officer of the watch coming in hastily very well mr hawkins let her go through the water replied i as soon as the cabin door was again shut i said you see cross the tide is now against us and this will not last long no sir we shall strike in five fathoms with this heavy sea i know we shall but i do not wish to dishearten the men before it is necessary and then we must do our best you wont be offended i am sure by my asking captain keene what you think of doing not at all cross it is my intention to explain it to the ships company before i do it i may as well take your opinion upon it now as soon as we are in six fathoms i intend to cut away the masts and anchor thats our only chance sir and if it is well done and the gale abates it may save some of us but how do you intend to anchor i shall back the best bower with the sheet and let go the small bower at the same time that i do the sheet so as to ride an even strain you cant do better sir but that will require time for preparation to be well done do you think that we shall have time if you wait till we are in six fathoms i dont know but you are right cross and i think it would be better to commence our preparations at once ten fathoms sir reported the officer of the watch very well i will be on deck directly well sir we must now go to our duty and as we may chance not to talk to one another again sir said cross i can only say god bless you and i hope that if we do not meet again in this world we shall in heaven or as near to it as possible goodbye sir goodbye cross replied i shaking him by the hand well do our duty at all events so now for my last dying speech cross quitted the cabin and i followed him as soon as i was on deck i desired the first lieutenant to turn the hands up and send them aft when they were all assembled with cross at their head i stood on one of the carronades and said my lads i have sent for you because i consider that although the gale is evidently breaking we are shoaling our water so fast that we are in danger of going on shore before the gale does break now what i intend to do as our best chance is to cut away the masts and anchor as soon as we are in six fathoms water perhaps we may then ride it out at all events we must do our best and put our trust in providence but my lads you must be aware that in times of difficulty it is important that we should be all cool and collected that you must adhere to your discipline and obey your officers to the last if you do not everything will go wrong instead of right you have proved yourselves an excellent set of men and im sure you will continue so to do it is possible we may not have to cut away our masts or to anchor still we must make every preparation in case it is necessary and i have therefore sent for you to explain my intentions and to request that you will all assist me to the best of your abilities and i feel convinced that you will and will do your duty like british seamen thats all i have to say my lads pipe down mr cross the ships company went forward in silence they perceived the full extent of the danger the first lieutenant and boatswain employed a portion in backing the best bower anchor with the sheet the others roued up the cables from the tiers and coiled them on the maindeck clear for running all hands were busily employed and employment made them forget their fears the work was done silently but orderly and steadily in the meantime we had shoaled to eight fathoms and it was now nearly three oclock but as it was summer time the days were long indeed when the weather was fine there was little or no night and the weather was warm which was all in our favour when everything was reported ready i went round to examine and ascertain if the cables would run clear satisfied that all was right i then picked out the men and appointed those who were most trustworthy to the stations of importance and having so done i then returned to the quarterdeck and called up the carpenter and some of the topmen to be ready with the axes to cut away the masts and lashings of the booms and boats just as these orders were completed the gale blew fiercer than ever we were now in seven fathoms water and pressed heavy by the gale i stood at the break of the gangway the first lieutenant and master by my side and cross a little forward watching my eye the men in the chains continued to give the soundings in a clear steady voice by the mark seven quarter less seven and a half six at last the man in the chains next to me a fine old forecastle man gave the sounding by the mark six and he gave it with a louder voice than before with a sort of defiance as much as to say the time is come let the elements do their worst the time was come silence fore and aft every man down under the halfdeck except those stationed cut away the boom lashings and clear the boats this was soon done and reported now then my lads be steady cut away the lanyards in the chains one after another the lanyards and backstays were severed the masts groaned and creaked and then the foremast and mainmast were over the side almost at the same time the mizen followed as the frigate broached to and righted leaving the ships deck a mass of wreck and confusion but no one was hurt from the precautions which had been taken the mast having been cut away before we rounded to to anchor as otherwise they would have fallen aft and not gone clear of the ship stand by the best bower stand clear of the cable let go the anchor as soon as the best bower cable was nearly out the sheet anchor and small bower were let go at the same moment and the result was to be ascertained chapter forty the frigate was head to wind rising and pitching with the heavy sea but not yet feeling the strain of the cables the masts lay rolling and beating alongside the ships company had most of them returned on deck to view their impending fate and the carpenters who had already received their orders were battening down the hatchways on the maindeck in a minute the frigate rode to her anchors and as soon as the strain was on the cables she dipped and a tremendous sea broke over her bows deluging us fore and aft nearly filling the maindeck and washing the carpenters away from their halfcompleted work a second and a third followed rolling aft so as to almost bury the vessel sweeping away the men who clung to the cordage and guns and carrying many of them overboard i had quitted the gangway where there was no hold and had repaired to the main bitts behind the stump of the mainmast even in this position i should not have been able to hold on if it had not been for bob cross who was near me and who passed a rope round my body as i was sweeping away but the booms and boats which had been cut adrift in case of the ship driving on shore broadside were driven aft with the last tremendous sea and many men on the quarterdeck were crushed and mangled after the third sea had swept over us there was a pause and cross said to me we had better go down on the maindeck captain keene and get the halfports open if possible we did so and with great difficulty found the people to help us for as it may be imagined the confusion was now very great but the carpenters were again collected and the halfports got out and then the battening down was completed for although she continued to ship seas fore and aft they were not so heavy as the three first which had so nearly swamped her i again went on deck followed by cross who would not leave me most of the men had lashed themselves to the guns and belaying pins but i looked in vain for the first lieutenant and master they were standing at the gangway at the time of the first sea breaking over us and it is to be presumed that they were washed overboard for i never saw them again we had hardly been on deck and taken our old position at the bitts when the heavy seas again poured over us but the booms having been cleared and the ports on the maindeck open they did not sweep us with the same force as before she cannot stand this long bob said i as we clung to the bitts no sir the cables must part with such a heavy strain or if they do not we shall drag our anchors till we strike on the sands and then we shall go to pieces yes sir but do not forget to get to the wreck of the masts if you possibly can the best chance will be there bads the best cross however that was my intention the reader will be surprised at my having no conversation with any other party but cross but the fact was that although it was only occasionally that a heavy sea poured over us we were blinded by the continual spray in which the frigate was enveloped and which prevented us not only from seeing our own position but even a few feet from us and as if any one who had not a firm hold when the seas poured over the deck was almost certain to be washed overboard every man clung to where he was indeed there were not fifty men on deck for those who had not been washed overboard by the first seas had hastened to get under the halfdeck and many had been washed overboard in the attempt the most painful part was to hear the moaning and cries for help of the poor fellows who lay jammed under the heavy spars and boats which had been washed aft and to whom it was impossible to afford any relief without the assistance of a large body of men but all i have described since the anchors were let go occurred in a few minutes on a sudden the frigate heeled over to starboard and at the same time a sea broke over her chesstree which nearly drowned us where we were clinging as soon as the pouring off of the water enabled us to recover our speech she has parted cross and all is over with us said i yes sir as soon as she strikes she will break up in ten minutes we must not stay here as she will part amidships i felt the truth of the observation and waiting until a heavy sea had passed over us contrived to gain the after ladder and descend as soon as we were on the main deck we crawled to the cabin and seated ourselves by the aftergun cross having made a hold on to a ringbolt for us with his silk neckhandkerchief there were many men in the cabin silently waiting their doom they knew that all was over that nothing could be done yet they still contrived to touch their hats respectfully to me as i passed my lads said i as soon as i had secured my hold the cables have parted and the ship will strike and go to pieces in a very short time recollect that the masts to leeward are your best chance those who were near me said thank you captain keene but the words were scarcely out of their mouths when a shock passed through the whole vessel and communicated itself to our very hearts the ship had struck on the sand and the beams and timbers had not ceased trembling and groaning when a sea struck her larboard broadside throwing her over on her beamends so that the starboard side of the maindeck and the guns were under water it would be impossible after this to detail what occurred in a clear and correct manner as the noise and confusion were so terrible at every sea hurled against the sides of the vessel the resistance to them became less what with the crashing of the beams the breaking up of the timbers and the guns to windward as their fastenings gave way tumbling with a tremendous crash to leeward and passing through the ships sides the occasional screams mixed with the other noise the pouring dashing and washing of the waters the scene was appalling at last one louder crash than any of the former announced that the vessel had yielded to the terrific force of the waves and had parted amidships after this there was little defence against them even where we were clinging for the waters poured in as if maddened by their success through the passage formed by the separation of the vessel and came bounding on as if changing their direction on purpose to overwhelm us as the two parts of the vessel were thrown higher up the shocks were more severe and indeed the waves appeared to have more power than before in consequence of their being so increased in weight from the quantity of sand which was mixed up with them another crash the sides of the afterpart of the vessel had given way and the heavy guns disengaged flew to leeward and we found ourselves without shelter from the raging waters the part of the wreck on which cross and i were sitting was so completely on its beamends that the deck was within a trifle of being perpendicular to walk was impossible all that we could do was to slide down into the water to leeward but little was to be gained by that as there was no egress we therefore remained for more than an hour in the same position wearied with clinging and the continual suffocation we received from the waves as they deluged us we perceived that the wreck was gradually settling down deeper and deeper in the sand it was more steady in consequence but at the same time the waves had more power over the upper part and so it proved for one enormous sea came in blowing up the quarter deck over our heads tearing away the planking and timbers and hurling them to leeward this at all events set us free although it exposed us more than before we could now see about us that is we could see to leeward and cross pointed out to me the mainmast tossing about in the boiling water with the maintop now buried and now rising out clear i nodded my head in assent he made a sign to say that he would go first after the next wave had passed over us i found myself alone and as soon as i had cleared my eyes of the saltwater i perceived cross in the surge to leeward making for the floating mast he gained it and waved his hand i immediately followed him and after a short buffet gained a place by his side just behind the maintop which afforded us considerable shelter from the seas indeed as the mainmast was in a manner anchored by the lee rigging to the wreck of the vessel the latter served as a breakwater and the sea was therefore comparatively smooth and i found my position infinitely more agreeable than when i was clinging on the wreck i could now breathe freely as it was seldom i was wholly under water neither was it necessary as before to cling for your life on looking round me i found that about twenty men were hanging on to the mast many of them appeared quite exhausted and had not strength left to obtain a more favourable berth the position taken by cross and myself was very secure being between the maintop and the catharpings and the water was so warm that we did not feel the occasional immersion five other men were close to us but not a word was saidindeed hardly a recognition exchanged at that time we thought only of immediate preservation and had little feeling for anybody else chapter forty one the night was now coming on the rolling waves changed from the yellow tinge given by the sand to green and then to purple at last all was black except the white foaming breakers exhausted with fatigue it had not been dark more than two hours when i felt an irresistible desire to sleep and i have no doubt that i did slumber in this position half in and half out of the water for some time for when i was roused up by losing my balance i looked above and perceived that the sky was clear and the stars shining brightly i then looked around me and it was evident that the water was not so agitated as it had been the wind too had subsided its roaring had ceased although it still whistled strong cross said i here i am captain keene close under your lee the gale is broke we shall have fair weather before the morning yes sir i have thought so some time thank god for his mercy we must trust that he will not leave us here to perish miserably no i hope not replied cross let us trust in him but i confess i see but little chance so have many others yet they have been saved cross very true sir replied he i wish it was daylight we had however three or four hours to wait but during that time the wind gradually subsided and then went down to a light and fitful breeze at dawn of day the mast rose and fell with the swell of the sea which still heaved after the late commotion but without any run in any particular direction for it was now calm i had been sitting on the mast with my back against the futtockshrouds i now rose up with difficulty for i was sorely bruised and stood upon the mast clear from the water to look around me about thirty yards from us was the wreck of the foremast with many men clinging to it the mizenmast had broken adrift the fore part of the frigate was several feet above water and the bowsprit steeved in the air of the after part there were but three or four broken timbers to be seen clear of the water so deep had it been buried in the sand cross had risen on his feet and was standing by me when we were hailed from the wreck of the foremast mainmast ahoy halloo replied cross have you got the captain on board yes replied bob all alive and hearty a faint huzzah which was the return affected me sensibly that my men should think of me when in such a position was soothing to my feelings but as i looked at them on the other mast and those around me and calculated that there could not be more than forty men left out of such a noble ships company i could have wept but it was time for action cross said i now that it is calm i think we shall be better on the fore part of the frigate than here half in and half out of water the forecastle is still remaining and the weather bulwarks will shelter the men besides if any vessels should come in sight we should more easily be able to make signals and to attract their attention very true sir replied cross and as there are many men here who cannot hold on much longer we must try if we cannot haul them on board do you feel strong enough to swim to the wreck yes quite cross then well start together sir and see how matters are i dropped into the sea followed by cross and as the distance from us was not forty yards we soon gained the wreck of the fore part of the frigate the lee gunnel was just above the water we clambered over it and found the deck still whole the weather portion as white as snow and quite dry we gained the weather bulwarks and looked in the offing in case there should be any vessel but we could see nothing now sir we had better hail and tell all those who can swim to come to us we did so and six men from the mainmast and nine from the foremast soon joined us now my lads said i we must look after those who cannot get here and try to save them get all the ends of ropes from the belaying pins bend them on one to another and then we will return and make the men fast and you shall haul them on board this was soon done cross and i took the end in our hands and swam back to the mainmast one of the topmen with a broken arm was the first that was made fast and when the signal was given hauled through the water to the wreck six or seven more followed in succession two men swam back every time with the rope and accompanied those who were hauled on board that they might not sink there were many more hanging to different parts of the mainmast but on examination they were found to be quite dead we sent on board all that showed any symptoms of life and then we swam to the foremast and assisted those who were hanging to it in about two hours our task was completed and we mustered twentysix men on the wreck we were glad to shelter ourselves under the bulwark where we all lay huddled up together before noon most of the poor fellows had forgotten their sufferings in a sound sleep cross i and the man with the broken arm were the only three awake the latter was in too much pain to find repose and moreover suffered from extreme thirst a breeze now sprang up from the southward which cheered our spirits as without wind there was little chance of receiving any assistance night again came on and the men still slept cross and i laid down and were glad to follow their example the night was cold and when we lay down we did not yet feel much from hunger or thirst but when the morning dawned we woke in suffering not from hunger but from thirst everybody cried out for water i told the men that talking would only make them feel it more and advised them to put their shirt sleeves in their mouths and suck them and then i climbed upon the bulwarks to see if there was anything in sight i knew that the greatest chance was that the cutter would be looking after us but at the same time it was not yet likely that she would come so near to the sands i had been an hour on the gunnel when cross came up to me its banking up sir to the southward i hope we are not going to have any more bad weather i have no fear of a gale although we may have thick weather replied i that would be almost as bad for us as we should perish on the wreck before we are discovered i am going to lower myself down into the galley captain keene to see if i can find anything i fear you will not be successful replied i for the coppers and ranges are all carried away i know that sir but i have been thinking of the cooks closet we had built up above the bowsprit i know that he used to stow away many things there and perhaps there may be something i believe the shortest way will be to go to leeward and swim round to it cross then left me and i continued to look out about an hour afterwards he returned and told me that he had easily opened it with his knife and had found eight or nine pounds of raw potatoes and a bucketful of slush we are not hungry enough to eat this now sir but there is enough to keep the life in us all for three or four days at least that is if we could get water and i expect we shall feel the want of that dreadfully in a short time i would give a great deal if i could only find a drop to give that poor fellow anderson with his broken arm it is terribly swelled and he must suffer very much did you find anything in the closet to put water into cross in case we should get any yes theres two or three kids and some small breakers captain keene well then you had better get them ready for those clouds rise so fast that we may have rain before morning and if so we must not lose the chance why it does look like rain sir replied cross ill take one or two of the men with me to assist in getting them up i watched the horizon till night again set in we were all very faint and distressed for water and the cool of the evening somewhat relieved us the breeze too was fresh the men had remained quietly in the shade as i had advised them but although patient they evidently suffered much once more we all attempted to forget ourselves in repose i was soundly asleep when i was woke up by cross captain keene it is raining and it will soon rain much harder now if you will order the men they will soon collect water enough call them up immediately cross we must not lose this providential succour it may save all our lives the men were soon on the alert the rain came down in a steady shower and as soon as they were wet through they took off their shirts and dabbling them into the water as it ran down to leeward squeezed it out into their mouths until their wants were satisfied and then under the direction of cross commenced filling the three breakers and four tubs which had been brought up they had time to fill them and to spare for the rain continued till the morning the tubs and breakers were securely slung under the forebitts for future use and they then continued to drink till they could drink no more chapter forty two the sun rose and chased away the clouds and the heat was overpowering what would have been our situation if it had not pleased heaven to refresh us the consequence of their thirst being appeased made the demand for food imperative and a raw potato was given to each man the day passed and so did a third and fourth and our hopes began to fail us when at daylight the next morning i spied a sail to the westward the breeze was light but the vessel was evidently coming down towards us and before noon we made it out to be the cutter we then sat on the bulwarks and held out a white shirt as a signal to attract their attention when about three miles from us the cutter rounded to not appearing to notice us and for two hours we were left in this state of maddening anxiety and suspense when at last we perceived her bows pay off and she again stood towards us they had at last seen us and as soon as they had run down to within three cables length the boat was lowered and sent to take us off in three trips we were all on board and devoutly thanked heaven for our preservation the lieutenant of the cutter said that at first the sun prevented his seeing us which i believe was the fact but he acknowledged that he had no idea that we had been wrecked although he thought that the dryad was as he had seen a mast floating and sending a boat to look at it found her name on the crosstrees we were however too much exhausted to enter into much conversation as soon as we had been supplied with food we were all put to bed in their hammocks the first lieutenant resigned his standing bedplace to me a long sleep recovered me and i felt little the worse for what i had suffered and sat down to a breakfast at noon on the following day with a good appetite the cutter had by my directions shaped a course for the island of heligoland where we should find means of returning to england i have letters for you captain keene said the lieutenant if you are well enough to read them thank you mr d i am now quite well and will be happy to have them the lieutenant brought me a large packet and i took a position on the sofa to read them comfortably while he went on deck i first opened those on servicethose of course had little interest for me now that i had lost my shipi skimmed them over and then threw them on the table one after another there were three private letters from england one of which was in lord de verselys handwriting i opened it first it was very kind but short complaining that he had not been very well lately the second was from my mother i read it it contained nothing of importance and then i took up the third which had a black seal i opened it it was from mr warden acquainting me that lord de versely had expired very suddenly on his return from the house of lords of an ossification of the heart in my weak state this blow was too much for me and i fainted how long i remained in that state i cannot say but when i came to my senses i found myself still down in the cabin i rallied as well as i could but it was some time before i could take up the letter again and finish it he stated that his lordship had left me all his personal property which was all that he could leavethat the library and wines were of some value and that there would be about a thousand pounds left at the bankers when the funeral expenses and debts had been paid oh if he could but have left me his family name i cried it was all i coveted my father my kind father i may really say who will lament your loss as i do i threw myself on the pillow of the sofa and for a long while shed bitter tears not unmixed i must own for my grief at his death was increased by my disappointment in having for ever lost the great object of my wishes the lieutenant of the cutter came down into the cabin and i was compelled to hide my emotion i complained of headache and weakness and collecting the letters i again lay down in the standing bedplace and drawing the curtains i was left to my own reflections but there was a sad tumult in my mind i could not keep my ideas upon one subject for a moment i was feverish and excited and at last my head was so painful that i could think no more fortunately exhaustion threw me again into a sound sleep and i did not wake till the next morning when i did i had to recollect where i was and what had happened i knew that there was something dreadful which had occurred again it flashed into my memory lord de versely was dead i groaned and fell back on the pillow are you very ill captain keene said a voice close to me i opened the curtains and perceived that it was cross who was standing by my bedside i am indeed cross very ill i have very bad news lord de versely is dead that is bad news sir replied crossvery bad news worse than losing the frigate but captain keene we must have our ups and downs in this world you have had a long run of good fortune and you must not be surprised at a change it is hard to lose your frigate and your father at the same timebut you have not lost your life which is a great mercy to be thankful for i turned away for my heart was full of bitterness cross perceiving my mood left me and i remained in a state of some indifference never rising from the bedplace during the remainder of the time that i was on board on the second day we arrived at heligoland and i was requested by the governor to take up my quarters with him until an opportunity occurred for my return to england my spirits were however so much weighed down that i could not rally i brooded over my misfortunes and i thought that the time was now come when i was to meet a reverse of the prosperity which i had so long enjoyed the sudden death of lord de versely at the age of fiftysix left me without a patron and had destroyed all my hopes centred in him the object of my ambition was i considered for ever lost to me there was now no chance of my being acknowledged as a member of his family then the loss of so fine a frigate and such a noble ships company that i should be honourably acquitted by a courtmartial i had not a doubt but i had no chance of future employment for now that lord de versely was dead i had no one to support my claims my prospects therefore in the service were all gone as well as the visions i had indulged in i dwelt with some pleasure upon the idea that lord de versely had left me his personal propertyit proved his regard but i wanted his family name and i preferred that to thousands per annum the second day after our arrival cross called and was admitted he found me in bad spirits and tried all he could to rouse me at last he said as for the loss of the frigate captain keene no human endeavour could have saved her and no one could have done his duty better than you did as the courtmartial will prove but sir i think it would be proper just now to show that your zeal for the service is as strong as ever and how am i to do that cross why sir you know as well as we all do how the frenchmen are going to the wall that they have been thrashed out of russia and that they are retreating everywhere they say that they have left hamburg and i understand that the gunbrigs here are going on an expedition from this island either tomorrow or next day to storm the batteries of cuxhaven and so create a diversion as they call itand very good diversion it islicking those french rascals now captain keene if i may take the liberty of saying so would it not be as well to take as many of your men as are able to go and join the storming party much better than sitting here all day melancholy and doing nothing its the first ive heard of it cross are you sure you are correct how should you hear it sir shut up here and seeing nobody its true enough sir they were telling off the men as i came up and i think they start at daylight tomorrow well cross i will think of it and let you know my decision if you call here in half an hour cross left me and i was still undecided when the governor called to pay me a visit after the first exchange of civilities i asked him if the report was true that there was an expedition about to proceed to cuxhaven his reply was that the russians had entered hamburg which the french had evacuated on the th and that the french garrisons at cuxhaven were reported to be in a very distressed state and in consequence the blazer and another gunbrig were about to proceed to attack the forts hamburg thought i why minnie vanderwelt is at hamburg with her father i will go and try if i cannot get to hamburg the remembrance of minnie gave a spur to my energies and created a new stimulus i then told the governor that i had a few men doing nothing that i would join them to the expedition and serve as a volunteer the governor thanked me for my zeal and i left him to go down and communicate my intentions to the commanding officer of the gunbrig who expressed himself most happy at my assistance and cooperation chapter forty three as neither my men nor i had any luggage to hamper usfor we had just the clothes we stood inwe were not long getting ready we started next morning and on entering the river found that the french had destroyed their flotilla and soon afterwards we were invited by the people to come on shore and take possession of the batteries which the french had evacuated i remained with cross and my men on shore at cuxhaven while the brigs went up the river in pursuit of a privateer after a day or two tired of inactivity and anxious to arrive at hamburg i proposed to cross that he should accompany me which he cheerfully acceded to i had drawn a bill at heligoland so that we were in no want of money and we set off on our expedition we had not however proceeded far before we were informed that the road to hamburg was so full of french troops scattered about that it would be impossible to gain the city without we made a detour as we knew that our throats would be cut by these disorganised parties we followed the advice given to us walking from village to village until we had put hamburg between us and the river but when there we found that we could not approach the imperial city but were obliged to direct our steps more inland at last we heard that the inhabitants of the town of lunenburg had risen and driven out the french garrison and i resolved to proceed there as it was more advisable than being continually in danger of being picked up by the french stragglers who were committing every enormity that could be imagined we arrived safe stated who we were to the authorities and were well received but we had not been there more than two days when the rejoicings and braggings of the townspeople on account of the late victory over the french garrison were turned to consternation by the intelligence that general moraud was advancing with a considerable force to retake the town the panic was so great that all idea of defence was in vain and at the very time that i was entreating them to make a stand the french troops poured in and two cuirassiers galloped up and seized upon cross and me a few minutes afterwards general moraud came up and inquired in a rough tone who we were i replied in french that we were english officers take them away said he and secure them well ill make an example here that shant be forgotten we were taken to the guardroom where we remained shut up for the night the next morning one of the cuirassiers looked into our cell i asked him whether we could not have something to eat cela ne vaut pas la peine mon ami vous naurez pas le temps pour la digestion dans une demieheure vous serez fusilles may i ask the english of that captain keene replied cross yes it is very pleasant he says that its not worth while eating anything as we shall be shot in half an hour well i suppose theyll shoot us first and try us afterwards replied cross wont they give us a reason i suspect not cross i am sorry that i have got you into this scrape as for myself i care little about it i am sorry for poor jane sir replied cross but we all owe heaven a death and after all its not worth making a fuss about our conversation was here interrupted by a party of french soldiers who opened the door and ordered us to follow them we had not far to go for we were led out to the grand place before the prison where we found the french troops drawn up and general moraud with his officers round him standing in the centre at twenty yards distance and surrounded by the troops which did not amount to more than three hundred were thirty of the principal inhabitants of the town pinioned and handkerchiefs tied over their eyes preparatory to their being shot this being the terrible example that the governor had threatened look cross said i what a handful of men these frenchmen have retaken the town with why if we had resisted we might have laughed at them they wont laugh any more i expect replied bob allons said the corporal to me where replied i to your friends there replied he pointing to the townspeople who were about to be shot i wish to speak to the general replied i resisting no no you must go i will speak to the general replied i pushing the corporal on one side and walking to where the general was standing well said the general fiercely i wish to know sir replied i by what law you are guided in shooting us we are english officers here on duty to assist against the french and at the most can only be prisoners of war upon what grounds do you order us to be shot as spies replied the general i am no spy sir i am a postcaptain in the english navy who joined with the seamen saved from the wreck of my frigate in the attack upon cuxhaven and there is my boatswain who came up with me to go to hamburg at all events i am fully justified in siding against the french and to shoot us will be a murder which will not fail to be revenged you may pass yourself off as the captain of a frigate but your dress disproves it and i have better information you are two spies and smugglers and therefore you will be shot i tell you before all your officers that i am captain keene of the circe frigate belonging to his britannic majesty and no spy if you choose to shoot me now i leave my death to be revenged by my country at this moment an officer in naval uniform stepped forward and looked me in the face general moraud said he what that officer says is true he is captain keene and i was prisoner on board of his vessel and i also know the other man as well captain vangilt i do not request your interference replied the general but general as an officer in the marine of the emperor it is my duty to state to you that you are deceived and that this officer is the person that he states himself to be messieurs continued captain vangilt addressing those about the general i assure you it is true and i am under the greatest obligation to this officer for his kindness and humanity when i was his prisoner i recognise you now mr vangilt replied i and i thank you for your evidence you see general he knows me by name i must demand the life of this british officer the other officers then spoke to the general who heard all they had to say and then with a sardonic grin repliedgentlemen he may be an officer but still he is a spy at that moment an orderly came up on horseback and dismounting gave a note to the general sacre bleu cried he then well have our revenge first at all events soldiers take these two men and put them in the centre with the others vangilt pleaded and entreated in vain at last in his rage he called the general a coward and a madman captain vangilt you will answer that at some other time replied the general at present we will carry our will into execution lead them away vangilt then covered his face with his hands and all the other officers showed signs of great disgust farewell vangilt said i in french i thank you for your interference although you have not succeeded with the scoundrel take them away roared the general at that moment the report of musketry was heard in dropping shots well if ever i saw such a bloody villain said cross take that at all events continued bob shying his hat right into the generals face i only wish it was a pounder you murdering thief the rage of the general may easily be imagined once more he gave his orders drawing his sword in a menacing way at his own soldiers who now forced us towards the part of the square where the other victims were collected as soon as we were there they wanted to blind our eyes but that both i and bob positively refused and a delay was created by our resistance the musketry was now approaching much nearer and a few seconds afterwards the general gave the order for the party to advance who were to execute the sentence the other prisoners kneeled down but i and cross would not and while we were resisting the general repeated his order to fire but the men were confused with the advance of the enemy and the impossibility to fire while cross and i not only resisted the soldiers but held them so fast that had the party fired they must have shot them as well as us a cry to arms was given and the troops all wheeled round in front to repel the enemy a loud hurrah was followed by an inpouring of some hundred cossacks with their long spears who in a few seconds charged and routed the french who retreated in the greatest confusion by the different streets which led into the grand place hurrah we are saved cried cross snatching up a musket that had been dropped by a soldier i did the same and pursued the retreating french till a bullet through my leg put a stop to my progress i called to cross who came to my assistance and he helped me back to the grand place which was now clear of troops chapter forty four the cossacks having divided and gone in pursuit of the french i pointed out to cross a hotel and requested him to help me there as we crossed the square strewed with the dead and wounded we passed close to general moraud who was breathing his last see cross said i there is retribution he intended that we should fall where he now lies the general recognised us gave a heavy groan and turning on his back fell dead as soon as i gained the hotel i was taken up into a room and made as comfortable as i could be until my wound could be dressed were well out of it this time sir said cross yes indeed bob this has indeed been a miraculous preservation and we ought to thank heaven for it why captain keene i thought just now you did not care whether you lived or died no more i did at that time cross but when we are so wonderfully preserved we cannot think but that we are preserved for better things and as providence has interfered it points out to us that it is our duty to live well im glad to hear you say that sir theres all the troops coming back what queerlooking chaps they are with their long lances and long beards yes they are cossacksrussian irregular cavalry irregular enough i dont doubt but they spitted the french men nicely they look exactly what i thought the pope of rome was like cross call the master of the hotel and tell him to come here when the man came i desired him to let the commander of the allied troops know that an english captain was wounded and required surgical assistance the master of the hotel went to the burgomaster who was one of those who had been ordered to be shot and the burgomaster who was now in company with the russian commander made known what i required in about an hour a surgeon came and my wound was dressed the burgomaster called soon afterwards and expressed his obligation to me for said he if you had not created the delaywhich you did by your resistanceit would have been all over with us by this time you have to thank a dutch naval officer of the name of vangilt replied i it is he who saved us all and if he is not hurt you must be kind to him and bring him to me i will get him his parole if he is a prisoner will you see to it burgomaster i will replied he as soon as we are a little more tranquil but what with fright and confusion none of us know what we are about you were right sir in persuading us to defend ourselves we might easily have beaten off the small force of general moraud but we thought he had ten thousand men at least we will do better another time but the french are now in full retreat everywhere that night after dusk captain vangilt came into my room he had been a prisoner but the burgomaster made inquiries and let him out which as chief magistrate he had the power to do vangilt embraced me with much warmth and expressed his regret that he could not persuade that wretch moraud from his murderous intentions it came to the same thing vangilt i owe you my life for if you had not created the delay we should have been shot thats true replied he how fortunate it was that as my squadron of gunboats were destroyed i consented to join moraud with what men i could collect to surprise the town are you badly wounded no not seriously i believe i hope to be able to get to hamburg in a few days there is more than one there who will be delighted to see you is mr vanderwelt alive and well oh yes and minnie my pretty cousin is still unmarried vangilt smiled as he made this reply i must ask for your parole vangilt and then you can go to hamburg with us with all my heart replied he for we are tired of war and as i am a dutchman and not a frenchman i care little for the reverses we have met with all i hope is that holland may become a kingdom again and not a french state as it is now the next day i was visited by the russian commandant who very willingly granted me the parole of vangilt in a week i was well enough to travel by slow journeys to hamburg lying on mattresses in a small covered waggon and escorted by cross and vangilt a few hours before my arrival vangilt went ahead to give notice of my coming and on the evening of the second day i found myself in a luxurious chamber with every comfort in the company of mr vanderwelt and with the beaming eyes of minnie watching over me the report of minnies beauty was fully warranted when she first made her appearance the effect upon me was quite electrical her style was radiant and almost dazzlinga something you did not expect to find in the human countenance their reception of me was all that i could desire their affection shown towards me their anxiety about my wound and joy at once more having me under their roof proved that i had not been forgotten after a short time vangilt left the room and i remained on the sofa one hand in the grasp of mr vanderwelt the other holding the not unwilling one of minnie that evening i made known to them all that had taken place since i last wrote to them winding up with the loss of my frigate the death of lord de versely and my subsequent capture and rescue and so it was in attempting to come and see us that you were wounded and nearly murdered yes minnie i had long been anxious to see you and could not help availing myself of the first opportunity thank god you are here at last said mr vanderwelt and that there is now every prospect of a conclusion to the war and you wont go to sea any morewill you percival said minnie they wont give me a ship minnie after having lost the one i commanded to be unfortunate is to be guilty in those who have no interest im very glad to hear it then youll remain quietly on shore and you will come and see us as i had been rendered feverish by travelling and my wound was a little angry as soon as it was dressed for the night they left me to repose but that i could notthe form of minnie haunted me to sleep was impossible and i lay thinking of her till day dawned the fact was that i was for the first time in love and that in no small degree before morning i was desperately so indeed there was excuse sufficient for minnie was as winning in her manners as she was lovely in her person and i was not at all surprised at hearing from vangilt of the numerous suitors for her hand chapter forty five the next morning i was pale and feverish which they observed with concern minnie was sitting by me and mr vanderwelt had left the room when she said how very pale you are and your hand is so hot i wish the doctor would come i could not sleep last night minnieand it was all your fault my fault yes your fault for i could not sleep for thinking of you i thought you were looking at me as you do now the whole night minnie blushed and i kissed her hand as soon as my wound was dressed i requested writing materials and wrote to the admiralty giving an account of what had occurred since i quitted heligoland i had written to inform them of the loss of the frigate when i was on the island i stated in my despatches that my wound would probably confine me for some weeks but as soon as i was able to be moved i should return to england to await their orders i also wrote to my mother and mr warden i informed the latter of what had passed and the delay which would be occasioned by my wound and requested him to write to me more fully as to the death of lord de versely and any other particulars which might interest me having sealed these despatches and entrusted them to the care of mr vanderwelt my mind was relieved and i had nothing to do but to think of and talk to minnie that my progress in her affections was rapid was not to be wondered at her attachment to me having commenced so early and as her father was evidently pleased at our increasing intimacy in a fortnight after my arrival at hamburg minnie had consented to be mine and her father had joined our hands and given us his blessing as i now had no secrets from them i detailed my whole history the cause of lord de verselys patronage and the mystery of my birth i opened the sealskin pouch to show them lord de verselys letter to my mother and stated what had been the object of my ambition through life and how great was my disappointment at my hopes being overthrown by the death of his lordship my dear percival said old mr vanderwelt after i had concluded my narrative you have been pursuing a shadow although the pursuit has called forth all your energies and led to your advancement you have the substance you have wealth more than sufficient for you know how rich i am you have reputation which is better than wealth and you have now i trust a fair prospect of domestic happiness for minnie will be as good a wife as she has been a daughter what then do you desire a name and what is that nothing if you do not like your present name from its association with your putative father of low origin change it to mine you will receive the fortune of an heiress which will fully warrant your so doing at all events let not your pride stand in the way of your happiness we cannot expect everything in this world you have much to be thankful to heaven for and you must not repine because you cannot obtain all i have so ardently desired it all my life it has been the sole object of my ambition replied i and i cannot but severely feel the disappointment granted but you must bear the disappointment or rather you must forget it regret for what cannot be obtained is not only unavailing but i may say it is sinful you have much to thank god for i have indeed sir replied i as i kissed his daughter and i will not repine i will take your name when you give me minnie and i will think no more about that of delmar after this conversation the subject was not renewed i felt too happy with minnies love to care much about anything else my ambition melted away before it and i looked forward to the time when i might embrace her as my own my wound healed rapidly i had been a month at hamburg and was able to limp about a little when one day cross came in with a packet of letters from england there was one from the admiralty acknowledging the receipt of my two letters one announcing the loss of the circe and the other my subsequent adventures desiring me to come home as soon as my wound would permit me to have the cause of the loss of the circe investigated by a courtmartial that of course one from my mother thanking heaven that i had escaped so many dangers with only a bullet in my leg and stating her intention of going up to town to see me as soon as she heard of my arrival the third was a voluminous epistle from mr warden which i shall give to the reader in his own words my dear captain keene i received your two letters the first acquainting me with your miraculous preservation after the loss of your frigate and the other with your subsequent adventures on terra firma you appear to me to have a charmed life and as there is now every prospect of a speedy termination to this long and devastating war i hope you will live many days i did not enter into many particulars as to lord de verselys death as it was so sudden the property left you is not perhaps of so much value in itself as it is as a mark of his regard and esteem nevertheless if ever you sit down quietly and take a wife you will find that it will save you a few thousands in furnishing and decorating the plate pictures and objects de vertu as they are termed are really valuable and i know that you will not part with them bequeathed as they have been by your friend and patron i must now refer to particulars of more consequence you know that as a legal adviser my lips are supposed to be sealed and they would have remained so now had it not been that circumstances have occurred which warrant my disclosure indeed i may say that i have permission to speak plainly as you have to repel charges against you which if not disproved may seriously affect your future interests know then that when you were last at madeline hall i was sent for to draw up the will of the honourable miss delmar and i then discovered that the will which had been made in favour of lord de versely to whom miss delmar had left everything was by his express desire to be altered in your favour and at the same time the secret of your birth was confided to me you will see therefore that lord de versely did not neglect your interests the de versely property he could not leave you but he did what he could in your favour this will was signed sealed and attested and is now in my possession and as the old lady is very shakey and something approaching to imbecile i considered that in a short time i should have to congratulate you upon your succession to this fine property which is a clear pounds per annum you must also know that colonel delmar whom you also met here and who accompanied you to portsmouth has always hoped that he would be the heir of the old lady and indeed had you not stepped in i have no doubt but eventually such would have been the case it appears that he has by some means discovered that you have ousted him and since you sailed he has returned to madeline hall and has so unsettled the old lady by reporting that you are an impostor and no relation by blood that she has given me instructions to make a new will in his favour by what means he has prevailed upon her i cannot tell the chief support of his assertion rests upon some letters which he has either surreptitiously obtained or forged written by your mother and addressed to you now that your mother has been supposed to be dead many years i knew well for lord de versely told me so the old lady has shown me these letters which certainly appear authentic and she says that if you have deceived her and lord de versely as to your mothers death you have deceived them in everything else and that she does not now believe that you are the son of her nephew as i hinted before the old lady is almost in her dotage and cannot well be reasoned with for she is very positive i argued as long as i could with her but in vain at last she consented to stop proceedings until i heard from you saying if i can have any proof under my nephews own hand that percival is his son i will be content but without that i sign the new will such is the state of affairs that you have little chance if such a document cannot be produced i feel certain at all events i have gained delay which we lawyers always aim at i only wish the old lady would take a sudden departure and leave the question as unsettled as it is had lord de versely not been so suddenly called away this would never have happened as it is we must make the best fight we can at present the colonel has it all his own way pray write immediately and explain as much as you can of this strange affair and let me know what steps you think it advisable to be takenyours very truly f warden chapter forty six the receipt of this letter was extremely mortifying to me i could not help feeling that if i lost the fine property which had been intended for me i lost it chiefly by the deceit practised relative to my mothers supposed death and that if i did lose the estate in consequence it was a proper punishment at the same time i felt not a little indignant at the conduct of colonel delmar i now understood why it was that he was talking with mr wardens clerk when i passed by them and i also felt certain that he must have taken advantage of my situation at portsmouth and have opened my desk and stolen the letters from my mother for this i resolved to call him to account under any circumstances that is whether he or i became the heir to the old lady as soon as i could fall in with him although i was far from despising the property which i was now likely to lose yet i was more actuated in my wish to regain it by my enmity towards him and i immediately resolved upon what i would do as i was still unfit to travel and moreover was resolved not to leave hamburg without minnie as my wife i sent for cross and telling him in few words what had taken place asked him if he would immediately start for england which he gladly consented to do the old lady requires it seems proof from lord de verselys own hand that i am his son fortunately that is in my power to give so do you take this and as soon as you arrive in england make all haste to mr wardens and put it into his own hands i then took off the sealskin pouch containing lord de verselys letter to my mother and confided it to his care at the same time i wrote a long letter to mr warden explaining as far as i could the means which the colonel had used to get possession of the letters and the reason which induced me to make his lordship believe that my mother was dead i did not attempt to extenuate my conduct on the contrary i severely blamed myself for my deception and acknowledged that if i lost the estate it was nothing more than i deserved cross made all haste and sailed the next morning having put this affair in train i had nothing to do but to give all my thoughts to minnie in another fortnight i was completely recovered and then i mentioned to mr vanderwelt my anxiety that the marriage should take place no difficulties were raised and it was settled that on that day week i should lead my minnie to the altar i thought that the week would never expire but like all other weeks it died a natural death at last and we were united the fete was over the company had all left us and we were again alone and i held my dearest minnie in my arms when mr vanderwelt brought me in a letter from england it was from mr warden and i hastily opened it minnie shared my impatience and read over my shoulder the contents were as follows my dear captain keene most fortunate it was for you that you have preserved that letter but i must not anticipate on receiving it from cross i immediately went with it to the old lady and presented it to her i did morei read over your letter in which you stated your reasons for making lord de versely believe that your mother was dead the old lady who is now very far gone in her intellect could hardly understand me however her nephews handwriting roused her up a little and she said well welli seei must think about it i wont decide i must hear what the colonel says now this is what i did not wish her to do but she was positive and i was obliged to leave her the colonel was sent for but i do not know what the result was or rather might have been as fortune stood your friend in a most unexpected way as i went out i perceived two gentlemen arrive in a postchaise one of them appeared very ill and feeble hardly able to walk up the steps they inquired for colonel delmar and were shown into a sittingroom until he came out of mrs delmars apartment i saw him come out and there was so much satisfaction in his countenance that i felt sure that he had gained over the old lady and i went home resolving that i would burn the new will which had not been signed if it were only to gain the delay of having to make it over again but the next morning an express arrived for me to go immediately to the hall i did so but i did not take the new will with me as i felt certain that if i had so done it would have been signed that day but i was mistaken i had been sent for on account of the death of colonel delmar who had that morning fallen in a duel with major stapleton the officer who fought with you it appears that captain green had informed the major of the language used by the colonel when major s was supposed to be dead and that the major who has been very ill ever since only waited till he was able to stand to demand satisfaction of the colonel it was the major with his friend whom i met as i left the hall the day before they fought at daylight and both fell the major however lived long enough to acknowledge that the duel with you had been an arranged thing between him and the colonel that you might be put out of the way after the information the colonel had received from my clerk and that the colonel was to have rewarded him handsomely if he had sent you into the other world i suspect after this that the fowlingpiece going off in the cover was not quite so accidental as was supposed however the colonel is out of your way now and the old lady has received such a shock that there is no fear of her altering the will indeed if she attempted it i doubt if it would be valid as she is now quite gone in her intellect i have therefore destroyed the one not signed and have no doubt but that in a very few weeks i may have to congratulate you upon your succession to this property i think that the sooner you can come home the better and i advise you to take up your quarters at madeline hall for possession is nine points of the law and you can keep off all trespassersyours most truly f warden well minnie dearest i may congratulate you i believe as the lady of madeline hall said i folding up the letter yes percival but there is a postscript overleaf which you have not read i turned back to the letter ps i quite forgot to tell you that there is a condition attached to your taking possession of the property which as it was at the particular request of lord de versely i presume you will not object to which isthat you assume the arms and name of delmar the end

masterman ready by captain marryat captain frederick marryat was born july and died august he retired from the british navy in in order to devote himself to writing in the following years he wrote books many of which are among the very best of english literature and some of which are still in print marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories he says somewhere that when he sat down for the day's work he never knew what he was going to write he certainly was a literary genius masterman ready was published in the nineteenth book to flow from marryat's pen it is simpler to read than most of marryat's books since it was intended for children this e text was transcribed in by nick hodson and was reformatted in and again in masterman ready by captain frederick marryat chapter one it was in the month of october that the pacific a large ship was running before a heavy gale of wind in the middle of the vast atlantic ocean she had but little sail for the wind was so strong that the canvas would have been split into pieces by the furious blasts before which she was driven through the waves which were very high and following her almost as fast as she darted through their boiling waters sometimes heaving up her stern and sinking her bows down so deep into the hollow of the sea that it appeared as if she would have dived down underneath the waves but she was a fine vessel and the captain was a good seaman who did what he considered best for the safety of his vessel and then put his trust in that providence who is ever watchful over us the captain stood before the wheel watching the men who were steering the ship for when you are running before a heavy gale it requires great attention to the helm and as he looked around him and up at the heavens he sang in a low voice the words of a sea song one wide water all around us all above us one black sky and so it was with them they were in the middle of the atlantic not another vessel to be seen and the heavens were covered with black clouds which were borne along furiously by the gale the sea ran mountains high and broke into large white foaming crests while the fierce wind howled through the rigging of the vessel besides the captain of the ship and the two men at the wheel there were two other personages on deck one was a young lad about twelve years old and the other a weather beaten old seaman whose grisly locks were streaming in the wind as he paced aft and looked over the taffrail of the vessel the young lad observing a heavy sea coming up to the stern of the vessel caught hold of the old man's arm crying out won't that great wave come into us ready no master william it will not don't you see how the ship lifts her quarters to it and now it has passed underneath us but it might happen and then what would become of you if i did not hold on and hold you on also you would be washed overboard i don't like the sea much ready i wish we were safe on shore again replied the lad don't the waves look as if they wished to beat the ship all to pieces yes they do and they roar as if angry because they cannot bury the vessel beneath them but i am used to them and with a good ship like this and a good captain and crew i don't care for them but sometimes ships do sink and then everybody is drowned yes and very often the very ships sink which those on board think are most safe we can only do our best and after that we must submit to the will of heaven what little birds are those flying about so close to the water those are mother carey's chickens you seldom see them except in a storm or when a storm is coming on the birds which william referred to were the stormy petrels were you ever shipwrecked on a desolate island like robinson crusoe yes master william i have been shipwrecked but i never heard of robinson crusoe so many have been wrecked and undergone great hardships and so many more have never lived to tell what they have suffered that it's not very likely that i should have known that one man you speak of out of so many oh but it's all in a book which i have read i could tell you all about it and so i will when the ship is quiet again but now i wish you would help me down below for i promised mamma not to stay up long then always keep your promise like a good lad replied the old man now give me your hand and i'll answer for it that we will fetch the hatchway without a tumble and when the weather is fine again i'll tell you how i was wrecked and you shall tell me all about robinson crusoe having seen william safe to the cabin door the old seaman returned to the deck for it was his watch masterman ready for such was his name had been more than fifty years at sea having been bound apprentice to a collier which sailed from south shields when he was only ten years old his face was browned from long exposure and there were deep furrows on his cheeks but he was still a hale and active man he had served many years on board of a man of war and had been in every climate he had many strange stories to tell and he might be believed even when his stories were strange for he would not tell an untruth he could navigate a vessel and of course he could read and write the name of ready was very well suited to him for he was seldom at a loss and in cases of difficulty and danger the captain would not hesitate to ask his opinion and frequently take his advice he was second mate of the vessel the pacific was as we have observed a very fine ship and well able to contend with the most violent storm she was of more than four hundred tons burthen and was then making a passage out to new south wales with a valuable cargo of english hardware cutlery and other manufactures the captain was a good navigator and seaman and moreover a good man of a cheerful happy disposition always making the best of everything and when accidents did happen always more inclined to laugh than to look grave his name was osborn the first mate whose name was mackintosh was a scotsman rough and ill tempered but paying strict attention to his duty a man that captain osborn could trust but whom he did not like ready we have already spoken of and it will not be necessary to say anything about the seamen on board except that there were thirteen of them hardly a sufficient number to man so large a vessel but just as they were about to sail five of the seamen who did not like the treatment they had received from mackintosh the first mate had left the ship and captain osborn did not choose to wait until he could obtain others in their stead this proved unfortunate as the events which we shall hereafter relate will show chapter two master william whom we have introduced to the reader was the eldest boy of a family who were passengers on board consisting of the father mother and four children his father was a mr seagrave a very well informed clever man who having for many years held an office under government at sydney the capital of new south wales was now returning from a leave of absence of three years he had purchased from the government several thousand acres of land it had since risen very much in value and the sheep and cattle which he had put on it were proving a source of great profit his property had been well managed by the person who had charge of it during his absence in england and he was now taking out with him a variety of articles of every description for its improvement and for his own use such as furniture for his house implements of agriculture seeds plants cattle and many other things too numerous to mention mrs seagrave was an amiable woman but not in very strong health the family consisted of william who was the eldest a clever steady boy but at the same time full of mirth and humour thomas who was six years old a very thoughtless but good tempered boy full of mischief and always in a scrape caroline a little girl of seven years and albert a fine strong little fellow who was not one year old he was under the charge of a black girl who had come from the cape of good hope to sydney and had followed mrs seagrave to england we have now mentioned all the people on board of the pacific perhaps we ought not to forget two shepherd's dogs belonging to mr seagrave and a little terrier which was a great favourite of captain osborn to whom she belonged it was not until the fourth day from its commencement that the gale abated and then it gradually subsided until it was nearly a calm the men who had been watching night after night during the gale now brought all their clothes which had been drenched by the rain and spray and hung them up in the rigging to dry the sails also which had been furled and had been saturated by the wet were now loosened and spread out that they might not be mildewed the wind blew mild and soft the sea had gone down and the ship was running through the water at the speed of about four miles an hour mrs seagrave wrapped up in a cloak was seated upon one of the arm chests near the stern of the ship her husband and children were all with her enjoying the fine weather when captain osborn who had been taking an observation of the sun with his sextant came up to them well master tommy you are very glad that the gale is over i didn't care replied tommy only i spilt all my soup but juno tumbled off her chair and rolled away with the baby till papa picked them both up it was a mercy that poor albert was not killed observed mrs seagrave and so he might have been if juno had not thought only of him and nothing at all about herself replied mr seagrave that's very true sir replied captain osborn she saved the child and i fear hurt herself i thump my head very hard said juno smiling yes and it's lucky that you have a good thick woolly coat over it replied captain osborn laughing it is o'clock by the sun sir said mackintosh the first mate to the captain then bring me up the latitude mr mackintosh while i work out the longitude from the sights which i took this morning in five minutes mr seagrave i shall be ready to prick off over our place on the chart here are the dogs come up on deck said william i dare say they are as glad of the fine weather as we are come here romulus here remus remus well sir said ready who was standing by them with his quadrant in his hand i should like to ask you a question those dogs of yours have two very odd names which i never heard before who were romulus and remus romulus and remus replied mr seagrave were the names of two shepherds brothers who in ancient days founded the city of rome which eventually became the largest and most celebrated empire in the world they were the first kings of rome and reigned together history says that remus affronted romulus by leaping over a wall he had raised and romulus in his anger took away his life but the history of early days is not to be depended upon no nor the brothers either it appears replied ready however it is the old story two of a trade can never agree one sometimes hears of rome now is that the same place yes replied william it is the remains of the old city well one lives and learns said ready i have learnt something to day which everyone will to the last day of his life if he will only ask questions i'm an old man and perhaps don't know much except in the seafaring way but i should have known much less if i did not ask for information and was not ashamed to acknowledge my ignorance that's the way to learn master william very good advice ready and william i hope you will profit by it said mr seagrave never be ashamed to ask the meaning of what you do not understand i always do papa do i not ask you questions ready yes you do and very clever questions for a boy of your age and i only wish that i could answer them better than i can sometimes i should like to go down now my dear said mrs seagrave perhaps ready will see the baby down safe that i will ma'am said ready putting his quadrant on the capstan now juno give me the child and go down first backwards you stupid girl how often do i tell you that some day or another you will come down with a run and break my head said juno yes or break your arm and then who is to hold the child as soon as they were all down in the cabin the captain and mr seagrave marked the position of the vessel on the chart and found that they were one hundred and thirty miles from the cape of good hope if the wind holds we shall be in to morrow said mr seagrave to his wife juno perhaps you may see your father and mother poor juno shook her head and a tear or two stole down her dark cheek with a mournful face she told them that her father and mother belonged to a dutch boer who had gone with them many miles into the interior she had been parted from them when quite a little child and had been left at cape town chapter three the next morning the pacific arrived at the cape and anchored in table bay why do they call this table bay ready said william i suppose it's because they call that great mountain the table mountain master william you see how flat the mountain is on the top yes it is quite as flat as a table yes and sometimes you will see the white clouds rolling down over the top of it in a very curious manner and that the sailors call spreading the tablecloth it is a sign of bad weather then i hope they will not spread the tablecloth while we are here ready said william for i shall certainly have no appetite we have had bad weather enough already and mamma suffers so much from it what a pretty place it is we shall remain here two days sir said captain osborn to mr seagrave if you and mrs seagrave would like to go on shore i will go down and ask mrs seagrave said her husband who went down the ladder followed by william upon the question being put to mrs seagrave she replied that she was quite satisfied with the ship having no motion and did not feel herself equal to going on shore it was therefore decided that she should remain on board with the two younger children and that on the following day mr seagrave should take william and tommy to see cape town and return on board before night the next morning captain osborn lowered down one of the large boats and mr seagrave accompanied by captain osborn went on shore with william and tommy tommy had promised his mamma to be very good but that he always did and almost always forgot his promise directly he was out of sight as soon as they landed they went up to a gentleman's house with whom captain osborn was acquainted they stayed for a few minutes to drink a glass of lemonade for it was very warm and then it was proposed that they should go to the company's gardens and see the wild beasts which were confined there at which william was much delighted and tommy clapped his hands with joy what are the company's gardens papa inquired william they were made by the dutch east india company at the time that the cape of good hope was in their possession they are properly speaking botanical gardens but at the same time the wild animals are kept there formerly there were a great many but they have not been paid attention to lately for we have plenty of these animals in england now what shall we see said tommy you will see lions tommy a great many in a large den together said captain osborn oh i want to see a lion you must not go too near them recollect no i won't said tommy as soon as they entered the gates tommy escaped from captain osborn and ran away in his hurry to see the lions but captain osborn caught him again and held him fast by the hand here is a pair of very strange birds said the gentleman who accompanied them they are called secretaries on account of the feathers which hang behind their heads as the feather of a pen does when a clerk puts it behind his ear but they are very useful for they are snake killers indeed they would if they could live altogether upon snakes which they are very great enemies to never letting one escape they strike them with their feet and with such force as to kill them immediately are there many snakes in this country inquired william yes and very venomous snakes replied mr seagrave so that these birds are very useful in destroying them you observe william that the almighty in his wisdom has so arranged it that no animal especially of a noxious kind shall be multiplied to excess but kept under by being preyed upon by some other indeed wherever in any country an animal exists in any quantity there is generally found another animal which destroys it the secretary inhabits this country where snakes exist in numbers that it may destroy them in england the bird would be of little value but some animals are too large or too fierce to be destroyed by others papa for instance the elephant and the lion very true but these larger animals do not breed so fast and therefore their numbers do not increase so rapidly for instance a pair of elephants will not have more than one young one in the space of two years or more while the rabbits which are preyed upon and the food of so many other beasts as well as birds would increase enormously if they were not destroyed examine through the whole of creation and you will find that there is an unerring hand which invariably preserves the balance exact and that there are no more mouths than for which food is provided although accidental circumstances may for a time occasion a slight alteration they continued their walk until they came to the den of the lions it was a large place in closed with a strong and high wall of stone with only one window to it for the visitors to look at them as it was open above this window was wide and with strong iron bars running from the top to the bottom but the width between the bars was such that a lion could put his paw out with ease and they were therefore cautioned not to go too near it was a fine sight to see eight or ten of these noble looking animals lying down in various attitudes quite indifferent apparently to the people outside basking in the sun and slowly moving their tufted tails to and fro william examined them at a respectful distance from the bars and so did tommy who had his mouth open with astonishment in which there was at first not a little fear mixed but he soon got bolder the gentleman who had accompanied them and who had been long at the cape was relating to mr seagrave and captain osborn some very curious anecdotes about the lion william and they were so interested that they did not perceive that tommy had slipped back to the grated window of the den tommy looked at the lions and then he wanted to make them move about there was one fine full grown young lion about three years old who was lying down nearest to the window and tommy took up a stone and threw it at him the lion appeared not to notice it for he did not move although he fixed his eyes upon tommy so tommy became more brave and threw another and then another approaching each time nearer to the bars of the window all of a sudden the lion gave a tremendous roar and sprang at tommy bounding against the iron bars of the cage with such force that had they not been very strong it must have broken them as it was they shook and rattled so that pieces of mortar fell from the stones tommy shrieked and fortunately for himself fell back and tumbled head over heels or the lion's paws would have reached him captain osborn and mr seagrave ran up to tommy and picked him up he roared with fright as soon as he could fetch his breath while the lion stood at the bars lashing his tail snarling and showing his enormous fangs take me away take me on board the ship cried tommy who was terribly frightened what did you do tommy said captain osborn i won't throw any more stones mr lion i won't indeed cried tommy looking terrified towards the animal mr seagrave scolded tommy well for his foolish conduct and by degrees he became more composed but he did not recover himself until they had walked some distance away from the lion's den they then looked at the other animals which were to be seen tommy keeping a most respectful distance from every one of them he wouldn't even go near to a cape sheep with a broad tail when they had seen everything they went back to the gentleman's house to dinner and after dinner they returned on board chapter four the following morning the fresh water and provisions were received on board and once more the pacific stretched her broad canvas to the winds and there was every prospect of a rapid voyage as for many days she continued her passage with a fair wind and flowing sheet but this did not continue it fell calm and remained so for nearly three days during which not a breath of wind was to be seen on the wide expanse of water all nature appeared as if in repose except that now and then an albatross would drop down at some distance from the stern of the vessel and as he swam lazily along with his wings half furled pick up the fragments of food which had been thrown over the side what great bird is that ready inquired william it is an albatross the largest sea bird we have their wings are very long i have seen them shot and they have measured eleven feet from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other when the wings have been spread out it is the first one that i have seen said william because you seldom meet them north of the cape sir people do say that they go to sleep on the wing balancing themselves high up in the air papa said william turning to mr seagrave who stood by why is it that one bird can swim and another cannot you recollect when tommy drove the hens into the large pond they flounced about and their feathers became wet and would support them no longer and then they were drowned now how does a sea bird contrive to remain so long on the water because a sea bird william is provided with a sort of oil on purpose to anoint the outside of its feathers and this oil prevents the water from penetrating them have you not observed the ducks on shore dressing their feathers with their bills they were then using this oil to make their feathers waterproof how odd don't say how odd william that is not an expression to use when we talk of the wonderful provisions made by the almighty hand who neglects not the meanest of his creatures say rather how wonderful that's very true sir observed ready but still you must not be too hard upon master william for i have heard many a grownup man make use of the same expression on the third day of the calm the barometer fell so low as to induce captain osborn to believe that they should have a severe gale and every preparation was made to meet it should it come on nor was he mistaken towards midnight the clouds gathered up fast and as they gathered up in thick piles heaped one over the other the lightning darted through them in every direction and as the clouds rose up so did the wind but at first only in heavy gusts and then lulling again to a calm ready said captain osborn how do you think we shall have the wind why captain osborn to tell you the truth i don't think it will be steady to one point long it may at first blow hard from the north but it's my idea it will shift soon to some other quarter and blow still harder what think you mackintosh we'll have plenty of it and a long steady gale that's my notion and the sooner we ship the dead lights the better mr seagrave with william happened to be standing by at the time of this conversation and at the term dead lights willy's face expressed some anxiety ready perceived it and said that's a foolish name they give to the shutters which go over the cabin windows to prevent the water from breaking into the cabin when a vessel sails before the wind you know we had them on the last time that we had a gale but ready said captain osborn why do you think that we shall have a shift of wind well i don't know perhaps i was wrong replied the old man and mr mackintosh is right the wind does seem to come steady from the north east that's certain and ready walked away to the binnacle and looked at the compass mr seagrave and william then went below and mr mackintosh went forward to give his orders as soon as they were all gone ready went up again to captain osborn and said captain osborn it's not for me to contradict mr mackintosh but that's of little consequence in a time like this i should have held to my opinion had it not been that the gentleman passenger and his son were standing by but now as the coast is clear i tell you that we shall have something worse than a gale of wind i have been in these latitudes before and i am an old seaman as you know there's something in the air and there has been something during the last three days of calm which reminds me too well of what i have seen here before and i am sure that we shall have little better than a hurricane as far as wind goes and worse in one point that it will last much longer than hurricanes generally do i have been watching and even the birds tell me so and they are told by their nature which is never mistaken that calm has been nothing more than a repose of the winds previous to their being roused up to do their worst and that is my real opinion well and i'm inclined to agree with you ready so we must send topgallant yards down on deck and all the small sails and lumber out of the tops get the trysail aft and bent and lower down the gaff i will go forward their preparations were hardly complete before the wind had settled to a fierce gale from the north east the sea rose rapidly topsail after topsail was furled and by dusk the pacific was flying through the water with the wind on her quarter under reefed foresail and storm staysail it was with difficulty that three men at the wheel could keep the helm such were the blows which the vessel received from the heavy seas on the quarter not one seaman in the ship took advantage of his watch below to go to sleep that night careless as they generally are the storm was too dreadful about three o'clock in the morning the wind suddenly subsided it was but for a minute or two and then it again burst on the vessel from another quarter of the compass as ready had foretold splitting the foresail into fragments which lashed and flogged the wind till they were torn away by it and carried far to leeward the heavens above were of a pitchy darkness and the only light was from the creaming foam of the sea on every side the shift of wind which had been to the west north west compelled them to alter the course of the vessel for they had no chance but to scud as they now did under bare poles but in consequence of the sea having taken its run from the former wind which had been north east it was as sailors call it cross and every minute the waves poured over the ship sweeping all before their weight of waters one poor man was washed overboard and any attempt made to save him would have been unavailing captain osborn was standing by the weather gunnel holding on by one of the belaying pins when he said to mackintosh how long will this last think you longer than the ship will replied the mate gravely i should hope not replied the captain still it cannot look worse what do you think ready far more fear from above than from below just now replied ready pointing to the yard arms of the ship to each of which were little balls of electric matter attached flaring out to a point look at those two clouds sir rushing at each other if i ready had not time to finish what he would have said before a blaze of light so dazzling that it left them all in utter darkness for some seconds afterwards burst upon their vision accompanied with a peal of thunder at which the whole vessel trembled fore and aft a crash a rushing forward and a shriek were heard and when they had recovered their eyesight the foremast had been rent by the lightning as if it had been a lath and the ship was in flames the men at the wheel blinded by the lightning as well as appalled could not steer the ship broached to away went the mainmast over the side and all was wreck confusion and dismay fortunately the heavy seas which poured over the forecastle soon extinguished the flames or they all must have perished but the ship lay now helpless and at the mercy of the waves beating violently against the wrecks of the masts which floated to leeward but were still held fast to the vessel by their rigging as soon as they could recover from the shock ready and the first mate hastened to the wheel to try to get the ship before the wind but this they could not do as the foremast and mainmast being gone the mizenmast prevented her paying off and answering to the helm ready having persuaded two of the men to take the helm made a sign to mackintosh for now the wind was so loud that they could not hear each other speak and going aft they obtained axes and cut away the mizen rigging the mizen topmast and head of the mizenmast went over the side and then the stump of the foremast was sufficient to get the ship before the wind again still there was much delay and confusion before they could clear away the wreck of the masts and as soon as they could make inquiry they found that four of the men had been killed by the lightning and the fall of the foremast and there were now but eight remaining besides captain osborn and his two mates chapter five sailors are never discouraged by danger as long as they have any chance of relieving themselves by their own exertions the loss of their shipmates so instantaneously summoned away the wrecked state of the vessel the wild surges burying them beneath their angry waters the howling of the wind the dazzling of the lightning and the pealing of the thunder did not prevent them from doing what their necessity demanded mackintosh the first mate rallied the men and contrived to fix a block and strap to the still smoking stump of the foremast a rope was rove through the block and the main topgallant sail hoisted so that the vessel might run faster before the gale and answer her helm better than she did the ship was again before the wind and comparatively safe notwithstanding the heavy blows she now received from the pursuing waves night again came on but there was no repose and the men were worn out with exposure and fatigue the third day of the gale dawned but the appearances were as alarming as ever the continual breaking of the seas over the stern had washed away the binnacles and it was impossible now to be certain of the course the ship had been steered or the distance which had been run the leaky state of the vessel proved how much she had already suffered from the violent shocks which she had received and the certainty was apparent that if the weather did not abate she could not possibly withstand the force of the waves much longer the countenance of captain osborn showed great anxiety he had a heavy responsibility on his shoulders he might lose a valuable ship and still more valuable cargo even if they did not all lose their lives for they were now approaching where the sea was studded with low coral islands upon which they might be thrown by the waves and wind without having the slightest power to prevent it in their present disabled condition ready was standing by him when captain osborn said i don't much like this ready we are now running on danger and have no help for it that's true enough replied ready we have no help for it it is god's will sir and his will be done amen replied captain osborn solemnly and then he continued after a pause there were many captains who envied me when i obtained command of this fine ship would they change with me now i should rather think not captain osborn but you never know what the day may bring forth you sailed with this vessel full of hope you now not without reason feel something approaching to despair but who knows it may please the almighty to rebuke those angry winds and waves and to morrow we may again hope for the best at all events you have done your duty no man can do more you are right replied captain osborn but hold hard ready that sea's aboard of us ready had just time to cling with both hands to the belaying pins when the sea poured over the vessel with a volume of water which for some time swept them off their legs they clung on firmly and at last recovered their feet she started a timber or two with that blow i rather think said ready i'm afraid so the best vessel ever built could not stand such shocks long replied captain osborn and at present with our weak crew i do not see that we can get more sail upon her all that night the ship flew in darkness before the gale at daybreak the wind abated and the sea went down the ship was however still kept before the wind for she had suffered too much to venture to put her broadside to the sea preparations were now made for getting up jury masts and the worn out seamen were busily employed under the direction of captain osborn and his two mates when mr seagrave and william came upon deck william stared about him he perceived to his astonishment that the tall masts with all their rigging and sails had disappeared and that the whole deck was in a state of confusion and disorder see my child said mr seagrave the wreck and devastation which are here see how the pride of man is humbled before the elements of the great jehovah ay master willy said old ready look around you as you well may do you remember the verses in the bible if not i remember them well for i have often read them and have often felt the truth of them they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep' but father said willy after a pause how shall we ever get to sydney without masts or sails why william replied ready we must do what we can we sailors are never much at a loss and i dare say before night you will find us under some sort of sail again we have lost our great masts so we must put up jury masts as we call them that is little ones and little sails upon them and if it pleases god we shall see sydney yet how is madam sir continued ready to mr seagrave is she better i fear she is very weak and ill replied mr seagrave nothing but fine weather will do her any good do you think that it will be fine now why sir to tell you the truth i fear we shall have more of it yet i have not given my thoughts to the captain as i might be mistaken but still i think so i've not been fifty years at sea without learning something i don't like the gathering of that bank there mr seagrave and i shouldn't wonder if it were to blow again from the very same quarter and that before dark god's will be done replied mr seagrave but i am very fearful about my poor wife who is worn to a shadow i shouldn't think so much about that sir as i really never knew of people dying that way although they suffer much william do you know that we have lost some of our men since you were down below no i heard the steward say something outside about the foremast we have lost five of our smartest and best men wilson was washed overboard fennings and masters struck dead with the lightning and jones and emery crushed by the fall of the foremast you are young master willy but you cannot think too early of your maker or call to mind what they say in the burial service in the midst of life we are in death' thank you ready for the lesson you have given my son said mr seagrave and william treasure it up in your memory yes william they are the words of an old man who has seen many and many a one who was full of youth and spirits called away before him and who is grateful to god that he has been pleased to preserve his life and allow him to amend his ways i have been thinking said mr seagrave after a silence of a minute or two that a sailor has no right to marry i've always thought so sir replied ready and i dare say many a poor deserted sailor's wife when she has listened to the wind and rain in her lonely bed has thought the same with my permission continued mr seagrave my boys shall never go to sea if there is any other profession to be found for them well mr seagrave they do say that it's no use baulking a lad if he wishes to go to sea and that if he is determined he must go now i think otherwise i think a parent has a right to say no if he pleases upon that point for you see sir a lad at the early age at which he goes to sea does not know his own mind every high spirited boy wishes to go to sea it's quite natural but if the most of them were to speak the truth it is not that they so much want to go to sea as that they want to go from school or from home where they are under the control of their masters or their parents very true ready they wish to be as they consider they will be independent and a pretty mistake they make of it sir why there is not a greater slave in the world than a boy who goes to sea for the first few years after his shipping for once they are corrected on shore they are punished ten times at sea and they never again meet with the love and affection they have left behind them it is a hard life and there have been but few who have not bitterly repented it and who would not have returned like the prodigal son and cast themselves at their fathers' feet only that they have been ashamed that's the truth ready and it is on that account that i consider that a parent is justified in refusing his consent to his son going to sea if he can properly provide for him in any other profession there never will be any want of sailors for there always will be plenty of poor lads whose friends can do no better for them and in that case the seafaring life is a good one to choose as it requires no other capital for their advancement than activity and courage chapter six mr seagrave and william went down below into the cabin where they found that there was plenty of employment the steward had brought a basin of very hot pea soup for the children tommy who was sitting up in the bed place with his sister had snatched it out of juno's left hand for she held the baby with the other and in so doing had thrown it over caroline who was screaming while juno in her hurry to assist caroline had slipped down on the deck with the baby who was also crying with fright although not hurt unfortunately juno had fallen down upon vixen the terrier who in return had bitten her in the leg which had made juno also cry out while mrs seagrave was hanging her head out of her standing bed place frightened out of her wits at the accident but unable to be of any assistance fortunately mr seagrave came down just in time to pick up juno and the baby and then tried to comfort little caroline who after all was not much scalded as the soup had had time to cool massa tommy is a very naughty boy cried juno rubbing her leg master tommy thought it better to say nothing he was duly admonished the steward cleaned up the mess and order was at length restored in the meantime they were not idle upon deck the carpenter was busy fixing a step for one of the spare topmasts instead of a mainmast and the men were fitting the rigging the ship unfortunately had sprung a leak and four hands at the pumps interfered very much with their task as ready had prophesied before night the gale blew the sea rose again with the gale and the leaking of the vessel increased so much that all other labour was suspended for that at the pump for two more days did the storm continue during which time the crew were worn out with fatigue they could pump no longer the ship as she rolled proved that she had a great deal of water in her hold when melancholy as were their prospects already a new disaster took place which was attended with most serious results captain osborn was on the forecastle giving some orders to the men when the strap of the block which hoisted up the main topgallant yard on the stump of the foremast gave way the yard and sail came down on the deck and struck him senseless as long as captain osborn commanded them the sailors had so high an opinion of his abilities as a seaman and were so encouraged by his cheerful disposition that they performed their work well and cheerfully but now that he was if not killed at all events senseless and incapable of action they no longer felt themselves under control mackintosh was too much disliked by the seamen to allow his words to have any weight with them they were regardless of his injunctions or requests and they now consulted among themselves the gale is broke my men and we shall have fine weather now observed ready going up to the sailors on the forecastle the wind is going down fast yes replied one of the men and the ship is going down fast that's quite as certain a good spell at the pumps would do us some good now replied ready what d'ye say my lads a glass of grog or two would do us more replied the seaman what d'ye say my boys i don't think that the captain would refuse us poor fellow if he could speak what do you mean to do my lads inquired mackintosh not get drunk i hope why not observed another of the men the ship must go down soon perhaps she may i will not deny it said mackintosh but that is no reason why we should not be saved now if you get drunk there is no chance of any one being saved and my life is precious to me i'm ready to join with you in anything you please and you may decide what is to be done but get drunk you shall not if i can help it that's certain and how can you help it replied one of the seamen surlily because two resolute men can do a great deal i may say three for in this instance ready will be of my side and i can call to my assistance the cabin passenger recollect the firearms are all in the cabin but why should we quarrel say at once what you intend to do and if you have not made up your minds will you listen to what i propose as mackintosh's courage and determination were well known the seamen again consulted together and then asked him what he proposed we have one good boat left the new yawl at the booms the others as you know are washed away with the exception of the little boat astern which is useless as she is knocked almost to pieces now we cannot be very far from some of the islands indeed i think we are among them now let us fit out the boat with everything we require go about our work steadily and quietly drink as much grog as will not hurt us and take a good provision of it with us the boat is complete with her masts sails and oars and it's very hard if we do not save ourselves somewhere ready do i give good advice or not you give very good advice mackintosh only what is to become of the cabin passengers the women and children and are you going to leave poor captain osborn or what do you mean to do we won't leave the captain said one of the seamen no no exclaimed the others and the passengers very sorry for them replied the former spokesman but we shall have enough to do to save our own lives well my lads i agree with you said mackintosh charity begins at home what do you say shall it be so yes replied the seamen unanimously and ready knew that it was in vain to expostulate they now set about preparing the boat and providing for their wants biscuits salt pork two or three small casks of water and a barrel of rum were collected at the gangway mackintosh brought up his quadrant and a compass some muskets powder and shot the carpenter with the assistance of another man cut away the ship's bulwarks down to the gunnel so as to enable them to launch the boat overboard for they could not of course hoist her out now that the masts were gone in an hour everything was prepared a long rope was made fast to the boat which was brought to the gunnel ready for launching overboard and the ship's broadside was brought to the wind as this was done mr seagrave came on deck and looked around him he perceived the boat ready for launching the provisions and water at the gangway the ship brought to the wind and rolling slowly to the heave of the sea at last he saw ready sitting down by captain osborn who was apparently dead what is all this ready inquired seagrave are they going to leave the ship have they killed captain osborn no sir not quite so bad as that poor captain osborn was struck down by the fall of the yard and has been insensible ever since but as to the other matter i fear that is decided you see they are launching the boat but my poor wife she will never be able to go she cannot move she is so ill i'm afraid mr seagrave that they have no idea of taking either you or your wife or your children with them what leave us here to perish merciful heaven how cruel how barbarous it is not kind mr seagrave but still you see it is the law of nature when it is a question of life it is every one for himself for life is sweet they are not more unkind than they would be to each other if there were too many for the boat to hold i've seen all this before in my time replied ready gravely my wife my children cried mr seagrave covering his face with his hands but i will speak to them continued he after a pause surely they will listen to the dictates of humanity at all events mr mackintosh will have some power over them don't you think so ready well mr seagrave if i must speak i confess to you that there is not a harder heart among them than that of mr mackintosh and it's useless speaking to him or any one of them and you must not be too severe upon them neither the boat is small and could not hold more people with the provisions which they take with them that is the fact if they were to take you and your family into the boat it might be the cause of all perishing together if i thought otherwise i would try what i could do to persuade them but it is useless what must be done then ready we must put our trust in a merciful god mr seagrave who will dispose of us as he thinks fit we must what do not you go with them no mr seagrave i have been thinking about it this last hour and i have made up my mind to remain with you they intend to take poor captain osborn with them and give him a chance and have offered to take me but i shall stay here to perish replied mr seagrave with surprise as god pleases mr seagrave i am an old man and it is of little consequence i care little whether i am taken away a year or two sooner but i do not like to see blossoms cut off in early spring i may be of use if i remain for i've an old head upon my shoulders and i could not leave you all to perish when you might be saved if you only knew how to act but here the seamen come the boat is all ready and they will now take poor captain osborn with them the sailors came aft and lifted up the still insensible captain as they were going away one of them said come ready there's no time to lose never mind me williams i shall stick to the ship replied ready i wish you success with all my heart and mr mackintosh i have but one promise to exact from you and i hope you will not refuse me which is that if you are saved you will not forget those you leave here on board and take measures for their being searched for among the islands nonsense ready come into the boat replied the first mate i shall stay here mr mackintosh and i only beg that you will promise me what i ask acquaint mr seagrave's friends with what has happened and where it is most likely we may be found if it please god to save us do you promise me that yes i do if you are determined to stay but continued he going up to ready and whispering to him it is madness come away man good bye mr mackintosh replied ready extending his hand you will keep your promise after much further expostulation on the part of mackintosh and the seamen to which ready gave a deaf ear the boat was pushed off and they made sail to the north east chapter seven for some time after the boat had shoved off from the ship old ready remained with his arms folded watching it in silence mr seagrave stood by him his heart was too full for utterance for he imagined that as the boat increased her distance from the vessel so did every ray of hope depart and that his wife and children himself and the old man who was by his side were doomed to perish his countenance was that of a man in utter despair at last old ready spoke they think that they will be saved and that we must perish mr seagrave they forget that there is a power above who will himself decide that point a power compared to which the efforts of weak man are as nought true replied mr seagrave in a low voice but still what chance we can have on a sinking ship with so many helpless creatures around us i confess i cannot imagine we must do our best and submit to his will replied ready who then went aft and shifted the helm so as to put the ship again before the wind as the old man had foretold to the seamen before they quitted the vessel the gale was now over and the sea had gone down considerably the ship however dragged but slowly through the water and after a short time ready lashed the wheel and went forward on his return to the quarter deck he found mr seagrave had thrown himself down apparently in a state of despair upon the sail on which captain osborn had been laid after his accident mr seagrave do not give way said ready if i thought our situation hopeless i would candidly say so but there always is hope even at the very worst and there always ought to be trust in that god without whose knowledge not a sparrow falls to the ground but mr seagrave i shall speak as a seaman and tell you what our probabilities are the ship is half full of water from her seams having opened by the straining in the gale and the heavy blows which she received but now that the gale has abated she has recovered herself very much i have sounded the well and find that she has not made many inches within the last two hours and probably as she closes her seams will make less if therefore it pleases god that the fine weather should continue there is no fear of the vessel sinking under us for some time and as we are now amongst the islands it is not impossible nay it is very probable that we may be able to run her ashore and thus save our lives i thought of all this when i refused to go in the boat and i thought also mr seagrave that if you were to have been deserted by me as well as by all the rest you would have been unable yourself to take advantage of any chances which might turn up in your favour and therefore i have remained hoping under god's providence to be the means of assisting you and your family in this sore position i think now it would be better that you should go down into the cabin and with a cheerful face encourage poor mrs seagrave with the change in the weather and the hopes of arriving in some place of safety if she does not know that the men have quitted the ship do not tell her say that the steward is with the other men which will be true enough and if possible leave her in the dark as to what has taken place master william can be trusted and if you will send him here to me i will talk to him i hardly know what to think ready or how sufficiently to thank you for your self devotion if i may so term it in this exigency that your advice is excellent and that i shall follow it you may be assured and should we be saved from the death which at present stares us in the face my gratitude do not speak of that sir i am an old man with few wants and whose life is of little use now all i wish to feel is that i am trying to do my duty in that situation into which it has pleased god to call me what can this world offer to one who has roughed it all his life and who has neither kith nor kin that he knows of to care about his death mr seagrave pressed the hand of ready and went down without making any reply he found that his wife had been asleep for the last hour and was not yet awake the children were also quiet in their beds juno and william were the only two who were sitting up william made a sign to his father that his mother was asleep and then said in a whisper i did not like to leave the cabin while you were on deck but the steward has not been here these two hours he went to milk the goat for baby and has not returned we have had no breakfast none of us william go on deck replied his father ready wishes to speak to you william went on deck to ready who explained to him the position in which they were placed he pointed out to him the necessity of his doing all he could to assist his father and him and not to alarm his mother in her precarious state of health william who as it may be expected looked very grave did however immediately enter into ready's views and proceeded to do his best the steward said he has left with the other men and when my mother wakes she will ask why the children have had no breakfast what can i do i think you can milk one of the goats if i show you how while i go and get the other things ready i can leave the deck for you see the ship steers herself very nicely and william i have sounded the well just before you came up and i don't think she makes much water and continued he looking round him and up above we shall have fine weather and a smooth sea before night by the united exertions of ready and william the breakfast was prepared while mrs seagrave still continued in a sound sleep the motion of the ship was now very little she only rolled very slowly from one side to the other the sea and wind had gone down and the sun shone brightly over their heads the boat had been out of sight some time and the ship did not go through the water faster than three miles an hour for she had no other sail upon her than the main topgallant sail hoisted up on the stump of the foremast ready who had been some time down in the cabin proposed to mr seagrave that juno and all the children should go on deck they cannot be expected to be quiet sir and now that madam is in such a sweet sleep it would be a pity to wake her after so much fatigue she may sleep for hours and the longer the better for you know that in a short time i trust she will have to exert herself mr seagrave agreed to the good sense of this proposal and went on deck with juno and the children leaving william in the cabin to watch his mother poor juno was very much astonished when she came up the ladder and perceived the condition of the vessel and the absence of the men but mr seagrave told her what had happened and cautioned her against saying a word to mrs seagrave juno promised that she would not but the poor girl perceived the danger of their position and as she pressed little albert to her bosom a tear or two rolled down her cheeks even tommy and caroline could not help asking where the masts and sails were and what had become of captain osborn look there sir said ready pointing out some floating sea weed to mr seagrave i perceive it said mr seagrave but what then that by itself would not be quite proof replied ready but we sailors have other signs and tokens do you see those birds hovering over the waves i do well sir those birds never go far from land that's all and now sir i'll go down for my quadrant for although i cannot tell the longitude just now at all events i can find out the latitude we are in and then by looking at the chart shall be able to give some kind of guess whereabout we are if we see land soon it is nearly noon now observed ready reading off his quadrant the sun rises very slowly what a happy thing a child is look sir at those little creatures playing about and as merry now and as unaware of danger as if they were at home in their parlour i often think sir it is a great blessing for a child to be called away early and that it is selfish in parents to repine perhaps it is replied mr seagrave looking mournfully at his children it's twelve o'clock sir i'll just go down and work the latitude and then i'll bring up the chart mr seagrave remained on deck he was soon in deep and solemn thought nor was it to be wondered at the ship a wreck and deserted left alone on the wide water with his wife and helpless family with but one to assist him had that one deserted as well as the rest what would have been his position then utter helplessness and now what had they to expect their greatest hopes were to gain some island and if they succeeded perhaps a desert island perhaps an island inhabited by savages to be murdered or to perish miserably of hunger and thirst it was not until some time after these reflections had passed through his mind that mr seagrave could recall himself to a sense of thankfulness to the almighty for having hitherto preserved them or could say with humility o lord thy will not mine be done but having once succeeded in repressing his murmurs he then felt that he had courage and faith to undergo every trial which might be imposed upon him here is the chart sir said ready and i have drawn a pencil line through our latitude you perceive that it passes through this cluster of islands and i think we must be among them or very near now i must put something on for dinner and then look sharp out for the land will you take a look round mr seagrave especially a head and on the bows ready went down to see what he could procure for dinner as the seamen when they left the ship had collected almost all which came first to hand he soon procured a piece of salt beef and some potatoes which he put into the saucepan and then returned on deck mr seagrave was forward looking over the bows and ready went there to him ready i think i see something but i can hardly tell what it is it appears to be in the air and yet it is not clouds look there where i point my finger you're right sir replied ready there is something it is not the land which you see but it is the trees upon the land which are refracted as they call it so as to appear as you say as if they were in the air that is an island sir depend upon it but i will go down and get my glass it is the land mr seagrave said ready after examining it with his glass yes it is so continued he musing i wish that we had seen it earlier and yet we must be thankful why so ready only sir as the ship forges so slowly through the water i fear that we shall not reach it before dark and i should have wished to have had daylight to have laid her nicely on it there is very little wind now well let us hope that there will be more replied ready if not we must do our best but i must now go to the helm for we must steer right for the island it would not do to pass it for mr seagrave although the ship does not leak so much as she did yet i must now tell you that i do not think that she could be kept more than twenty four hours above water i thought otherwise this morning when i sounded the well but when i went down in the hold for the beef i perceived that we were in more danger than i had any idea of however there is the land and every chance of escape so let us thank the lord for all his mercies amen replied mr seagrave ready went to the helm and steered a course for the land which was not so far distant as he had imagined for the island was very low by degrees the wind freshened up and they went faster through the water and now the trees which had appeared as if in the air joined on to the land and they could make out that it was a low coral island covered with groves of cocoa nuts occasionally ready gave the helm up to mr seagrave and went forward to examine when they were within three or four miles of it ready came back from the forecastle and said i think i see my way pretty clear sir you see we are to the windward of the island and there is always deep water to the windward of these sort of isles and reefs and shoals to leeward we must therefore find some little cleft in the coral rock to dock her in as it were or she may fall back into deep water after she has taken the ground for sometimes these islands run up like a wall with forty or fifty fathom of water close to the weather sides of them but i see a spot where i think she may be put on shore with safety you see those three cocoa nut trees close together on the beach now sir i cannot well see them as i steer so do you go forward and if i am to steer more to the right put out your right hand and if to the left the same with your left and when the ship's head is as it ought to be then drop the hand which you have raised i understand ready replied mr seagrave who then went forward and directed the steering of the vessel as they neared the island when they were within half a mile of it the colour of the water changed very much to the satisfaction of ready who knew that the weather side of the island would not be so steep as was usually the case still it was an agitating moment as they ran on to beach they were now within a cable's length and still the ship did not ground a little nearer and there was a grating at her bottom it was the breaking off of the coral trees which grew below like forests under water again she grated and more harshly then struck and then again at last she struck violently as the swell lifted her further on and then remained fast and quiet ready let go the helm to ascertain the position of the ship he looked over the stern and around the ship and found that she was firmly fixed fore and aft upon a bed of coral rocks chapter eight all's well so far sir said ready to mr seagrave and now let us return thanks to heaven as they rose to their feet again after giving thanks to the almighty william came up and said father my mother was awakened by the noise under the ship's bottom and is frightened will you go down to her what is the matter my dear and where have you all been exclaimed mrs seagrave when her husband went down below i have been so frightened i was in a sound sleep and i was awakened with such a dreadful noise be composed my dear replied mr seagrave we have been in great danger and are now i trust in safety tell me are you not better for your long sleep yes much better much stronger but do tell me what has happened much took place dearest before you went to sleep which was concealed from you but now as i expect we shall all go on shore in a short time go on shore my dear yes on shore now be calm and hear what has happened and how much we have reason to be grateful to heaven mr seagrave then entered into a detail of all that had passed mrs seagrave heard him without reply and when he had finished she threw herself in his arms and wept bitterly mr seagrave remained with his wife using all his efforts to console her until juno reappeared with the children for it was now getting late then he returned on deck well sir said ready when mr seagrave went up to him i have been looking well about me and i think that we have great reason to be thankful the ship is fast enough and will not move until some violent gales come on and break her up but of that there is no fear at present the little wind that there is is going down and we shall have a calm before morning i grant that there is no immediate danger ready but how are we to get on shore and when on shore how are we to exist i have thought of that too sir and i must have your assistance and even that of master william to get the little boat on board to repair her her bottom is stove in it is true but i am carpenter enough for that and with some well tarred canvas i can make her sufficiently water tight to land us all in safety we must set to at daylight and when we get on shore why mr seagrave where there are cocoa nut trees in such plenty as there are on that island there is no fear of starvation even if we had not the ship's provisions i expect a little difficulty with regard to water for the island is low and small but we cannot expect to find everything exactly as we wish i am thankful to the almighty for our preservation ready but still there are feelings which i cannot get over here we are cast away upon a desolate island which perhaps no ship may ever come near so that there is little chance of our being taken off it is a melancholy and cruel fate ready and that you must acknowledge mr seagrave as an old man compared to you i may venture to say that you are ungrateful to heaven to give way to these repinings what is said in the book of job shall we receive good of the lord and shall we not receive evil' besides who knows whether good may not proceed from what appears evil i beg your pardon mr seagrave i hope i have not offended you but indeed sir i felt that it was my duty to speak as i have done you have reproved me very justly ready and i thank you for it replied mr seagrave i will repine no more but make the best of it and trust in god sir who if he thinks fit will restore you once more to your friends and increase tenfold your flocks and herds that quotation becomes very apt ready replied mr seagrave smiling considering that all my prospects are in flocks and herds upon my land in new south wales i must put myself under your orders for in our present position you are my superior knowledge is power can we do anything to night i can do a little mr seagrave but you cannot assist me till tomorrow morning except indeed to help me to drag these two spars aft and then i can rig a pair of sheers and have them all ready for hoisting up to morrow morning to get the boat in you see with so little strength on board and no masts we shall be obliged to contrive mr seagrave assisted ready in getting the two spars aft and laid on the spot which was required there now mr seagrave you may go down below william had better let loose the two dogs and give them a little victuals for we have quite forgot them poor things i shall keep watch to night for i have plenty to do and plenty to think of so good night sir ready remained on deck lashing the heads of the spars and fixing his tackles ready for the morrow when all was done he sat down upon one of the hen coops aft and remained in deep thought at last tired with watching and exertion the old man fell asleep he was awakened at daylight by the dogs who had been set at liberty and who after walking about the ship and finding nobody had then gone to sleep at the cabin door at daybreak they had roused up and going on deck had found old ready asleep on the hen coop and were licking his face in their joy at having discovered him ay said the old man as he got off the hen coop you'll all three be useful if i mistake not by and by down vixen down poor creature you've lost a good master i'm afraid stop now let me see said ready talking to himself first but i'll get the log board and a bit of chalk and write them down for my memory is not quite so good as it was ready placed the logboard on the hen coop and then wrote on it with the chalk three dogs two goats and billy the kid i think there's five pigs fowls quite enough three or four pigeons i'm sure the cow she has lain down and won't get up again i'm afraid so we must kill her and there's the merino ram and sheep belonging to mr seagrave plenty of live stock now what's the first things we must get on shore after we are all landed a spar and topgallant sail for a tent a coil or two of rope a mattress or two for madam and the children two axes hammer and nails something to eat yes and something to cut it with there that will do for the present said old ready getting up now i'll just light the fire get the water on and while i think of it boil two or three pieces of beef and pork to go on shore with them and then i'll call up mr seagrave for i reckon it will be a hard day's work chapter nine as soon as ready had executed his intentions and had fed the animals he went to the cabin and called mr seagrave and william with their assistance the sheers were raised and secured in their place the boat was then hooked on but as one person was required to bear it clear of the davits and taffrail they could not hoist it in master william will you run down to juno and tell her to come on deck to assist us we must all work now william soon returned with juno who was a strong girl and with her assistance they succeeded in getting the boat in the boat was turned over and ready commenced his work while mr seagrave at his request put the pitch pot on the galley fire all ready for pitching the canvas when it was nailed on it was not till dinner time that ready who had worked hard could patch up the boat he then payed the canvas and the seams which he had caulked with pitch both inside and out i think we shall do now sir said ready we'll drag her to the gangway and launch her it's fortunate for us that they did clear away the gunnel as we shall have no trouble a rope was made fast to the boat to hold her to the ship she was then launched over the gunnel by the united exertions of mr seagrave and ready and to their great satisfaction she appeared to leak very little now sir said ready what shall we do first take some things on shore or some of the children what do you say ready i think as the water is as smooth as glass and we can land anywhere you and i had better go first to reconnoitre it is not two hundred yards to the beach and we shall lose but little time very well ready i will first run down and tell my wife and in the meanwhile i'll put the sail into the boat and one or two other things ready put the sail in an axe a musket and some cord then they both got into the boat and pulled on shore when they landed they found that they could see nothing of the interior of the island the cocoa nut groves were so thick but to their right they perceived at about a quarter of a mile off a small sandy cove with brushwood growing in front of the cocoa nut trees that said ready pointing to it must be our location let us get into the boat again and pull to it in a few minutes they arrived at the cove the water was shallow and as clear as crystal beneath the boat's bottom they could see beautiful shells and the fish darting about in every direction the sand extended about forty yards from the water and then commenced the brushwood which ran back about forty yards further intermingled with single cocoa nut trees until it joined the cocoa nut grove they pulled the boat in and landed what a lovely spot this is exclaimed mr seagrave and perhaps mortal man has never yet visited it till now those cocoa nuts have borne their fruit year after year have died and others have sprung up in their stead and here has this spot remained perhaps for centuries all ready for man to live in and to enjoy whenever he should come to it providence is bountiful mr seagrave replied ready and supplies our wants when we least expect it if you please we will walk a little way into the wood take the gun as a precaution sir not that there appears to be much occasion for it there is seldom anything wild on these small islands except a pig or two has been put on shore by considerate christians well now that we are in the grove ready what do you think i was looking for a place to fix a tent up for the present sir and i think that on that little rise would be a very good place till we can look about us and do better but we have no time now sir for we have plenty of trips to make before nightfall if you please we'll haul the sail and other articles on to the beach and then return on board as they were pulling the boat back ready said i've been thinking about what is best mr seagrave would mrs seagrave mind your leaving her if not i should say we should have juno and william on shore first as they can be of use i do not think that she will mind being left on board with william and the children provided that i return for her when she is to come on shore herself with the baby well then let william remain on board if you please sir i'll land you and juno tommy and the dogs this time for they will be a protection in case of accidents you and juno can be doing something while i return by myself for the other articles we shall require as soon as they arrived on board mr seagrave went down to cheer his wife with the account of what they had seen while he was down below ready had cast off the lashings of the two spars which had formed the sheers and dragging them forward had launched them over the gunnel with lines fast to them ready for towing on shore in a few minutes juno and tommy made their appearance on deck ready put some tools into the boat and a couple of shovels which he brought up when he went for the dogs and once more they landed at the sandy cove tommy stared about him a great deal but did not speak until he saw the shells lying on the beach when he screamed with delight and began to pick them up as fast as he could the dogs barked and galloped about overjoyed at being once more on shore and juno smiled as she looked around her saying to ready what a nice place now mr seagrave i'll remain on shore with you a little first we'll load the musket in case of need and then you can put it out of the way of tommy who fingers everything i observe we will take up the sail between us juno you can carry the tools and then we can come back again for the spars and the rope and the other things come tommy you can carry a shovel at all events and that will make you of some use having taken all these things to the little knoll which ready had pointed out before they returned for the spars and in two trips they had carried everything there tommy with the second shovel on his shoulder and very proud to be employed here are two trees which will answer our purpose pretty well said ready as they are far enough apart we must lash the spars up to them and then throw the sail over and bring it down to the ground at both ends that will be a beginning at all events and i will bring some more canvas on shore to set up the other tent between these other trees and also to shut up the two ends of both of them then we shall have a shelter for madam and juno and the younger children and another for william tommy and ourselves now sir i'll just help you to lash the spars and then i'll leave you to finish while i go on board again but how can we reach so high ready why sir we can manage that by first lashing a spar as high as we can conveniently reach and then standing on that while we lash the other in its proper place i shall bring another spar on shore that we may do the same when we set up the other tent having by this plan succeeded in lashing the spar high enough and throwing the sail over the spar ready and mr seagrave spread it out and found that it made a very good sized tent now sir i'll return on board in the meantime if you can cut pegs from the brush wood to fasten the sail down to the ground and then with the shovel cover the bottom of it with sand to keep it down it will be close enough when it is all finished i shall do very well replied mr seagrave juno can help me to pull the canvas out tight when i am ready yes and in the meantime juno take a shovel and level the inside of the tent nice and smooth and throw out all those old cocoa nut leaves and look if you see any vermin lurking among them master tommy you must not run away and you must not touch the axes they will cut you if you do it may be as well to say mr seagrave that should anything happen and you require my assistance you had better fire off the gun and i will come on shore to you immediately chapter ten when ready returned on board he first went down into the cabin to acquaint mrs seagrave and william with what they had done mrs seagrave naturally felt anxious about her husband being on shore alone and ready informed her that they had agreed that if anything should occur mr seagrave would fire the musket he then went down into the sail room to get some canvas a new topgallant sail which was there and a palm and needles with twine scarcely had he got them out and at the foot of the ladder when the report of the musket was heard and mrs seagrave rushed out of the cabin in the greatest alarm ready seized another musket jumped into the boat and pulled on shore as fast as he could on his arrival quite out of breath for as he pulled on shore he had his back towards it and could see nothing he found mr seagrave and juno busy with the tent and tommy sitting on the ground crying very lustily it appeared that while mr seagrave and juno were employed tommy had crept away to where the musket was placed up on end against a cocoa nut tree and after pulling it about some little while had touched the trigger the musket went off and as the muzzle was pointed upwards the charge had brought down two large cocoa nuts mr seagrave who was aware what an alarm this would produce on board the vessel had been scolding him soundly and now master tommy was crying to prove how very penitent he was i had better return on board immediately sir and tell mrs seagrave said ready do pray replied mr seagrave ready then returned to the ship and explained matters and then recommenced his labour having put into the boat the sailmaker's bag with palm and needles two mattresses and blankets from the captain's state room the saucepan with the beef and pork and a spar which he towed astern ready found that he had as much as he could carry but as there was nobody but himself in it he came on shore very well having with the assistance of mr seagrave and juno got all the things up to the knoll ready lashed the spar up for the second tent and then leaving them to fix it up like the other he returned again on board he made two other trips to the ship bringing with him more bedding a bag of ship's biscuits another of potatoes plates knives and forks spoons frying pans and other cooking utensils and a variety of other articles he then showed juno how to fill up the ends of the first tent with the canvas and sails he had brought on shore so as to inclose it all round juno took the needle and twine and worked very well ready satisfied that she would be able to get on without them now said mr seagrave we have but two hours more daylight and it is right that mrs seagrave should come on shore now so if you please we'll go off and fetch her and the children i think we shall be able to do very well for the first night and if it pleases god to give us fine weather we may do a great deal more to morrow as soon as they arrived on board mr seagrave went down to his wife to propose her going on shore she was much agitated and very weak from her illness but she behaved courageously notwithstanding and supported by her husband gained the deck william following with the baby and his little sister caroline carried by ready with some difficulty they were all at last placed in the boat and shoved off but mrs seagrave was so ill that her husband was obliged to support her in his arms and william took an oar they landed very safely and carried mrs seagrave up to the tent and laid her down on one of the mattresses she asked for a little water and i have forgotten to bring any with me well i am a stupid old man but i'll go on board directly said ready to think that i should be so busy in bringing other things on shore and forget the greatest necessary in life the fact is i intended to look for it on the island as soon as i could as it would save a great deal of trouble ready returned on board as fast as he could and brought on shore two kegs of fresh water which he and william rolled up to the tent juno had completely finished her task and mrs seagrave having drunk some water declared that she was much better i shall not return on board any more to night said ready i feel tired very tired indeed you must be replied mr seagrave do not think of doing any more and i haven't touched food this day or even quenched my thirst replied ready sitting down you are ill are you not ready said william a little faint william i'm not so young as i was could you give me a little water stop william i will said mr seagrave taking up a tin can which had been filled for his wife here ready drink this i shall be better soon sir i'll just lie down a little and then i'll have a biscuit and a little meat poor old ready was indeed quite tired out but he ate something and felt much revived juno was very busy she had given the children some of the salt meat and biscuit to eat the baby and tommy and caroline had been put to bed and the second tent was nearly ready it will do very well for to night juno said mr seagrave we have done work enough for this day yes sir replied ready and i think we ought to thank god for his mercies to us before we go to sleep you remind me of my duty ready let us thank him for his goodness and pray to him for his protection before we go to sleep mr seagrave then offered up a prayer of thankfulness and they all retired to rest chapter eleven mr seagrave was the first who awoke and rose from his bed on the ensuing morning he stepped out of the tent and looked around him the sky was clear and brilliant a light breeze ruffled o'er the surface of the water and the tiny waves rippled one after another upon the white sand of the cove to the left of the cove the land rose forming small hills behind which appeared the continuation of the cocoa nut groves to the right a low ridge of coral rocks rose almost as a wall from the sea and joined the herbage and brushwood at about a hundred paces while the wreck of the pacific lying like some huge stranded monster formed the prominent feature in the landscape the sun was powerful where its beams could penetrate but where mr seagrave stood the cocoa nuts waved their feathery leaves to the wind and offered an impervious shade a feeling of the extreme beauty of the scene subdued by the melancholy created by the sight of the wrecked vessel pervaded the mind of mr seagrave as he meditated over it yes thought he if tired with the world and its anxieties i had sought an abode of peace and beauty it would have been on a spot like this how lovely is the scene what calm what content what a sweet sadness does it create how mercifully have we been preserved when all hope appeared to be gone and how bountifully have we been provided for now that we have been saved and yet i have dared to repine when i ought to be full of gratitude may god forgive me wife children all safe nothing to regret but a few worldly goods and a seclusion from the world for a time yes but for how long a time what rebellious still for the time that it shall please god in his wisdom to ordain mr seagrave turned back to his tent william tommy and old ready still remained fast asleep excellent old man thought mr seagrave what a heart of oak is hid under that rugged bark had it not been for his devotion where might i and all those dear helpless creatures have been now the dogs who had crept into the tent and laid themselves down upon the mattresses by the side of william and tommy now fawned upon mr seagrave william woke up with their whining and having received a caution from his father not to wake ready he dressed himself and came out had i not better call juno father said william i think i can without waking mamma if she is asleep then do if you can my boy and i will see what cooking utensils ready has brought on shore william soon returned to his father stating that his mother was in a sound sleep and that juno had got up without waking her or the two children well we'll see if we cannot get some breakfast ready for them william those dry cocoa nut leaves will make an excellent fire but father how are we to light the fire we have no tinder box or matches no but there are other ways william although in most of them tinder is necessary the savages can produce fire by rubbing a soft piece of wood against a hard one but we have gunpowder and we have two ways of igniting gunpowder one is by a flint and steel and the other is by collecting the sun's rays into one focus by a magnifying glass but father when we have lighted the fire what have we to cook we have no tea or coffee no i do not think we have replied mr seagrave but we have potatoes father yes william but don't you think it would be better if we made our breakfast off the cold beef and pork and ship's biscuit for once and not use the potatoes we may want them all to plant you know but why should we not go on board of the ship ourselves you can pull an oar pretty well and we must all learn to work now and not leave everything for poor old ready to do come william mr seagrave then went down to the cove the little boat was lying on the beach just lifted by the rippling waves they pushed her off and got into her i know where the steward kept the tea and coffee father said william as they pulled on board mamma would like some for breakfast i'm sure and i'll milk the goats for baby although they were neither of them very handy at the oar they were soon alongside of the ship and having made the boat fast they climbed on board william first went down to the cabin for the tea and coffee and then left his father to collect other things while he went to milk the goats which he did in a tin pan he then poured the milk into a bottle which he had washed out that it might not be spilt and went back to his father i have filled these two baskets full of a great many things william which will be very acceptable to your mamma what else shall we take let us take the telescope at all events father and let us take a whole quantity of clothes they will please mamma the clean ones are all in the drawers we can bring them up in a sheet and then father let us bring some of the books on shore and i'm sure mamma will long for her bible and prayer book here they are you are a good boy william replied mr seagrave i will now take those things up to the boat and then return for the rest in a short time everything was put into the boat and they pulled on shore again they found juno who had been washing herself waiting for them at the cove to assist to take up the things well juno how do you find yourself this morning quite well massa said juno and then pointing to the clear water she said plenty fish here yes if we only had lines replied mr seagrave i think ready has both hooks and lines somewhere come juno take up this bundle of linen to your tent we can manage all the rest when they arrived at the tent they found that every one was awake except ready who appeared still to sleep very sound mrs seagrave had passed a very good night and felt herself much refreshed william made some touch paper which he lighted with one of the glasses from the telescope and they soon had a good fire mr seagrave went to the beach and procured three large stones to rest the saucepan on and in half an hour the water was boiling and the tea made chapter twelve juno had taken the children down to the cove and walking out into the water up to her knees had dipped them in all over as the shortest way of washing them and had then dressed them and left them with their mother while she assisted william to get the cups and saucers and plates for breakfast everything was laid out nice and tidy between the two tents and then william proposed that he should awaken ready yes my boy you may as well now he will want his breakfast william went and pushed ready on the shoulder ready have you had sleep enough said william as the old man sat up yes william i have had a good nap i expect and now i will get up and see what i can get for breakfast for you all do replied william laughing ready was soon dressed for he had only taken off his jacket when he lay down he put it on and came out of the tent when to his astonishment he found the whole party mrs seagrave having come out with the children standing round the breakfast which was spread on the ground good morning ready said mrs seagrave extending her hand mr seagrave also shook hands with him you have had a good long sleep ready said mr seagrave and i would not waken you after your fatigue of yesterday i thank you sir and i am glad to see that madam is so well and i am not sorry to see that you can do so well without me continued ready smiling indeed but we cannot i'm afraid replied mrs seagrave had it not been for you and your kindness where should we have been now we can get a breakfast ready without you said mr seagrave but without you i think we never should have required another breakfast by this time but we will tell ready all we have done while we eat our breakfast now my dear if you please mrs seagrave then read a chapter from the bible and afterwards they all knelt down while mr seagrave offered up a prayer while they were at breakfast william told ready how they had gone on board and what they had brought on shore and he also mentioned how juno had dipped all the children in the sea but juno must not do that again replied ready until i have made all safe you know that there are plenty of sharks about these islands and it is very dangerous to go into the water oh what an escape they have had cried mrs seagrave shuddering it's very true continued ready but they don't keep so much to the windward of the islands where we are at present but still that smooth cove is a very likely place for them to come into so it's just as well not to go in again juno until i have time to make a place for you to bathe in in safety as soon as we can get as much as we want from the ship we must decide whether we shall stay here or not stay here or not ready what do you mean why we have not yet found any water and that is the first necessary of life if there is no water on this side of the island we must pitch our tents somewhere else that's very true replied mr seagrave i wish we could find time to explore a little so we can sir but we must not lose this fine weather to get a few things from the ship we had better go now you and william can remain on board to collect the things and i will land them on the beach for juno to bring up the whole day was spent in landing every variety of article which they thought could be useful all the small sails cordage twine canvas small casks saws chisels and large nails and elm and oak plank were brought on shore before dinner after they had taken a hearty dinner the cabin tables and chairs all their clothes some boxes of candles two bags of coffee two of rice two more of biscuits several pieces of beef and pork and bags of flour some more water the grindstone and mrs seagrave's medicine chest were landed when ready came off again he said our poor boat is getting very leaky and will not take much more on shore without being repaired and juno has not been able to get half the things up they are too heavy for one person i think we shall do pretty well now mr seagrave and we had better before it is dark get all the animals on shore i don't much like to trust them to swim on shore but they are awkward things in a boat we'll try a pig at all events and while i get one up do you and william tie the legs of the fowls and put them into the boat as for the cow she cannot be brought on shore she is still lying down and i expect won't get up again any more however i have given her plenty of hay and if she don't rise why i will kill her and we can salt her down ready went below and the squealing of the pig was soon heard he came on deck with it hanging over his back by the hind legs and threw it into the sea over the gunnel the pig floundered at first but after a few seconds turned its head away from the ship and swam for the shore he goes ashore straight enough said ready who with mr seagrave and william was watching the animal but a minute afterwards ready exclaimed i thought as much we've lost him how replied mr seagrave d'ye see that black thing above water pushing so fast to the animal that's the back fin of a shark and he will have the poor thing there he's got him said ready as the pig disappeared under the water with a heavy splash well he's gone better the pig than your little children mr seagrave yes indeed god be praised that monster might have been close to them at the time that juno took them into the water he was not far off i reckon replied ready we'll go down now and tie the legs of the other four pigs and bring them up with what's already in the boat they will be a good load as soon as the pigs were in the boat ready sculled it on shore while mr seagrave and william brought up the goats and sheep ready for the next trip ready soon returned now this will be our last trip for to day and if i am any judge of the weather our last trip for some days it is banking up very thick in the offing this trip we'll be able to put into the boat a bag of corn for the creatures in case we require it and then we may say good bye to the ship for a day or two at least they then all got into the boat which was very deeply laden for the corn was heavy but they got safe on shore although they leaked very much having landed the goats and sheep william led them up to the tent where they remained very quietly the pigs had run away and so had the fowls that's what i call a good day's work mr seagrave said ready the little boat has done its duty well but we must not venture in her again until i have put her into a little better condition they were not at all sorry after their hard day's work to find that juno had prepared coffee for them and while they were drinking it they narrated to mrs seagrave the tragically death of the poor pig by the shark poor juno appeared quite frightened at the danger which the children had been in even now that it was all over we shall have plenty to do here to morrow observed mr seagrave in getting things into their places we shall have plenty to do for some time i expect replied ready in two months or thereabouts we shall have the rainy season come on and we must be under cover before that time if we possibly can what's the first thing we must do ready inquired mr seagrave to morrow we had better fix up another tent or two to stow away all the articles we have brought on shore that will be one good day's work we shall then know where to lay our hands upon everything and see what we want that's very true and what shall we do then why then sir i think we must make a little expedition to explore the island and find out where we must build our house can we build a house said william oh yes sir and with more ease than you would think there's no tree so valuable as the cocoa nut tree and the wood is so light that we can easily move it about why what are the great merits of the cocoa nut tree said mrs seagrave i'll tell you madam in the first place you have the wood to build the house with then you have the bark with which you can make ropes and lines and fishing nets if you please then you have the leaves for thatching your house then you have the fruit which as a nut is good to eat and very useful in cooking and in the young nut is the milk which is also very wholesome then you have the oil to burn and the shell to make cups of if you haven't any and then you can draw toddy from the tree which is very pleasant to drink when fresh but will make you tipsy if it is kept too long there is no tree which yields so many useful things to man for it supplies him with almost everything at all events we've plenty of them said william yes william there's no want of them and i am glad of it for had there been but few i should not have liked to destroy them people might be wrecked here as well as ourselves and without the good fortune that we have had in getting so many necessaries on shore and they might be obliged to depend wholly upon the cocoa nut trees for their support chapter thirteen when breakfast was over the next morning ready observed now mr seagrave we must hold a council of war and decide upon an exploring party for to morrow and when we have settled that we will find some useful way of employing ourselves for the rest of the day the first question is of whom is the party to consist and upon that i wish to hear your opinion why ready replied mr seagrave it appears to me that you and i should go surely not both of you my dear interrupted mrs seagrave you can do without my husband can you not ready i certainly should have liked to have mr seagrave to advise with ma'am replied ready but still i have thought upon it and do not think that william would be quite sufficient protection for you or at all events you would not feel that he was which is much the same thing and so if mr seagrave has no objection it would perhaps be better that he remained with you would you go alone then ready said mr seagrave no sir i do not think that would be right either some accident might happen there is no saying what might happen although there is every appearance of safety i should like therefore to have some one with me the question is whether it be william or juno take me said tommy take you tommy said ready laughing then i must take juno to take care of you no i think they cannot spare you your mamma will want you when we are gone you are so useful in gathering wood for the fire and taking care of your little sister and brother that your mother cannot part with you so i must have either juno or william and which would you prefer ready said mrs seagrave william certainly ma'am if you will let him go with me as you could ill spare the girl indeed i do not like it i would rather lose juno for a time replied mrs seagrave my dear wife said mr seagrave recollect how providence has preserved us in such awful dangers how we are landed in safety and now will you not put trust in that providence when the dangers are as i trust only imaginary i was wrong my dear husband but sickness and suffering have made me i fear not only nervous and frightened but selfish i must and will shake it off hitherto i have only been a clog and an incumbrance to you but i trust i shall soon behave better and make myself useful if you think then that it would be better that you should go instead of william i am quite content go then with ready and may heaven protect you both no ma'am replied ready william will do just as well indeed i would go by myself with pleasure but we know not what the day may bring forth i might be taken ill i might hurt myself i am an old man you know and then i was thinking that if any accident was to happen to me you might miss me that's all pardon me replied mrs seagrave a mother is foolish at times over anxious ma'am perhaps but not foolish replied ready well then william shall go with you ready that point's settled observed mr seagrave what is the next the next is to prepare for our journey we must take some provisions and water with us a gun and some ammunition a large axe for me and one of the hatchets for william and if you please romulus and remus had better come with us juno put a piece of beef and a piece of pork into the pot william will you fill four quart bottles with water while i sew up a knapsack out of canvas for each of us and what shall i do ready said mr seagrave why sir if you will sharpen the axe and the hatchet on the grindstone it would be of great service and tommy can turn it he is so fond of work tommy jumped up directly he was quite strong enough to turn the grindstone but he was much fonder of play than work but as ready had said that he was fond of it he wished to prove that such was the case and worked very hard before they went to prayers and retired for the night the axe was sharpened the knapsacks made and everything else ready when do you intend to start ready said mr seagrave why sir i should like to get off at the dawn of day when the heat is not so great and when do you intend to come back said mrs seagrave why madam we have provisions enough for three days if we start to morrow morning which is wednesday i hope to be back some time on friday evening but i won't be later than saturday morning if i can help it good night and good bye mother said william for i shall not see you to morrow god bless and protect you my dear child replied mrs seagrave take care of him ready and good bye to you till we meet mrs seagrave went into the tent to hide the tears which she could not suppress chapter fourteen ready was up before the sun had appeared and he awakened william the knapsacks had been already packed with two bottles of water in each wrapped round with cocoa nut leaves to prevent their breaking and the beef and pork divided between each knapsack ready's which was larger than william's held the biscuit and several other things which ready had prepared in case they might require them as soon as the knapsacks were on ready took the axe and gun and asked william if he thought he could carry a small spade on his shoulder which they had brought on shore along with the shovels william replied that he could and the dogs who appeared to know they were going were all ready standing by them then just as the sun rose they turned into the cocoa nut grove and were soon out of sight of the tents now william do you know said ready stopping after they had walked twenty yards by what means we may find our way back again for you see this forest of trees is rather puzzling and there is no path to guide us no i am sure i cannot tell i was thinking of the very same thing when you spoke and of tom thumb who strewed peas to find his way back but could not do it because the birds picked them all up well tom thumb did not manage well and we must try to do better we must do as the americans always do in their woods we must blaze the trees blaze them what set fire to them replied william no no william blaze is a term they use when they cut a slice of the bark off the trunk of a tree just with one blow of a sharp axe as a mark to find their way back again they do not blaze every tree but about every tenth tree as they go along first one to the right and then one to the left which is quite sufficient and it is very little trouble they do it as they walk along without stopping so now we'll begin you take the other side it will be more handy for you to have your hatchet in your right hand i can use my left see now just a slice off the bark the weight of the axe does it almost what an excellent plan observed william but i have another friend in my pocket replied ready and i must use him soon what is that poor captain osborn's pocket compass you see william the blazing will direct us how to go back again but it will not tell us what course we are now to steer at present i know we are going right as i can see through the wood behind us but by and by we shall not be able and then i must make use of the compass i understand that very well but tell me ready why do you bring the spade with us what will be the use of it you did not say yesterday that you were going to bring me no william i did not as i did not like to make your mother anxious but the fact is i am very anxious myself as to whether there is any water on this island if there is not we shall have to quit it sooner or later for although we may get water by digging in the sand it would be too brackish to use for any time and would make us all ill very often there will be water if you dig for it although it does not show above ground and therefore i brought the spade you think of everything ready no i do not william but in our present situation i think of more things than perhaps your father and mother would they have never known what it is to be put to their shifts but a man like me who has been all his life at sea and who has been wrecked and suffered hardships and difficulties and has been obliged to think or die has a greater knowledge not only from his own sufferings but by hearing how others have acted when they were in distress necessity sharpens a man's wits and it is very curious what people do contrive when they are compelled to do so especially seamen and where are we going to now ready right to the leeward side of the island why do you call it the leeward side of the island because among these islands the winds almost always blow one way we landed on the windward side the wind is at our back now put up your finger and you will feel it even among the trees no i cannot replied william as he held up his finger then wet your finger and try again william wet his finger and held it up again yes i feel it now said he but why is that because the wind blows against the wet and you feel the cold as ready said this the dogs growled then started forward and barked what can be there cried william stand still william replied ready cocking his gun and i will go forward to see ready advanced cautiously with the gun to his hip the dogs barked more furiously and at last out of a heap of cocoa nut leaves collected together burst all the pigs which had been brought on shore grunting and galloping away as fast as they could with the dogs in pursuit of them it's only the pigs said ready smiling i never thought i should be half frightened by a tame pig here romulus here remus come back continued ready calling to the dogs well william this is our first adventure i hope we shall not meet with any one more dangerous replied william laughing but i must say that i was alarmed no wonder for although not likely it is possible there may be wild animals on this island or even savages but being alarmed is one thing and being afraid is another a man may be alarmed and stand his ground but a man that is afraid will run away i do not think i shall ever run away and leave you ready if there is danger i'm sure you will not but still you must not be rash and now we will go on again as soon as i have uncocked my gun i have seen more accidents happen from people cocking their guns and forgetting to uncock them afterwards than you can have any idea of recollect also until you want to fire never cock your gun ready and william continued their way through the cocoa nut grove for more than an hour longer marking the trees as they went along they then sat down to take their breakfast don't give the dogs any water william nor any of the salt meat give them biscuit only but they are very thirsty may not i give them a little no we shall want it all ourselves in the first place and in the next i wish them to be thirsty and william take my advice and only drink a small quantity of water at a time the more you drink the more you want then i should not eat so much salt meat very true the less you eat the better unless we find water and fill our bottles again but we have our axes and can always cut down a cocoa nut and get the milk from the young nuts very true and fortunate it is that we have that to resort to but still we could not do very well on cocoa nut milk alone even if it were to be procured all the year round now we will go on if you do not feel tired not in the least i am tired of seeing nothing but the stems of cocoa nut trees and shall be glad when we are through the wood then the faster we walk the better said ready as far as i can judge we must be about half way across now ready and william recommenced their journey and after half an hour's walking they found that the ground was not so level as it had been sometimes they went gradually up hill at others down i am very glad to find the island is not so flat here we have a better chance of finding water it is much steeper before us replied william it's quite a hill the ground now became more undulating although still covered with cocoa nut trees even thicker together than before they continued their march occasionally looking at the compass until william showed symptoms of weariness for the wood had become more difficult to get through than at first how many miles do you think we have walked ready said willy about eight i should think not more than eight no i do not think that we have made more than two miles an hour it's slow work travelling by compass and marking the trees but i think the wood looks lighter before us now that we are at the top of this hill it does ready i fancy i can see the blue sky again your eyes are younger than mine william and perhaps you may however we shall soon find out they now descended into a small hollow and then went up hill again as soon as they arrived at the top william cried out the sea ready there's the sea very true william and i'm not sorry for it i thought we never should get out of that nasty wood again said william as he impatiently pushed on and at last stood clear of the cocoa nut grove ready soon joined him and they surveyed the scene before them in silence chapter fifteen oh how beautiful exclaimed william at last i'm sure mamma would like to live here i thought the other side of the island very pretty but it's nothing compared to this it is very beautiful replied ready thoughtfully a more lovely scene could scarcely be imagined the cocoa nut grove terminated about a quarter of a mile from the beach very abruptly for there was a rapid descent for about thirty feet from where they stood to the land below on which was a mixture of little grass knolls and brushwood to about fifty yards from the water's edge where it was met with dazzling white sand occasionally divided by narrow ridges of rock which ran inland the water was a deep blue except where it was broken into white foam on the reefs which extended for miles from the beach and the rocks of which now and then showed themselves above water on the rocks were perched crowds of gannets and men of war birds while others wheeled in the air every now and then darting down into the blue sea and bringing up in their bills a fish out of the shoals which rippled the water or bounded clear of it in their gambols the form of the coast was that of a horse shoe bay two points of land covered with shrubs extending far out on each side the line of the horizon far out at sea was clear and unbroken ready remained for some time without speaking he scanned the horizon right and left and then he turned his eyes along the land at last william said what are you thinking of ready why i am thinking that we must look for water as fast as we can but why are you so anxious because i can see no island to leeward of us as i expected and therefore there is less chance of getting off this island and this bay although very beautiful is full of reefs and i see no inlet which makes it awkward for many reasons but we cannot judge at first sight let us now sit down and take our dinner and after that we will explore a little ready cut two wide marks in the stems of the cocoa nut trees and then descended with william to the low ground where they sat down to eat their dinner as soon as their meal was finished they first walked down to the water's edge and ready turned his eyes inland to see if he could discover any little ravine or hollow which might be likely to contain fresh water there are one or two places there observed ready pointing to them with his finger where the water has run down in the rainy season we must examine them carefully but not now i want to find out whether there is any means of getting our little boat through this reef of rocks or otherwise we shall have very hard work if we change our abode to this spot to bring all our stores through that wood so we will pass the rest of this day in examining the coast and to morrow we will try for fresh water look at the dogs ready they are drinking the sea water poor things they won't drink much of that i expect you see they don't like it already how beautiful the corals are look here they grow like little trees under the water and look here here is really a flower in bloom growing on that rock just below the water put your finger to it master william said ready william did so and the flower as he called it immediately shut up why it's flesh and alive yes it is i have often seen them before they call them sea anemones they are animals but i don't know whether they are shell fish or not now let us walk out to the end of this point of land and see if we can discover any opening in the reef the sun is going down and we shall not have more than an hour's daylight and then we must look out for a place to sleep in but what is that cried william pointing to the sand that round dark thing that's what i'm very glad to see william it's a turtle they come up about this time in the evening to drop their eggs and then they bury them in the sand can't we catch them yes we can catch them if we go about it quietly but you must take care not to go behind them or they will throw such a shower of sand upon you with their hind flappers or fins that they would blind you and escape at the same time the way to catch them is to get at their heads and turn them over on their backs by one of the fore fins and then they cannot turn back again let us go and catch that one i should think it very foolish to do so as we could not take it away and it would die to morrow from the heat of the sun i did not think of that ready if we come to live here i suppose we shall catch them whenever we want them no we shall not for they only come on shore in the breeding season but we will make a turtle pond somewhere which they cannot get out of but which the sea flows into and then when we catch them we will put them into it and have them ready for use as we require them that will be a very good plan replied william they now continued their walk and forcing their way through the brushwood which grew thick upon the point of land soon arrived at the end of it what is that out there said william pointing to the right of where they stood that is another island which i am very glad to see even in that direction although it will not be so easy to gain it if we are obliged to leave this for want of water it is a much larger island than this at all events continued ready scanning the length of the horizon along which he could see the tops of the trees well we have done very well for our first day so we will go and look for a place to lie down and pass the night they returned to the high ground where the cocoa nut grove ended and collecting together several branches and piles of leaves made a good soft bed under the trees and now we'll go to bed look william at the long shadow of the trees the sun has nearly set shall i give the dogs some water now ready see poor remus is licking the sides of the bottles no do not give them any it appears to be cruel but i want the intelligence of the poor animals to morrow and the want of water will make them very keen and we shall turn it to good account so now william we must not forget to return thanks to a merciful god and to beg his care over us for this night we little know what the day may bring forth good night chapter sixteen william slept as sound as if he had been on shore in england upon a soft bed in a warm room so did old ready and when they awoke the next morning it was broad daylight the poor dogs were suffering for want of water and it pained william to see them with their tongues out panting and whining as they looked up to him now william said ready shall we take our breakfast before we start or have a walk first ready i cannot really drink a drop of water myself and i am thirsty unless you give a little to these poor dogs i pity the poor dumb creatures as much as you do master willy it is kindness to ourselves and them too which makes me refuse it to them however if you like we will take a walk first and see if we can find any water let us first go to the little dell to the right and if we do not succeed we will try farther on where the water has run down during the rainy season william was very glad to go and away they went followed by the dogs ready having taken up the spade which he carried on his shoulder they soon came to the dell and the dogs put their noses to the ground and snuffed about ready watched them at last they lay down panting let us go on said ready thoughtfully they went on to where the run of water appeared to have been the dogs snuffed about more eagerly than before you see william these poor dogs are now so eager for water that if there is any they will find it out where we never could i don't expect water above ground but there may be some below it this beach is hardly far enough from the water's edge or i should try in the sand for it in the sand but would it not be salt replied william no not if at a good distance from the sea beach for you see william the sand by degrees filters the sea water fresh and very often when the sand runs in a long way from the high water mark if you dig down you will find good fresh water at other times it is a little brackish but still fit for use look ready at romulus and remus how hard they are digging with their paws there in the hollow thanks to heaven that they are you don't know how happy you have made me feel for to tell you the truth i was beginning to be alarmed but why do they dig because there is water there poor animals now you see the advantage of having kept them in pain for a few hours it is in all probability the saving of all of us for we must either have found water or quitted this island now let us help the poor dogs with the spade and they shall soon be rewarded for their sufferings ready walked quickly to where the dogs continued digging they had already got down to the moist earth and were so eagerly at work that it was with difficulty he could get them out of his way to use his spade he had not dug two feet before the water trickled down and in four or five minutes the dogs had sufficient to plunge their noses in and to drink copiously look at them how they enjoy it i don't think any israelite felt more grateful when moses struck the rock than i do now william this was the one thing wanting but it was the one thing indispensable now we have everything we can wish for on this island and if we are only content we may be happy ay much happier than are those who are worrying themselves to heap up riches not knowing who shall gather them see the poor animals have had enough at last now shall we go back to breakfast yes replied william i shall enjoy it now and have a good drink of water myself that is a plenteous spring depend upon it said ready as they walked back to where they had slept and left their knapsacks but we must clear it out further up among the trees where the sun cannot reach it and then it will be cool and not be dried up we shall have plenty of work for the next year at least if we remain here where we are now will be a capital spot to build our house on as soon as the breakfast was over ready said now we must go down and explore the other point for you see william i have not yet found a passage through the reef and as our little boat must come round this side of the island it is at the point on this side that i must try to find an entrance when i was on the opposite point it did appear to me that the water was not broken close to this point and should there be a passage we shall be very fortunate they soon arrived at the end of the point of land and found that ready was not wrong in his supposition the water was deep and there was a passage many yards wide the sea was so smooth and the water so clear that they could see down to the rocky bottom and watched the fish as they darted along look there said willy pointing out about fifty yards from the beach a great shark ready yes i see him sir replied ready there's plenty of them here depend upon it and you must be very careful how you get into the water the sharks always keep to the leeward of the island and for one where juno bathed your little brother you will find fifty here i'm quite satisfied now william we shall do very well and all we have now to think of is moving away from the other side of the island as fast as possible shall we go back to day yes i think so for we shall only be idle here it is not twelve o'clock i should think and we shall have plenty of time i think we had better start at once we will leave the spade and axe here for it is no use taking them back again the musket i will take along but first let us go back and look at the spring and see how the water flows as they walked along the edge of the sandy beach they found the sea birds hovering close to them all of a sudden a large shoal of fish threw themselves high and dry on the sand and they were followed by several of a larger size which also lay flapping on the beach while the sea birds darting down close to the feet of william and ready and seizing up the fish flew away with them how very strange said william surprised yes sir but you see how it is the small fish were chased by the larger ones which are bonettas and in their fright ran upon the beach these bonettas were so anxious to catch them that they came on shore also and then the gannets picked them all up they found the hole which ready had dug quite full of water and tasting it it proved very sweet and good overjoyed at this discovery they covered up the articles they agreed to leave behind them with some boughs under the notched cocoa nut trees and calling the dogs set off on their journey back again to the cove chapter seventeen guided by the marks made on the trees william and ready made rapid progress in their return and in less than two hours found themselves almost clear of the wood which had taken them nearly eight hours to force their way through the day before i feel the wind now ready observed william and we must be nearly through the wood but it appears to me to be very dark i was just thinking the same replied ready i should not wonder if there is a storm brewing up and if so the sooner we are back again the better as they proceeded the rustling and waving of the boughs of the trees and ever and anon a gust of wind followed by a moaning and creaking sound proved that such was the fact and as they emerged from the grove they perceived that the sky as it became visible to them was of one dark leaden hue and no longer of the brilliant blue which it usually had presented to their sight there is indeed a gale coming on said ready as they cleared the wood let us go on to the tents as fast as possible for we must see that all is as secure as we can make it the dogs now bounded forward and at their appearance at the tents mr seagrave and juno came out and seeing ready and william advancing made known the welcome tidings to mrs seagrave who with the children had remained within in a moment more william was pressed in his mother's arms i am glad that you are come back ready said mr seagrave shaking him by the hand after he had embraced william for i fear that bad weather is coming on i am sure of it replied ready and we must expect a blusterous night this will be one of the storms which are forerunners of the rainy season however we have good news for you and must only take this as a warning to hasten our departure as soon as possible we shall have fine weather after this for a month or so although we must expect a breeze now and then but we must work hard and do our best and now if you please you and juno william and i will go and haul up the boat as far from the beach as we possibly can for the waves will be high and run a long way up and our boat will be our main dependence soon the four went down as soon as ready had sawed the ends of the spars which had been cut off into three rollers to fix under the keel with the help afforded by them the boat was soon hauled up high into the brushwood where it was considered by ready to be perfectly safe i meant to have worked upon her immediately observed ready but i must wait now till the gale is over and i did hope to have got on board once more and looked after some things which i have since remembered would have been useful but i strongly suspect continued he looking at the weather that we shall never go on board of the poor vessel again hear the moaning of the coming storm sir look how the sea birds wheel about and scream as if to proclaim her doom but we must not wait here the tents must be made more secure for they will have to hold up against no small force of wind if i mistake not ready assisted by mr seagrave now got out some heavy canvas and lines and commenced putting it as a double cover over the tents to keep out the rain they also secured the tents with guys and stays of rope so as to prevent them being blown down while juno with a shovel deepened the trench which had been made round the tents so that the water might run off more easily during the time they were at work ready had made mr seagrave acquainted with what they had discovered and done during the exploring expedition and the adventure with the pigs made them all laugh heartily as the sun went down the weather threatened still more the wind blew strong and the rocky beach was lashed by the waves and white with spray while the surf roared as it poured in and broke upon the sand in the cove the whole family had retired to bed except ready who said that he would watch the weather a little before he turned in the old man walked towards the beach and leaned against the gunnel of the boat and there he remained with his keen grey eye fixed upon the distance which was now one opaque mass except where the white foam of the waters gleamed through the darkness of the night yes thought he the winds and the waves are summoned to do his bidding and evenly do they work together as one rises so does the other when one howls the other roars in concert hand in hand they go in their fury and their force had they been called up but one week since where would have been those who have now been as it were intrusted to my weak help the father the mother the children the infant at the breast and i the grey headed old man all buried fathoms deep awaiting our summons but they were restrained by his will and by his will we were saved will those timbers which bore us here so miraculously hold together till morning i should think not what are the iron bolts and fastenings of weak man compared with the force of god's elements they will snap as yarns and by to morrow's dawn the fragments of the stout ship will be washing and tossing on the wild surf well it will be a kindness to us for the waters will perform the labour which we could not they will break up the timbers for our use and throw on shore from the hold those articles which we could not reach with our little strength a sharp flash of lightning struck upon the old man's eyes and obstructed his vision for the moment the storm will soon be at its height thought he i will watch the tents and see how they stand up against its force then the rain came pattering down and the wind howled louder than before in a minute or two the darkness became so intense that he could hardly find his way back to the tents he turned round but could not see for he was blinded by the heavy rain as nothing could be done he went into the tent and sheltered himself from the storm although he would not lie down lest his services might be required the others had retired to bed but with the exception of tommy and the children they had not taken off their clothes chapter eighteen the storm now raged furiously the lightning was accompanied by loud peals of thunder and the children awoke and cried with fright till they were hushed to sleep again the wind howled as it pressed with all its violence against the tents while the rain poured off in torrents one moment the canvas of the tents would bulge in and the cords which held it strain and crack at another an eddy of wind would force out the canvas which would flap and flap while the rain found many an entrance the tent in which mrs seagrave and the children reposed was on the outside of the others and therefore the most exposed about midnight the wind burst on them with greater violence than before a loud crash was heard by ready and mr seagrave followed by the shrieks of mrs seagrave and juno the pegs of the tent had given way and the inmates were exposed to the fury of the elements ready rushed out followed by mr seagrave and william so strong was the wind and beating rain and such was the darkness that it was with some difficulty that by their united efforts the women and children could be extricated tommy was the first taken up by ready his courage had all gone and he was bellowing furiously william took albert in charge and carried him into the other tent where tommy sat in his wet shirt roaring most melodiously juno mrs seagrave and the little girl were at last carried away and taken into the other tent fortunately no one was hurt although the frightened children could not be pacified and joined in chorus with tommy nothing more could be done except to put the children into bed and then the whole party sat up the remainder of the night listening to the noise of the wind the roaring of the sea and the loud patter of the rain against the canvas at dawn of day ready went out and found that the gale had spent its force and had already much abated but it was not one of those bright glorious mornings to which they had been accustomed since their arrival at the island the sky was still dark and the clouds were chasing each other wildly there was neither sun nor blue sky to be seen it still rained but only at intervals and the earth was soft and spongy the little cove but the day before so beautiful was now a mass of foaming and tumultuous waves and the surf was thrown many yards upon the beach the horizon was confused you could not distinguish the line between the water and the sky and the whole shore of the island was lined with a white foam ready turned his eyes to where the ship had been fixed on the rocks it was no longer there the whole frame had disappeared but the fragments of it and the contents of the holds were floating about in every direction or tossing amongst the surf on the beach i thought as much said ready pointing to where the ship had lain as he turned round and found that mr seagrave had followed him look sir this gale has broken her up entirely this is a warning to us not to remain here any longer we must make the most of the fine weather which we may have before the rainy season sets in i agree with you ready replied mr seagrave and there is another proof of it pointing to the tent which had been blown down it was a mercy that none of them were hurt very true sir but the gale is breaking and we shall have fine weather to morrow let us now see what we can do with the tent while william and juno try if they can get any breakfast they set to work ready and mr seagrave made it fast with fresh cords and pegs and very soon had it all ready but the beds and bedding were wet through they hauled over the wet canvas and then left it to go to their breakfast to which juno had summoned them we need do no more at present said ready by night time it will not be so wet and we can handle it easier i see a break in the sky now which promises fine weather soon and now we had better work hard to day for we may save a great many things which may be dashed to pieces on the rocks if we do not haul them on the beach chapter nineteen they went down to the beach ready first procured from the stores a good stout rope and as the waves threw up casks and timbers of the vessel they stopped them from being washed back again and either rolled or hauled them up with the rope until they were safely landed this occupied them for the major part of the day and yet they had not collected a quarter of the articles that were in their reach independent of the quantity which floated about out at sea and at the entrance of the cove i think said ready we have done a good day's work tomorrow we shall be able to do much more for the sea is going down and the sun is showing himself from the corner of that cloud now we will go to supper and then see if we can make ourselves more comfortable for the night the tent which had not been blown down was given to mrs seagrave and the children and the other was fitted up as well as it could be the bedding being all wet they procured some sails from the stores which being stowed away farther in the grove had not suffered much from the tempest and spreading the canvas they lay down and the night passed without any disaster for the wind was now lulled to a pleasant breeze the next morning the sun shone bright the air was fresh and bracing but a slight breeze rippled the waters and there was little or no surf the various fragments of the wreck were tossed by the little surf that still remained many things were lying on the beach which had landed during the night and many more required but a little trouble to secure them there appeared to be a sort of in draught into the cove as all the articles which had been floating out at sea were now gradually coming on shore in that direction ready and mr seagrave worked till breakfast time and had by that time saved a great many casks and packages after breakfast they went down again to the beach and resumed their labours look ready what is that said william who was with them as he pointed to a white looking mass floating in the cove that sir is the poor cow and if you look again you will see the sharks are around making a feast of her don't you see them yes i do what a quantity yes there's no want of them william so be very careful how you get into the water and never let tommy go near it for they don't care how shallow it is when they see their food but now sir said ready i must leave you and william to do what you can in saving any more of the wreck while i set to and put the boat in proper repair ready left them at their own employment and went away for his tools during this time mr seagrave and william occupied themselves in collecting the different articles thrown on shore and rolling up the casks as far as they could as it would take some days for ready to put the boat into proper order mr seagrave determined that he would go to the other side of the island with william that he might examine it himself and as mrs seagrave had no objection to be left with ready and juno on the third day after the gale they set off william led the way guiding his footsteps through the grove by the blazing of the cocoa nut trees and in two hours they reached their destination is not this beautiful father said william yes indeed it is my dear boy replied mr seagrave i fancied that nothing could be more beautiful than the spot where we reside but this surpasses it not only in variety but in extent and now let us examine the spring father said william leading the way to the ravine the spring was full and flowing and the water excellent they then directed their steps towards the sandy beach and having walked some time sat down upon a coral rock who would have ever imagined william said mr seagrave that this island and so many more which abound in the pacific ocean could have been raised by the work of little insects not bigger than a pin's head insects father replied william yes insects give me that piece of dead coral william do you see that on every branch there are a hundred little holes well in every one of these little holes once lived a sea insect and as these insects increase so do the branches of the coral trees yes i understand that but how do you make out that this island was made by them almost all the islands in these seas have been made by the labour and increase of these small animals the coral grows at first at the bottom of the sea where it is not disturbed by the winds or waves by degrees as it increases it advances higher and higher to the surface till at last it comes near to the top of the water then it is stopped in its growth by the force of the winds and waves which break it off and of course it never grows above the water for if it did the animals would die then how does it become an island by very slow degrees the time perhaps much depending upon chance for instance a log of wood floating about and covered with barnacles may ground upon the coral reefs that would be a sufficient commencement for it would remain above water and then shelter the coral to leeward of it until a flat rock had formed level with the edge of the water the sea birds are always looking for a place to rest upon and they would soon find it and then their droppings would in course of time form a little patch above water and other floating substances would be thrown on it and land birds who are blown out to sea might rest themselves on it and the seeds from their stomachs when dropped would grow into trees or bushes i understand that well then william you observe there is an island commenced as it were and once commenced it soon increases for the coral would then be protected to leeward and grow up fast do you observe how the coral reefs extend at this side of the island where they are protected from the winds and waves and how different it is on the weather side which we have just left just so the little patch above water protects the corals to leeward and there the island increases fast for the birds not only settle on it but they make their nests and rear their young and so every year the soil increases and then perhaps one cocoa nut in its great outside shell at last is thrown on these little patches it takes root and becomes a tree every year shedding its large branches which are turned into mould as soon as they decay and then dropping its nuts which again take root and grow in this mould and thus they continue season after season and year after year until the island becomes as large and as thickly covered with trees as the one we are now standing upon is not this wonderful my dear boy is not he a great and good god who can make such minute animals as these work his pleasure and at the time he thinks fit produce such a beautiful island as this indeed he is exclaimed william we only need use our eyes william and we shall love as well as adore look at that shell is it not beautifully marked could the best painter in the world equal its colouring no indeed i should think not and yet there are thousands of them in sight and perhaps millions more in the water they have not been coloured in this way to be admired like the works of man for this island has been till now probably without any one upon it and no one has ever seen them it makes no difference to him who has but to wish and all is complete for a few minutes after this conversation mr seagrave and william were both silent mr seagrave then rose from where he was sitting come william let us now find our way back again we have three hours' daylight left and shall be home in good time chapter twenty everything was now preparing for their removal to the leeward side of the island ready had nearly completed the boat he had given it a thorough repair and fitted a mast and sail william and mr seagrave continued to collect and secure the various articles thrown on shore particularly such as would be injured by their exposure to the weather these they rolled or carried into the cocoa nut grove so as to be sheltered from the sun but there were so many things thrown on shore day after day that they hardly knew what they had but they secured case and cask one after another waiting for a better opportunity to examine their contents at last they collected a great many articles together and with their shovels covered them over with sand it being impossible to get them from the beach without more time than they could spare neither was mrs seagrave who was now getting quite strong or juno idle they had made up everything that they could in packages ready for moving on the eighth day after the gale they were ready and it was arranged that ready should put into the boat the bedding and canvas of one tent and should take william with him on his expedition having transported this safe he should return for a load of the most necessary articles and then the family should walk through the grove to the other side of the island and remain there with mr seagrave while ready and william returned for the other tent and after that the boat should make as many trips as the weather would permit till they had brought all the things absolutely required it was a lovely calm morning when ready and william pushed off in the boat which was well loaded and as soon as they were clear of the cove they hoisted the sail and went away before the wind along the coast in two hours they had run to the eastern end of the island and hauled up close inshore the point which ran out and at the end of which there was an inlet was not a mile from them and in a very short time they had lowered the sail and were pulling in for the sandy beach you see william it is fortunate for us that we shall always have a fair wind when we come down loaded and only have to pull our empty boat back again indeed it is how many miles do you think it is from the cove to this part of the island about six or seven not more the island you see is long and narrow now let us get the things out and carry them up and then we will be back to the cove long before dark the boat was soon unloaded but they had some way to carry up the things we shall not mind such a gale as we had the other day when our tents are pitched here william said ready for we shall be protected by the whole width of the cocoa nut grove we shall hardly feel the wind although we shall the rain for that will come down in torrents i must go and see how our spring gets on said william and get a drink from it willy reported the spring to be up to the brim with water and that he had never drunk water so excellent they then pushed off the boat and after rowing for about two hours or more found themselves at the entrance of the cove and mrs seagrave with tommy by her side waving her handkerchief to them they very soon pulled in to the beach and landing received the congratulations of the whole party at their first successful voyage and all expressed their delight at its having proved so much shorter than had been anticipated tommy will go next time said master tommy by and by when tommy grows a little taller replied ready massa tommy you come help me to milk the goats said juno yes tommy milk the goats said the little urchin running after juno you must be almost tired of eating nothing but salt meat and biscuit ma'am said ready as they sat down to their meal but when we are all safe on the other side of the island we hope to feed you better at present it is hard work and hard fare as long as the children are well i care very little about it but i must say that after the last gale i am as anxious as you to be on the other side of the island especially after the account william has given me of it it must be a paradise when do we set off not till the day after to morrow ma'am i should think for you see i must have another trip for the cooking utensils and the bundles which you have made up if you will spare juno to walk through the wood with william to morrow we will then have the tent ready for you and the children chapter twenty one old ready had his boat loaded and had made sail for the other side of the island long before the family were up indeed before they were dressed he had landed his whole cargo on the beach and was sitting down quietly taking his breakfast as soon as he had eaten the beef and biscuit which he had taken with him he carried up the things which he had brought and commenced arrangements for setting up the tent intending to await the arrival of william and juno that they might assist him in getting up the spars and canvas over it about ten o'clock william made his appearance leading one of the goats by a string followed by the others juno came after with the sheep also holding one with a cord the rest had very quietly joined the procession here we are at last said william laughing we have had terrible work in the woods for nanny would run on one side of a tree when i went on the other and then i had to let go the string we fell in with the pigs again and juno gave such a squall i tink 'em wild beast said juno ah what a nice place missis will like to live here yes it is a very nice place juno and you'll be able to wash here and never mind about saving the water i am thinking said william how we are to get the fowls here they are not very wild but still we cannot catch them i'll bring them with me to morrow william but how will you catch them wait till they are gone to roost and then you may catch them when you please and i suppose the pigeons and the pigs must run wild the best thing we can do with them then we shall have to shoot them i suppose well william so we shall and the pigeons also when they have become plentiful if we remain here so long we shall soon be well stocked and live in plenty but now you must help me to get the tent up and everything in order so that your mamma may find things comfortable on her arrival for she will be very tired i dare say walking through the wood mamma is much better than she was replied william i think she will soon be quite strong again especially when she comes to live at this beautiful place we have a great deal of work to do more than we can get through before the rainy season which is a pity but it can't helped by this time next year we shall be more comfortable why what have we to do besides putting up the tents and shifting over here in the first place we have to build a house and that will take a long while then we ought to make a little garden and sow the seeds which your father brought from england with him oh that will be nice where shall we make it ready we must put a fence across that point of land and dig up all the brushwood the mould is very good then what next then we shall want a storehouse for all the things we have got and all that are in the wood and on the beach and consider what a many trips we shall have to make with the little boat to bring them all round yes that is very true ready have we anything more to do plenty we have to build a turtle pond and a fish pond and a bathing place for juno to wash the children in but first we must make a proper well at the spring so as to have plenty of fresh water now there's enough for a year's hard work at least well let us once get mamma and the children here and we will work hard i should wish very much to see it all done william said ready i hope my life will be spared till it is done at all events but why do you say that ready you are an old man but you are strong and healthy i am so now but what does the book say in the midst of life we are in death' you are young and healthy and promise a long life but who knows but you may be summoned away tomorrow can i then an old man worn out with hardships expect to live long no no william still i should like to remain here as long as i can be useful and then i trust i may depart in peace i never wish to leave this island and i have a kind of feeling that my bones will remain on it god's will be done for some time after ready had finished neither of them said a word but continued their employment stretching out the canvas of the tent and fastening it down to the ground with pegs at last william broke the silence ready did you not say your christian name was masterman so it is william it is a very odd christian name you were called after some other person yes i was william he was a very rich man do you know ready i should like very much if you will one day tell me your history i mean your whole life from the time you were a boy well perhaps i may william for there are many parts of my life which would prove a lesson to others but that must be after we have got through our work how old are you ready i am turned of sixty four a very old age for a seaman i could not obtain employment on board of a vessel if it were not that i am well known to several captains but why do you say old for a seaman' because sailors live faster than other people partly from the hardships which they undergo and partly from their own fault in drinking so much spirits and then they are too often reckless and care nothing for their healths but you never drink spirits now no never william but in my early days i was as foolish as others now juno you may bring in the bedding we have two or three hours yet william what shall we do next had we not better make the fireplace all ready for cooking it was what i was going to propose if you had not i shall be here to morrow long before any of you and i will take care that supper is ready on your arrival i brought a bottle of water in my knapsack replied william not so much for the water as because i want to milk the goats and take back the milk for baby you proved yourself not only thoughtful but kind william now while you and juno fetch the stones for the fireplace i will stow away under the trees the things i have brought in the boat shall we let the goats and sheep loose ready oh yes there is no fear of their straying the herbage here is better than on the other side and there is plenty of it well i will let nanny go as soon as juno has milked her now juno let us see how many stones we can carry at once in an hour the fireplace was made ready had done all that he could the goats were milked and let loose and then william and juno set off on their journey back ready went down to the beach on his arrival there he observed a small turtle creeping up softly he got between it and the water and succeeded in turning it over that will do for to morrow said he as he stepped into the boat and laying hold of the oars he pulled out of the bay to return to the cove chapter twenty two ready arrived at the cove and proceeded to the tents where he found the whole party listening to william who was detailing what had been done the arrangements for the next day were made as soon as ready joined them they then separated for the night but ready and william remained until it was dark to catch the fowls and tie their legs ready for their being put in the boat the next morning at daylight all were summoned to dress themselves as soon as possible as ready wanted to take down the tent in which mrs seagrave and the children had slept for with the exception of tommy the others had slept upon some canvas which they had spread out under the cocoa nut trees as soon as mrs seagrave was dressed the tent was taken down and with all the bedding put into the boat then when they had breakfasted the plates knives and forks and some other necessaries were also put in ready laid the fowls on the top of all and set off by himself for their new location after he was gone the rest of the party prepared for their journey through the cocoa nut grove william led the way with the three dogs close to his heels mr seagrave with the baby in his arms juno with little caroline and mrs seagrave with master tommy holding her hand they cast a last look round at the cove and the fragments of the wreck and cargo strewed about in every direction and then turned into the wood ready arrived at the point and was again on shore in less than two hours after he had set off as soon as the boat was safe in he did not wait to land his cargo but going up to the turtle which he had turned the day before he killed it and cleaned it on the beach he then went to where they had built up the fireplace with stones made a fire filled the iron saucepan full of water and set it on to boil he then cut up a portion of the turtle and put it into the pot with some slices of salt pork covered it up and left it to boil and having hung up the rest of the turtle in the shade he went back to the beach to unload the boat he released the poor fowls and they were soon busy seeking for food it was two or three hours before he had carried everything up for it was a good distance and some of the articles were heavy and the old man was not sorry when he had finished his task and could sit down to rest himself it's almost time they arrived thought ready they must have started nearly four hours ago ready remained a quarter of an hour more watching the fire and occasionally skimming the top of the pot when the three dogs came bounding towards him well they are not far off now observed old ready in six or seven minutes afterwards the party made their appearance very hot and very fatigued it appeared that poor little caroline had been tired out and juno had to carry her then mrs seagrave complained of fatigue and they had to rest a quarter of an hour then tommy who refused to remain with his mamma and had been running backwards and forwards from one to the other had declared that he was tired and that someone must carry him but there was no one to carry him so he began to cry until they stopped for another quarter of an hour till he was rested then as soon as they went on again he again complained of being tired william then carried him pickaback for some time and in so doing he missed the blaze cut on the trees and it was a long while before he could find it again then baby became hungry and he cried and little caroline was frightened at being so long in the wood and she cried but finally they got on better and arrived at last so warm and exhausted that mrs seagrave went into the tent with the children to repose a little before she could even look at the place which was to be their future residence i think said mr seagrave that this little journey of to day has been a pretty good proof of how helpless we should have been without you ready i am glad that you are here sir replied ready it is a weight off my mind now you will get on better i think that after a while you may live very comfortably here but still we have much to do as soon as madam has rested we will have our dinner and then fix up our own tent which will be quite enough after such a hard day's work do you go back to the cove to morrow ready yes sir we want our stores here it will take about three trips to empty our storehouses and as to the other things we can examine them and bring them down at our leisure as soon as i have made those three trips in the boat we can then work here altogether but i can do something in the meantime oh yes there is plenty for you to do mr seagrave went into the tent and found his wife much refreshed but the children had all fallen fast asleep on the beds they waited another half hour and then woke tommy and caroline that they might all sit down to dinner dear me exclaimed william as ready took the cover off the saucepan what is it that you have so good there it's a treat i have prepared for you all replied ready i know that you are tired of salt meat so now you are going to feed like aldermen why what is it ready said mrs seagrave it smells very good it is turtle soup ma'am and i hope you will like it for if you do you may often have it now that you are on this side of the island indeed it really is excellent but it wants a little salt have you any salt juno got a little ma'am very little left replied juno what shall we do when all our salt is gone said mrs seagrave juno must get some more replied ready how i get salt hab none left replied juno looking at ready there's plenty out there juno said mr seagrave pointing to the sea i don't know where said juno looking in that direction what do you mean my dear inquired mrs seagrave i only mean if we want salt we can have as much as we please by boiling down salt water in the kettle or else making a salt pan in the rocks and obtaining it by the sun drying up the water and leaving the salt salt is always procured in that way either by evaporation or boiling i'll soon arrange that for you ma'am said ready and show juno how to get it when she wants it i am very glad to hear you say so for i should feel the want of salt very much replied mrs seagrave i really never enjoyed a dinner so much as i have to day the soup was pronounced excellent by everybody as soon as they had finished mrs seagrave remained with the children and ready and mr seagrave assisted by juno and william got the second tent up and everything ready for the night they then all assembled and returned thanks to god for their having gained their new abode and tired out with the fatigue of the day were soon fast asleep chapter twenty three mr seagrave was the first up on the ensuing morning and when ready came out of the tent he said to him do you know ready i feel much happier and my mind much more at ease since i find myself here on the other side of the island everything reminded me that we had been shipwrecked and i could not help thinking of home and my own country but here we appear as if we had been long settled and as if we had come here by choice i trust that feeling will be stronger every day sir for it's no use and indeed sinful to repine i acknowledge it and with all humility what is the first thing which you wish we should set about i think sir the first object is to have a good supply of fresh water and i therefore wish you and william here he is good morning william i was saying that i thought it better that mr seagrave and you should clear out the spring while i am away in the boat i brought another shovel with me yesterday and you both can work perhaps we had better go there as juno i see is getting the breakfast ready you observe mr seagrave we must follow up the spring till we get among the cocoa nut trees where it will be shaded from the sun that is easily done by digging towards them and watching how the water flows then if you will dig out a hole large enough to sink down in the earth one of the water casks which lie on the beach i will bring it down with me this afternoon and then when it is fixed in the earth in that way we shall always have the cask full of water for use and the spring filling it as fast as we empty it i understand replied mr seagrave that shall be our task while you are absent now i have nothing more to do than to speak to juno about dinner replied ready and then i'll just take a mouthful and be off ready directed juno to fry some pork in the frying pan and then to cut off some slices from the turtle and cook turtle steaks for dinner as well as to warm up the soup which was left and then with a biscuit and a piece of beef in his hand he went down to the boat and set off for the cove mr seagrave and william worked hard and by twelve o'clock the hole was quite large and deep enough according to the directions ready had given they then left their work and went to the tent you don't know how much happier i am now that i am here said mrs seagrave taking her husband's hand as he seated himself by her i trust it is a presentiment of future happiness my dear said mr seagrave i assure you that i feel the same and was saying so to ready this morning i feel that i could live here for ever it is so calm and beautiful but i miss one thing there are no birds singing here as at home i have seen no birds except sea birds and of them there is plenty have you william only once father i saw a flight a long way off ready was not with me and i could not tell what they were but they were large birds as big as pigeons i should think there is ready coming round the point continued william how fast that little boat sails it is a long pull though for the old man when he goes to the cove let us go down and help ready carry up some of the things before dinner said mrs seagrave they did so and william rolled up the empty water cask which ready had brought with him the turtle steaks were as much approved of as the turtle soup indeed after having been so long on salt meat a return to fresh provisions was delightful and now to finish our well said william as soon as dinner was over how hard you do work william said his mother so i ought mother i must learn to do everything now and that you will very soon said ready they rolled the cask to the spring and to their astonishment found the great hole which they had dug not two hours before quite full of water oh dear said william we shall have to throw all the water out to get the cask down think a little william said mr seagrave for the spring runs so fast that it will not be an easy task cannot we do something else why father the cask will float you know replied william to be sure it will as it is but is there no way of making it sink oh yes i know we must bore some holes in the bottom and then it will fill and sink down of itself exactly replied ready i expected that we should have to do that and have the big gimlet with me ready bored three or four holes in the bottom of the cask and as it floated the water ran into it and by degrees it gradually sank down as soon as the top of the cask was level with the surface they filled in all round with the spade and shovel and the well was completed chapter twenty four the next morning as soon as breakfast was over mr seagrave observed now that we have so many things to do i think ready we ought to lay down a plan of operations method is everything when work is to be done now tell me what you propose shall be our several occupations for the next week for to morrow is sunday and although we have not yet been able to honour the day as we should i think that now we must and ought to keep it holy yes sir replied ready to morrow we will rest from our labour and ask god's blessing upon our endeavours during the six days of the week and now as to your proposition mr seagrave shall we begin first with the lady you must not consider that you have ladies with you now ready said mrs seagrave at least not fine ladies my health and strength are recovering fast and i mean to be very useful i propose to assist juno in all the domestic duties such as the cookery and washing to look after and teach the children mend all the clothes and make all that is required to the best of my ability if i can do more i will i think we may be satisfied with that mr seagrave replied ready now sir the two most pressing points with the exception of building the house are to dig up a piece of ground and plant our potatoes and seeds and to make a turtle pond so as to catch the turtle and put them in before the season is over you are right replied mr seagrave but which ought to be done first i should say the turtle pond as it will be only a few days' work for you juno and william i shall not want your assistance for this next week i shall fix upon some spot not far from here where the trees are thickest in the grove and cut them down so as to clear out a space in which we will by and by build our storerooms and as soon as the rainy season has gone by we can remove all our stores from the other side of the island it will occupy me the whole of the week cutting down the trees and sawing them into proper lengths ready for building the house and then we must all join our strength and get it up without delay can you really manage to get it up in time how soon do you expect the rains will come on in three or four weeks after next week i shall probably have the assistance of two of you if not of all now i think of it i must return to the cove what for don't you recollect sir your two wheeled carriage packed up in matting which was thrown on shore in the gale you laughed when you saw it and said it would be of little use now but the wheels and axle will be very useful as we can make a wide path to the place when i cut down the trees and wheel out the logs much more easily than we can drag or carry them that is an excellent idea it will save a great deal of labour i expect that it will sir william and i will go away early on monday morning and be back before breakfast to day we will fix upon the spots where our garden is to be our turtle pond to be made and the trees to be cut down that shall be our business mr seagrave and william and juno may put things a little more to rights here mr seagrave and ready then walked down to the beach and after surveying the reefs for some time ready said you see mr seagrave we do not want too much water for a turtle pond as if it is too deep there is a difficulty in catching them when we want them what we want is a space of water surrounded by a low wall of stones so that the animals cannot escape for they cannot climb up although they can walk on the shelving sand with their flippers now the reef here is high out of the water and the space within the reef and the beach is deep enough and the rocks on the beach nearly fill up that side and prevent them crawling away by the shore we have therefore little more to do than to fill up the two other sides and then our pond will be complete i see it will not be a long job either if we can find loose rocks enough replied mr seagrave almost all those which are on the beach are loose replied ready and there are plenty close to us some of them will be too heavy to carry but they can be brought here by the aid of handspikes and crowbars suppose we make a signal for william and juno and set them to work mr seagrave called and waved his hat and juno and william came down to them juno was ordered to go back for two handspikes while ready explained to william what was to be done having stayed with them and assisted them for some time after juno had returned with the implements mr seagrave and ready proceeded to the point to fix upon a spot for a garden leaving william and juno to continue their labour chapter twenty five mr seagrave and ready then continued their way along the beach until they arrived at the point which the latter had considered as a convenient place to make the garden they found a sufficiency of mould and as the point was narrow at its joining on to the mainland no great length of enclosure would be required you see sir said ready we can wait till after the rainy season is over before we put up the fence and we can prepare it in the meantime when the weather will permit us to work the seeds and potatoes will not come up until after the rains are finished so all we have to do is to dig up the ground and put them in as fast as we can we cannot make a large garden this year but our potatoes we must contrive to get in if we cannot manage anything else if we have no fence to make replied mr seagrave i think we shall be able to clear away quite enough ground in a week to put in all that we require the first job will be to pull up the small brushwood said ready and turn up the ground the larger plants we must leave if we have not time tommy might be of some use here in taking away the shrubs as you pull them up but we had better now go on to the grove and choose the spot for cutting down the trees i have made my mark ready and mr seagrave proceeded in the direction which the former had pointed out until they arrived at a spot on a rising ground where the trees were so thick that it was not very easy to pass through them there is the place said ready i propose to cut all the timber we want for the houses out of this part of the grove and to leave an open square place in the centre of which we will build our storerooms you see sir if necessary with a very little trouble we might turn it into a place of protection and defence as a few palisades here and there between the trees would make it what they call in the east indies a stockade very true but i trust we shall not require it for such a purpose i hope so too but there is nothing like being prepared however we have plenty to do before we can think of that now sir as dinner is ready suppose we return and after dinner we will both commence our tasks juno and william returned to the dinner which mrs seagrave had prepared they were both very warm with their work which was very hard but very eager to finish their task after dinner was over mrs seagrave requested her husband as he was about to go down to the point with the spade and a small hatchet in his hand to take tommy with him as she had a great deal to do and could not watch him as well as the baby and caroline so mr seagrave took tommy by the hand and led him to the point and made him sit down close to him while he cleared away the brushwood mr seagrave worked very hard and when he had cut down and cleared a portion of the ground he made tommy carry away to a little distance and pile in a heap the bushes which he had cleared away when mr seagrave had cleared away a large piece of ground with his hatchet he then took his spade to dig at the roots and turn up the mould leaving tommy to amuse himself what tommy did for about an hour during which mr seagrave worked very diligently his father did not observe but all of a sudden he began to cry and when his father asked him the reason he did not answer but only cried the more until at last he put his hands to his stomach and roared most lustily as he appeared to be in very great pain his father left off work and led him up to the tent when mrs seagrave came out alarmed at his cries ready who had heard tommy screaming for so long a while thought that there might be something serious and left his work to ascertain the cause when he heard what had passed he said depend upon it the child has eaten something which has made him ill tell me tommy what did you eat when you were down there berries roared tommy i thought as much ma'am said ready i must go and see what the berries were and the old man hastened down to the place where mr seagrave had been at work in the meantime mrs seagrave was much alarmed lest the child should have poisoned himself and mr seagrave went to search among the medicines for some castor oil ready returned just as he came back to the tent with the bottle of castor oil and he told ready that he was about to give tommy a dose well sir replied ready who had a plant in his hand i don't think you should give him any for it appears to me that he has taken too much already this is if i recollect right the castor oil plant and here are some of the castor oil beans which master tommy has been eating tell me tommy did you eat them yes cried tommy i thought so give him a little warm drink ma'am and he'll soon be better it will teach him not to eat berries or beans again what ready said was true nevertheless master tommy was very ill for the whole of the day and was put early to bed chapter twenty six the next day when mr seagrave william juno and ready were all at work at their allotted tasks mrs seagrave was sitting down at the front of the tent the little baby albert crawling close to her caroline trying to work with her needle and tommy was making holes in the ground and putting a small stone into each hole what are you doing tommy said mrs seagrave i'm making a garden replied tommy making a garden then you ought to plant some trees in it no i'm sowing seeds look here replied tommy pointing to the stones but these are stones not seeds well but i pretend and that's the same thing replied tommy not exactly tommy suppose instead of eating those beans yesterday you had only pretended to eat them wouldn't it have been better i won't eat any more replied tommy no not of those beans but if you saw anything else which you thought you would like i am afraid you would eat it and be as ill and even worse than you were i like cocoa nuts why don't we have some there's plenty upon the trees but who is to climb up so high tommy can you no but why don't ready climb or papa or william i suppose they will get some by and by when they are not so busy but they have no time now i like turtle soup replied tommy william and juno are making a pond to put turtle in and then we shall have it oftener but we cannot have everything we like when we wish for it i like fried fish said tommy why don't we have fried fish because every one is too busy to catch them just now tommy go and bring your brother albert back he has crawled too near to billy and he butts sometimes tommy went after the baby who was crawling towards the kid which had now grown pretty large and as he took up his brother he kicked at the goat's head don't do that tommy he'll butt at you and hurt you i don't care replied tommy holding the baby by one hand while he continued to kick at billy billy however would not stand it he lowered his head made a butt at tommy and he and albert rolled on the ground one over the other the baby roared and tommy began to whimper mrs seagrave ran up to them and caught up the baby and tommy alarmed caught hold of his mother's dress for protection looking behind him at billy who appeared inclined to renew the attack why don't you mind what is said to you tommy i told you that he would butt you said mrs seagrave pacifying the child i don't care for him replied tommy who perceived that the goat was walking away no you are very brave now that he has gone but you're a very naughty boy not to mind what is said to you billy never butts at me mamma said caroline no my dear because you do not tease him but your brother is very fond of teasing animals and so he gets punished and frightened it is very wrong of him to do so especially as he is told by his father and me that he ought not you said i was a good boy when i learnt my lesson this morning replied tommy yes but you should always be good replied his mother i can't be always good said tommy i want my dinner it is dinner time tommy that is certain but you must wait until they all come home from their work there's ready coming with a bag on his shoulder replied tommy ready soon came up to where mrs seagrave was sitting and laid down the bag i've brought you some young cocoa nuts and some old ones also from the trees that i have been cutting down oh cocoa nuts i like cocoa nuts cried tommy i told you tommy that we should have some by and by and they have come sooner than we thought you are very warm ready yes ma'am replied ready wiping his face it is rather warm work for there is no breeze in the grove to cool one is there anything you want from the other side of the island for i shall go there directly after dinner what for i must bring the wheels to get the timber out for i must clear it away as i go until the path is finished i must have william to help me william will like the trip i do not doubt i do not recollect anything in particular that we want ready replied mrs seagrave there he comes with juno and i see mr seagrave has laid down his spade so caroline dear take care of albert while i get the dinner for them ready assisted mrs seagrave and the dinner was spread out on the ground for they had not brought the chairs and tables with them to their new residence as they thought that they could do without them till the house was built william reported that juno and he would have the turtle pond complete by the next day mr seagrave had cleared sufficient ground to plant the half sack of potatoes that they had saved so that in a day or two they would be able to put all their strength upon the cutting and drawing of the timber after dinner william and ready set off in the boat and before it was dark returned with the wheels and axle of the carriage and several other articles to make up their load chapter twenty seven now william said ready if you are not very sleepy perhaps you would like to come with me to night and see if we cannot turn some of the turtle for the season is going away fast and they will leave the island very soon as soon as the sun had disappeared william and ready went down to the beach and sat quietly on a rock in a short time ready perceived a turtle crawling on the sand and desiring william to follow him without speaking walked softly down by the water's edge so as to get between the animal and the sea as soon as the turtle perceived them it made for the water but they met it and ready seizing hold of one of its fore flippers turned it over on its back you see william that is the way to turn a turtle take care that he does not catch you with his mouth for if he did he would bite the piece out now the animal cannot get away for he can't turn over again and we shall find him here to morrow morning so we will now walk along the beach and see if we cannot find some more ready and william remained till past midnight and turned sixteen turtle i think that will do william for once we have made a good night's work of it for we have provided food for many days tomorrow we must put them all into the pond how shall we carry such large animals we need not carry them we must put some old canvas under them and haul them along by that means we can easily do that on the smooth sand why don't we catch some fish ready we might put them into the turtle pond they would not stay there long william nor could we easily get them out if they did i have often thought of getting some lines ready and yet the time has never come for i feel sleepy after our day's work but as soon as the house is built we will have them and you shall be fisherman in chief but the fish will bite at night will they not oh yes and better than they do in the daytime well then if you will get me a line and show me how i will fish for an hour or so after the work is done i know mamma is getting tired of salt meat and does not think it good for caroline well then i will get a bit of candle to morrow night and fit up two fishing lines but i must go with you william we don't use much candle at all events no we are too glad to go to bed but there are two or three boxes of one sort or another up in the cove the next morning before breakfast all hands were employed in getting the turtle into the pond after breakfast william and juno finished the pond where the walls had not been raised high enough and when they returned to dinner reported that their task was completed mr seagrave also said that he had he thought cleared quite ground enough for the present and as mrs seagrave wanted juno to help her to wash the linen that afternoon it was agreed that william ready and mr seagrave should all go down to the garden and put in the potatoes ready worked with the spade while mr seagrave and william cut the potatoes in pieces so as to have an eye in each piece when they had finished this work mr seagrave said now that we have finished cutting the potatoes let us go and assist ready in planting them and the seeds which we have brought down with us chapter twenty eight that night ready sat up for two or three hours working by candle light william keeping him company very busily engaged fitting up the fishing lines with leads and hooks at last two were complete what bait must we use ready i should think that the best would be one of the fish out of the shells which are in the sand but a piece of pork fat will i dare say do as well and whereabouts would you fish ready the best place i should think would be at the farthermost end of the point where i got the boat through the reef the water is deep there close to the rocks i was thinking ready if those gannets and men of war birds would be good eating not very william they are very tough and very fishy we must try for those when we can get nothing better now that we have got in the seeds and potatoes we must all set to to morrow morning to fell and carry the timber i think mr seagrave had better use the axe with me and you and juno can when i have shown you how hang the timber to the axle and wheel it out to the place where we have decided upon building the house and now we had better go to bed william however had made up his mind to do otherwise he knew that his mother would be very glad to have some fish and he determined as the moon shone bright to try if he could not catch some before he went to bed so he waited very quietly till he thought ready was asleep as well as the others and then went out with the lines and went down to the beach where he picked up three or four shells and breaking them between two pieces of rock took out the fish and baited his hooks he then walked to the point it was a beautiful night the water was very smooth and the moonbeams pierced deep below the surface william threw in his line and as soon as the lead touched the bottom he pulled it up about a foot as ready had instructed him and he had not held his line more than half a minute when it was jerked so forcibly that not expecting it he was nearly hauled into the water as it was the fish was so strong that the line slipped through his hand and scored his fingers but after a time he was able to pull it in and he landed on the beach a large silver scaled fish weighing nine or ten pounds as soon as he had dragged it so far away from the edge of the rocks as to prevent its flapping into the water again william took out the hook and determined to try for another his line was down as short a time as before when it was again jerked with violence but william was this time prepared and he let out the line and played the fish till it was tired and then pulled it up and found that the second fish was even larger than the first satisfied with his success he wound up his lines and running a piece of string through the gills of the fish dragged them back to the tents and hanged them to the pole for fear of the dogs eating them he then went in and was soon fast asleep the next morning william was the first up and showed his prizes with much glee but ready was very much displeased with him you did very wrong william to run the risk which you did if you were resolved to catch fish why did you not tell me and i would have gone with you you say yourself that the fish nearly hauled you into the water suppose it had done so or suppose a small shark instead of one of these gropers as we call them had taken the bait you must have been jerked in and the rocks are so steep there that you would not have been able to get out again before a shark had hold of you think a moment what would have been the distress of your father and the agony and despair of your poor mother when this news should have arrived i was very wrong ready replied william now that i think of it but i wanted to surprise and please my mother that reason is almost sufficient to plead your pardon my dear boy replied ready but don't do so again and now let us say no more about it nobody will know that you have been in danger and there's no harm done and you mustn't mind an old man scolding you a little no indeed ready i do not for i was very thoughtless but i had no idea that there was danger there's your mother coming out of her tent replied ready good morning madam do you know what william has done for you last night look here are two beautiful fish and very excellent eating they are i can tell you i am quite delighted replied mrs seagrave tommy clapped his hands and danced about crying fried fish for dinner and juno said have very fine dinner to day missy caroline after breakfast they all set out for the grove where ready had been cutting down the trees taking with them the wheels and axle and a couple of stout ropes mr seagrave and ready cut down the trees and slung them to the axle and juno and william dragged them to the spot where the house was to be built they were not sorry when dinner was ready for it was very hard work that night tired as they were ready and william went out and turned eight more turtle they continued felling the cocoa nut trees and dragging the timber for the remainder of the week when they considered that they had nearly enough and on tuesday morning they commenced building the house chapter twenty nine ready had cut out and prepared the door posts and window frames from timber which he had towed round from the cove he now fixed four poles in the earth upright at each corner and then with the assistance of mr seagrave notched every log of cocoa nut wood on both sides where it was to meet with the one crossing it so that by laying log upon log alternately they fitted pretty close and had only to have the chinks between them filled in with cocoa nut leaves twisted very tight and forced between them this was the work of william and juno when no more logs were ready for carrying and by degrees the house rose up from its foundation the fireplace could not be made at once as they had either to find clay or to burn shells into lime and build it up with rocks and mortar but a space was left for it for three weeks they worked very hard as soon as the sides were up they got on the whole of the roof and rafters and then with the broad leaves of the cocoa nut trees which had been cut down ready thatched it very strong and securely at the end of the three weeks the house was secure from the weather and it was quite time for the weather had begun to change the clouds now gathered thick and the rainy season was commencing we have no time to lose sir said ready to mr seagrave we have worked hard but we must for a few days work harder still we must fit up the inside of the house so as to enable madam to get into it as soon as possible the earth in the inside of the house was then beaten down hard so as to make a floor and a sort of bedstead about two feet from the ground running the whole length of the house was raised on each side of the interior these were fitted with canvas screens to let down by night and then ready and william took the last trip in the boat to fetch the chairs and tables which they did just before the coming on of the first storm of the season the bedding and all the utensils were now taken into the house and a little outhouse was built up to cook in until the fireplace could be made it was late on the saturday night that the family shifted into the new house and fortunate it was that they had no further occasion for delay for on the sunday the first storm burst upon them the wind blew with great force and although they were shielded from it still the cocoa nut trees ground and sawed each other's stems as they bent their heads to its force the lightning was vivid and the thunder appalling while the rain descended in a continual torrent the animals left the pastures and sheltered themselves in the grove and although noonday it was so dark that they could not see to read this then is the rainy season which you talked about ready said mrs seagrave is it always like this if so what shall we do no madam the sun will shine sometimes but not for long at a time we shall be able to get out and do something every now and then almost every day but still we shall have rain perhaps for many days without intermission and we must work indoors how thankful we ought to be that we have a house over our heads we should have been drowned in the tents that i knew madam and therefore i was anxious to get a house over your head let us thank god for it indeed we ought observed mr seagrave and it is indeed time for us to read the service the morning service was then performed in the new house violent as the rain was it did not penetrate through the thatch which had been put on ready and william went out to secure the boat which they were afraid would be injured and returned wet to the skin the storm continued without intermission the whole of the night but they slept dry and safe and when awakened by the noise of the thunder and the pelting of the rain they thanked god that they had found a dwelling in the wilderness upon which they had been cast chapter thirty when they all rose up the next morning the clouds had cleared off and the sun was shining bright ready and juno were the first out of the house ready with the telescope under his arm which he always took with him when he went his rounds as he termed it in the morning well juno said ready this is a fine morning after the rain yes massa ready very fine morning but how i get fire light and make kittle boil for breakfast i really don't know stick and cocoa nut trash all so wet before i went to bed last night juno i covered up the embers with ashes put some stones over them and then some cocoa nut branches so i think you will find some fire there yet i was going my morning's round but i will stay a little and help you tank you massa ready plenty rain fell last night yes not a little juno you must not expect to find the water at the well very clear this morning indeed i doubt if you will see the well at all here's some stuff which is not very wet i got plenty of fire too replied juno who had removed the branches and stones and was now on her knees blowing up the embers you'll do very well now juno said ready besides william will be out directly so i'll leave you ready whistled to the dogs who came bounding out and then set off on his round of inspection he first directed his steps to the well in the ravine but instead of the gushing spring and the limpid clear water with which the cask sunk for a well had been filled there was now a muddy torrent rushing down the ravine and the well was covered with it and not to be distinguished i thought as much said ready musing over the impetuous stream well better too much water than too little ready waded through as he wished to examine the turtle pond which was on the other side of the stream finding all right he again crossed the water where it was now spread wide over the sandy beach until he came to the other point where he had moored his boat both by the head and stern with a rope and a heavy stone made fast to it as an anchor from this point as usual he surveyed the horizon with his telescope not that he thought that there was a chance of a vessel arriving among these islands but still as it was possible he took the trouble but never except when he went out in the morning alone as he was aware that the very circumstance of his so doing would make mr seagrave melancholy and unsettled as usual he dropped the telescope on his arm after his survey saying to himself little use doing that the gale having blown offshore the boat had dragged her moorings and was so far out that ready could not get at her here's a puzzle said the old man how foolish of me not to have made a line fast to the shore i'll not trust myself to john shark by swimming to the boat let me see ready took the halyards and sheets belonging to the boat's sails which he had left on the beach and bent one on to the other until he had sufficient length of rope he then made a piece of wood about two feet long fast by the middle to the end of the rope and after one or two attempts contrived to throw it into the boat the piece of wood caught under one of the thwarts and this enabled him to draw the boat to the shore having baled out the water which had fallen into her during the storm he then landed again and examined the garden now to find the sheep and goats said ready and then my morning's walk is over now romulus now remus boys find them out continued he and the dogs who appeared to know what he was in search of went away in pursuit and soon found the sheep and two of the goats but the third goat was not with them why where can black nanny be muttered ready stopping a little while at last he heard a bleat in a small copse of brushwood to which he directed his steps followed by the dogs i thought as much said he as he perceived nanny lying down in the copse with two new born kids at her side come my little fellows we must find some shelter for you said he taking one up under each arm come nanny ready walked back to the house and brought in the kids followed by nanny he found mr and mrs seagrave and the children all dressed caroline and tommy gave a scream of delight when they saw the little kids and even little albert clapped his hands as soon as ready put them down on the ground tommy and caroline had each their arms round one i've brought an addition to our family mrs seagrave said ready we must allow them to remain in the house until i can knock up a little shelter for them this is only a beginning i expect we shall soon have more as soon as the children could be persuaded to part with the kids nanny was tied up in a corner and was very content with fondling and nursing her progeny juno and william brought in the breakfast and as soon as it was over mr seagrave said now ready i think we must hold a council and make arrangements as to our allotted duties and employments during the rainy season we have a great deal to do and must not be idle yes sir we have a great deal to do and to get through our work we must have order and method in our doings i've lived long enough to know how much can be done by regularity and discipline why sir there is more work got out of men in a well conducted man of war than there can in the merchant service in double the time and why so because everything is in its place and there is a place for everything i agree with you said mrs seagrave method is everything while one careless little girl is looking for her thimble another will have finished her work i assure you i never should have known what can be done by order and arrangement if i had not been pressed on board of a man of war i found that everything was done in silence every man was to his post everyone had a rope to haul upon or a rope to let go the boatswain piped and in a few seconds every sail was set or taken in as was required it seemed to me at first like magic and you observe mr seagrave that when there is order and discipline every man becomes of individual importance if i learnt nothing else on board of a man of war i learnt to make the most of time and the most of the strength which you could command you are very right ready you must teach us to do the same replied mr seagrave we have so much to do that i hardly know where to begin yet sir we must work at present how we can and when we can until we have got things into a little better order we have done well up to the present what do you think we ought to do first well sir our first job will be to haul up the boat and secure her from harm we will half dock her in the sand and cover her over for i do not think it will be safe to go in her now to the other side of the island where the sea will always be rough there i perfectly agree with you now what is the next why sir we must not leave the tents where they are but take them down and as soon as they are dry stow them away for we may want them by and by then sir we must build a large outhouse for our stores and provisions with a thatched roof and a floor raised about four feet from the ground and then under the floor the sheep and goats will have a protection from the weather then there is the fish pond to make and also a salt pan to cut out of the rock then we have two more long jobs one is to go through the woods and examine the stores we have left on the other side of the island sort and arrange them all ready for bringing here after the rains are over and we must also explore the island a little and find out what it produces for at present we know nothing of it we may find a great many things useful to us a great many trees and fruits and i hope and trust we may be able to find some more grass for our live stock i agree with you in all you say ready replied mr seagrave now how shall we divide our strength we will not divide at present sir if you please juno has plenty to do indoors with mrs seagrave william and you and i will first secure the boat and stow away the tents and gear after that we will set about the outbuilding and work at it when we can if juno has any time to spare she had better collect the cocoa nut leaves and pile them up for fuel and tommy will i dare say go with her and show her how to draw them along yes i'll show her said tommy getting on his feet not just now tommy said ready but as soon as your mamma can spare her to go with you come sir a few hours of weather like this is not to be lost continued ready we shall have more rain before the day is over i expect i will first go to the tent for the shovels then i will haul the boat round to the beach and meet you there you and william can take some cord tie up a large bundle of cocoa nut boughs sling it to the wheels and draw it down to the beach and meet me chapter thirty one as so many cocoa nut trees had been cut down to build the house there were plenty of boughs lying in every direction and william and mr seagrave had soon procured sufficient in a very short time the boat was drawn up about ten yards from the water's edge which ready said was quite sufficient they then dug from under with their shovels until the boat was sunk about half down in the sand having filled in the sand all round her up to her gunnel the boat was then carefully covered over with the boughs which were weighed down with sand that they might not be blown away i don't see why you should cover the boat up in this way ready the rain won't hurt her observed william no sir the rain won't do her any harm but the sun will when it bursts out occasionally for it's very powerful when it does shine and it would split her all to pieces i forgot that replied william what shall we do now suppose as we have two hours to dinner time you run for the lines william and we'll try for some fish we cannot all three of us fish with only two lines said mr seagrave no sir and as william knows how to catch them suppose you remain with him and i will go up and collect wood and chips for juno's fire she was hard pressed for it this morning it was so wet but if once piled up it will soon be dry be careful mr seagrave not to hold the lines tight in your hands or you may be jerked into the water mr seagrave and william were very fortunate before the two hours were expired they had caught eight large fish which they brought up to the house slung on the boat hook tommy hallooed loudly for fish for dinner and as they had caught so many it was agreed that the dinner should be put off until some could be got ready and they were not sorry to eat them instead of salt pork they had hardly sat down to table when the rain came pattering down on the roof and in a quarter of an hour the storm was as violent and the thunder and lightning as terrific as on the day before all outdoor labour was again suspended mrs seagrave juno and caroline took their work for there was plenty to do with the needle and thread and ready soon found employment for the rest william and mr seagrave unlaid some thick rope that ready might make smaller and more useful rope with the yarns ready took up his sailing needles and worked eyelet holes in the canvas screens which they had put up in a hurry so that they might be drawn to and fro as required as soon as ready had hung up the curtains he looked under the bedsteads for a large bundle and said as he opened it i shall now decorate madam seagrave's sleeping place it ought to be handsomer than the others the bundle was composed of the ship's ensign which was red and a large square yellow flag with the name of the ship pacific in large black letters upon it these two flags ready festooned and tied up round the bed place so as to give it a very gay appearance and also to hide the rough walls of the cottage indeed ready i am much obliged to you said mrs seagrave when he had finished it is really quite grand for this place it's the best use we can put them to now madam said ready i am afraid so replied mr seagrave thoughtfully ready said william after the candles were lighted you once half promised me that you would tell me your history i wish you would tell us some of it now as it will pass away the evening well william i did say so and i shall keep my word when you have heard my story you will say that i have been very foolish in my time and so i have but if it proves a warning to you it will at all events be of some use ready then commenced his history as follows history of old ready of course you wish to know who my father and mother were that is soon told my father was the captain of a merchant vessel which traded from south shields to hamburg and my poor mother god bless her was the daughter of a half pay militia captain who died about two months after their marriage the property which the old gentleman had bequeathed to my mother was added to that which my father had already vested in the brig and he then owned one third of the vessel the other two thirds were the property of a very rich ship builder and owner of the name of masterman what with the profits of the share he held of the vessel and his pay as captain my father was well to do mr masterman who had a very high opinion of my father and gained much money by his exertions and good management was present at the marriage and when i was born about a year afterwards he stood for me as godfather every one considered that this was a most advantageous circumstance for me and congratulated my father and mother for mr masterman was a bachelor of nearly sixty years without any near relations it is true that he was very fond of money but that they said was all the better as he could not take it away with him when he died an end however was soon put to all their worldly ideas for a year after i was born my father was drowned at sea his vessel and the whole of her crew being lost on the texel sands and my mother found herself a widow with a child scarcely weaned when she was but twenty two years of age it was supposed that my mother would still have sufficient to live upon as the ship had been insured at two thirds of her value but to the astonishment of everybody mr masterman contrived to make it appear that it was his two thirds of the vessel which had been insured what is insurance inquired william insurance my dear boy is paying a certain sum to people who are called underwriters that in case the vessel or cargo is lost or damaged the loss or damage is made good to the owners of the vessel or cargo you pay in proportion to the risk incurred supposing you wished to insure one thousand pounds on a vessel or cargo and ten per cent was required you would if the vessel came home safe pay the underwriters one hundred pounds if on the contrary the vessel was lost the underwriters would have to pay you one thousand pounds the sum which you had insured i beg your pardon for the interruption ready no need mr seagrave we never should lose an opportunity of teaching the young well how far the assertion of mr masterman was correct or not it was impossible at the time to say but i do know that everybody cried out shame' and that if he did deprive the widow he had much to answer for for the bible says pure religion is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction and to keep yourself unspotted in the world' the consequence was that my mother had little or nothing to live upon but she found friends who assisted her and she worked embroidery and contrived to get on somehow until i was eight or nine years of age but did not your godfather come forward to the assistance of your mother inquired mr seagrave no sir strange to say he did not and that made people talk the more i believe it was the abuse of him which he did not fail to hear and which he ascribed to my mother which turned him away from us perhaps it was his own conscience for we always dislike those we have injured unfortunately there is great truth in that remark of yours ready observed mr seagrave still it is strange that he did not do something it was very strange sir at least so it appeared at the time but he was very fond of money and irritated at the reports and observations which were made about him but to go on sir i was a strong hardy boy and whenever i could escape from my mother or school was always found by the water side or on board of the vessels in the summer time i was half the day in water and was a very good swimmer my mother perceived my fondness for the profession and tried all she could to divert my thoughts some other way she told me of the dangers and hardships which sailors went through and always ended with my father's death and a flood of tears we certainly are of a perverse nature as i have often heard the clergyman say for it appears to me that we always wish to do that which we are told not to do if my mother had not been always persuading me against going to sea i really believe i might have stayed at home i've often thought since how selfish and unfeeling i must have been i was too young to know what pain i was giving my mother and how anxiety was preying upon her all on my account children cannot feel it if they did they would do otherwise for our hearts are seldom hard until we grow older i agree with you ready said mr seagrave if children really knew how much their parents suffer when they behave ill how alarmed they are at any proofs of wickedness in them they would be much better we never find that out sir till it is too late continued ready well sir i was little more than nine years old when on a very windy day and the water rough a hawser by which a vessel was fast to the wharf was carried away with a violent jerk and the broken part as it flew out struck a person who was at the edge of the wharf and knocked him into the sea i heard the crying out and the men from the wharf and from the ships were throwing ropes to him but he could not catch hold of them indeed he could not swim well and the water was rough i caught a rope that had been hauled in again and leapt off the wharf young as i was i swam like a duck and put the rope into his hands just as he was going down he clung to it as drowning men only can cling and was hauled to the piles and soon afterwards a boat which had been lowered from the stern of one of the vessels picked us both up we were taken to a public house and put into bed till dry clothes could be sent for us and then i found that the person i had saved was my godfather mr masterman everyone was loud in my praise and although perhaps i ought not to say it it was a bold act for so young a boy as i was the sailors took me home to my mother in a sort of triumphal procession and she poor thing when she heard what i had done embraced me over and over again one moment rejoicing at my preservation and the next weeping bitterly at the thoughts of the danger i had encountered and the probability that my bold spirit would lead me into still greater but she did not blame you for what you had done oh no william she felt that i had done my duty towards my neighbour and perhaps she felt in her own heart that i had returned good for evil but she did not say so the next day mr masterman called upon us he certainly looked very foolish and confused when he asked for his godson whom he had so long neglected my mother who felt how useful he might be to me received him very kindly but i had been often told of his neglect of me and my mother and of his supposed unfair conduct towards my father and had taken a violent dislike to him his advances towards me were therefore very coolly received i felt glad that i had saved him but although i could not exactly understand my own feelings at the time i am ashamed to say that my pleasure was not derived from having done a good action so much as indulging a feeling of revenge in having put one under an obligation who had treated me ill this arose from my proud spirit which my mother could not check so you see william there was very little merit in what i had done as after i had done it i indulged those feelings which i ought to have checked i think i could not have helped feeling the same ready under such circumstances replied william the impulse which induced me to act was good replied ready but the feeling which i indulged in afterwards took away the whole merit of the deed i am stating what i believe to be the truth and an old man like me can look upon the past without bias but not without regret mr masterman made but a short visit he told my mother that he would now take care of me and bring me up to the business of a ship builder as soon as i was old enough to leave school and that in the meantime he would pay all my expenses my poor mother was very grateful and shed tears of joy and when mr masterman went away she embraced me and said that now she was happy as i should have a profession on shore and not go to sea i must do justice to mr masterman he kept his word and sent money to my mother so that she became quite cheerful and comfortable and everyone congratulated her and she used to fondle me and say it was all through me that she was relieved from her distress how happy that must have made you ready said william yes it did but it made me also very proud strange to say i could not conquer my dislike to mr masterman i had nourished the feeling too long i could not bear that my mother should be under obligations to him or that he should pay for my schooling it hurt my foolish pride young as i then was and although my mother was happy i was not besides as i was put to a better school and was obliged to remain with the other boys i could no longer run about the wharfs or go on board the vessels as before i did not see then as i do now that it was all for my good but i became discontented and unhappy merely because i was obliged to pay attention to my learning and could no longer have my own way the master complained of me and mr masterman called and scolded me well i became more disobedient and then i was punished this irritated me and i made up my mind that i would run away to sea you see william i was all in the wrong and so will all boys be who think they know better than those who have charge of them and now only see what i probably lost by my foolish conduct i say probably for no one can calculate or foresee what is to take place but as far as appearances went i had every prospect of receiving a good education of succeeding mr masterman in his business and very probably of inheriting his large fortune so that i might have been at this time a rich and well educated man surrounded with all the comforts and luxuries of life perhaps with an amiable wife and large family round me to make me still happier instead of being what i now am a poor worn out old seaman upon a desert isle i point this out to you william to show how one false and foolish step in the young may affect their whole prospects in life and instead of enabling them to sail down with the stream of prosperity may leave them to struggle against the current of adversity as has been the case with me it is indeed a good lesson ready said mr seagrave it is not that i repine at my lot even while i regret the errors that led to it an all wise and gracious god disposes of us as he thinks best and i can now say with perfect sincerity thy will not mine be done' your misfortunes have however proved an incalculable benefit to us ready observed mrs seagrave for had you not gone to sea and been on board the ship when the crew deserted us what would have become of us well madam it is some comfort to think that a worn out old seaman like myself has been of some use chapter thirty two the bleating of the kids woke them the next morning earlier than usual the weather was again fine and the sun shining brightly and ready turned out nanny and her progeny they had an excellent breakfast of fried fish and then mr seagrave ready and william went out to their work the two first took down the tents and spread the canvas on the ground that it might be well dried while william went in pursuit of the fowls which had not been seen for a day or two after half an hour's search in the cocoa nut grove he heard the cock crow and soon afterwards found them all he threw them some split peas which he had brought with him they were hungry enough and followed him home to the house where he left them and went to join ready and his father william said ready i think now that we have spread out the tents we will if mr seagrave approves all set to at once and knock up a fowl house it won't be more than a day's job and then the creatures will have a home there are four very thick cocoa nut trees close to the house we will build it under them it will be a good job over mr seagrave assented and they set immediately to work there were many thin poles left the tops of the cocoa nut trees which had been cut down to build the house these they nailed to the trunks of the four trees so as to make a square and then they ran up rafters for a pitched roof now sir this is only rough work we will first put up a perch or two for them and then close in the side and thatch the roof with cocoa nut branches but there's juno taking in the dinner so we'll finish it afterwards after their meal the work was renewed mr seagrave collected the branches while william and ready worked upon the sides and roof and before the evening closed in the fowl house was complete william enticed the fowls down to it with some more split peas and then walked away now sir the creatures will soon find their way in and by and by when i have time i'll make a door to the entrance and now said william i think we had better roll up the canvas of the tents we have had a splendid day and may not be so fortunate to morrow very true we will get them housed and stow them away under the bed places there is plenty of room by the time that they had folded up the canvas and william had brought in nanny and the kids the sun had set and they went into the house ready was requested to go on with his history which he did as follows i said last night that i determined to run away from school and go to sea but i did not tell you how i managed it i had no chance of getting out of the school unperceived except after the boys were all put to bed the room that i slept in was at the top of the house the doors i knew were all locked but there was a trap door which led out on the roof fastened by a bolt inside and a ladder leading up to it and i determined that i would make my escape by that way as soon as all the other boys were fast asleep i arose and dressed myself very quietly and then left the room the moon shone bright which was lucky for me and i gained the trap door without any noise i had some difficulty in forcing it up as it was heavy for a boy of my age but i contrived to do so at last and gained the roof of the house i then began looking about me to see how i was to get to the ground and after walking to and fro several times i decided that i could slip down by a large water pipe it was so far detached from the bricks that i could get my small fingers round it i climbed over the parapet and clinging to the pipe firmly with my hands and knees i slid down and arrived at the bottom in safety it's a wonder you did not break your neck ready observed mrs seagrave it was indeed ma'am as soon as i was landed in the flowerbed which was below i hastened to the iron gates at the entrance and soon climbed up and got to the other side into the road i started as fast as i could towards the port and when i arrived at the wharf i perceived that a vessel had her topsails loose and meant to take advantage of the ebb tide which had just made the men were singing yo heave yo' getting the anchor up and as i stood watching almost making up my mind that i would swim off to her i perceived that a man pushed off in her jolly boat and was sculling to a post a little higher up where a hawser had been made fast i ran round and arrived there before he had cast off the rope without saying a word i jumped into the boat what do you want youngster' said the seaman i want to go to sea' said i breathless take me on board pray do' well' said he i heard the captain say he wanted an apprentice and so you may come' he sculled the boat back again to the vessel and i climbed up her side who are you' said the captain i told him that i wanted to go to sea you are too little and too young' no i am not' replied i why do you think that you dare go aloft' i'll show you' replied i and i ran up the rigging like a cat and went out at the topgallant yard arm when i came down the captain said well i think you'll make a sharp seaman by and by so i'll take you and as soon as i get to london i'll bind you apprentice' the ship which was a collier was soon out of port and before the day had dawned i found myself on the wide ocean which was hereafter to be my home as soon as the hurry and confusion were over i was examined by the captain who appeared to me to be a very rough harsh man indeed before the day was over i almost repented of the step which i had taken and when i sat down cold and wet upon some old sail at night the thoughts of my mother and what distress i should occasion her for the first time rushed into my mind and i wept bitterly but it was too late then i have often thought mr seagrave that the life of hardship which i have since gone through has been a judgment on me for my cruelty to my mother in leaving her the way i did it broke her heart a poor return william for all her care and kindness god forgive me old ready left off for some little time and the remainder of the party kept silence then he said i'll leave off now if you please i don't feel inclined to go on my heart is full when i recall that foolish and wicked deed of mine chapter thirty three the next morning was fine and as soon as breakfast was over they took the wheels down to the turtle pond and ready having speared one of the largest by means of a pike with a barb to it which he had made on purpose they hauled it on shore slung it under the wheels and took it up to the house having killed the turtle and cut it up juno under the directions of ready chose such portions as were required for the soup and when the pot was on the fire ready mr seagrave and william set off with the cross cut saw and hatchets to commence felling the cocoa nut trees for the building of the outhouse which was to hold their stores as soon as they could be brought round from the other side of the island i mean this to be our place of refuge in case of danger sir observed ready and therefore i have selected this thick part of the wood as it is not very far from the house and by cutting the path to it in a zigzag it will be quite hidden from sight and we must make the path just wide enough to allow the wheels to pass and stump up the roots of the trees which we are obliged to cut down otherwise the stumps would attract attention i agree with you ready replied mr seagrave there is no saying what may happen you see sir it is often the custom for the natives in this part of the world to come in their canoes from one island to another merely to get cocoa nuts i can't say that the other islands near us are inhabited but still it is probable and we cannot tell what the character of the people may be i tell you this but we had better not say a word to mrs seagrave as it may distress her mr seagrave agreed and ready continued we are now near the spot sir you see when we have got over this hill where the trees are so very thick the fall in the ground will assist in the concealment of the building i should say we are very near right where we now stand how far are we now from the house we must not be too distant i reckon we are not yards in a straight line although the road will by its turning make it double the distance then i think this spot will do very well i'll just mark out the trees which are to stand mr seagrave and those which are to be cut down so as to leave about four feet of stump standing as soon as they had planned the building the axes and saw were in full use and tree after tree fell one upon the other they worked hard till dinner time and were not sorry at the prospect of sitting down to a rich mess of turtle soup my dear william and you too mr seagrave how very warm you are said mrs seagrave you must not work so hard cutting down trees is very warm work mother replied william and hard work will never hurt any one especially when he dines off turtle soup why tommy what's the matter with you tommy and i are at variance replied mrs seagrave i had my thimble this morning and had commenced my sewing when i was called out by juno and caroline went with me and tommy was left in the house when i came back i found him outside and on going back to my work there was no thimble to be found i asked him if he had touched it and his answer was that he would look for it he did look and said he could not find it i have asked him several times if he took it away and his only answer is that he will find it by and by tommy did you take the thimble said mr seagrave gravely i'll find it by and by papa that's not an answer did you take the thimble i'll find it by and by papa said tommy whimpering that's all the answer he will give me said mrs seagrave well then he shall have no dinner till the thimble makes its appearance replied mr seagrave master tommy began to cry at this intelligence juno appeared with the turtle soup and tommy cried louder when they had said grace and commenced their dinner they were all very hungry and william sent his plate for another portion which he had not commenced long before he put his finger in his mouth and pulled out something why mother here's the thimble in my soup cried william no wonder he said he would find it by and by said ready smiling he meant to have fished it up i suppose from what was left of the soup after dinner well mrs seagrave i don't mean to say that tommy is a good boy but still although he would not tell where the thimble was he has not told a falsehood about it no he has not replied william i think now that the thimble is found if he begs pardon papa will forgive him tommy come here said mr seagrave tell me why you put that thimble into the soup i wanted to taste the soup i wanted to fill the thimble the soup burnt my fingers and i let the thimble drop in well a thimbleful wasn't much at all events observed ready and why didn't you tell your mamma where the thimble was i was afraid mamma throw all the soup away and then i get none for dinner oh that was it was it well sir i said you should have no dinner till the thimble was found so as it is found you may have your dinner but if you ever refuse to answer a question again i shall punish you more severely tommy was glad the lecture was over and more glad to get his turtle soup he finished one plate and as he asked for another he said tommy won't put thimble in again put tin pot in next time after dinner they went to their work again and did not come in again till sunset the clouds are gathering fast sir observed ready we shall have rain to night i fear we shall but we must expect it now ready yes sir and by and by we shall have it for days together ready said mrs seagrave if you are not too tired perhaps you will go on with your history certainly ma'am if you wish it replied ready when i left off i was on board of the collier bound to london we had a very fair wind and a quick passage i was very sick until we arrived in the nore and then i recovered and as you may suppose was astonished at the busy scene and the quantity of vessels which were going up and down the river but i did not like my captain he was very severe and brutal to the men and the apprentice who was on board told me to run away and get into another vessel and not to bind myself apprentice to this captain or i should be beat all day long and be treated as bad as he was i knew this was the case as the captain kicked and cuffed him twenty times a day the men said that he did not do so to me for fear i should refuse to be his apprentice but that as soon as my indentures were signed he would treat me in the same way well i made up my mind that i would not remain in the collier and as the captain had gone on shore i had plenty of time to look about me there was a large ship which was ready to sail lying in the stream i spoke to two boys who were at the stairs in her boat and they told me that they were very comfortable on board and that the captain wanted two or three apprentices i went on board with them and offered myself the captain asked me a great many questions and i told him the truth and why i did not like to remain in the collier he agreed to take me and i went on shore with him signed my indentures and received from him a sufficient supply of clothes and two days afterwards we sailed for bombay and china but you wrote to your mother ready did you not said william yes i did for the captain desired me to do so and he put a few lines at the bottom to comfort her but unfortunately the letter which was sent on shore by the cook never arrived whether he dropped it or forgot it till after the ship sailed and then tore it up i do not know but as i found out afterwards it never did get to her hands it was not your fault that the letter did not arrive safe said mrs seagrave no madam that was not my fault the fault had been committed before don't dwell any more upon that portion of your history ready but tell us what took place after you sailed for the east indies be it so if you please i certainly was very smart and active for my age and soon became a great favourite on board especially with the lady passengers because i was such a little fellow we arrived safely at bombay where our passengers went on shore and in three weeks afterwards we sailed down the straits for china it was war time and we were very often chased by french privateers but as we had a good crew and plenty of guns none of them ventured to attack us and we got safe to macao where we unloaded our cargo and took in teas we had to wait some time for a convoy and then sailed for england when we were off the isle of france the convoy was dispersed in a gale and three days afterwards a french frigate bore down upon us and after exchanging a few broadsides we were compelled to haul down our colours a lieutenant was sent on board with forty men to take charge of us for we were a very rich prize to them the captain and most of the crew were taken on board of the frigate but ten lascars and the boys were left in the indiaman to assist in taking her into the isle of france which was at that time in the hands of the french i thought it hard that i was to go to prison at twelve years old but i did not care much about it and very soon i was as gay and merry as ever we had made the island and were on a wind beating up to the port when a vessel was seen to windward and although i could not understand what the frenchmen said i perceived that they were in a great fluster and very busy with their spy glasses and jack romer one of my brother 'prentices who had been three years at sea said to me i don't think we'll go to prison after all ready for that vessel is an english man of war if i'm not mistaken' at last she came down within three miles of us and hoisted english colours and fired a gun the frenchmen put the ship before the wind but it was of no use the man of war came up with us very fast and then the frenchmen began to pack up their clothes together with all the other things which they had collected out of the property of our captain and crew a shot was fired which went clean over our heads and then they left the helm and jack romer went to it and with my help hove the ship up in the wind a boat came on board and took possession and so there was one escape at all events they sent a midshipman as prize master on board of the vessel and left all us who had been taken prisoners by the french in the vessel to help to work her into port as the captain did not wish to part with any more men of his own than was necessary we soon made sail for england quite delighted at having escaped a french prison but after all we only exchanged it for a dutch one how do you mean i mean that two days afterwards as we were rounding the cape another french vessel bore down upon us and captured us this time we did not find any friend in need and were taken into table bay for at that time the cape of good hope was in the possession of the dutch who as well as the french were at war with england how very unfortunate you were ready said mrs seagrave yes madam we were and i can't say much in favour of a dutch prison however i was very young at that time and did not care much i had a light heart chapter thirty four a heavy storm came on soon after they had retired to rest the lightning was so vivid that its flashes penetrated through the chinks of the door and windows and the thunder burst upon them with a noise which prevented them obtaining any sleep the children cried and trembled as they lay in the arms of mrs seagrave and juno who were almost as much alarmed themselves this is very awful said mr seagrave to ready for they had both risen from their beds it is indeed sir i never knew a more terrible storm than this merciful heaven exclaimed mr seagrave as he spoke they were both thrown back half stunned a crash of thunder burst over the house which shook everything in it a sulphurous smell pervaded the building and soon afterwards when they recovered their feet they perceived that the house was full of smoke and they heard the wailing of the women and the shrieks of the children in the bed places on the other side god have mercy on us exclaimed ready who was the first to recover himself and who now attempted to ascertain the injury which had been done the lightning has struck us and i fear that the house is on fire somewhere my wife my children exclaimed mr seagrave are they all safe yes yes cried mrs seagrave all safe tommy has come to me but where is juno juno juno answered not william darted to the other side of the house and found juno lying on her side motionless she is dead father cried william help me to carry her out of the house mr seagrave said ready who had lifted up the poor girl she may be only stunned they carried juno out of the house and laid her on the ground the rain poured down in torrents ready left them for a minute to ascertain if the house was on fire he found that it had been in flames at the further corner but the rain had extinguished it he then went back to mr seagrave and william who were with juno i will attend to the girl sir said ready go you and master william into the house mrs seagrave will be too much frightened if she is left alone at such an awful time see sir juno is not dead her chest heaves she will come to very soon thank god for it william and mr seagrave returned to the house they found mrs seagrave fainting with anxiety and fear the information they brought that juno was not killed by the lightning did much to restore her william soothed little albert and tommy in a few minutes was fast asleep again in his father's arms the storm now abated and as the day began to break ready appeared with juno who was sufficiently recovered to be able to walk in with his support she was put into her bed and then ready and mr seagrave went to examine if further mischief had been done the lightning had come in at the further end of the house at the part where the fireplace was intended to have been made we have been most mercifully preserved said mr seagrave yes sir thanks be to god for all his goodness replied ready i think we have a large roll of copper wire ready have we not said mr seagrave yes sir i was just thinking of it myself we will have a lightning conductor up the first thing it was now broad daylight mrs seagrave dressed herself and the children and as soon as she was ready mr seagrave read such portions of the psalms as were appropriate and they earnestly joined in a prayer of thankfulness and humility william went out to prepare the breakfast and ready procured the coil of copper wire from those stores which were stowed under the bed places this he unrolled and stretched it out straight and then went for the ladder which was at the outhouse they had commenced building as soon as breakfast was over ready and mr seagrave went out again to fix up the lightning conductor leaving william to do the work of juno who still remained fast asleep in her bed i think said ready that one of those two trees which are close together will suit the best they are not too near the house and yet quite near enough for the wire to attract the lightning i agree with you ready but we must not leave both standing no sir but we shall require them both to get up and fix the wire after that we will cut down the other ready put his ladder against one of the trees and taking with him the hammer and a bag of large spike nails drove one of the nails into the trunk of the tree till it was deep enough in to bear his weight he then drove in another above it and so he continued to do standing upon one of them while he drove in another above till he had reached the top of the tree close to the boughs he then descended and leaving the hammer behind him took up a saw and small axe and in about ten minutes he had cut off the head of the cocoa nut tree which remained a tall bare pole take care ready how you come down said mr seagrave anxiously never fear sir replied ready i'm not so young as i was but i have been too often at the mast head much higher than this ready came down again and then cut down a small pole to fix with a thick piece of pointed wire at the top of it on the head of the cocoa nut tree he then went up lashed the small pole to the head of the tree made the end of the copper wire fast to the pointed wire and then he descended the other tree near to it was then cut down and the lower end of the wire buried in the ground at the bottom of the tree on which the lightning conductor had been fixed that's a good job done sir said ready wiping his face for he was warm with the work yes replied mr seagrave and we must put up another near the outhouse or we may lose our stores very true sir you understand this william don't you said his father o yes papa lightning is attracted by metal and will now strike the point instead of the house run down the wire and only tear up the ground below it's coming on again sir as thick as ever observed the old man we shall do no work to day i'm afraid i'll just go and see where the stock are juno was now up again and said that she was quite well with the exception of a headache as ready had predicted the rain now came on again with great violence and it was impossible to do any work out of doors at the request of william he continued his narrative narrative of old ready well william as soon as they had let go their anchor in table bay we were all ordered on shore and sent up to a prison close to the government gardens we were not very carefully watched as it appeared impossible for us to get away and i must say we were well treated in every respect but we were told that we should be sent to holland in the first man of war which came into the bay and we did not much like the idea there were as i told you some other boys as well as myself who belonged to the indiaman and we kept very much together not only because we were more of an age but because we had been shipmates so long two of these boys one of whom i have mentioned as jack romer and the other will hastings were my particular friends and one day as we were sitting under the wall warming ourselves for it was winter time romer said how very easy it would be for us to get away if we only knew where to go to' yes' replied hastings but where are we to go to if it is not to the hottentots and wild savages and when we get there what can we do we can't get any further' well' said i i would rather be living free among savages than be shut up in a prison' that was our first talk on the subject but we had many others afterwards and as the one or two dutch soldiers who stood sentry spoke english and we could talk a little dutch we obtained a good deal of information from them for they had very often been sent to the frontiers of the colony we continued to ask questions and to talk among ourselves for about two months and at last we resolved that we would make our escape we should have done much better if we had remained where we were but there is no putting old heads upon young shoulders we saved up our provisions bought some long dutch knives tied our few clothes up in bundles and one dark night we contrived to remain in the yard without being perceived when the prisoners were locked up and raising a long pole which lay in the yard to the top of the wall with a good deal of scrambling we contrived to get over it and made off as fast as we could for the table mountain what was your reason for going there ready why hastings who was the oldest and i will say the sharpest of the three said that we had better stay up there for a few days till we had made up our minds what to do and try if we could not procure a musket or two and ammunition for you see we had money as when the indiaman was first taken the captain divided a keg of rupees which was on board among the officers and men in proportion to the wages due to them thinking it was better for the crew to have the money than to leave it for the frenchmen and we had spent very little while in prison there was also another reason why he persuaded us to go to the table mountain which was that as soon as our escape was found out they would send parties to look for us thinking of course that we had made for the interior and we should have less chance of being retaken if we travelled after the first search was over the soldiers had told us of the lions and other wild animals and how dangerous it was to travel and hastings said that not finding us they would suppose we had been destroyed by the wild beasts and would not look for us any more foolish indeed observed mrs seagrave to set off you knew not where in a country full of wild beasts and savages true enough madam replied ready we ran at first until we were out of breath and then we walked on as fast as we could not going right up the mountain but keeping a slanting direction to the south west so as to get away from the town and more towards false bay we had walked about four hours and began to feel very tired when the day dawned and then we looked out for a place to conceal ourselves in we soon found a cave with a narrow entrance large enough inside to hold half a dozen of such lads as we were and we crawled in it was quite dry and as we were very tired we lay down with our heads on our bundles intending to take a nap but we had hardly made ourselves comfortable and shut our eyes when we heard such a screaming and barking that we were frightened out of our lives almost we could not think what it could be at last hastings peeped out and began to laugh so romer and i looked out also and there we saw about one hundred and fifty large baboons leaping and tumbling about in such a way as i never saw they were bigger than we were indeed when they stood on their hind legs they were much taller and they had very large white tusks some of them were females with young ones on their backs and they were just as active as the males at last they played such antics that we all burst out into a loud laugh and we had not ceased when we found the grinning face of one of the largest of those brutes close to our own he had dropped from the rock above us like magic we all three backed into the cave very much frightened for the teeth of the animal were enormous and he looked very savage he gave a shrill cry and we perceived all the rest of the herd coming to him as fast as they could i said that the cave was large enough to hold six of us but there was a sort of inner cave which we had not gone into as the entrance was much smaller romer cried out let us go into the inside cave we can get in one by one' and he backed in hastings followed with his bundle and i hurried in after him just in time for the baboons who had been chattering to each other for half a minute came into the outer cave just as i crawled into the inner five or six of them came in all males and very large the first thing they did was to lay hold of romer's bundle which they soon opened at once they seized his provisions and rammed them into their pouches and then they pulled out the other things and tore them all to pieces as soon as they had done with the bundle two of them came towards the inner cave and saw us one put his long paw in to seize us but hastings gave him a slash with his knife and the animal took his paw out again fast enough it was laughable to see him hold out his hand to the others and then taste the blood with the tip of his tongue and such a chattering i never heard they were evidently very angry and more came into the cave and joined them then another put in his hand and received a cut just as before at last two or three at once tried to pull us out but we beat them all off with our knives wounding them all very severely for about an hour they continued their attempts and then they went away out of the cave but remained at the mouth shrieking and howling we began to be very tired of this work and romer said that he wished he was back in prison again and so did i i can assure you but there was no getting out for had we gone out the animals would have torn us to pieces we agreed that we had no chance but the animals becoming tired and going away and most anxious we were for the excitement had made us very thirsty and we wanted water we remained for two hours in this way imprisoned by baboons when all of a sudden a shrill cry was given by one of the animals and the whole herd went galloping off as fast as they could screaming louder than ever we waited for a short time to see if they would return and then hastings crawled out first and looking out of the cave very cautiously said that they were all gone and that he could see nothing but a hottentot sitting down watching some cattle we therefore all came out very happy at our release that was our first adventure we had plenty afterwards but i think it is now time we should go to bed it is my opinion we shall have a fine day to morrow sir but there's no saying i do so want to hear what happened to you afterwards ready said william well so you shall but there's a time for everything and this is bed time unless you like to go with me the weather has cleared up and i want to catch a fish or two for to morrow chapter thirty five as ready had predicted the weather set in fine after the violent storm of which we have made mention for a fortnight with little intermission it continued fine and during that time ready mr seagrave and william worked from daylight till dusk at the storehouse which they were so anxious to complete and were so tired when their work was over that even william did not ask ready to go on with his history at last the storehouse was complete thatched and wattled in on three sides leaving one open for ventilation the lower part which had been arranged for the folding of the stock at night and during the rainy season was also wattled in with cocoa nut boughs on three sides and made a very comfortable retreat for the animals the winding path to the storehouse was also cut through the cocoa nut grove but the stumps were not removed as they could not spare the time all the stores that they had brought round were put into the storehouse and they were now ready to take up some other job it was however agreed that on the day after the building was finished they should all have a day's holiday which they certainly did require william caught some fish a turtle was speared and wheeled up to the house and they not only had a holiday but a feast mr seagrave and william had been walking on the beach with mrs seagrave and the children while ready was assisting juno in cutting up the turtle they had shown mrs seagrave the storehouse and the goats with the four kids had been led there as there was no longer any occasion for them to remain in the house the weather was beautiful and they agreed to go and examine the garden they found that the seeds had not yet commenced sprouting notwithstanding the heavy rains i should have thought that so much rain would have made them come up said mrs seagrave no my dear replied mr seagrave they require more of the sun than they will have till the rainy season is nearly over a few days like this and they will soon be above ground let us sit down on this knoll it is quite dry said mrs seagrave i little thought continued she that i could have been so happy in a desert island i thought i should feel the loss of books very severely but i really do not think that i could have found time to read employment is a source of happiness especially when you are usefully employed an industrious person is always a happy person provided he is not obliged to work too hard and even where you have cause for unhappiness nothing makes you forget it so soon as occupation but mamma we shall not always have so much to do as we have now said william of course not replied mr seagrave and then we shall find our books a great source of enjoyment i am anxious to go to the other side of the island and see what have been spared to us and whether they have been much damaged but that cannot be until after the rains are over and we can use the boat again look at this minute insect which is crawling on my finger said mr seagrave turning to william what a number of legs it has yes i have seen something like it in old books how fast it runs with its little legs thinner than hairs how wonderful yes william replied mr seagrave we have only to examine into any portion however small of creation and we are immediately filled with wonder there is nothing which points out to us the immensity and the omniscience of the almighty more than the careful provision which has been made by him for the smallest and most insignificant of created beings this little animal is perhaps one of many millions who have their term of existence and their enjoyment as well as we have what is it an insect of the minutest kind a nothing in creation yet has the same care been bestowed upon its formation these little legs hardly visible have their muscles and their sinews and every other portion of its body is as complete as fearfully and wonderfully fashioned as our own such is his will and what insects we ought to feel ourselves when compared to the god of power and of love let me also point out to you william continued mr seagrave the infinity of his creative power displayed in endless variety amongst the millions of men that have been born and died if ever yet were there seen two faces or two bodies exactly alike nay if you could examine the leaves upon the trees although there may be millions upon millions in a forest you could not discover two leaves of precisely the same form and make i have often tried in vain replied william yet some animals are so much alike that i cannot perceive any difference between them sheep for instance very true you cannot tell the difference because you have not examined them but a shepherd if he has seven hundred sheep under his care will know every one of them from the others which proves that there must be a great difference between them although not perceptible to the casual observer and the same no doubt is the case with all other classes of animals yes william observed ready i have often wondered over the things that i have seen and i have even in my ignorance felt what your papa has now told you and it has brought into my mind the words of job when i consider i am afraid of him' papa said william after a pause in the conversation you have referred to the variety the wonderful variety shown in the works of the deity tell me some other prominent feature in creation one of the most remarkable william is order point out to me papa where and in what that quality is most observable everywhere and in everything my dear boy whether we cast our eyes up to the heavens above us or penetrate into the bowels of the earth the principle of order is everywhere everything is governed by fixed laws which cannot be disobeyed we have order in the seasons in the tides in the movement of the heavenly bodies in the instinct of animals in the duration of life assigned to each from the elephant who lives more than a century to the ephemeral fly whose whole existence is limited to an hour inanimate nature is subject to the same unvarying laws metals and rocks and earths and all the mineral kingdom follow one law in their crystallisation never varying from the form assigned to them each atom depositing itself in the allotted place until that form is complete we have order in production order in decay but all is simple to him by whom the planets were thrown out into space and were commanded to roll in their eternal orbits yes the stars in the heavens are beautiful said william but they are not placed there in order the fixed stars do not appear to us to be in order that is they do not stud the heavens at equal distances from each other as we view them but you must recollect that they are at very different distances from this earth spreading over all infinity of space and we have reason to suppose that this our earth is but a mere unit in the multitude of created worlds only one single portion of an infinite whole as the stars now appear to us they are useful to the mariner enabling him to cross the trackless seas and to the astronomer who calculates the times and seasons what do you mean papa by saying that this world of ours is supposed to be but one of a multitude of created worlds our little knowledge is bounded to this our own earth which we have ascertained very satisfactorily to be but one of several planets revolving round our own sun i say our own sun because we have every reason to suppose that each of those fixed stars and myriads now not visible to the naked eye are all suns bright and glorious as our own and of course throwing light and heat upon unseen planets revolving round them does not this give you some idea of the vastness the power and the immensity of god one almost loses one's self in the imagination said mrs seagrave yes replied mr seagrave and it has been surmised by some who have felt in their hearts the magnificence of the great architect that there must be some point of view in space where all those glorious suns which seem to us confused in the heavens above us will appear all symmetrically arranged will there be viewed in regular order whirling round in one stupendous and perfect system of beauty and design and where can that be if it is not in that heaven which we hope to gain there was a silence for a few moments when william said they say that there are people who are atheists papa how can they be so if they only look around them i am sure a mere examination of the works of god ought to make them good christians no my child replied mr seagrave there you are in error few deny the existence of a deity and an examination of his works may make them good and devout men but not christians there are good men to be found under every denomination whether they be jews mahomedans or pagans but they are not christians very true papa faith in things seen if i may use the term my dear child may induce men to acknowledge the power and goodness of the almighty but it will not make them wise to salvation for that end it is necessary as the apostle saith to have faith in things not seen chapter thirty six well ready said mr seagrave after breakfast which is to be our next job why sir i think we had better all set to to collect the branches and ends of the cocoa nut trees cut down and stack them for fuel tommy and juno have already made a good large pile and i think by to night we shall have made the stack and so arranged it that the rain will not get into it much after that as the weather will not permit us to leave the house for any time we will cut our salt pan and make our fish pond they will take a week at least and then we shall have little more to do near home i think the strength of the rains is over already and perhaps in a fortnight we may venture to walk through the wood and examine what we have saved from the wreck and we are to explore the island are we not ready said william i long to do that yes william but that must be almost the last job for we shall be away for two or three nights perhaps and we must look out for fine weather we will however do that before we bring the stores round in the boat but how are we to make the salt pan ready we must cut it out of the solid rock yes william but i have three or four of what they call cold chisels and with one of them and a hammer we shall get on faster than you think for the coral rock although hard at the surface is soft a little below it the whole of that day was employed in piling up the cocoa nut branches and wood ready made a square stack like a haystack with a gable top over which he tied the long branches so that the rain would pour off it there said ready as he came down the ladder that will be our provision for next year we have quite enough left to go on with till the rainy season is over and we shall have no difficulty in collecting it afterwards when the weather is dry mr seagrave sighed and looked grave ready observed it and said mr seagrave it is not that we may want it but still we must prepare for the next rainy season in case we do want it that captain osborn if he lives will send to look for us i have no doubt nay i believe that mackintosh will do the same but still you must not forget that they all may have perished although we have been so mercifully preserved we must put our trust in god sir we must ready and if it is his will we must not murmur i have schooled myself as much as possible but thoughts will come in spite of my endeavours to restrain them of course they will sir that's natural however sir you must hope for the best fretting is no good and it is sinful i feel it is ready and when i see how patient and even happy my wife is under such privations i am angry with myself a woman sir bears adversity better than a man a woman is all love and if she has but her husband and children with her and in good health she will make herself happy almost anywhere but men are different they cannot bear being shut out of the world as you are now it is our ambition which makes us unhappy ready replied mr seagrave but let us say no more about it god must dispose of me as he thinks fit after supper ready being requested by william continued his narrative i left off if i recollect right william just as the hottentot with the cattle under his care had frightened away the baboons who were tormenting us well we came out of the cave and sat down under the rock so that the hottentot could not see us and we had a sort of council of war romer was for going back and giving ourselves up again for he said it was ridiculous to be wandering about without any arms to defend ourselves against wild beasts and that we might fall in with something worse than the baboons very soon and he was right it would have been the wisest thing which we could have done but hastings said that if we went back we should be laughed at and the idea of being laughed at made us all agree that we would not bear this in mind william and never let the fear of ridicule induce you to do what is wrong or if you have done wrong prevent you from returning to what is your duty many thanks for your advice ready i hope william will not forget it said mr seagrave well sir such was our reason for not giving up our mad scheme and having so decided the next point of consultation between us was how we were to procure arms and ammunition which we could not do without as we were talking this over i peeped from behind the rock to see where the hottentot might be i perceived that he had laid himself down and wrapped himself up in his kross a mantle of sheep skins which they always wear now we had observed that he carried his musket in his hand when we first saw him as the hottentots always go out armed and i pointed out to hastings and romer that if he was asleep we might get possession of his musket without his perceiving it this was a good idea and hastings said he would crawl to him on his hands and knees while we remained behind the rock he did so very cautiously and found the man's head covered up in his kross and fast asleep so there was no fear for the hottentots are very hard to wake at any time that we knew well hastings first took the musket and carried it away out of the reach of the hottentot and then he returned to him cut the leather thong which slung his powder horn and ammunition and retreated with all of them without disturbing the man from his sleep we were quite overjoyed at this piece of good luck and determined to walk very cautiously some distance from where the hottentot lay that in case he awoke he should not see us keeping our eyes about in every direction lest we should meet with anybody else we proceeded nearly a mile towards table bay when we fell in with a stream of water this was another happy discovery for we were very thirsty so we concealed ourselves near the stream after we had quenched our thirst and made a dinner off the provisions we had brought with us but ready did you not do wrong to steal the hottentot's musket no william in that instance it could not be considered as a theft we were in an enemy's country trying to escape we were therefore just as much at war with the country as we were when they took us prisoners and we no more stole the musket than they could be said to have stolen our ship am i not right mr seagrave i believe you are justified in what may seem extreme acts for the recovery of your liberty after you have been made prisoners it has always been so considered well sir to go on we waited till dusk and then we continued our march towards false bay as fast as we could we knew that there were farmers down in the valley or rather on the sides of the hills and we hoped to obtain by some means or other two more muskets it was near twelve o'clock at night with a bright moon when we had a sight of the water in false bay and soon afterwards we heard the baying of a large dog and not far from us we distinguished two or three farmhouses with their cattle folds and orchards we then looked for a hiding place where we might remain till the morning we found one between some large pieces of rock we agreed that one should watch while the other two slept this hastings undertook to do as he was not inclined to sleep at daylight he woke romer and me and we made our breakfast from the place we were concealed in we had a bird's eye view of the farmhouse and of what was going on the farmhouse and buildings just below us were much smaller than the other two which were more distant we watched the people as they went about in about an hour the hottentots came out and we perceived that they were yoking the oxen to the waggon they yoked twelve pair and then the hottentot driver got in and drove off towards cape town soon after that another hottentot drove the cows up the valley to feed and then a dutch woman came out of the house with two children and fed the poultry we watched for another hour and then the farmer himself made his appearance with a pipe in his mouth and sat down on a bench when his pipe was out he called to the house and a hottentot woman came to him with more tobacco and a light during the whole of the day we did not see any other people about the house so we concluded that there were no more than the farmer his wife the hottentot woman and two children about two hours after noon the farmer went to the stable and led out his horse mounted and rode away we saw him speak to the hottentot woman when he rode off and she soon after went down the valley with a basket on her head and a long knife in her hand then hastings said it was time that we moved for there was but one woman in the house and we could easily overpower her and get what we wanted still there was a great risk as she might give the alarm and we should have to escape in the day time and might be seen and taken prisoners again however as it was our only chance we resolved to go down to the farmhouse very cautiously and be all ready to seize any opportunity we crept down the hill and gained the fence which was at the back of the farmhouse without being discovered we remained there for about a quarter of an hour when to our great joy we observed the farmer's wife go out of the house leading a child in each hand apparently she was going to visit one of her neighbours for she went in the direction of one of the other farms as soon as she was a hundred yards off hastings crept softly through the fence and entered the farmhouse by the back door he came out again and made a sign for us to come in we found him already in possession of a rifle and a musket which had been hanging over the fire place and we soon handed down the powder horns and ammunition pouches which were hung up at a different part of the room away from the fire place having gained these hastings set me to watch at the front door lest anybody should return while romer and he looked out for something else in the way of provisions we got possession of three hams and a large loaf of bread as big as a small washing tub with these articles we made our way safe back to our retreat we then looked round and could see nobody in any direction so we presumed that we were not discovered as there was a sort of ravine full of rocks dividing the hill which we were obliged to pass before we could get into the valley unless we went down close to the farmhouse we agreed that it would be better at once to cross it during the day time so that we should get that difficulty over and at the same time be further from the farmhouse we did so and found a very secure hiding place where we lay down waiting for the sun to set before we started on our journey into the interior i think i had better leave off now william as it is getting late chapter thirty seven the fishpond was commenced the next morning ready mr seagrave and william went down together to the beach and after much examination chose a spot about one hundred yards from the turtle pond as most eligible for the purpose the water being shallow so that at the part farthest from the shore there would not be more than three feet now sir said ready this is a very simple job all we have to do is to collect small rocks and stones pile them up wall fashion inside and with a slope outside so as to break the force of the waves when the water is a little rough of course the water will find its way through the stones and will be constantly changed it's very true that we can at most times catch fish when we want them but it is not always that we can spare the time so it's just as well to have always a certain quantity at hand to take out at a moment's warning and we can of course catch them and put them in here when we have nothing else to do juno will be able to come down and take them out with a spear when we are away and she wants something for dinner but there are few stones about here ready we shall have to fetch them a long way said william well then william let us get the wheels down here and then we can carry a quantity at a time but how shall we carry them ready we will sling a tub on the axle i will go up and get that ready and bring it down in the meantime you and mr seagrave can collect all the stones which are near at hand ready soon returned with the wheels and the tub slung with rope on the axle and by that means they found that they could collect the stones very fast mr seagrave and william bringing them and ready in the water building up the wall we have quite forgot another job which we must put in hand sir observed ready but the fish pond reminds me of it what is that ready a bathing place for the children and indeed for us all we shall want it when the hot weather comes on but we will put it off till then i can tell you sir that although i don't mind building this wall in the shallow water i shall be very careful when the water is up to my knees for you don't know how bold the sharks are in these latitudes when i was at st helena not very long ago we had a melancholy proof of it tell us the story ready well two soldiers were standing on the rocks at st helena the rocks were out of the water but the swell just broke over them two sharks swam up to them and one of them with a blow of his tail turning round the same way tripped one of them into the water which was very deep his comrade was very much frightened and ran to the barracks to tell the story about a week afterwards a schooner was in sandy bay on the other side of the island and the people seeing a very large shark under the stern put out a hook with a piece of pork and caught him they opened him and found inside of him to their horror the whole of the body of the soldier except the legs below the knees the monster had swallowed him whole with the exception of his legs which it had nipped off when it closed its jaws i really had no idea that they were so bold ready it is a fact i assure you and therefore we cannot be too careful how we go into the water you saw how soon the poor pig was despatched i wonder how the pigs get on ready said william i dare say they have littered by this time sir they have no want of food but can they eat the cocoa nuts not the old ones but they can the young ones which are constantly dropping from the trees and then there's plenty of roots for them if we stay long here we shall soon have good sport hunting them but we must be very careful for although they were tame pigs when we brought them on shore they will be wild and very savage in a very short time how must we hunt them said mr seagrave why sir with the dogs and then shoot them i am glad that vixen will have pups soon we shall want more dogs shall we not have more mouths than we can find food for never fear that sir as long as we have the sea to fish in dogs live very well upon fish even if it is raw we shall have some lambs soon ready shall we not yes sir i expect very soon i wish we had more food for the animals they are put rather hard to it just now but next year if we find more food on the island we must keep the grass near home to make hay and stack it for the winter time or the rainy season rather for there is no winter in these latitudes i'm pretty sure we shall find some clear land on the south of the island for the cocoa nut grove does not extend so close to the water on that side as it does on the north i do so long to go on our exploring party said william we must wait a little replied ready but i don't know whether you will go we must not all three go at once and leave mrs seagrave alone no replied mr seagrave that would not be fair either you or i must remain william william made no reply but it was evident that he was annoyed at the idea of not being of the party they worked very hard that day and the walls rose fast out of the water after supper ready continued his narrative we remained concealed until it was dark and then hastings and romer each with a musket on his shoulders and a ham at his back and i being the smallest with the rifle and the great loaf of bread set off on our journey our intention was to travel north as we knew that was the road leading from the colony but hastings had decided that we should first go to the eastward so as to make what we sailors call a circumbendibus which would keep us out of the general track we passed through the deep sands of false bay and after that gradually ascended getting among brushwood and young trees but we saw no signs of cultivation nor did we pass one house after we had left false bay astern of us about twelve o'clock we were very much fatigued and longed for a drink of water but we did not find any although the moon shone as bright as day we distinctly heard however what we did not much like the howling and cries of the wild beasts which increased as we went on still we did not see any and that was our comfort at last we were so tired that we all sat down on the ledge of a rock we dared not go to sleep so we remained there till daylight listening to the howling of the animals we none of us spoke and i presume that hastings' and romer's thoughts were the same as my own which were that i would have given a great deal to find myself safe and sound again within the prison walls however daylight came at last the wild beasts did not prowl any more we walked on till we found a stream of water where we sat down and took our breakfast after which our courage revived and we talked and laughed as we walked on just as we had done before we now began to ascend the mountains which hastings said must be the black mountains that the soldiers had talked to us about they were very desolate and when night came on we collected brushwood and cut down branches with our knives that we might make a fire not only to warm ourselves but to scare away the wild beasts whose howling had already commenced we lighted our fire and ate our supper the loaf was half gone and the hams had been well cut into we knew therefore that very soon we should have to trust to our guns for procuring food as soon as we had finished our meal we lay down by the fire with our muskets loaded close to us and our ammunition placed out of danger we were so tired that we were soon fast asleep it had been agreed that romer should keep the first watch and hastings the middle and i the morning but romer fell asleep and the consequence was that the fire was not kept up it was about midnight that i was awakened by something breathing hard in my face and just as i could recall my senses and open my eyes i found myself lifted up by my waistband and the teeth of some animal pinching my flesh i tried to catch at my musket but i put out my wrong hand and laid hold of a still lighted brand out of the fire which i darted into the animal's face it let me drop directly and ran away what a providential escape said mrs seagrave yes it was ma'am the animal was a hyena fortunately they are a very cowardly sort of beast still had it not been for the lighted stick it would have carried me off for i was very small then and it lifted me up as if i was a feather in its mouth the shout i gave woke hastings who seized his musket and fired i was very much frightened as you may suppose as for romer he never woke till we pushed him hard he was so completely knocked up this affair of course made us more cautious and afterwards we lighted two fires and slept between them one always remaining on the watch for a week we travelled on and as soon as we were over the mountains we turned our heads to the northward our provisions were all gone and we were one day without any but we killed an antelope called a spring bock which gave us provisions for three or four days there was no want of game after we had descended into the plain i forgot to mention however a narrow escape we had just before we had left an extensive forest on the side of the mountain we had walked till past noon and were very much tired we decided upon taking our dinner under a large tree and we threw ourselves down in the shade hastings was lying on his back with his eyes looking upwards when he perceived on the lower branch of the tree a panther which lay along it his green eyes fixed upon us and ready to spring he seized his musket and fired it without taking aim for there was no time but the ball entered the stomach of the animal and as it appeared divided its back bone down came the beast within three or four feet of where we lay with a loud roar and immediately crouched to spring upon romer but it could not for the back bone being broken it had not any power in its hinder quarters so it raised up its fore quarters and then dropped down again i never saw such rage and fury in an animal in my life at first we were too much frightened to fire but perceiving that the beast could not spring hastings snatched the musket from romer and shot it through the head we were now obliged to hunt for our livelihood and we became bolder than ever our clothes were all in rags but we had plenty of powder and ammunition there were hundreds and hundreds of antelopes and gnus in the plain indeed sometimes it was impossible to count them but this plentiful supply of game was the cause of our being in greater danger for now for the first time we heard the roar of the lions every night we made large fires to keep them off but they often made us tremble when they came near to us did you ever meet with one in the day time said william yes sir we often saw them but they never attacked us and we were too much afraid to fire at them once we met one face to face we had killed an antelope called a hartebeest and with our muskets on our shoulders were running to secure it just as we came up to the spot we heard a roar and found ourselves not ten yards from a lion who was lying on the top of the beast we had killed his eyes flashing fire at us and half raising himself as if ready for a spring we all took to our heels as fast as we could i never looked back till i was out of breath but the lion was content with our running away and did not take the trouble to follow us well sir we had been travelling we really hardly knew where but certainly in a northerly direction for three weeks and were quite worn out we now all agreed that we had done a very foolish thing and would gladly have gone back again for my part i declare that i was willing to lie down and die if i could have so done and i became quite indifferent to the roaring of the lions and felt as if i should be glad if one would have made a meal of me at length one morning we fell in with a party of natives they were of the karroo tribe as they told us by pointing to themselves and saying karroos' and then they pointed to us and said dutch' we shot game and gave it to them which pleased them very much and they remained with us for five or six days we tried by signs to inquire of them if there were any dutch settlement about there and they understood us and said that there was in a direction which they pointed out to us to the north east we offered them a present if they would show us the way two of the men agreed to go with us the rest of the tribe with the women and children went southward the next day we arrived at a dutch settlement of three or four farmhouses called graaff reinet but i must leave off now for it is past bed time chapter thirty eight the construction of the fish pond proceeded rapidly and on the third day it was nearly complete as soon as all the walls were finished ready threw out sand and shingle so as to make the part next to the beach nearly as deep as the other so that there might be sufficient water to prevent the gulls and man of war birds from darting down and striking the fish while ready was thus employed mr seagrave and william collected more rocks so as to divide the pond into four parts at the same time allowing a communication between each part these inside walls as well as the outside were made of sufficient width to walk upon by which means they would have all the fish within reach of the spear in case they wished to take them out the day after the pond was completed the weather changed the rain poured down with great force but it was not accompanied with such terrific thunder and lightning nor were the storms of so long continuance as at the commencement of the rainy season in the intervals of fine weather they caught a great many fish which they put into the pond so that it was well stocked but a circumstance occurred which was the occasion of great alarm to them all which was that one evening william was taken with a shivering and complained very much of a pain in his head ready had promised to continue his narrative on that evening but william was too ill to sit up he was put into bed and the next morning he was in a violent fever mr seagrave was much alarmed as the symptoms were worse every hour and ready who had sat up with him during the night called mr seagrave out of the house and said this is a bad case sir william was working yesterday with his hat off and i fear that he has been struck by the sun the poor boy was for many days in great danger and the cheerful house was now one of gloom and silence how fervent were now the morning and evening prayers how often during the day did his parents offer up a petition to heaven for their dear boy's recovery the weather became finer every day and it was almost impossible to keep tommy quiet juno went out with him and albert every morning and kept them with her while she cooked and fortunately vixen had some young ones and when juno could no longer amuse them she brought them two of the puppies to play with as for the quiet meek little caroline she would remain during the whole day holding her mother's hand and watching her brother or working with her needle by the side of his bed ready who could not be idle had taken the hammer and cold chisel to make the salt pan at which he worked during those portions of the day in which his services were not required indoors and as he sat chipping away the rock his thoughts were ever upon william for he dearly loved the boy for his amiable disposition and his cleverness and many a time during the day would he stop his work and the tears would run down his cheeks as he offered up his petition to the almighty that the boy might be spared to his afflicted parents and those prayers were heard for on the ninth day william was pronounced by ready and mr seagrave to have much less fever and shortly afterwards it left him altogether but he was so weak that he could not raise himself in his bed for two or three days and it was not till more than a fortnight after the fever had left him that he could go out of the house the joy that was expressed by them all when the change took place may be imagined nor were the thanksgivings less fervent than had been the prayers during his convalescence as there was nothing else to do mr seagrave and ready who now went gladly to their work determined as the salt pan was finished that they would make a bathing place juno came to their assistance and was very useful in assisting to drag the wheels which brought the rocks and stones and tommy was also brought down that he might be out of the way while mrs seagrave and caroline watched the invalid by the time that william was able to go out of the house the bathing place was finished and there was no longer any fear of the sharks william came down to the beach with his mother and looked at the work which had been done he was much pleased with it and said now ready we have finished everything at home for the present all we have to do is to explore the island and to go to the cove and examine our collection from the wreck very true william and the weather has been so fine that i think we may venture upon one or the other in a few days more but not till you are stronger i shall soon be strong again ready i have no doubt of it william and we have good reason to thank god for we could ill spare you it's a long while since you have gone on with your story ready said william after they had taken their supper i wish you would do so now as i am sure i shall not be tired with pleasure william replied ready but can you remember where i left off for my memory is none of the best oh yes if you recollect you had just arrived at a dutch farmer's house in company with the savages at a place called graaff reinet i think well then the dutch farmer came out when he saw us coming and asked us who we were we told him that we were english prisoners and that we wished to give ourselves up to the authorities he took away our arms and ammunition and said that he was the authority in that part which was true enough and then he said you'll not run away without arms and ammunition that's certain as for sending you to the cape that i may not be able to do for months so if you wish to be fed well you must work well while you're here' we replied that we should be very glad to make ourselves useful and then he sent us some dinner by a hottentot girl but we soon found out that we had to deal with an ill tempered brutal fellow and that he gave us plenty of hard work but by no means plenty of food he would not trust us with guns so the hottentots went out with the cattle but he gave us plenty of work to do about the house and at last he treated us very cruelly when he was short of provisions for the hottentots and other slaves of whom he had a good many he would go out with the other farmers who lived near him and shoot quaggas for them to eat nobody but a hottentot could live upon such flesh what is quagga a wild ass partly covered with stripes but not so much as the zebra a pretty animal to look at but the flesh is very bad at last he would give us nothing to eat but quaggas the same as the hottentots while he and his family for he had a wife and five children lived upon mutton and the flesh of the antelope which is very excellent eating we asked him to allow us a gun to procure better food and he kicked romer so unmercifully that he could not work for two days afterwards our lives became quite a burden to us we were employed all day on the farm and every day he was more brutal towards us at last we agreed that we would stand it no longer and one evening hastings told him so this put him into a great rage and he called two of the slaves and ordered them to tie him to the waggon wheel swearing that he would cut every bit of skin off his body and he went into his house to get his whip the slaves had hold of hastings and were tying him up for they dared not disobey their master when he said to us if i am flogged this way it will be all over with us now's your time run back behind the house and when he comes out with the whip do you go in and seize the muskets which are always ready loaded hold him at bay till i get clear and then we will get away somehow or other you must do it for i am sure he will flog me till i am dead and he will shoot you as runaway prisoners as he did his two hottentots the other day' as romer and i thought this very probable we did as hastings told us and when the dutchman had gone towards him where he was tied up about fifty yards from the house we went in the farmer's wife was in bed having just had an addition to her family and the children we cared not for we seized two muskets and a large knife and came out just as the dutchman had struck the first blow with the rhinoceros whip which was so severe that it took away poor hastings' breath we went up he turned round and saw us we levelled our muskets at him and he stopped another blow and we'll shoot you' cried romer yes' cried i we are only boys but you've englishmen to deal with' when we came up romer kept his piece levelled at the dutchman while i passed him and with the knife cut the thongs which bound hastings the dutchman turned pale and did not speak he was so frightened and the slaves ran away as soon as hastings was free he seized a large wooden mallet used for driving in stakes and struck the dutchman down to the earth crying out that for flogging an englishman you rascal' while the man lay senseless or dead i didn't know which at the time we tied him to the waggon wheels and returning to the house seized some ammunition and other articles which might be useful we then went to the stables and took the three best horses which the dutchman had put some corn in a sack for each of them took some cord for halters mounted and rode away as fast as we could as we knew that we should be pursued we first galloped away as if we were going eastward to the cape and then as soon as we were on ground which would not show the tracks of our horses' hoofs we turned round to the northward in the direction of the bushman country it was dark soon after we had altered our course but we travelled all night and although we heard the roaring of the lions at a distance we met with no accident at daylight we rested our horses and gave them some corn and then sat down to eat some of the provision we had brought with us how long were you with the farmer at graaff reinet nearly eight months sir and during that time we could not only speak dutch but we could make ourselves understood by the hottentots and other natives while we were eating we held a consultation how we should proceed we were aware that the dutchmen would shoot us if they came up with us and that they would come out in strong force against us and we were afraid that we had killed the man and if so they would hang us as soon as we got to the cape so we were at a great loss to know how to act at last we decided that we would cross the country of the bushmen and get to the sea side to the northward of the cape we determined that it would be better to travel at night as there would be less fear of the wild beasts or of being seen so we went fast asleep for many hours towards the evening we found water for the horses and then we fed them again and proceeded on our journey i won't tell what passed every day for a fortnight by which time we had pretty well killed our horses and we were compelled to stop among a tribe of gorraguas a very mild inoffensive people who supplied us with milk and treated us very kindly we had some adventures nevertheless one day as we were passing by a tuft of small trees a rhinoceros charged upon my horse which very narrowly escaped by wheeling short round and getting behind him the beast then made off without meddling with us any more every day we used to shoot some animal or other for provision sometimes it was a gnu something between an antelope and a bull at other times it was one of the antelope kind well we stayed for three weeks with these people and gave our horses time to refresh themselves and then we set off again keeping more towards the coast as we went southward for the gorraguas told us that there was a fierce native tribe called kaffers to the northward who would certainly kill us if we went there the fact is we did not know what to do we had left the cape without any exact idea where we should go to like foolish boys as we were and we became more entangled with difficulties every day at last we decided that it would be better to find our way back to the cape and deliver ourselves up as prisoners for we were tired out with fatigue and constant danger all that we were afraid of was that we had killed the dutch farmer at graaff reinet who had treated us so brutally but hastings said he did not care that was his business and he would take his chance so when we bade adieu to the gorraguas we turned our horses' heads to the south east so as to make the sea and go to the southward at the same time i have now to mention a most melancholy event which occurred two days after we had recommenced our travels in passing through some high grass we stumbled on a lion which was devouring a gnu romer who happened to be some ten yards foremost of the three was so alarmed that he fired at the animal which we had agreed never to do as it was folly to enrage so powerful a beast when our party was so small the lion was slightly wounded he gave a roar that might have been heard for a mile sprang upon romer and with one blow of his paw knocked him off the saddle into the bushes our horses which were frightened wheeled round and fled for the animal was evidently about to attack us as it was he did make one bound in our direction we could not pull up until we had gone half a mile and when we did we saw the lion had torn down the horse which romer had ridden and was dragging away the carcass to the right at a sort of a canter without any apparent effort on his part we waited till he was well off and then rode back to the spot where romer had fallen we soon found him but he was quite dead the blow with the lion's paw had fractured his skull i ought to have said that the gorraguas told us not to travel by night but by day and we had done so in consequence of their advice i believe it was very good advice notwithstanding this unfortunate accident for we found that when we had travelled all night the lions had more than once followed us the whole time and indeed i have often thought since that we were altogether indebted to his mercy who ordereth all things both in heaven and earth that we escaped so well as we did three days after poor romer's death we first saw the wide ocean again we kept near the coast but we soon found that we could not obtain the supply of game or fuel for our fires at night so well as we could in the interior and we agreed to get away from the coast again we had a dreary plain to pass over and we were quite faint for want of food for we had been without any for nearly two days when we came upon an ostrich hastings put his horse to his speed but it was of no use the ostrich ran much faster than the horse could i remained behind and to my great joy discovered his nest with thirteen large eggs in it hastings soon came back with his horse panting and out of wind we sat down lighted a fire and roasted two of the eggs we made a good dinner of them and having put four more on our saddle bows we continued our journey at last one forenoon we saw the table mountain and were as glad to see it as if we had seen the white cliffs of old england we pushed on our horses with the hopes of being once more comfortably in prison before night when as we neared the bay we noticed that english colours were flying on board of the vessels in the road this surprised us very much but soon after that we met an english soldier who told us that the cape had been taken by our forces more than six months ago this was a joyful surprise as you may suppose we rode into the town and reported ourselves to the main guard the governor sent for us heard our story and sent us to the admiral who took us on board of his own ship chapter thirty nine the next morning as there was no particular work on hand ready and mr seagrave took the lines to add to the stock of the fish pond as the weather was fine and cool william accompanied them that he might have the benefit of the fresh air as they passed the garden they observed that the seeds sown had already sprung up an inch or two above the ground and that apparently none of them had missed while ready and mr seagrave were fishing and william sitting near them william said to his father many of the islands near us are inhabited are they not papa yes but not those very near us i believe at all events i never heard any voyagers mention having seen inhabitants on the isles near which we suppose the one we are on to be what sort of people are the islanders in these seas they are various the new zealanders are the most advanced in civilisation the natives of van diemen's land and australia are some portions of them of a very degraded class indeed little better than the beasts of the field i have seen them said ready and i think i can mention a people not very numerous indeed who are still more like the beasts of the field i saw them once and at first thought they were animals and not human beings indeed ready where may that be in the great andaman isles at the mouth of the bay of bengal i once anchored in distress in port cornwallis and the morning after we anchored we saw some black things going upon all fours under the trees that came down to the water's edge we got the telescope and perceived then that they were men and women for they stood upright did you ever come into contact with them no sir i did not but i met at calcutta a soldier who had for at one time the east india company intended making a settlement on the island and sent some troops there he said that they caught two of them that they were not more than four feet high excessively stupid and shy they had no houses or huts to live in and all that they did was to pile up some bushes to keep the wind off had they any arms yes sir they had bows and arrows but so miserably made and so small that they could not kill anything but very small birds where did the people come from who inhabited these islands papa that is difficult to say william but it is supposed that they have become inhabited in much the same way as this our island has been that is by people in canoes or boats driven out to sea and saving their lives by effecting a landing as we have done i believe that's the truth replied ready i heard say that the andaman isles were supposed to have been first inhabited by a slaver full of negroes who were wrecked on the coast in a typhoon what is a typhoon ready it is much the same as a hurricane william it comes on in india at the change of the monsoons but what are monsoons winds that blow regular from one quarter so many months during the year and then change round and blow from another just as long and what are the trade winds which i heard poor captain osborn talking about after we left madeira the trade winds blow on the equator and several degrees north and south of it from the east to the west following the course of the sun is it the sun which produces these winds yes the extreme heat of the sun between the tropics rarefies the air as the earth turns round and the trade winds are produced by the rushing in of the less heated air yes william and the trade winds produce what they call the gulf stream observed ready how is that i have heard it spoken of papa the winds constantly following the sun across the atlantic ocean and blowing from east to west have great effect upon the sea which is forced up into the gulf of mexico where it is stopped by the shores of america so that it is many feet higher in the gulf than in the eastern part of the atlantic this accumulation of water must of course find a vent somewhere and it does in what is called the gulf stream by which the waters are poured out running very strong to the northward along the shores of america and then westward eastward passing not far from newfoundland until its strength is spent somewhere to the northward of the azores the gulf stream william said ready is always several degrees warmer than the sea in general which is they say owing to its waters remaining in the gulf of mexico so long where the heat of the sun is so great what do you mean by the land and sea breezes in the west indies and other hot climates papa it is the wind first blowing off from the shore and then blowing from the sea towards the shore during certain hours of the day which it does regularly every twenty four hours this is also the effect of the heat of the sun the sea breeze commences in the morning and in the afternoon it dies away when the land breeze commences which lasts till midnight there are latitudes close to the trade winds said ready where the wind is not certain where ships have been becalmed for weeks the crews have exhausted the water on board and they have suffered dreadfully we call them the horse latitudes why i do not know but it is time for us to leave off and for master william to go into the house they returned home and after supper ready went on with his narrative i left off at the time that i was sent on board of the man of war and i was put down on the books as a supernumerary boy i was on board of her for nearly four years and we were sent about from port to port and from clime to clime until i grew a strong tall lad and was put into the mizen top i found it very comfortable i did my duty and the consequence was i never was punished for a man may serve on board of a man of war without fear of being punished if he only does his duty and the duty is not very hard either not like on board of the merchant vessels where there are so few hands there it is hard work of course there are some captains who command men of war who are harsh and severe but it was my good fortune to be with a very mild and steady captain who was very sorry when he was obliged to punish the men although he would not overlook any improper conduct the only thing which was a source of constant unhappiness to me was that i could not get to england again and see my mother i had written two or three letters but never had an answer and at last i became so impatient that i determined to run away the very first opportunity which might offer we were then stationed in the west indies and i had very often consultations with hastings on the subject for he was quite as anxious to get away as i was and we had agreed that we would start off together the very first opportunity at last we anchored in port royal jamaica and there was a large convoy of west india ships laden with sugar about to sail immediately we knew that if we could get on board of one they would secrete us until the time of sailing for they were short handed enough the men of war having pressed every man they could lay their hands upon there was but one chance and that was by swimming on board of one of the vessels during the night time and that was easy enough as they were anchored not a hundred yards from our own ship what we were afraid of was the sharks which were so plentiful in the harbour however the night before the convoy was to sail we made up our minds that we would run the risk for we were so impatient to escape that we did not care for anything it was in the middle watch i recollect it and shall recollect it all my life as if it were last night that we lowered ourselves down very softly from the bows of the ship and as soon as we were in the water we struck out for one of the west indiamen close to us the sentry at the gangway saw the light in the water made by our swimming through it and he hailed of course we gave no answer but swam as fast as we could for after he had hailed we heard a bustle and we knew that the officer of the watch was manning a boat to send after us i had just caught hold of the cable of the west indiaman and was about to climb up by it for i was a few yards before hastings when i heard a loud shriek and turning round perceived a shark plunging down with hastings in his jaws i was so frightened that for a short time i could not move at last i recovered myself and began to climb up by the cable as fast as i could i was just in time for another shark made a rush at me and although i was clear out of the water more than two feet he sprung up and just caught my shoe by the heel which he took down with him fear gave me strength and in a second or two afterwards i was up at the hawse holes and the men on board who had been looking over the bows and had witnessed poor hastings' death helped me on board and hurried me down below for the boat from our ship was now nearly alongside when the officer of the boat came on board they told him they had perceived us both in the water close to their vessel and that the sharks had taken us down as the shriek of hastings was heard by the people in the boat the officer believed that it was the case and returned to the ship i heard the drum beat to quarters on board of the man of war that they might ascertain who were the two men who had attempted to swim away and a few minutes afterwards they beat the retreat having put down dd against my name on the books as well as against that of poor hastings what does dd mean d stands for discharged from the service dd stands for dead replied ready and it was only through the mercy of providence that i was not so it was a miraculous escape indeed observed mr seagrave yes indeed sir i can hardly describe my sensations for some hours afterwards i tried to sleep but could not i was in agony the moment i slumbered i thought the shark had hold of me and i would start up and shriek and then i said my prayers and tried to go to sleep again but it was of no use the captain of the west indiaman was afraid that my shrieks would be heard and he sent me down a tumbler of rum to drink off this composed me and at last i fell into a sound sleep when i awoke i found that the ship was under weigh and with all canvas set surrounded by more than a hundred other vessels the men of war who took charge of the convoy firing guns and making signals incessantly it was a glorious sight and we were bound for old england i felt so happy that i thought i would risk the jaws of another shark to have regained my liberty and the chance of being once more on shore in my own country and able to go to newcastle and see my poor mother i am afraid that your miraculous escape did you very little good ready observed mrs seagrave if you got over it so soon indeed madam it was not so that was only the feeling which the first sight of the vessels under weigh for england produced upon me i can honestly say that i was a better and more serious person the very next night when i was in my hammock i prayed very fervently and there happened to be a very good old scotchman on board the second mate who talked very seriously to me and pointed out how wonderful had been my preservation and i felt it it was he who first read the bible with me and made me understand it and i may say become fond of it i did my duty on our passage home as a seaman before the mast and the captain was pleased with me the ship i was in was bound to glasgow and we parted company with the convoy at north foreland and arrived safe in port the captain took me to the owners who paid me fifteen guineas for my services during the voyage home and as soon as i received the money i set off for newcastle as fast as i could i had taken a place on the outside of the coach and i entered into conversation with a gentleman who sat next to me i soon found out that he belonged to newcastle and i first inquired if mr masterman the ship builder was still alive he told me that he had been dead about three months and to whom did he leave his money' i asked for he was very rich and had no kin' he had no relations' replied the gentleman and he left all his money to build an hospital and almshouses he had a partner in his business latterly and he left the yard and all the stores to him i believe because he did not know whom to leave it to there was a lad whom i knew for certain he intended to have adopted and to have made his heir a lad of the name of ready but he ran away to sea and has never been heard of since it is supposed that he was lost in a prize for he was traced so far foolish boy that he was he might now have been a man of fortune' very foolish indeed' replied i yes but he has harmed more than himself his poor mother who doted upon him as soon as she heard that he was lost pined away by degrees and ' you don't mean to say that she is dead' interrupted i seizing the gentleman by the arm yes' replied he looking at me with surprise she died last year of a broken heart' i fell back on the luggage behind me and should have fallen off the coach if the gentleman had not held me he called to the coachman to pull up the horses and they took me down and put me inside and as the coach rolled on i cried as if my heart would break ready appeared so much affected that mr seagrave proposed that he should leave off his history for the present thank you sir it will be better for i feel my old eyes dim with tears even now it's a dreadful thing in after life to reflect upon that your foolish conduct has hastened the death of a most kind mother but so it was william and i give you the truth for your advantage chapter forty a few mornings afterwards juno came in before breakfast with six eggs in her apron which she had found in the hen house look missy seagrave fowls lay eggs soon have plenty plenty for master william make him well again and plenty for chickens by and by you haven't taken them all out of the nests juno have you no leave one in each nest for hen to see well then we will keep them for william and i hope as you say they will make him strong again i am getting quite strong now mother replied william i think it would be better to leave the eggs for the hens to sit upon no no william your health is of more consequence than having early chickens for a few days mr seagrave and ready were employed at the garden clearing away the weeds which had begun to sprout up along with the seeds which had been sown during which time william recovered very fast the two first days juno brought in three or four eggs regularly but on the third day there were none to be found on the fourth day the hens appeared also not to have laid much to the surprise of mrs seagrave as when hens commence laying eggs they usually continue on the fifth morning when they sat down to breakfast master tommy did not make his appearance and mrs seagrave asked where he was i suspect madam said old ready laughing that tommy will not come either to his breakfast or his dinner to day what can you mean ready said mrs seagrave why madam i will tell you i thought it very odd that there were no eggs and i thought it probable that the hens might have laid astray so i went about yesterday evening to search i could not find any eggs but i found the egg shells hid under some cocoa nut leaves and i argued that if an animal supposing there was any on the island had taken the eggs it would not have been so careful to hide the egg shells so this morning i fastened up the door of the hen house and only left open the little sliding door by which the fowls go in to roost and then after you were up i watched behind the trees and saw tommy come out and go to the hen house he tried the door and finding it fast crept into the hen house by the little sliding door as soon as he was in i let down the slide and fastened it with a nail so there he is caught in his own trap and there shall he remain all day the little glutton said mr seagrave yes it will serve him right replied mrs seagrave and be a lesson to him mr seagrave ready and william as usual went down to their work mrs seagrave and juno with little caroline were busy indoors tommy remained very quiet for an hour when he commenced roaring but it was of no use no one paid any attention to him at dinner time he began to roar again but with as little success it was not till the evening that the door of the hen house was opened and tommy permitted to come out he looked very foolish and sat down in a corner without speaking well tommy how many eggs did you suck to day said ready tommy won't suck eggs any more said the urchin no you had better not replied mr seagrave or you will find in the end that you will have less to eat instead of more as you have this day tommy waited very quietly and very sulkily till supper was ready when he made up for lost time after which ready continued his narrative i told you william that i was informed by the gentleman on the coach that my mother had died of a broken heart in consequence of my supposed death i was in agony until i arrived at newcastle where i could ascertain all the facts connected with her decease when the coach stopped the gentleman who had remained outside came to the coach door and said to me if i mistake not you are masterman ready who ran away to sea are you not' yes sir' replied i very sorrowfully i am' well my man' said he cheer up when you went away you were young and thoughtless and certainly had no idea that you would have distressed your mother as you did it was not your going to sea but the report of your death which preyed so much upon her mind and that was not your fault you must come with me as i have something to say to you' i will call upon you to morrow sir' replied i i cannot do anything until i talk to the neighbours and visit my poor mother's grave it is very true that i did not intend to distress my mother and that the report of my death was no fault of mine but i cannot help feeling that if i had not been so thoughtless she would be still alive and happy' the gentleman gave me his address and i promised to call upon him next morning i then went to the house my mother used to live in i knew that she was not there yet i was disappointed and annoyed when i heard merry laughter within i looked in for the door was open in the corner where my mother used to sit there was a mangle and two women busily at work others were ironing at a large table and when they cried out to me what do you want' and laughed at me i turned away in disgust and went to a neighbouring cottage the inmates of which had been very intimate with my mother i found the wife at home but she did not know me and i told her who i was she had attended my mother during her illness till the day of her death and she told me all i wished to know it was some little relief to my mind to hear that my poor mother could not have lived as she had an incurable cancer but at the same time the woman told me that i was ever in her thoughts and that my name was the last word on her lips she also said that mr masterman had been very kind to my mother and that she had wanted nothing i then asked her to show me where my mother had been buried she put on her bonnet and led me to the grave and then at my request she left me i seated myself down by the mound of turf which covered her and long and bitterly did i weep her loss and pray for forgiveness it was quite dark when i left the spot and went back to the cottage of the kind woman who had attended my mother i conversed with her and her husband till late and then as they offered me a bed i remained with them that night next morning i went to keep my appointment with the gentleman whom i had met in the coach i found by the brass plate on the door that he was a lawyer he desired me to sit down and then he closed the door carefully and having asked me many questions to ascertain if i was really masterman ready he said he was the person employed at mr masterman's death and that he had found a paper which was of great consequence as it proved that the insurance of the vessel which had belonged to my father and mr masterman and which had been lost had not been made on mr masterman's share only but upon my father's as well and that mr masterman had defrauded my mother he said he had found the paper in a secret drawer some time after mr masterman's death and that my mother being dead and i being supposed to be dead he did not see any use in making known so disagreeable a circumstance but that now i had re appeared it was his duty so to do and that he would arrange the matter for me if i pleased with the corporation of the town to whom all mr masterman's property had been left in trust to build an hospital and almshouses he said that the insurance on the vessel was three thousand pounds and that one third of the vessel belonged to my father so that a thousand pounds were due to him which the interest for so many years would increase to above two thousand pounds this was good news for me and you may suppose i readily agreed to all he proposed he set to work at once and having called together the mayor and corporation of the town and proved the document they immediately agreed that i was entitled to the money and that it should be paid to me without any contest thus you see master william was a new temptation thrown in my way how do you mean a temptation it surely was very fortunate ready said william yes william it was as people say fortunate according to the ideas of the world every one congratulated me and i was myself so inflated with my good fortune that i forgot all the promises of amendment all the vows of leading a good life which i made over my poor mother's grave now do you perceive why i called it a temptation master william my dear child said mr seagrave riches and prosperity in this world prove often the greatest of temptations it is adversity that chastens and amends us and which draws us to god as soon as the money was in my own hands continued ready i began to squander it away in all manner of folly fortunately i had not received it more than ten days when the scotch second mate came like a guardian angel to save me as soon as i had made known to him what had taken place he reasoned with me pointed out to me that i had an opportunity of establishing myself for life and proposed that i should purchase a part of a vessel on condition that i was captain of her i liked this idea very much and being convinced that i had been making a fool of myself i resolved to take his advice but one thing only restrained me i was still very young not more than twenty years old and although i could navigate at one time i had latterly paid no attention i told sanders this and he replied that if i would take him as my first mate that difficulty would be got over as he could navigate well and that i could learn to do so in the first voyage so all was arranged fortunately i had not spent above one hundred pounds of the money i set off for glasgow in company with sanders and he busied himself very hard in looking about for a vessel that would suit at last he found that there was one ready for launching which in consequence of the failure of the house for which it was built was to be sold he made inquiries and having found who was likely to purchase her that it was a very safe and respectable firm he made a proposal for me that i should take one fourth share of her and command her as sanders was very respectable and well known to be a steady man his recommendation was attended to so far that the parties wished to see and speak to me they were satisfied with me young as i was and the bargain was made i paid down my two thousand pounds for my share and as soon as the vessel was launched was very busy with sanders whom i had chosen as first mate in fitting her out the house which had purchased her with me was a west india firm and the ship was of course intended for the west india trade i had two or three hundred pounds left after i had paid my share of the vessel and this i employed in purchasing a venture on my own account and providing nautical instruments etcetera i also fitted myself out for you see william although sanders had persuaded me to be rational i was still puffed up with pride at the idea of being captain of my own ship it was too great a rise for one who had just before been a lad in the mizen top of a man of war i dressed myself very smart wore white shirts and rings on my fingers indeed as captain and part owner of a fine vessel i was considered as somebody and was often invited to the table of the other owners of the vessel i was well off for my pay was ten pounds a month independent of what my own venture might produce and my quarter share of the profits of the vessel this may be considered as the most prosperous portion of my life and so if you please we will leave off here for to night for i may as well tell you at once that it did not last very long chapter forty one for several days after they were employed in clearing away the stumps of the cocoa nut trees in the winding path to the storehouse and as soon as that work was finished ready put up a lightning conductor at the side of the storehouse like the one which he had put up near to the cottage they had now got through all the work that they had arranged to do during the rainy season the ewes had lambed but both the sheep and the goats began to suffer for want of pasture for a week they had no rain and the sun burst out very powerfully and ready was of opinion that the rainy season was now over william had become quite strong again and he was very impatient that they should commence the survey of the island after a great deal of consultation it was at last settled that ready and william should make the first survey to the southward and then return and report what they had discovered this was decided upon on the saturday evening and on the monday morning they were to start the knapsacks were got ready and well filled with boiled salt pork and flat cakes of bread they were each to have a musket and ammunition and a blanket was folded up to carry on the shoulders that they might sleep on it at night ready did not forget his compass or the small axes for them to blaze the trees as they went through the wood the whole of saturday was occupied in making their preparations after supper ready said now william before we start on our travels i think i may as well wind up my history i haven't a great deal more to tell as my good fortune did not last long and after my remaining so long in a french prison my life was one continued chapter of from bad to worse our ship was soon ready and we sailed with convoy for barbadoes sanders proved a good navigator and from him before we arrived at barbadoes i gained all the knowledge which i required to enable me to command and navigate my vessel sanders attempted to renew our serious conversation but my property had made me vain and now that i felt i could do without his assistance i not only kept him at a distance but assumed the superior this was a very ungrateful return for his kindness to me but it is too often the case in this world sanders was very much annoyed and on our arrival at barbadoes he told me that it was his intention to quit the vessel i replied very haughtily that he might do as he pleased the fact is i was anxious to get rid of him merely because i was under obligations to him well sir sanders left me and i felt quite happy at his departure my ship was soon with a full cargo of sugar on board of her and we waited for convoy to england when at barbadoes i had an opportunity to buy four brass guns which i mounted on deck and had a good supply of ammunition on board i was very proud of my vessel as she had proved in the voyage out to be a very fast sailer indeed she sailed better than some of the men of war which convoyed us and now that i had guns on board i considered myself quite safe from any of the enemies' privateers while we were waiting for convoy which was not expected for a fortnight it blew a very heavy gale and my ship as well as others dragged their anchors and were driven out of carlisle bay we were obliged to make sail to beat into the bay again it still blowing very fresh what with being tired waiting so long for convoy and the knowledge that arriving before the other west indiamen would be very advantageous i made up my mind that instead of beating up into the bay again i would run for england without protection trusting to the fast sailing of my vessel and the guns which i had on board i forgot at the time that the insurance on the vessel was made in england as sailing with convoy' and that my sailing without would render the insurance void if any misfortune occurred well sir i made sail for england and for three weeks everything went on well we saw very few vessels and those which did chase us could not come up with us but as we were running with a fair wind up channel and i had made sure of being in port before night a french privateer hove in sight and gave chase we were obliged to haul our wind and it blowing very fast we carried away our main top mast this accident was fatal the privateer came alongside of us and laid us by the board and that night i was in a french prison and i may say a pauper for the insurance of the vessel was void from my having sailed without convoy i felt that i had no one to thank but myself for the unfortunate position i was in at all events i was severely punished for i remained a prisoner for nearly six years i contrived to escape with three or four others we suffered dreadfully and at last arrived in england in a swedish vessel without money or even clothes that would keep out the weather of course i had nothing to do but to look out for a berth on board of a ship and i tried for that of second mate but without success i was too ragged and looked too miserable so i determined as i was starving to go before the mast there was a fine vessel in the port i went on board to offer myself the mate went down to the captain who came on deck and who should he be but sanders i hoped that he would not remember me but he did immediately and held out his hand i never did feel so ashamed in my life as i did then sanders perceived it and asked me down into the cabin i then told him all that had happened and he appeared to forget that i had behaved so ill to him he offered me a berth on board and money in advance to fit me out but if he would not remember my conduct i could not forget it and i told him so and begged his forgiveness well sir that good man as long as he lived was my friend i became his second mate before he died and we were again very intimate my misfortunes had humbled me and i once more read the bible with him and i have i trust done so ever since when he died i continued second mate for some time and then was displaced since that i have always been as a common seaman on board of different vessels but i have been well treated and respected and i may add i have not been unhappy for i felt that property would have only led me into follies and have made me forget that in this world we are to live so as to prepare ourselves for another now william you have the history of masterman ready and i hope that there are portions of it which may prove useful to you to morrow we must be off betimes and as we are all to breakfast early together why i think the sooner we go to bed the better very true replied mr seagrave william dear bring me the bible chapter forty two they were all up early the next morning and breakfasted at an early hour the knapsacks and guns and the other requisites for the journey were all prepared william and ready rose from the table and taking an affectionate leave of mr and mrs seagrave they started on their journey the sun was shining brilliantly and the weather had become warm the ocean in the distance gleamed brightly as its waters danced and the cocoa nut trees moved their branches gracefully to the breeze they set off in high spirits and having called the two shepherd dogs and driven back vixen who would have joined the party they passed the storehouse and ascending the hill on the other side they got their hatchets ready to blaze the trees and ready having set his course by his pocket compass they were fairly on their way for some time they continued to cut the bark of the trees with their hatchets without speaking and then ready stopped again to look at his compass i think the wood is thicker here than ever ready observed william yes sir it is but i suspect we are now in the thickest part of it right in the middle of the island however we shall soon see we must keep a little more away to the southward we had better get on as fast as we can we shall have less work by and by and then we can talk better for half an hour they continued their way through the wood and as ready had observed the trees became more distant from each other still however they could not see anything before them but the stems of the cocoa nuts it was hard work chopping the trees every second and their foreheads were moist with the exertion i think we had better pull up for a few minutes william you will be tired i have not been so used to exercise ready and therefore i feel it more replied william wiping his face with his handkerchief i should like to stop a few minutes how long do you think it will be before we are out of the wood not half an hour more sir i should think even before that perhaps what do you expect to find ready that's a difficult question to answer i can tell you what i hope to find which is a good space of clear ground between the beach and the wood where we may pasture our sheep and goats and perhaps we may find some other trees besides cocoa nuts at present you know we have seen only them and the castor oil beans that tommy took such a dose of you see william there is no saying what new seeds may have been brought here by birds or by the winds and waves but will those seeds grow yes william i have been told that seeds may remain hundreds of years under ground and come up afterwards when exposed to the heat they continued their way and had not walked for more than a quarter of an hour when william cried out i see the blue sky ready we shall soon be out and glad shall i be for my arm aches with chopping i dare say it does sir i am just as glad as you are for i'm tired of marking the trees however we must continue to mark or we shall not find our way back when we want it in ten minutes more they were clear of the cocoa nut grove and found themselves among brushwood higher than their heads so that they could not see how far they were from the shore well said william throwing down his hatchet i'm glad that's over now let us sit down a little before we go any further i'm of your opinion sir replied ready sitting down by the side of william i feel more tired to day than i did when we first went through the wood after we set off from the cove i suppose it's the weather come back dogs lie down the weather is very fine ready yes now it is but i meant to have said that the rainy season is very trying to the health and i suppose i have not recovered from it yet you have had a regular fever and of course do not feel strong but a man may have no fever and yet his health suffer a great deal from it i am an old man william and feel these things now i think that before we go on ready we had better have our dinner that will do us good well we will take an early dinner and we shall get rid of one bottle of water at all events indeed i think that as we must go back by the same way we came we may as well leave our knapsacks and everything but our guns under these trees i dare say we shall sleep here too for i told mr seagrave positively not to expect us back to night i did not like to say so before your mother she is so anxious about you they opened their knapsacks and made their meal the two dogs coming in for their share after which they again started on their discoveries for about ten minutes they continued to force their way through the thick and high bushes till at last they broke out clear of them and then looked around them for a short time without speaking the sea was about half a mile distant and the intervening land was clear with fresh blades of grass just bursting out of the earth composing a fine piece of pasture of at least fifty acres here and there broken with small patches of trees and brushwood there was no sandy beach but the rocks rose from the sea about twenty to thirty feet high and were in one or two places covered with something which looked as white as snow well ready said william there will be no want of pasture for our flock even if it increases to ten times its number no replied ready we are very fortunate and have great reason to be thankful this is exactly what we required and now let us go on a little and examine these patches of wood and see what they are i see a bright green leaf out there which if my eyes do not fail me i have seen many a time before when they arrived at the clump of trees which ready had pointed out he said yes i was right look there this is the banana it is just bursting out now and will soon be ten feet high and bearing fruit which is excellent eating besides which the stem is capital fodder for the beasts here is a plant i never saw before said william pulling off a piece of it and showing it to ready but i have william it is what they call the bird's eye pepper they make cayenne pepper out of it look the pods are just formed it will be useful to us in cooking as we have no pepper left you see william we must have some birds on the island at least it is most probable for all the seeds of these plants and trees must have been brought here by them the banana and the pepper are the food of many birds what a quantity of bananas are springing up in this spot there will be a little forest of them in a few weeks what is that rough looking sort of shrub out there ready i can't see so well as you william so let us walk up to it oh i know it now it is what they call the prickly pear in the west indies i am very glad to have found that for it will be very useful to us is it good eating ready not particularly and the little spikes run into your fingers and are very difficult to get rid of but it is not bad by way of a change no the use it will be to us is to hedge in our garden and protect it from the animals it makes a capital fence and grows very fast and without trouble now let us go on to that patch of trees and see what they are what is this plant ready i don't know william then i think i had better make a collection of all those you don't know and take them back to father he is a good botanist william pulled a branch of the plant off and carried it with him on their arrival at the next patch of trees ready looked at them steadfastly for some time i ought to know that tree said he i have often seen it in hot countries yes it's the guava what is it the fruit they make guava jelly of said william yes the very same let us now walk in the direction of those five or six trees said william and from there down to the rocks i want to find out how it is that they are so white be it so if you wish replied ready why ready what noise is that hark such a chattering it must be monkeys no they are not monkeys but i'll tell you what they are although i cannot see them they are parrots i know their noise well you see william it's not very likely that monkeys should get here but birds can and it is the birds that we have to thank for the bananas and guavas and other fruits we may find here as soon as they came under the trees there was a great rioting and fluttering and then away flew screaming as loud as they could a flock of about three hundred parrots their beautiful green and blue feathers glistening in the beams of the sun i told you so well we'll have some capital pies out of them william pies do they make good pies ready yes excellent and very often have i had a good dinner from one in the west indies and in south america stop let us come a little this way i see a leaf which i should like to examine the ground is very swampy just here ready is it not yes there's plenty of water below i don't doubt so much the better for the animals we must dig some pools when they come here oh i thought i was not wrong look this is the best thing i have found yet we now need not care so much about potatoes why what are they ready yams which they use instead of potatoes in the west indies indeed potatoes do not remain potatoes long when planted in hot climates how do you mean ready they turn into what they call sweet potatoes after one or two crops yams are better things in my opinion at this moment the dogs dashed among the broad yam leaves and commenced baying there was a great rustling and snorting what's that cried william who had been stooping down to examine the yam plant and who was startled at the noise ready laughed heartily it isn't the first time that they've made you jump william why it's our pigs isn't it replied william to be sure they're in the yam patch very busy feeding on them i'll be bound ready gave a shout and a grunting and rushing were heard among the broad leaves and very soon out rushed instead of the six about thirty pigs large and small who snorting and twisting their tails galloped away at a great rate until they gained the cocoa nut grove how wild they are ready said william yes and they'll be wilder every day but we must fence these yams from them or we shall get none ourselves but they'll beat down the fence before it grows up we must pale it with cocoa nut palings and plant the prickly pears outside now we'll go down to the sea side as they neared the rocks which were bare for about fifty yards from the water's edge ready said i can tell you now what those white patches on the rocks are william they are the places where the sea birds come to every year to make their nests and bring up their young they always come to the same place every year if they are not disturbed they soon arrived at the spot and found it white with the feathers of birds mixed up with dirt i see no nests ready nor the remains of any no they do not make any nests further than scratching a round hole about half an inch deep in the soil and there they lay their eggs sitting quite close to one another they will soon be here and begin to lay and then we will come and take the eggs if we want any for they are not bad eating why ready what a quantity of good things we have found out already this has been a very fortunate expedition of ours yes it has and we may thank god for his goodness who thus provides for us so plentifully in the wilderness do you know ready i cannot help thinking that we ought to have built our house here not so william we have not the pure water recollect and we have not the advantages of the sandy beach where we have our turtle and fish pond no we may feed our stock here we may gather the fruit taking our share of it with the poor birds we may get our yams and every other good provided for us but our house and home must be where it is now you are right ready but it will be a long walk not when we are accustomed to it and have made a beaten path besides we may bring the boat round perhaps then they walked along the sea side for about a quarter of a mile until they came to where the rocks were not so high and there they discovered a little basin completely formed in the rocks with a narrow entrance see william what a nice little harbour for our boat we may here load it with yams and take it round to the bay provided we can find an entrance through the reefs on the southern side of it which we have not looked for yet because we have not required it yes ready it is indeed a nice smooth little place for the boat what is that thing on the bottom there said william pointing in the direction that is a sea crawfish quite as good eating as a lobster i wonder if i could make a lobster pot we should catch plenty and very good they are and what are those little rough things on the rock they are a very nice little sort of oyster not like those we have in england but much better they are so delicate why ready we have two more good things for our table again replied william how rich we shall be yes but we have to catch them recollect there is nothing to be had in this world without labour ready said william we have good three hours' daylight suppose we go back and tell what we have seen my mother will be so glad to see us i agree with you william we have done well for one day and may safely go back again and remain for another week there are no fruits at present and all i care about are the yams i should like to protect them from the pigs but let us go home and talk the matter over with mr seagrave they found out the spot where they had left their knapsacks and hatchets and again took their path through the cocoa nut trees following the blaze which they had made in the morning one hour before sunset they arrived at the house where they found mr and mrs seagrave sitting outside and juno standing on the beach with the two children who were amusing themselves with picking up the shells which were strewed about william gave a very clear account of all they had seen and showed his father the specimens of the plants which he had collected this said mr seagrave is a well known plant and i wonder ready did not recognise it it is hemp i never saw it except in the shape of rope replied ready i know the seed well enough well if we require it i can tell you how to dress it replied mr seagrave now william what is the next this odd looking rough thing that's the egg plant it bears fruit of a blue colour i am told they eat it in the hot countries yes sir they do they fry it with pepper and salt they call it bringal i think it must be that i do not doubt but you are right replied mr seagrave why william you should know this it is like the grape vine yes and it is so it is the wild grape we shall eat them by and bye i have only one more papa what is this you don't know it because it has sprung up so high william but it is the common mustard plant what we use in england and is sold as mustard and cress i think you have now made a famous day's work of it and we have much to thank god for as soon as they had returned to the house a consultation was held as to their future proceedings and after some debate it was agreed that it would be advisable that they should take the boat out of the sand and as soon as it was ready examine the reef on the southward to see if they could find a passage through it as it would take a long while to go round it and as soon as that was accomplished mr seagrave ready william and juno should all go through the wood carrying with them a tent to pitch on the newly discovered piece of ground and that they should set up a flag staff at the little harbour to point out its position of course that would be a hard day's work but that they would nevertheless return the same night and not leave mrs seagrave alone with the children having accomplished this ready and william would then put the wheels and axle in the boat and other articles required such as saw hatchets and spades and row round to the south side of the island to find the little harbour as soon as they had landed them and secured the boat they would then return by the path through the wood the next job would be to rail in the yam plantation to keep off the pigs and at the same time to drive the sheep and goats through the wood that they might feed on the new pasture ground ready and william were then to cut down cocoa nut trees sufficient for the paling fix up the posts and when that was done mr seagrave was to come to them and assist them in railing it in and drawing the timber this they expected would be all done in about a month and during that time as mrs seagrave and juno would be for the greatest part of it left at the house they were to employ themselves in clearing the garden of weeds and making preparation for fencing it in as soon as this important work had been completed the boat would return to the bay with a load of prickly pears for the garden fence and then they were to direct their attention to the stores which had been saved from the wreck and were lying in the cove where they had first landed when they had examined them and brought round what were required and secured them in the storehouse they would then have a regular survey of the island by land and by water but man proposes and god disposes as will be shown by the interruption of their intended projects which we shall have to narrate in the ensuing chapter chapter forty three as usual ready was the first up on the following morning and having greeted juno who followed him out of the house he set off on his accustomed rounds to examine into the stock and their other possessions he was standing in the garden at the point first he thought that it would be necessary to get ready some sticks for the peas which were now seven or eight inches out of the ground he had proceeded a little farther to where the calivances or french haricot beans had been sown and had decided upon the propriety of hoeing up the earth round them as they were a very valuable article of food that would keep and afford many a good dish during the rainy or winter season he had gone on to ascertain if the cucumber seeds had shown themselves above ground and was pleased to find that they were doing well he said to himself we have no vinegar that i know of but we can preserve them in salt and water as they do in russia it will be a change at all events and then he raised his eyes and looked out to the offing and as usual scanned the horizon he thought he saw a ship to the north east and he applied his telescope to his eye he was not mistaken it was a vessel the old man's heart beat quick he dropped his telescope on his arm and fetched some heavy breaths before he could recover from the effect of this unexpected sight after a minute he again put his telescope to his eye and then made her out to be a brig under top sails and top gallant sails steering directly for the island ready walked to the rocky point from which they fished and sat down to reflect could it be that the vessel had been sent after them or that she had by mere chance come among the islands he decided after a short time that it must be chance for none could know that they were saved much less that they were on the island her steering towards the island must then be either that she required water or something else perhaps she would alter her course and pass by them at all events thought the old man we are in the hands of god who will at his own time and in his own way do with us as he thinks fit i will not at present say anything to mr and mrs seagrave it would be cruel to raise hopes which might end in disappointment a few hours will decide and yet i cannot do without help i must trust william ready rose examined the vessel with his telescope and then walked towards the house william was up and the remainder of the family were stirring william said ready to him as they walked away from the house i have a secret to tell you which you will at once see the necessity of not telling to anyone at present a few hours will decide the question william readily gave his promise there is a vessel off the island she may be the means of rescuing us or she may pass without seeing us it would be too cruel a disappointment to your father and mother if the latter were the case william stared at ready and for a moment could not speak his excitement was so great oh ready how grateful i am i trust that we may be taken away for you have no idea how my poor father suffers in silence and so does my mother i know it william i know it and it is natural they do their best to control their yearnings and they can do no more but now we must be quick and at work before breakfast but stop i will show you the vessel ready caught the vessel in the field of the telescope which he leant against the trunk of a cocoa nut and william put his eye to the glass do you see her oh yes ready and she is coming this way yes she is steering right for the island i will put the telescope down here and we will go about our work william and ready went to the storehouse for the axe ready selected a very slight cocoa nut tree nearest to the beach which he cut down and as soon as the top was taken off with the assistance of william he carried it down to the point now william go for a shovel and dig a hole here that we may fix it up as a flag staff when all is ready i will go for a small block and some rope for halyards to hoist up the flags as soon as the vessel is likely to see them at breakfast time i shall propose that you and i get the boat out of the sand and examine her and give mr seagrave some work indoors but the flags ready they are round my mother's bed how shall we get them suppose i say that it is time that the house should be well cleaned and that the canvas hangings of the beds should be taken out to be aired this fine day ask your father to take the direction of the work while we dig out the boat that will employ them all inside the house yes that will do ready during breakfast time ready observed that he intended to get the boat out of the sand and that william should assist him and what am i to do ready said mr seagrave why sir i think now that the rains are over it would not be a bad thing if we were to air bedding as they say at sea it is a fine warm day and if all the bedding was taken out of the house and well shaken and then left out to air it would be a very good job over for you see sir i have thought more than once that the house does smell a little close it will be a very good thing ready observed mrs seagrave and at the same time juno and i will give the house a thorough cleaning and sweeping had we not better have the canvas screens down and air them too yes replied ready we had better air everything we will assist in taking down the screens and flags and spread them out to air and then if mr seagrave has no objection we will leave him to superintend and assist madam and juno with all my heart replied mr seagrave we have done breakfast and will begin as soon as you please ready and william took down the canvas screens and flags and went out of the cottage with them they spread out the canvas at some distance from the house and then william went down to the beach with the flags while ready procured the block and small rope to hoist them up with ready's stratagem answered well without being perceived by those in the cottage the flag staff was raised and fixed in the ground and the flags all ready for hoisting then ready and william returned to the fuel stack and each carried down as much stuff as they could hold that they might make a smoke to attract the notice of those on board of the vessel all this did not occupy much more than an hour during which the brig continued her course steadily towards the island when ready first saw her the wind was light but latterly the breeze had increased very much and at last the brig took in her top gallant sails the horizon behind the vessel which had been quite clear was now banked up with clouds and the waves curled in white foam over the reefs of rocks extending from the island the breeze is getting up strong william said ready and she will soon be down if she is not frightened at the reefs which she can see plainer now the water is rough than she could before i trust she will not be afraid replied william how far do you think she is off now about five miles not more the wind has hauled round more to the southward and it is banking up fast i see i fear that we shall have another smart gale however it won't last long come let us hoist the flags we must not lose a chance the flags will blow nice and clear for them to see them william and ready hoisted up the ensign first and below it the flag with the ship's name pacific in large letters upon it now then said ready as he made fast the halyards let us strike a light and make a smoke that will attract their notice as soon as the cocoa nut leaves were lighted ready and william threw water upon them so as to damp them and procure a heavy column of smoke the vessel approached rapidly and they were watching her in silent suspense when they perceived mr and mrs seagrave juno carrying albert with tommy and caroline running down as fast as they could to the beach the fact was that tommy tired of work had gone out of the house and walked towards the beach there he perceived first the flags hoisted and then he detected the vessel off the island he immediately ran back to the house crying out papa mamma captain osborn come back come back in a big ship at this announcement mr and mrs seagrave ran out of the house perceived the vessel and the flags flying and ran as fast as they could down to where william and ready were standing by the flag staff oh ready why did you not tell us this before exclaimed mr seagrave i wish you had not known it now sir replied ready but however it can't be helped it was done out of kindness mr seagrave yes indeed it was papa mrs seagrave dropped down on the rock and burst into tears mr seagrave was equally excited does she see us ready exclaimed he at last no sir not yet and i waited till she did before i made it known to you replied ready she is altering her course ready said william yes sir she has hauled to the wind she is afraid of coming too near to the reefs surely she is not leaving us exclaimed mrs seagrave no madam but she does not see us yet she does she does cried william throwing up his hat see she hoists her ensign very true sir she does see us thanks be to god mr seagrave embraced his wife who threw herself sobbing into his arms kissed his children with rapture and wrung old ready's hand he was almost frantic with joy william was equally delighted as soon as they were a little more composed ready observed mr seagrave that they have seen us is certain and what we must now do is to get our own boat out of the sand we know the passage through the reefs and they do not i doubt if they will however venture to send a boat on shore until the wind moderates a little you see sir it is blowing up very strong just now but you don't think it will blow harder ready i am sorry to say sir that i do it looks very threatening to the southward and until the gale is over they will not venture near an island so surrounded with rocks it would be very imprudent if they did however sir a few hours will decide but surely said mrs seagrave even if it does blow they will not leave the island without taking us off they will come after the gale is over yes madam if they can i do think they will but god knows some men have hard hearts and feel little for the misery of others the brig had in the meantime kept away again as if she was running in but very soon afterwards she hauled to the wind with her head to the northward and stood away from the island she is leaving us exclaimed william mournfully hard hearted wretches said mr seagrave with indignation you are wrong to say that sir replied ready excuse me mr seagrave for being so bold but the fact is that if i was in command of that vessel i should do just as they have done the gale rises fast and it would be very dangerous for them to remain where they now are it does not at all prove that they intend to leave us they but consult their own safety and when the gale is over we shall i trust see them again no reply was made to ready's judicious remarks the seagraves only saw that the vessel was leaving them and their hearts sank they watched her in silence and as she gradually diminished to the view so did their hopes depart from them the wind was now fierce and a heavy squall with rain obscured the offing and the vessel was no longer to be distinguished mr seagrave turned to his wife and mournfully offered her his arm they walked away from the beach without speaking the remainder of the party with the exception of old ready followed them ready remained some time with his eyes in the direction where the vessel was last seen at last he hauled down the ensign and flag and throwing them over his shoulder followed the disconsolate party to the house chapter forty four when ready arrived he found them all plunged in such deep distress that he did not consider it advisable to say anything the evening closed in it was time to retire the countenance of mr seagrave was not only gloomy but morose the hour for retiring to rest had long passed when ready broke the silence by saying surely you do not intend to sit up all night mr seagrave oh no there's no use sitting up now replied mr seagrave rising up impatiently come my dear let us go to bed mrs seagrave rose and retired behind the canvas screen her husband seemed as if he was about to follow her when ready without speaking laid the bible on the table before him mr seagrave did not appear to notice it but william touched his father's arm pointed to the book and then went inside of the screen and led out his mother god forgive me exclaimed mr seagrave in my selfishness and discontent i had forgotten yes sir you had forgotten those words come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest' i am ashamed of myself said mrs seagrave bursting into tears mr seagrave opened the bible and read the psalm as soon as he had closed the book good night were all the words that passed and they all retired to rest during the night the wind howled and the rain beat down the children slept soundly but mr and mrs seagrave ready and william were awake during the whole of the night listening to the storm and occupied with their own thoughts ready was dressed before daylight and out on the beach before the sun had risen the gale was at its height and after a careful survey with his telescope he could see nothing of the vessel he remained on the beach till breakfast time when he was summoned by william and returned to the house he found mr and mrs seagrave up and more composed than they were the evening before and they welcomed him warmly i fear ready said mr seagrave that you have no good news for us no sir nor can you expect any good news until after the gale is over the vessel could not remain here during the gale that is certain and there is no saying what the effects of the gale may be she may lie to and not be far from us when the gale is over or she may be obliged to scud before the gale and run some hundred miles from us then comes the next chance i think by her running for the island that she was short of water the question is then whether she may not find it necessary to run for the port she is bound to or water at some other place a captain of a vessel is bound to do his best for the owners at the same time i do think that if she can with propriety come back for us she will the question is first whether she can and secondly whether the captain is a humane man and will do so at his own inconvenience there is but poor comfort in all that replied mr seagrave it is useless holding out false hopes sir replied ready but even if the vessel continues her voyage we have much to be thankful for in what ready why sir no one knew whether we were in existence or not and probably we never should have been searched for but now we have made it known and by the ship's name on the flag they know who we are and if they arrive safe in port will not fail to communicate the intelligence to your friends is not that a great deal to be thankful for we may not be taken off by this vessel but we have every hope that another will be sent out to us very true ready i ought to have seen that before but my despair and disappointment were yesterday so great that it almost took away my reason the gale continued during the day and showed no symptoms of abatement when they again retired for the night the following day ready was up early as usual and william accompanied him to the beach i don't think that it blows so hard as it did ready no william it does not the gale is breaking and by night i have no doubt will be over it is however useless looking for the vessel as she must be a long way from this it would take her a week perhaps to come back to us if she was to try to do so unless the wind should change to the northward or westward ready ready exclaimed william pointing to the south east part of the reef what is that look it's a boat ready put his telescope to his eye it's a canoe william and there are people in it why where can they have come from see they are among the breakers they will be lost let us go towards them ready they hastened along the beach to the spot nearest to where the canoe was tossing on the surf and watched it as it approached the shore william this canoe must have been blown off from the large island which lies out there and ready again looked through his telescope there are two people in it and they are islanders poor things they struggle hard for their lives and seem much exhausted but they have passed through the most dangerous part of the reef yes replied william they will soon be in smoother water but the surf on the beach is very heavy they won't mind that if their strength don't fail them they manage the canoe beautifully during this conversation the canoe had rapidly come towards the land in a moment or two afterwards it passed through the surf and grounded on the beach the two people in it had just strength enough left to paddle through the surf and then they dropped down in the bottom of the canoe quite exhausted let's drag the canoe higher up william poor creatures they are nearly dead while dragging it up ready observed that the occupants were both women their faces were tattooed all over otherwise they were young and might have been good looking shall i run up and get something for them ready do william ask juno to give you some of whatever there is for breakfast anything warm william soon returned with some thin oatmeal porridge which juno had been preparing for breakfast and a few spoonfuls being forced down the throats of the two natives they gradually revived william then left ready and went up to acquaint his father and mother with this unexpected event william soon returned with mr seagrave and as the women were now able to sit up they hauled up the canoe as far as they could to prevent her being beat to pieces they found nothing in the canoe except a piece of matting and the two paddles which had been used by the natives you see sir said ready it is very clear that these two poor women having been left in charge of the canoe have been blown off from the shore of one of the islands to the south east they must have been contending with the gale ever since the day before yesterday and as it appears without food or water it's a mercy that they gained this island it is so replied mr seagrave but to tell the truth i am not over pleased at their arrival it proves what we were not sure of before that we have very near neighbours who may probably pay us a very unwelcome visit that may be sir replied ready still these two poor creatures being thrown on shore here does not make the matter worse or the danger greater perhaps it may turn to our advantage for if these women learn to speak english before any other islanders visit us they will interpret for us and be the means perhaps of saving our lives would their visit be so dangerous then ready why sir a savage is a savage and like a child wishes to obtain whatever he sees especially he covets what he may turn to use such as iron etcetera if they came and we concealed a portion and gave up the remainder of our goods we might escape but still there is no trusting to them and i would infinitely prefer defending ourselves against numbers to trusting to their mercy but how can we defend ourselves against a multitude we must be prepared sir if we can fortify ourselves with our muskets we would be more than a match for hundreds mr seagrave turned away after a pause he said it is not very pleasant to be now talking of defending ourselves against savages when we hoped two days ago to be leaving the island oh that that brig would make its appearance again the wind is going down fast sir observed ready it will be fine weather before the evening we may look out for her at all events for the next week i shall not give up all hopes a whole week ready alas how true it is that hope deferred maketh the heart sick it is a severe trial mr seagrave but we must submit when we are chastened we had better get these poor creatures up to the house and let them recover themselves ready then beckoned to them to get on their feet which they both did although with some difficulty he then went in advance making a sign for them to follow they understood him and made the attempt but were so weak that they would have fallen if they had not been supported by mr seagrave and william it required a long time for them to arrive at the house mrs seagrave who knew what had happened received them very kindly and juno had a mess ready which she put before them they ate a little and then lay down and were soon sound asleep it is fortunate for us that they are women observed mr seagrave we should have had great difficulty had they been men yes sir replied ready but still we must not trust women too much at first for they are savages where shall we put them to night ready why sir i have been thinking about that i wish we had a shed close to us but as we have not we must let them sleep in the storehouse we must now pass over a space of fifteen days in which there was nothing done the expectation of the vessel returning was still alive although each day decreased these hopes every morning ready and william were at the beach with the telescope and the whole of the day was passed in surmises hopes and fears in fact the appearance of the vessel and the expectation of leaving the island had completely overturned all the regularity and content of our island party no other subject was broached not any of the work proposed was begun as it was useless to do anything if they were to leave the island after the first week had passed they felt that every day their chances were more adverse and at the end of the fortnight all hopes were very unwillingly abandoned the indian women had in the meantime recovered their fatigues and appeared to be very mild and tractable whatever they were able to do they did cheerfully and had already gained a few words of english the party to explore was again talked over and arranged for the following monday when a new misfortune fell on them which disconcerted all their arrangements on the saturday morning when ready as usual went his rounds as he walked along the beach he perceived that the indian canoe was missing it had been hauled up clear of the water so that it could not have floated away ready's heart misgave him he looked through his telescope in the direction of the large island and thought he could distinguish a speck on the water at a great distance as he was thus occupied william came down to him william said ready i fear those island women have escaped in their canoe run up and see if they are in the outhouse or anywhere else and let me know as soon as you can william in a few minutes returned breathless stating that the women were not to be found and that they had evidently carried away with them a quantity of the large nails and other pieces of iron which were in the small kegs in the storehouse this is bad william this is worse than the vessel not coming back why we can do without them ready yes but when they get back to their own people and show them the iron they have brought with them and describe how much more there is to be had depend upon it we shall have a visit from them in numbers that they may obtain more i ought to have known better than to leave the canoe here we must go and consult with mr seagrave for the sooner we begin to work now the better they communicated the intelligence to mr seagrave when they were outside he at once perceived their danger so they held a council and came to the following resolutions that it would be necessary that they should immediately stockade the storehouse so as to render it impossible for any one to get in and that as soon as the fortification was complete the storehouse should be turned into their dwelling house and such stores as could not be put within the stockade should be removed to their present house or concealed in the cocoa nut grove it was decided that nothing should be begun on that day saturday that sunday should be spent in devout prayer for help and encouragement from the almighty who would do towards them as his wisdom should ordain and that on monday with the blessing of god they would recommence their labour i don't know why but i feel more courage now that there is a prospect of danger than i felt when there was little or none said mrs seagrave how little do we know what the day may bring forth exclaimed mr seagrave how joyful were our anticipations when the vessel hoisted her colours we felt sure that we were to be taken off the island the same gale that drove the vessel away brought down to us the island women the fair weather after the gale which we hoped would have brought back the vessel to our succour on the contrary enabled the women to escape in the canoe and make known our existence to those who may come to destroy us how true it is that man plans in vain and that it is only by the almighty will and pleasure that he can obtain his ends chapter forty five but although they resolved as stated in the last chapter nothing was done finally one morning at sunrise as they were looking round with the telescope close to the turtle pond masterman ready said to mr seagrave indeed sir we must no longer remain in this state of idleness i have been thinking a great deal of our present position and prospects as to the vessel coming back we must at present give up all hopes of it i only wish that we were quite as sure that we shall not have a visit from the savages that is my great fear and it really haunts me the idea of our being surprised some night and mrs seagrave and the dear children perhaps murdered in their beds is awful to reflect upon god help us exclaimed mr seagrave covering up his face god will help us mr seagrave but at the same time it is necessary that we should help ourselves he will give his blessing to our exertions but we cannot expect that miracles will be performed for us and if we remain as we now are inactive and taking no steps to meet the danger which threatens us we cannot expect the divine assistance we have had a heavy shock but it is now time that we recover from it and put our own shoulders to the wheel i agree with you ready replied william indeed i have been thinking the same thing for many days past we have all been thinking of it i believe said mr seagrave i'm sure i have lain awake night after night considering our position and what we ought to do but i have never been able to come to any satisfactory resolution no more have i till last night mr seagrave but i think that i have now something to propose which perhaps will meet with your approval replied ready so now sir suppose we hold another council and come to a decision i am most willing ready said mr seagrave sitting down upon a rock and as you are the oldest and moreover the best adviser of the three we will first hear what you have to propose well then mr seagrave it appears to me that it will not do to remain in the house for we may as i have said be surprised by the savages at any hour in the night and we have no means of defence against numbers i feel that and have felt it for some time replied mr seagrave what shall we do then shall we return to the cove i should think not sir said ready what i propose is this we have made a discovery on the south of the island which is of great importance to us not that i consider the fruit and other plants of any great value as they will only serve to increase our luxuries if i may so call them during the summer season one great advantage to us is the feed which we have found for our live stock and the fodder for them during the rainy season but principally the patch of yams which will afford us food during the winter they are of great importance to us and we cannot too soon protect them from the pigs which will certainly root them all up if we do not prevent them now sir you know what we had arranged to do but which we have not done i think the cocoa nut rails will take too much time and it will be sufficient to make a ditch and hedge round the yams but it will be very tedious if we are to go backwards and forwards to do the work and mrs seagrave and the children will be left alone i therefore propose as the weather is now set in fair and will remain so for months that we pitch our tents on that part of the island and remove the whole family there we shall soon be very comfortable and at all events much safer there than if we remain here without any defence it is an excellent plan ready we shall as you say be removed from danger for the time and when there we may consider what we had best do by and by yes sir those women may not have gained the other island it is true for they had the wind right against them for several days after they went away in the canoe and moreover the current sets strong this way but if they have we must expect that the savages will pay us a visit they will of course come direct to the house if they do come but ready you don't mean to say that we are to leave this side of the island altogether and all our comfortable arrangements said william no william not altogether for now i come to the second part of my proposition as soon as we have done our work at the yam plantation and made everything as comfortable there as we can i think we may then leave mrs seagrave and the children in the tents and work here as we before agreed let us abandon the house in which we live at present and fit out the outhouse which is concealed in the cocoa nut grove as a dwelling house and fortify it so as to be secure against any sudden attack of the savages for return here we must to live as we cannot remain in the tents after the rainy season sets in how do you propose to fortify it ready said mr seagrave i hardly know that i will explain to you by and by sir then if the savages come here at all events we should be able to defend ourselves with fire arms one man behind a stockade is better than twenty who have no other arms but spears and clubs and we may with the help of god beat them off i think your plan is excellent ready said mr seagrave and that the sooner we begin the better that there is no doubt of sir now the first job is for william and me to try for the passage through this side of the reef with the boat and then we will look for the little harbour which we discovered as soon as that is done we will return and take the tents and all we require round in the boat and when we have pitched the tents and all is arranged mrs seagrave and the children can walk through the wood with us and take possession let us not lose an hour ready we have lost too much time already replied mr seagrave what shall we do to day after breakfast william and i will take the boat and try for the passage you can remain here packing up the tents and such articles as must first be carried round we shall be back i hope by dinner time they then rose and walked towards the house all felt relieved in their minds after they had made this arrangement satisfied that they would be using all human endeavours to ward off the danger which threatened them and might then put their confidence in that providence who would if he thought fit protect them in their need chapter forty six the subject was introduced to mrs seagrave while they were at breakfast and as she perceived how much more secure they would be she cheerfully consented in less than an hour afterwards william and ready had prepared the boat and were pulling out among the rocks of the reef to find a passage which after a short time and by keeping two or three cables from the point they succeeded in doing this is very fortunate william observed ready but we must now take some marks to find our way in again see the large black rock is on a line with the garden point so if we keep them in one we shall know that we are in the proper channel and now for a mark abreast of us to find out when we enter it why ready the corner of the turtle pond just touches the right wall of the house replied william so it does that will do and now let us pull away as hard as we can so as to be back in good time they soon were on the south side of the island and pulling up along the shore how far do you think that it is by water ready i hardly know but at least four or five miles so we must make up our minds to a good hour's pull at all events we shall sail back again with this wind although there is but little of it we are in very deep water now observed william after a long silence yes on this side of the island we must expect it the coral grows to leeward only i think that we cannot be very far from the little harbour we discovered suppose we leave off rowing for a minute and look about us there are two rocks close to the shore ready said william pointing and you recollect there were two or three rocks outside of the harbour very true william and i should not wonder if you have hit upon the very spot let us pull in they did so and to their satisfaction found that they were in the harbour where the water was as smooth as a pond now then william we will step the mast and sail back at our leisure stop one moment ready give me the boat hook i see something between the clefts of the rocks ready handed the boat hook to william who lowering it down into the water drove the spike of iron at the end of it into a large crayfish which he hauled up into the boat that will be an addition to our dinner said ready we do not go back empty handed and therefore as the saying is we shall be more welcome now then let us start for we must pull here again this afternoon and with a full cargo on board they stepped the mast and as soon as they had pulled the boat clear of the harbour set sail and in less than an hour had rejoined the party at the house william had brought up the crayfish which had only one claw and juno put on another pot of water to boil it as an addition to the dinner which was nearly ready tommy at first went with his sister caroline to look at the animal and as soon as he had left off admiring it he began as usual to tease it first he poked its eyes with a stick then he tried to unfold his tail but the animal flapped and he ran away at last he was trying to put his stick into the creature's mouth when it raised its large claw and caught him by the wrist squeezing him so tight that tommy screamed and danced about as the crayfish held on fortunately for him the animal had been so long out of water and had been so much hurt by the iron spike of the boat hook that it was more than half dead or he would have been severely hurt ready ran to him and disengaged the crayfish but tommy was so frightened that he took to his heels and did not leave off running until he was one hundred yards from the house while juno and ready were laughing at him till the tears came into their eyes when he saw the crayfish on the table he appeared to be afraid of it although it was dead well tommy said mr seagrave i suppose you won't eat any of the crayfish won't i replied tommy i'll eat him for he tried to eat me why did you not leave the animal alone tommy said mr seagrave if you had not tormented it it would not have bitten you i don't know whether you ought to have any i don't like it i won't have any replied tommy i like salt pork better well then if you don't like it you shall not have it forced upon you tommy replied mr seagrave so now we'll divide it among the rest of us tommy was not very well pleased at this decision for he really did wish to have some of it so he turned very sulky for the rest of the dinner time especially when old ready told him that he had had his share of the crayfish before dinner chapter forty seven as soon as the meal was over mr seagrave and juno assisted them in carrying down the canvas and poles for the tent with shovels to clear away and the pegs to fix the tents up properly before they started william observed i think it would be a good thing if ready and i were to take our bedding with us and then we could fix up one tent this evening and sleep there to morrow morning we might set up the other and get a good deal of work over before we come back you are right william replied ready let us see what juno can give us to eat and then we will do as you say for the sooner we are all there the better as mr seagrave was of the same opinion juno packed up a piece of salt pork and some flour cakes which with three or four bottles of water they took down to the boat ready having thrown in a piece of rope to moor the boat with they shoved off and were soon through the reef and after a smart pull they arrived again at the small harbour as soon as they had landed all the things they made the boat fast by the rope and then carried a portion of the canvas and tent poles up to the first copse of trees which were the guavas they then returned for the remainder and after three trips everything was up now william we must see where to pitch the tent we must not be too near the cocoa nut grove or we shall have too far to go for water don't you think that the best place will be close to the bananas the ground is higher there and the water is you know between the bananas and the yams very true i think it will not be a bad place let us walk there first and reconnoitre the ground they walked to where the bananas were now throwing out their beautiful large green leaves and decided that they would fix the tents upon the north side of them so here let it be said ready and now let us go and fetch all the things it is a nice dry spot and i think will do capitally they were soon hard at work and long before sunset one tent was ready and they had put their bedding in it well now i suppose you are a little tired said ready i'm sure you ought to be for you have worked hard to day i don't feel very tired ready but it's not time to go to bed yet no and i think we had better take our shovels and dig the pits for the water and then we shall know by to morrow morning whether the water is good or not yes ready we can do that before we get our supper they walked to where the ground between the bananas and yam patch was wet and swampy and dug two large holes about a yard deep and square the water trickled in very fast and they were up to their ankles before they had finished there'll be no want of water ready if it is only fit to drink i've no fear of that replied ready they returned to the tent and made their supper off the salt pork and flour cakes and then lay down on the mattresses they were soon fast asleep for they were tired out with the hard work which they had gone through the next morning at sunrise they were up again the first thing they did was to go and examine the holes they had dug for water they found them full and running over and the water had settled quite clear they tasted it and pronounced it very good as soon as they had washed themselves they went back and made their breakfast and then set to work to get up the other tent they then cleared all the ground near the tents of brushwood and high grass and levelled it nicely with their shovels inside now william we have another job which is to prepare a fireplace for juno we must go down to the beach for stones in another hour the fireplace was completed and ready and william looked at their work well i call this a very comfortable lodging house said ready and i am sure replied william it's very pretty mamma will be delighted with it we shall have no want of bananas in a few weeks said ready look they are all in blossom already well now i suppose we had better leave everything here and go back we must have another trip this afternoon and sleep here to night they went down to the boat and sailed back as before by ten o'clock in the morning they had regained the house and then they made arrangements for their work during the remainder of the day it was agreed that the provisions necessary for a day or two the table and chairs the cooking utensils and a portion of their clothes should be taken round that afternoon that ready and william should come back early the next morning and then they should all set off together through the wood to the new location the sheep and lambs for they had four lambs the goats and kids were to be driven through the wood by mr seagrave william and ready and the dogs would be very useful in driving them as for the fowls and chickens it was decided they should be left as ready and william could look after them on their occasional visits chapter forty eight the boat was well loaded that afternoon and they had a heavy pull round and hard work afterwards to carry all the articles up william and ready were therefore not sorry when their work was done and they went to bed as soon as they had taken their supper at sunrise they went back to the bay in the boat which they hauled up and then proceeded to the house where they found that everyone was ready to start mr seagrave had collected all the animals and they set off the marks on the trees were very plain and they had no difficulty in finding their way but they had a good deal of trouble with the goats and sheep and did not get on very fast it was three hours before they got clear of the cocoa nut grove and mrs seagrave was quite tired out at last they arrived and mr and mrs seagrave could not help exclaiming how beautiful when they came to where the tents were pitched by the side of the bananas they were equally pleased it was quite a fairy spot mrs seagrave went into her tent to repose after her fatigue the goats and sheep were allowed to stray away as they pleased the dogs lay down panting with their long journey juno put albert on the bed while she went with william to collect fuel to cook the dinner ready went to the pits to get some water while mr seagrave walked about examining the different clumps of trees with which the meadow was studded when ready returned with the water he called the dogs and went back towards the yam plantation tommy followed them the dogs went into the yams and were soon barking furiously which pleased tommy very much when of a sudden out burst again in a drove all the pigs followed by the dogs and so close to tommy that he screamed with fright and tumbled head over heels i thought you were there my gentlemen said ready looking after the pigs the sooner we fence you out the better the pigs scampered away and went into the cocoa nut grove as they had done before the dogs followed the pigs and did not return for a long while afterwards it was late before the dinner was ready and they were all very glad to go early to bed at day dawn william and ready had again started and walked through the cocoa nut grove back to the house to bring round in the boat the articles of furniture and the clothes which had been left having collected everything in the house and procured some more pork and flour from the storehouse they completed the load by spearing one of the turtles which remained and putting it into the bottom of the boat they then set off again for their new residence and arrived in time for breakfast what a delightful spot this is said mrs seagrave i think we ought always to make it our summer residence and only go back to the house during the rainy season it is much cooler here madam during the summer and much more pleasant but we are more protected in the house by the cocoa nut grove yes that is true and it is very valuable during the rainy season but it makes it warmer in the summer time i like the change ready and shall be sorry when we have to go back again now i must go and help juno to cut up the turtle said ready we must make our larder among the banana trees but what are we all to do ready said mr seagrave we must not be idle no sir but i think we must give up this day to putting everything to rights and making everything comfortable inside the tents to morrow we will commence the ditch and hedge round the yam plantation we need not work very hard at it for i don't think the pigs will venture here again as i mean to tie up all the dogs round the yam patch every night and their barking will keep them off that will be a very good plan ready what beautiful food there is for the sheep and goats yes this must be their future residence for the best part of the year i think to morrow we will begin a piece of the ditch and show william how to put in the cuttings of prickly pear for the hedge and then i should propose that you and i go to the cove to examine the stores and select what it will be necessary to bring round i think you said that you must go yourself yes ready i wish to go when we have made our selection i will return and then you and william who is more used to the boat than i am can bring the stores round i presume we shall not bring them here no sir we will take them round to the storehouse when we have done that job we must then commence our alterations and our stockade chapter forty nine the next morning they went with their shovels to the yam plantation and commenced their work as the ground was soft and swampy the labour was very easy the ditch was dug nearly a yard wide and the earth thrown up on a bank inside they then went to where the large patch of prickly pears grew and cut a quantity which they planted on the top of the bank before night they had finished about nine or ten yards of the hedge and ditch i don't think that the pigs will get over that when it is finished said ready and william will be able to get on by himself when we are gone as well as if we were with him i'll try if i cannot shoot a pig or two said william let it be a young one then we must not kill the old ones now i think we may as well go back juno is carrying in the supper before mr seagrave and ready started on the following morning the latter gave william directions as to the boat the provisions and the knapsack having been already prepared they took leave of mrs seagrave and set off each armed with a musket and ready with his axe slung over his shoulder they had a long walk before them as they had first to find their way back to the house and from thence had to walk through the wood to the cove in two hours after leaving the house they reached the spot where they had first landed the rocks near to it were strewed with timber and planks which lay bleaching in the sun or half buried in the sand mr seagrave sat down and sighed deeply as he said ready the sight of these timbers of which the good ship pacific was built recalls feelings which i had hoped to have dismissed from my mind but i cannot help them rising up the remains of this vessel appear to me as the last link between us and the civilised world which we have been torn from and all my thoughts of home and country and i may say all my longing for them are revived as strong as ever and very natural that they should mr seagrave i feel it also i am content it is true because i have nothing to wish or look forward to but still i could not help thinking of poor captain osborn and my shipmates as i looked upon the wreck and wishing that i might take them by the hand again it is very natural that one should do so why sir do you know that i feel unhappy even about the poor ship we sailors love our vessels especially when they have good qualities and the pacific was as fine a vessel as ever was built now sir i feel quite melancholy when i see her planks and timbers lying about here but sir if we cannot help feeling as we do it is our duty to check the feeling so that it does not get the mastery over us we can do no more very true ready said mr seagrave rising up it is not only useless but even sinful to indulge in them as they only can lead to our repining at the decrees of heaven let us now examine the rocks and see if anything has been thrown up that may be of use to us they walked round but with the exception of spars and a barrel or two of tar they could find nothing of value there was no want of staves and iron hoops of broken casks and these ready observed would make excellent palings for the garden when they had time to bring them round after they had returned they sat down to rest themselves and then they went to the tents in the cocoa nut grove in which they had collected the articles thrown up when the ship went to pieces why the pigs have been at work here said ready they have contrived to open one cask of flour somehow or another look sir i suppose it must have been shaky or they could not have routed into it the canvas is not good for much i fear fortunately we have several bolts of new which i brought on shore now sir we will see what condition the stores are in all these are casks of flour and we run no risk in opening them and seeing if they are in good order the first cask which was opened had a cake round it as hard as a board but when it was cut through with the axe the inside was found in a good state that's all right sir and i presume the others will be the same the salt water has got in so far and made a crust which has preserved the rest but now let us go to dinner and to work afterwards chapter fifty after dinner they resumed their labour i wonder what's in this case said mr seagrave pointing to the first at hand ready set to work with his axe and broke off the lid and found a number of pasteboard boxes full of tapes narrow ribbons stay laces whalebones and cottons on reels this has been sent out for some botany bay milliner said mr seagrave i presume however we must confiscate it for the benefit of mrs seagrave and miss caroline we will take them to them as soon as we have time the next was a box without a lock the lid was forced up and they found a dozen half gallon square bottles of gin stored in divisions that's hollands sir i know said ready what shall we do with it we will not destroy it ready but at the same time we will not use it but as a medicine replied mr seagrave we have been so long used to spring water that it would be a pity to renew a taste for spirituous liquors i trust we shall never want to drink a drop of it sir either as a medicine or otherwise now for this cask with wooden hoops the head was soon out and discovered a dinner set of painted china with gold edges this mr seagrave may be useful for we are rather short of plates and dishes common white would have served as well and be more suitable with our present outfit replied mr seagrave here's a box with your name on it sir said ready do you know what is in it i have no idea ready but your axe will decide the point when the box was opened everything appeared in a sad mouldy state from the salt water which had penetrated but on removing the brown paper and pasteboard it was found to contain stationery of all sorts and except on the outside it was very little injured this is indeed a treasure ready i recollect now this is paper pens and everything requisite for writing besides children's books copy books paint boxes and a great many other articles in the stationery line well sir that is fortunate now we may set up our school and as the whole population of the island will attend it it will really be a national school very true ready now for that cask i can tell what that is by the outside it is oil and very acceptable for our candles are nearly out now we come to the most valuable of all our property what is that ready all the articles which i brought on shore in the different trips i took in the boat before the ship went to pieces for you see sir iron don't swim and therefore what i looked after most was ironware of all sorts and tools here are three kegs of small nails besides two bags of large and there are several axes hammers and other tools besides hanks of twine sailing needles and bees' wax they are indeed valuable ready here's some more of my plunder as the americans say all these are wash deck buckets this a small harness cask for salting meat and here's the cook's wooden trough for making bread which will please miss juno and in it you see i have put all the galley hooks ladles and spoons and the iron trivets and here's two lamps i think i put some cotton wicks somewhere i know i did we shall find them by and by here's the two casks one of cartridges made up and the other of gunpowder and the other six muskets these are really treasures ready and yet how well we have done without them very true sir but we shall do better with them and when we fit up the storehouse for a dwelling mr seagrave we shall be able to make it a little more comfortable in every respect than the present one for you see there all the fir planking and deals which william and i buried in the sand i really had quite forgotten them ready if i could but get the fear of the savages coming over out of my head i really think we might live very comfortably even on this island do you know mr seagrave i am glad to hear you say that for it proves that you are more contented and resigned than you were i am so ready at least i think so but perhaps it is that the immediate danger from the savages so fills my thoughts that i no longer dwell so much upon our being taken off the island i dare say it is as you state sir but now let us go on with our search here are the ship's compasses and deep sea line and reel also the land lead the stuff will be very useful for our little boat and i am very glad of the compasses ready for with them i shall be able to make a sort of survey of the island when i have a little time your pocket compass is too small for surveying i shall take some bearings now while i am here as i may not be back again very soon well sir i think if we open this other case which i perceive has your name on it it will be as much as we need do to day for the sun is going down we can then make up some kind of bed eat our suppers and go to sleep i am very tired ready and shall be glad to do as you propose that case contains books but what portion of my library i do not know but you soon will sir replied ready wrenching it open with his axe they are a little stained on the outside but they are jammed so tight that they do not appear to have suffered much here are one or two sir plutarch's lives i am glad i have them they are excellent reading for young or old there is no occasion to open any more as i know all the other books in the case are history' perhaps the best case which could have been saved chapter fifty one mr seagrave and ready then set to work and made a rough sort of bed of cocoa nut branches and after eating their supper committed themselves to the divine protection and went to sleep the next morning they resumed their labour and opened every other case and package that had been saved from the wreck they found more books four boxes of candles three casks of rice and several other useful articles besides many others which were of no value to them a chest of tea and two bags of coffee which ready had brought on shore were much to their delight found in good order but there was no sugar the little which they had saved having been melted away that's unfortunate sir we cannot expect to get things here as though we were a hundred yards from a grocer's shop now let us go to where we covered up the other articles with sand the sand was shovelled up and the barrels of beef and pork and the deal boards found in good order but many other things were quite spoilt about noon they had finished and as they had plenty of time mr seagrave took the bearings of the different points of land with the compasses they then shouldered their muskets and set off on their return they gained the house in the bay and having rested a little while at the storehouse they proceeded on their way to the tents in the meadow they had about half a mile to go when ready heard a noise and made a sign to mr seagrave to stop ready whispering to mr seagrave that the pigs were all close to them loaded his musket mr seagrave did the same and they walked very softly to where they now heard their grunting they did not see them till they were within twenty yards and then they came upon the whole herd the pigs raised their heads the old ones gave a loud grunt and then just as ready fired his musket they all set off at full speed mr seagrave had no opportunity of firing but ready had shot one which lay kicking and struggling under a cocoa nut tree a piece of fresh pork will be quite a treat mr seagrave said ready as they walked up to where the animal was lying it will indeed ready replied mr seagrave we must contrive to carry the beast home between us we will sling it on the musket sir and it will not be very heavy it is one of those born on the island and a very fine fellow for his age the pig was soon slung and they carried it between them as they cleared the wood they perceived mrs seagrave and william who had heard the report of the musket and had come out to meet them william took the load from his father who walked on with mrs seagrave well william what news have you said ready why very good ready yesterday evening when i was tired of work i thought i would take the boat and try if there was any fish to be caught on this side of the island in the deep water and i caught three large ones quite different from those we took among the reefs we had one for breakfast and dinner to day and it was excellent did you go out in the boat by yourself no i took juno with me she pulls very well ready she is a handy girl william well we have had our survey and there will be plenty of work for you and me i can tell you i don't think we can bring everything round in a week so i suppose to morrow we had better be off well i like boating better than ditching i can tell you ready replied william i shan't be sorry to leave that work to my father i suppose it must fall to him as he will of course prefer staying with mrs seagrave and the children as soon as they were at the tents ready hung up the pig to the cross pole of the tent in which he and william and mr seagrave slept and having propped the muskets up against the side of the tent he went with william to get his knife and some stretchers of wood to open the pig with while he and william were away caroline and tommy came out to look at it and tommy after telling caroline how glad he was that they were to have roast pig for dinner took up one of the muskets and said now caroline i'll shoot the pig oh tommy you must not touch the gun cried caroline papa will be very angry i don't care replied tommy i'll show you how to shoot the pig don't tommy cried caroline if you do i'll go and tell mamma then i'll shoot you replied tommy trying to point the musket at her caroline was so frightened that she ran away as fast as she could and then tommy using all his strength contrived to get the musket up to his shoulder and pulled the trigger it so happened that tommy had taken up mr seagrave's musket which had not been fired and when he pulled the trigger it went off and as he did not hold it tight to his shoulder it recoiled and hit him with the butt right on his face knocking out two of his teeth besides making his nose bleed very fast tommy was so astonished and frightened at the musket going off and the blow which he received that he gave a loud yell dropped the musket and ran to the tent where his father and mother were just as they had started up and had rushed out at hearing the report when mrs seagrave saw tommy all covered with blood and screaming so loud she was so alarmed that she could not stand and fell fainting in mr seagrave's arms ready and william on hearing the musket go off had run as fast as they could fearing that some accident had happened and while mr seagrave supported his wife ready went to tommy and wiping the blood off his face with the palm of his hand perceived that there was no wound or serious mischief and cried out to mr seagrave he's not hurt sir it's only his nose bleeding musket knocked me down cried tommy sobbing as the blood ran out of his mouth serve you right tommy you'll take care not to touch the musket again i won't touch it again cried tommy blubbering juno now came up with some water to wash his face mrs seagrave had recovered and gone back into the tent on mr seagrave telling her that it was only tommy's nose which was bleeding in about half an hour tommy had ceased crying and his nose had left off bleeding his face was washed and then it was discovered that he had lost two front teeth and that his cheek and lips were very much bruised he was undressed and put to bed and was soon fast asleep i should not have left the muskets said ready to william it was my fault but i thought tommy had been told so often not to touch fire arms that he would not dare to do so he pointed it at me and tried to shoot me said caroline but i ran away merciful heavens what an escape cried mrs seagrave he has been well punished this time madam and i'll venture to say he will not touch a musket again in a hurry yes but he must be punished more said mr seagrave he must remember it well sir if he is to be punished more i think you cannot punish him better than by not allowing him to have any of the pig when it is cooked i think so too ready and therefore that is a settled thing no pig for tommy chapter fifty two the next morning tommy's face presented a very woeful appearance his cheek and lips were swelled and black and the loss of his two front teeth made him look much worse tommy looked very glum when he came to breakfast there was the pig's fry for breakfast and the smell of it had been very inviting to tommy but when his father scolded him and told him that he was not to have one bit of the pig he began to cry and roar so loud that he was sent away from the tents till he had left off after breakfast ready proposed that he and william should take the boat and begin their labour of carrying the articles round from the cove to the bay where the house was pointing out that there was not a day to be lost juno had at his request already baked a large piece of the pig for them to take with them and boiled a piece of salt pork so that they were all ready to start but ready said mrs seagrave how long do you intend to remain absent with william why madam this is wednesday of course we shall be back on saturday night my dear william i cannot bear the idea of your being absent so long and as you will be on the water every day i shall be in a continual fright until i see you again well mamma i suppose i must write by the penny post to let you know how i am don't laugh at me william i do wish there was a penny post and that you could write every day ready and william made every preparation for a continued absence they took their blankets with them and a small pot for cooking and when all was prepared they bade mr and mrs seagrave farewell they were now to pull to the bay and leave their luggage and then go round to the cove as they shoved off william took the dog remus into the boat why do you take the dog william he will be of use here in keeping the pigs away but of no use to us yes he will ready i must take him for i have an idea come into my head so let me have my own way well william you can always have your own way as far as i'm concerned if you wish to take the dog there is an end of the matter they hoisted the sail and as the breeze was fresh were round to the bay in a very short time they took their provisions and stores up to the house and made fast the door called the fowls and gave them some damaged rice which ready had brought from the cove and found to their great delight that they had now upwards of forty chickens some indeed quite grown and large enough to kill they then got into the boat again and pulled away for the cove the wind was fresh and against them so they had a long pull but as ready observed it was much better that it should be so as when the boat was loaded they could very quickly sail back again to the bay as soon as they arrived at the cove they lost no time in loading the boat the nails and iron work of every description with the twine and tools composed the major part of the first cargo and calling remus who was lying on the sandy beach they shoved off hoisted their sail and in an hour had regained the bay and passed through the reef i am glad that this cargo has arrived safe william for it is very valuable to us now we will take them all up and that will be sufficient for to day to morrow if we can we will make two trips we can if we start early replied william but now let us have our dinner and carry the remainder of the things up afterwards as they were eating their dinner and william was giving the bones to the dog ready said pray william what was the idea in your head which made you bring remus with you i will tell you ready i mean him to carry a letter to mamma you know that he always goes back when he is ordered and now i wish to see if he will not go back to the tents if he is told i have brought a piece of paper and pencil with me william then wrote on the paper dear mamma we are quite well and just returned with the first cargo quite safe your affectionate son william william tied the paper round the dog's neck with a piece of twine and then calling him out of the house said to him remus go back sir go back sir the dog looked wistfully at william as if not sure of what he was to do but william took up a stone and pretended to throw it at the dog who ran away a little distance and then stopped go back remus go back sir william again pretended to throw the stone repeating the order and then the dog set off as fast as his legs could carry him through the cocoa nut grove he is gone at all events said william i think he will go home we shall see sir replied ready and now that we have finished our dinner we will bring up the things and put them in the storehouse chapter fifty three as soon as they had carried up the whole of the cargo they secured the boat and went up to the house to sleep just as they went in remus came bounding up to them with a letter round his neck here's the dog william said ready he won't go home after all how provoking i made sure he would go back i really am disappointed we will give him nothing to eat and then he will but dear me ready this is not the paper i tied round his neck i think not let me see william took the paper opened it and read dear william your letter arrived safe and we are glad you are well write every day and god bless you it was very clever of you and remus your affectionate mother selina seagrave well it is clever said ready i'm sure i had no idea he had gone and his coming back again too when he was ordered dear remus good dog said william caressing it now i'll give you a good supper for you deserve it so he does sir well you've established a post on the island which is a great improvement seriously william it may prove very useful at all events it will be a great comfort to my mother yes especially as we shall be obliged all three to be here when we fit up the storehouse and make the proposed alterations now i think we had better go to bed for we must be up with the lark to morrow here i suppose we ought to say up with the parrots for they are the only land birds on the island you forget the pigeons i saw one of them in the wood the other day good night the next morning they were off before breakfast the boat was soon loaded and they returned under sail they then breakfasted and having left the things they had brought on the beach that they might lose no time they set off again and returned with another cargo two hours before dusk this they landed and then secured the boat as soon as they were in the house william wrote on a piece of paper dear mamma we have brought round two cargoes to day all well and very tired yours william remus did not require any teaching this time william patted him and said good dog now remus go back go home sir and the dog wagged his tail and set off immediately before they were in bed the dog returned with the answer how fast he must run ready he has not been away more than two hours no so now remus you shall have plenty of supper and plenty of patting and coaxing for you are a clever good little dog the next day as they had to take the two cargoes up to the house they could only make one trip to the cove on saturday they only made one trip as they had to return to the tents which they did by water having first put a turtle into the boat on their arrival they found them all at the little harbour waiting to receive them well william you did keep your promise and send me a letter by post said mrs seagrave how very delightful it is i shall have no fear now when you are all away i must teach romulus and vixen to do the same mamma and i'll teach the puppies said tommy yes tommy by the time you can write a letter the puppies will be old enough to carry it said ready come albert i'll carry you up you and i haven't had a game of play for a long while how does the ditch and hedge get on mr seagrave pretty well ready replied mr seagrave i have nearly finished two sides i think by the end of next week i shall have pretty well inclosed it well sir you must not work too hard there is no great hurry william and i can get through a great deal together it is my duty to work ready and i may add it is a pleasure as they were at supper the conversation turned upon the cleverness shown by the dog remus mr seagrave narrated many instances of the sagacity of animals when william asked the question of his father what is the difference then between reason and instinct the difference is very great william as i will explain to you but i must first observe that it has been the custom to say that man is governed by reason and animals by instinct alone this is an error man has instinct as well as reason and animals although chiefly governed by instinct have reasoning powers in what points does man show that he is led by instinct when a child is first born william it acts by instinct only the reasoning powers are not yet developed as we grow up our reason becomes every day more matured and gains the mastery over our instinct which decreases in proportion then when we have grown to a good old age i suppose we have no instinct left in us not so my dear boy there is one and a most powerful instinct implanted in man which never deserts him on this side of the grave it is the fear not of death but of utter annihilation that of becoming nothing after death this instinctive feeling could not have been so deeply implanted in us but as an assurance that we shall not be annihilated after death but that our souls shall still exist although our bodies shall have perished it may be termed the instinctive evidence of a future existence that is very true mr seagrave observed ready instinct in animals william continued mr seagrave is a feeling which compels them to perform certain acts without previous thought or reflection this instinct is in full force at the moment of their birth it was therefore perfect in the beginning and has never varied the swallow built her nest the spider its web the bee formed its comb precisely in the same way four thousand years ago as they do now i may here observe that one of the greatest wonders of instinct is the mathematical form of the honeycomb of the bee which has been proved by demonstration to be that by which is given the greatest possible saving of time and labour but that is all pure instinct papa now you said that animals had reasoning powers will you point out to me how they show that they have i will my dear boy but we had better defer it till another evening it is now time to go to bed chapter fifty four the following day being sunday was devoted to the usual religious exercises tommy stole away out of the tent while mr seagrave was reading a sermon to have a peep at the turtle soup which was boiling on the fire however juno suspected him and had hold of him just as he was taking the lid off the pot he was well scolded and very much frightened lest he should have no soup for his dinner however as it was not a very heavy offence he was forgiven in the evening william requested his father to renew the conversation about the reasoning powers of animals with pleasure william replied mr seagrave it is a fit discourse for a sunday evening let us however first examine the various mental faculties discoverable in animals in the first place they have memory especially memory of persons and places quite as tenacious as our own a dog will recognise an old master after many years absence an elephant who had again escaped into the woods after twenty years remaining in a wild state recognised his old mahoot or driver a dog will find his way back when taken more than a hundred miles from his master's residence another proof of memory in animals were it required is that they dream now a dream is a confused recollection of past events and how often do you not hear romulus and remus growling barking and whining in their sleep very true papa well then they have attention see how patiently a cat will remain for hours before a hole in watch for the mouse to come out a spider will remain for months watching for the fly to enter its web but this quality is to be observed in every animal in the pursuit of its prey they have also association of ideas which is in fact reasoning a dog proves that he will allow a gentleman to come up to the door but fly at a beggar when he is in charge of any property he will take no notice of a passer by but if a man stops he barks immediately in the elephant this association of ideas is even more remarkable indeed he understands what is said to him better than any other animal his reasoning powers are most extraordinary promise him rewards and he will make wonderful exertion he is also extremely alive to a sense of shame the elephants were employed to transport the heavy artillery in india one of the finest attempted in vain to force a gun through a swamp take away that lazy beast' said the director and bring another' the animal was so stung with the reproach that it used so much exertion to force the gun on with its head as to fracture its skull and it fell dead when chunee the elephant which was so long in exeter change was ordered as usual to take up a sixpence with his trunk it happened one day that the sixpence rolled against the skirting board out of his reach chunee stopped and reflected a little while and then drawing the air into his trunk he threw it out with all his force against the skirting board the rebound of the air from the skirting board blew the sixpence towards him and he was enabled to reach it that was very clever of him replied william yes it was a proof of thought with a knowledge of cause and effect there was a curious instance of a horse which by the bye i consider the most noble animal of creation which was ridden round by his master to deliver newspapers he invariably stopped at the doors where papers were to be left but it happened that two people living at different houses took in a weekly newspaper between them and it was agreed that one should have the first reading of it on one week and the other on the following after a short time the horse became accustomed to this arrangement and stopped at the one house on the one week and at the other house on the following never making a mistake that was very curious what a sagacious animal he must have been observed william animals also are as you know capable of receiving instruction which is another proof of reasoning powers the elephant the horse the dog the pig even birds may be taught a great deal but then papa i still wish to know where the line is to be drawn between reason and instinct i was about to come to that very point william when animals follow their instinct in providing their food bringing up their young and in their precautions against danger they follow certain fixed rules from which they never deviate but circumstances may occur against which their instinct can afford them no regular provision then it is that their reasoning powers are called into action i will explain this by stating a fact relative to the bee one of the animals upon which instinct is most powerful in its action there is a certain large moth called the death's head moth which is very fond of honey it sometimes contrives to force its way through the aperture of the hive and gain an entrance the bees immediately attack it and it is soon destroyed by their stings but the carcass is so large that they cannot carry it out of the hive as they invariably do the bodies of the smaller insects which may have intruded and it appears that their sense of smell is very acute what then do they do to avoid the stench arising from the dead body of this large moth why they embalm it covering it entirely with wax by which it no longer becomes offensive to them but papa might not their instinct have provided for such an event observed william if such an event could have occurred to the bees in their wild state you certainly might have raised the question but recollect william that bees in their wild state live in the hollows of trees and that the hole by which they enter is never more than sufficiently large to admit one bee at a time consequently no animal larger than a bee could gain entrance and if it did could of course have been easily removed from the hive but the bees were here in a new position in an artificial state in a hive of straw with a large aperture and therefore met with an exigence they were not prepared for and acted accordingly yes papa i perceive the difference i will conclude my observations with one remark it appears to me that although the almighty has thought proper to vary the intellectual and the reasoning powers of animals in the same way that he has varied the species and the forms yet even in this arrangement he has not been unmindful of the interest and welfare of man for you will observe that the reasoning powers are chiefly if not wholly given to those animals which man subjects to his service and for his use the elephant the horse and the dog thereby making these animals of more value as the powers given to them are at the service and under the control of man chapter fifty five on the monday morning william and ready went away in the boat as before to bring round the various articles from the cove it had been arranged that they were not to return till the saturday evening and that the dog remus was to bring intelligence of them and their welfare every afternoon they worked hard during the week and on saturday they had completed their task with the exception of a portion of the timbers of the ship everything had been brought round but had not been carried up to the storehouse as that required more time on saturday morning they went for the last time to the cove and ready selected some heavy oak timber out of the quantity which was lying on the beach part of which they put into the boat and the remainder they towed astern it was a heavy load and although the wind was fair to sail back again to the bay the boat went but slowly through the water well william said ready we have done a good week's work and i must say it is high time that it is done for the boat is in rather a crazy condition and i must contrive to patch her up by and by when there is time we shall not want to use her very much after this ready replied william a few trips round to the little harbour will be all that will be required before we come back again to our old quarters that's true william but she leaks very much and at all events i'll give her a coat of pitch as soon as possible for a slight built little thing as she is she has done hard duty pray ready why when you speak of a ship or boat do you always call it she well william i don't know why but it is certain that we sailors always do so i believe it is because a sailor loves his ship his ship is his wife is a very common saying with us and then you see master william a vessel is almost a thing of life in appearance i believe that's the reason and of course if a vessel is she a little boat must be a she also well i think you have explained it very well ready i suppose on monday we shall set to at the storehouse and alter it for our future residence can't begin too soon william replied ready i don't doubt but mr seagrave has finished the hedge and ditch round the yams by this time and if so i expect madam will not like to be left in the tents alone with juno and the children and so we shall all move back to the house again until we have altered the storehouse i must say that i would rather your mamma remained in the tents until all was finished because you are afraid of a visit from the savages ready i am sir and that's the truth but ready if they do come we shall see them coming and would it not be better that we should all be together even if we are obliged to conceal ourselves in consequence of not being prepared suppose the savages were to overrun the island and find my mother my little brother and sister defenceless at the time we were obliged to retreat from our house how dreadful that would be but i counted upon retreating to the tents so we can all together unless we are surprised in the night that we must take care not to be there's not three hours' dark in this season of the year well william i doubt not you may be right and if they are all with us juno will be a great help and we shall get through our work the faster we had better let the question be decided by my father and mother very true william here's the point at last we will haul the timber on the beach and then be off as fast as we can for it is getting late it was indeed much later than they had usually arrived at the little harbour owing to the heavy load which made the boat so long in coming round from the cove and when they pulled in they found mr and mrs seagrave and the children all waiting for them you are very late william said mrs seagrave i was quite uneasy till i saw the boat at a distance yes mamma but we could not help it we had a heavy load to bring round and now our work is done i am delighted to hear it william for i cannot bear you being away so long and my work is done said mr seagrave the hedge and ditch were finished this morning well then observed ready we must hold another council but i presume it will not take very long no i expect not it seldom does when people are of the same mind mrs seagrave won't be left here ready and i don't want to leave her so i presume on monday we all start home again yes sir if you please replied ready juno i hope you have a good supper said william for i'm very hungry yes massa william plenty fried fish massa catch 'em this morning chapter fifty six the next day being sunday was a day of repose and as they had all worked so hard they felt the luxury of a day of rest in the afternoon they agreed that on monday they should make every preparation for quitting the tents and returning to the house at the bay they decided that the live stock should all be left there as the pasturage was so plentiful and good with the exception of one goat which they would take back with them to supply them with milk and they also agreed that the tents should be left standing with some cooking utensils that in case william and ready went round for the bananas or yams or to examine the live stock they should not be compelled to sleep in the open air and should have the means of dressing their dinner william and ready were to carry the beds etcetera round to the bay in the boat which they could do in two trips and mr and mrs seagrave with the family were to walk through the woods after taking a very early breakfast all these points being arranged they had finished their supper when william again brought up the conversation about animals as he was delighted to bear mr seagrave talk on the subject the conversation had not commenced more than a few minutes when william said papa they always say as stupid as an ass' is an ass such a stupid animal no william it is a very sagacious one but the character has been given to the animal more on account of its obstinacy and untractableness than on any other account it is usual to say as stupid as an ass or as stupid as a pig or a goose now these three animals are very much maligned for they are all sagacious animals but the fact is that as regards the ass we have only very sorry specimens of the animal in england they are stunted and small and from want of corn and proper food besides being very ill treated are slow and dull looking animals the climate of england is much too cold for the ass in the south of france and the mediterranean where it is much warmer the ass is a much finer animal but to see it in perfection we must go to the torrid zone in guinea right on the equator the hottest portion of the globe where the ass in its native state and in its native country is a handsome creature and as fleet as the wind indeed supposed to be and mentioned in the scriptures as the fleetest animal in creation the fact is that in asia especially in palestine and syria asses were in great repute and used in preference to horses we must see an animal in its own climate to form a true estimate of its value does climate then make so great a difference said william of course it does not only with animals but with trees plants and even man until he is accustomed to the change with respect to animals there are some which can bear the different varieties of climate and even change of food the horse for instance although originally indigenous to arabia lives as well in the temperate and even in the frigid zones it may be said for they endure the hard winters of russia and north america so will domestic cattle such as cows sheep pigs etcetera it is a curious fact that during the winter in canada a large proportion of the food of cattle consists of fish fish papa cows eat fish yes my dear boy such is the fact it is a remarkable instance of a graminivorous or grass eating animal being changed for a time into a flesh eating or rather into fish eating animal but there are other animals which can live under any temperature as the wolf the fox the hare and rabbit it is a curious provision that the sheep and goats in the hottest climates throw off their warm covering of wool and retain little better than hair while removed to a cold climate they recover their warm covering immediately but a goat has no wool papa what are cashmere shawls made of william very true papa most animals have a certain increase of covering as they recede further from the warm climates to the cold ones wolves and foxes hares and rabbits change the colour of their skins to white when they get far north the little english stoat which is destroyed by the gamekeepers becomes the beautiful snow white ermine in russia and other cold countries well papa i think it a great advantage to man and a proof of the almighty's care of him and kindness to him in permitting all the animals most useful to him to be able to live in any country but i don't know whether i am wrong in saying so papa i cannot see why an animal like the wolf should not have been kept to his own climate like the lion and tiger and other ferocious animals you have started a question william which i am glad you have done rather than it should have remained on your mind and have puzzled you it is true that the shepherd might agree with you that the wolf is a nuisance equally true that the husbandman may exclaim what is the good of thistles and the various weeds which choke the soil but my dear boy if they are not which i think they are for the benefit of man at all events they are his doom for the first transgression cursed is the ground for thy sake thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and by the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread' was the almighty's sentence and it is only by labour that the husbandman can obtain his crops and by watchfulness that the shepherd can guard his flocks labour is in itself a benefit without exercise there would be no health and without health there would be no enjoyment i see now papa you have mentioned the animals which can live in all climates will you not tell us something about other animals there is but one remark to make william which is that animals indigenous to that is originally to be found in any one portion of the globe invariably are so fashioned as to be most fit for that country and have the food also most proper for them growing or to be obtained in that country take for instance the camel an animal fashioned expressly for the country to which he is indigenous and without whose aid all communication must have been stopped between asia and africa he is called the ship of the desert' for the desert is a sea of sand' his feet are so fashioned that he can traverse the sands with facility he can live upon the coarsest vegetable food and salt plants which are found there and he has the capacity of carrying water in a sort of secondary stomach for his own supply where no water is to be found here is an animal wonderfully made by the almighty for an express locality and for the convenience of man in that country for in england or elsewhere he would be of no value but it is late my dear william so we will first thank him for all his mercies and then to bed chapter fifty seven the next morning was one of bustle there was packing up and every preparation for departure juno was called here and called there and was obliged to ask little caroline to look after the kettle and call to her if it boiled over master tommy as usual was in every one's way and doing more harm than good in his attempts to assist at last ready to get rid of him sent him down with a large bundle to the beach tommy shouldered it with great importance but when he came back looking rather warm with the exertion and ready asked him to take down another he said he was too tired and sat down very quietly till breakfast time before which everything was ready mrs seagrave and juno packed up the breakfast and dinner things in a basket after breakfast was over and then mr and mrs seagrave and the family set off on their journey accompanied by the dogs through the cocoa nut grove william and ready lost no time in getting through their work the crockery kitchen utensils table and chairs were the first articles put into the boat the goat was then led down and they set off with a full load and arrived at the bay long before the party who were walking through the wood they landed the things on the beach and then shoved off again to bring round the bedding which was all that was left by three o'clock in the afternoon they had arrived at the bay with their second and last load and found that the other party had been there about an hour and mr seagrave and juno were very busy taking the articles up from the beach well william said ready this is our last trip for some time i expect and so much the better for our little boat must have something done to her as soon as i can find time yes indeed ready she has done her work well do you know i feel as if i were coming home now that we are back to the bay i really feel quite glad that we have left the tents i found the pigeons among the peas ready so we must pick them as soon as we can i think there were near twenty of them we shall have pigeon pies next year i expect if it pleases god that we live and do well replied ready who had his eyes fixed upon the sea before night everything was in its place again in the house and as comfortable as before and as they were very tired they went very early to bed having first arranged what they should do in the morning at daylight ready and william went down to the turtle pond and speared a turtle for now the time was coming on for turning the turtle again and the pond would soon be filled having cut it up and put a portion of it into the pot all ready for mrs seagrave as soon as breakfast was over they proceeded to the storehouse after a little consultation with mr seagrave ready marked out a square of cocoa nut trees surrounding the storehouse so as to leave a space within them of about twenty yards each side which they considered large enough for the inclosure these cocoa nut trees were to serve as the posts between which were to be fixed other cocoa nut trees cut down and about fourteen feet high so as to form a palisade or stockade which could not be climbed over and would protect them from any attack of the savages as soon as the line of trees had been marked out they set to work cutting down all the trees within the line and then outside to a distance of ten yards so as to give them room for their work ready cut out cross pieces to nail from tree to tree and now they found the advantage of having saved so many of the large spike nails without which they never could have made so good or so quick a job of it mr seagrave cut down trees william and juno sawed them off at a proper length with one of the cross cut saws and then carried them to ready they soon had more cut out than he could use and then they dragged away the tops and branches and piled them at a distance on the ground to use as winter fuel while mr seagrave helped ready in fixing up the palisades they worked very hard that day and were not sorry to go to bed ready however took an opportunity to speak to william i think said he that now we are here again it will be necessary to keep a sort of night watch in case of accident i shall not go to bed till it is quite dark which it will be by nine o'clock and shall have my glass to examine the offing the last thing you see there is little fear of the savages coming here in the night time but they may just before night or very early in the morning so one of us must be up again before daybreak that is between two and three o'clock in the morning to see if there is anything to be seen of them if there is not of course we may go to bed again as they cannot arrive till many hours afterwards and we must watch the wind and weather if it is favourable for them to come to us which indeed the wind will not be except at the commencement of the rainy season but it may be very light and then they would not care for its being against them i've been thinking of it william a great deal and my idea is that it will be at the beginning of the rainy season that we shall have a visit if we have one at all for you see that the wind don't blow regular from one quarter as it does now but is variable and then they can make sail in their canoes and come here easily instead of pulling between thirty and forty miles which is hard work against wind and current still we must not be careless and we must keep a good look out even now i don't want to fret your father and mrs seagrave with my fears on the subject but i tell you what i really think and what we ought to do i agree with you ready and i will take care to be up before daybreak and examine very carefully with the spy glass as soon as the day dawns you take the night part and i will do the morning part of the watching chapter fifty eight for nearly a fortnight the work upon the stockade continued without any intermission when a circumstance occurred which created the greatest alarm and excitement one day as the party returned to dinner mrs seagrave said with surprise why was not tommy with you no replied mr seagrave he has not been near us all day he went with us after breakfast but did not remain a quarter of an hour no missy i tell massa tommy to help carry cocoa nut leaves and then he go away directly goodness where can he be exclaimed mrs seagrave alarmed i dare say he is picking up shells on the beach ma'am replied ready or perhaps he is in the garden i will go and see i see him oh mercy i see him said juno pointing with her finger he in the boat and boat go to sea it was but too true there was tommy in the boat and the boat had drifted from the beach and was now a cable's length away from it among the breakers william ran off like the wind followed close by mr seagrave and ready and at a distance by mrs seagrave and juno indeed there was no time to be lost for the wind was off the shore and in a short time the boat would have been out to sea william as soon as he arrived at the beach threw off his hat and jacket and dashed into the water he was already up to his middle when old ready who had followed him caught him by the arm and said william go back immediately i insist upon it your going can do no good as you do not understand the thing so well as i do and go i will so there will be double risk for nothing mr seagrave order him back he will obey you i insist upon it sir william said mr seagrave come back immediately i command you william obeyed but before he was clear of the water ready had swam across to the first rocks on the reef and was now dashing through the pools between the rocks towards the boat oh father said william if that good old man is lost i shall never forgive myself look father one two three sharks here close to us he has no chance see he is again in deep water god protect him in the meantime mr seagrave whose wife was now by his side after glancing his eye a moment at the sharks which were within a few feet of the beach had kept his gaze steadily upon ready's movements if he passed through the passage of deep water between the rocks he might be considered safe as the boat was now beating on a reef on the other side where the water was shallow it was a moment of intense anxiety at last ready had gained the reef and had his hands upon the rocks and was climbing on them he is safe is he not whispered mrs seagrave faintly yes now i think he is replied mr seagrave as ready had gained a footing on the rocks where the water was but a little above his ankles i think there is no deep water between him and the boat in another minute ready was over the rocks and had seized the gunnel of the boat he is in the boat cried william thank god yes we must thank god and that fervently replied mr seagrave look at those monsters continued he pointing to the sharks how quick they swim to and fro they have scented their prey on the water it is fortunate they are here see he has the boat hook and is pushing the boat off the reef into the deep water oh he is quite safe now such however was not the case the boat had been beating on the rocks of the reef and had knocked a hole in her bottom and as soon as ready had forced the boat into deep water she began to fill immediately ready pushed as hard as he could with the boat hook and tearing off his neck cloth forced as much as he could of it into the hole this saved them but the boat was up to the thwarts with water and the least motion on the part of ready or even tommy would have upset her immediately and they had still to pass the deep water between the reef and the beach where the sharks were swimming ready who perceived his danger called out to them to throw large stones at the sharks as fast as they could to drive them away this was immediately done by mr seagrave and william aided by juno and mrs seagrave the pelting of the stones had the desired effect the sharks swam away and ready passed through to the beach and the boat grounded just as she was up to the gunnel in water and about to turn over he handed out tommy who was so dreadfully frightened that he could not cry as soon as ready landed william sprang into his arms crying thank god you are safe ready mrs seagrave overpowered by her feelings sank her head upon william's shoulder and burst into tears it was touch and go william observed ready as they walked up to the house preceded by mr and mrs seagrave how much mischief may be created by a thoughtless boy however one can't put old heads on young shoulders and so tommy must be forgiven he has been punished enough as far as fright goes replied william i'll answer for it he'll never get into the boat again by himself no i think not but now william you saw how nearly i was swamped in the boat indeed it was only by his mercy that i was preserved but taking the question merely as far as our endeavours could help us do you think that if you had gained the boat instead of me you would have brought her to the beach as i did no ready i never could have managed her so skilfully as you did and therefore i must have been swamped before i got on shore well william as i am an old sailor and you are not therefore it is not vanity which makes me say that you could not have managed the boat so well as i did now as i had not three or four seconds to spare you as you say must have been swamped i mention this to prove to you that i was right in desiring your father to order you back certainly ready but tommy is my brother and i felt that it was more my duty than yours to risk my life for him a very proper feeling william but you have other duties which are to look after your father and mother and be a comfort and solace to them your life is more valuable than mine i am an old man on the brink of the grave and a year or two makes no difference but your life is i hope of more consequence that evening the prayers were more than usually solemn and the thanksgivings more heartfelt and sincere exhausted with the exciting scene of the day they all retired early to bed chapter fifty nine when tommy was questioned on the following morning as to his inducement to get into the boat to their great surprise he replied that he wanted to go round to the tents again to see if the bananas were ripe that he intended to eat some of them and be back before dinner time that he might not be found out i suspect tommy you would have been very hungry before you ate any bananas if we had not perceived you said ready i won't go into the boat any more said tommy i rather think you will keep to that resolution tommy replied mr seagrave however i must leave your mother to point out to you the danger you were in yourself and in which you placed others by your folly the stockade was now almost finished the door was the occasion of a good deal of consultation at last it was agreed that it would be better to have a door of stout oak plank but with second door posts inside about a foot apart from the door between which could be inserted short poles one above the other so as to barricade it within when required this would make the door as strong as any other portion of the stockade as soon as this was all complete the storehouse was to be altered for a dwelling house by taking away the wattles of cocoa nut boughs on the sides and filling them up with logs of cocoa nut trees before the week was ended the stockade and door were complete and they now began to fell trees to form the sides of the house this was rapid work and while mr seagrave william and juno felled the trees and brought them on the wheels to the side of the stockade all ready cut to their proper lengths ready was employed in flooring the house with a part of the deal planks which they had brought round from the cove but this week they were obliged to break off for two days to collect all their crops from the garden a fortnight more passed away in continual hard work but the house was at last finished and very complete compared to the one they were residing in it was much larger and divided into three rooms by the deal planking the middle room which the door opened into was the sitting and eating room with a window behind the two side rooms were sleeping rooms one for mrs seagrave and the children and the other for the male portion of the family see william said ready when they were alone what we have been able to do by means of those deal planks why to have floored this house and run up the partitions would have taken us half a year if we had had to saw the wood yes and what a comfort it is to have so many shelves about when shall we shift into this house the sooner the better we have plenty of work still to do but we can work outside of the stockade and what do you propose to do with the old house said william we had better put some of our stores of least value in it for the present until we can fit up another storehouse inside the stockade then we'll put those casks in for they take up a great deal of room all but that large one william we shall want that i shall fix it up in a corner what for ready to put water in but we are closer to the spring than we were at the other house i know that but perhaps we may not be able to go out of the stockade and then we shall want water i understand ready how thoughtful you are if at my age i did not think a little william it would be very odd you don't know how anxious i am to see them all inside of this defence but why should we not come in ready why sir as there is still plenty of work i do not like to press the matter lest your mamma should be fidgeted and think there was danger but danger there is i have a kind of forewarning of it i wish you would propose that they should come in at once the standing bed places are all ready except the canvas and i shall nail on new by to night in consequence of this conversation william proposed at dinnertime that the next day they should go into the new house as it was so much more handy to work there and live there at the same time mr seagrave was of the same opinion but mrs seagrave thought it better that everything should be tidy first why ma'am said ready the only way to get things tidy is to go yourself and make them so nothing will ever be in its place unless you are there to put it in well ready said mrs seagrave since you are against me as well as all the rest i give it up and if you please we will shift over to morrow indeed ma'am i think it will be better this is the last month of fine weather and we shall have plenty to do be it so ready you are the best judge to morrow we will take up our quarters in the stockade thank god muttered ready very softly the next day was fully employed in changing their residence and shifting over the bedding and utensils and that night they slept within the stockade ready had run up a very neat little outhouse of plank as a kitchen for juno and another week was fully employed as follows the stores were divided those of least consequence and the salt provisions flour and the garden produce etcetera were put into the old house the casks of powder and most of the cartridges were also put there for security but a cask of beef of pork and flour all the iron work and nails canvas etcetera were stowed away for the present under the new house which had when built as a storehouse been raised four feet from the ground to make a shelter for the stock this was very spacious and of course quite dry and contained all they wished to put in ready also took care by degrees to fill the large water butt full of water and had fixed into the bottom a spigot for drawing the water off well mr seagrave said ready on the saturday we have done a good many hard weeks' work lately but this is the last of them we are now comfortably settled in our new house our stores are all under cover and safe from the weather and so we may now take things a little easier william and i must repair the boat so that we may take a trip round to examine how the stock and yams get on and the bananas and the guavas said tommy why we have quite forgotten all about them observed mrs seagrave yes ma'am we have been so busy that it is no wonder however there may be some left yet and i will go round as soon as the boat is able to swim and bring all i can find we must put our seeds and potatoes in before the rainy season ready it will be better sir if we can find time as we shall not have much more fine weather now at all events we can get them in at intervals when the weather is fine now i shall go my rounds for turtle good night ma'am good night sir come william william and ready succeeded in turning six more turtles to add to their stock and having taken a careful survey with the telescope they came back fastened the door of the stockade and went to bed chapter sixty another week passed away during which ready repaired the boat and william and mr seagrave were employed in digging up the garden it was also a very busy week at the house as they had not washed linen for some time mrs seagrave and juno and even little caroline were hard at work and tommy was more useful than ever he had been going for the water as they required it and watching little albert indeed he was so active that mrs seagrave praised him before his papa and tommy was quite proud on the monday william and ready set off in the boat to the little harbour and found all the stock doing well many of the bananas and guavas had ripened and withered but there were enough left to fill the boat half full we cannot do better than to leave the stock where it is at present william they can run into the cocoa nut grove for shelter if there is a storm and there is feed enough for ten times as many yes but will you not dig up a few yams first i had quite forgotten it william i will go for the spade having procured the yams they set off on their return before they arrived at the bay the sky clouded over and threatened a storm it did not however rain till after they had landed when a small shower announced the commencement of the rainy season the fruit was very welcome to all of them it was so long since they had tasted any the following day was beautifully fine and everything appeared refreshed by the rain which had fallen it was however agreed that ready and william should go round the next morning bring home the tents and as many yams as the boat could carry william and ready went out at night as usual when ready observed that the wind had chopped round to the eastward that will be bad for us to morrow ready replied william we may sail to the harbour but we shall have to pull back with the loaded boat i trust it will be no worse than that at all events replied ready but we must now return and go to bed i shall be up by daylight so you need not wake without you like i can't help waking replied william and i shall therefore be up with you very well i am always glad of your company the next morning just before the day dawned ready and william unfastened the door of the stockade and went down to the beach the wind was still to the eastward and blowing rather fresh and the sky was cloudy as the sun rose ready as usual had his telescope with him and looked through it at the offing to the eastward as he kept the spy glass to his eye for some time without speaking william said do you see anything ready that you look so long in that direction either my old eyes deceive me or i fear that i do replied ready but a few minutes more will decide there was a bank of clouds on the horizon to the eastward but as soon as the sun had risen above them ready who had the telescope fixed in the same direction said yes william i am right i thought that those dark patches i saw there were brown grass sails sails of what ready said william hastily of the indian canoes i knew that they would come take the glass and look yourself my eye is quite dim from straining it so long yes i have them now replied william with his eye to the glass at last he said why there are twenty or thirty of them ready at least and with twenty or thirty men in each too william what must we do ready how frightened my poor mother will be i'm afraid we can do nothing against such a number yes william we can do a great deal and we must do a great deal that there are hundreds of savages there is no doubt but recollect that we have a stockade which they cannot easily climb over and plenty of firearms and ammunition so that we can make a good fight of it and perhaps beat them off for they have nothing but clubs and spears how fast they come down ready why they will be here in an hour no sir nor in two hours either those are very large canoes however there is no time to be lost while i watch them for a few minutes till i make them more clearly out do you run up to the house and beckon your father to come down to me and then william get all the muskets ready and bring the casks of powder and of made up cartridges from the old house into the stockade call juno and she will help you we shall have time enough to do everything after you have done that you had better come down and join us in a very few minutes after william ran up to the house mr seagrave made his appearance ready there is danger i'm sure william would not tell me i presume because he was afraid of alarming his mother what is it it is mr seagrave that the savages are now coming down upon us in large force perhaps five or six hundred of them and that we shall have to defend ourselves with might and main do you think we have any chance against such a force yes sir with god's help i have no doubt but that we shall beat them off but we must fight hard and for some days i fear mr seagrave examined the fleet of canoes with the glass it is indeed dreadful odds to contend against yes sir but three muskets behind a stockade are almost a match for all their clubs and spears provided none of us are wounded well ready we must put our trust in the lord and do our best i will second you to the utmost of my power and william i'm sure will do his duty i think sir said ready we had better not wait here any more as we have not long to prepare for them we have only to fix up some of our strong deal planks on the inside of the stockade for us to stand upon when we are attacked that we may see what the enemy is about and be able to fire upon them but first we had better go to the old house and take out what provisions and other articles we shall most want and roll the casks into the stockade for to the old house they will go first and perhaps destroy everything in it the casks they certainly will for the sake of the iron hoops an hour's work will do a great deal i believe we have everything we want in the stockade juno has her fuel the large butt of water will last us two or three weeks at least and if we have time we will get the wheels down and spear a couple of turtles for fresh provisions these observations were made as they walked up to the house as soon as they arrived they found william and juno had just brought in the powder and cartridges mr seagrave went in to break the matter to his wife i was told that i had to expect this my dear replied mrs seagrave so that it has not come upon me altogether unawares and anything that a poor weak woman can do i will i am indeed greatly relieved said mr seagrave by finding you thus prepared and supported i shall feel no anxiety but we have work to be done mr and mrs seagrave then joined william ready and juno who had already proceeded to the old house the children were all still in bed and asleep so that there was no occasion for any one to watch them chapter sixty one as they could have a very good view of the canoes from where the old house stood ready examined them with his glass every time that he returned from rolling up a cask to the stockade every one worked hard even mrs seagrave did all she could either assisting in rolling the casks or carrying up what she was able to lift in an hour they had got into the stockade all that they most cared for and the canoes were still about six or seven miles off we have a good hour before they arrive sir said ready and even then the reefs will puzzle them not a little i doubt if they are disembarked under two hours we have plenty of time for all we wish to do juno go for the wheels and william come down with the spear and we will have some of the turtle into the stockade mr seagrave i do not require your assistance so if you will have the kindness to get out the muskets and examine the flints it will be as well yes and then you have to load them replied mrs seagrave juno and i can do that at all events ready for you to fire them an excellent idea madam replied ready in half an hour six turtles were brought up by juno and william and then ready followed them into the stockade they then rolled the casks and upheaded them by the sides of the stockade and fixed up deal planks to stand upon just high enough to enable them to see over the top of the palisades and to fire at the enemy mrs seagrave had been shown how to load a musket and juno was now taught the same now sir we are all prepared said ready and madam and juno can go and look a little after the children and get breakfast as soon as the children were dressed mr seagrave called ready who was outside watching the canoes and they went to their morning devotions and prayed heartily for succour in this time of need they then breakfasted in haste for as may be supposed they were almost too anxious to eat this suspense is worse than all said mrs seagrave i wish now that they were come shall i go to ready and hear his report my dear i will not be away three minutes in a short time mr seagrave returned saying that the canoes were close to the beach that the savages evidently had a knowledge of the passages through the reefs as they had steered right in and had lowered their sails that ready and william were on the look out but concealed behind the cocoa nut trees i hope they will not stay out too long no fear of that my dear selina but they had better watch their motions to the last minute during this conversation between mr and mrs seagrave within the stockade william and ready were watching the motions of the savages a large portion of whom had landed out of ten of the canoes and the others were following their example as fast as they could forcing their way through the reefs the savages were all painted with their war cloaks and feathers on and armed with spears and clubs evidently having come with no peaceable intentions william who had taken the telescope to examine them more minutely said to ready what a fierce cruel set of wretches they appear to be if they overpower us they will certainly kill us of that there is no doubt william but we must fight hard and not let them overpower us kill us they certainly will and i am not sure that they may not eat us afterwards but that is of little consequence william replied in a determined tone i'll fight as long as i have breath in my body but ready they are coming up as fast as they can yes we must wait no longer come william i thought i saw another vessel under sail out away by the garden point ready just as we turned away very likely sir a canoe which has separated from the others during the night come quick william they have begun to yell another half minute and they arrived at the door of the stockade they entered shut the door and then barricaded it with the cocoa nut poles which they had fitted to the inner door posts chapter sixty two the loud yells of the savages struck terror into the heart of mrs seagrave it was well that she had not seen their painted bodies and fierce appearance or she would have been much more alarmed little albert and caroline clung around her neck with terror in their faces they did not cry but looked round and round to see from whence the horrid noise proceeded and then clung faster to their mother tommy was very busy finishing all the breakfast which had been left for there was no one to check him as usual juno was busy outside and was very active and courageous mr seagrave had been employed making the holes between the palisades large enough to admit the barrels of the muskets so that they could fire at the savages without being exposed while william and ready with their muskets loaded were on the look out for their approach they are busy with the old house just now sir observed ready but that won't detain them long here they come replied william and look ready is not that one of the women who escaped from us in the canoe who is walking along with the first two men yes it is i am sure you are right william it is one of them ah they have stopped they did not expect the stockade that is clear and it has puzzled them see how they are all crowding together and talking they are holding a council of war how to proceed that tall man must be one of their chiefs now william although i intend to fight as hard as i can yet i always feel a dislike to begin first i shall therefore show myself over the palisades and if they attack me i shall then fire with a quiet conscience but take care they don't hit you ready no great fear of that william here they come ready now stood upon the plank within so as to show himself to the savages who gave a tremendous yell and as they advanced a dozen spears were thrown at him with so true an aim that had he not instantly dodged behind the stockade he must have been killed three or four spears remained quivering in the palisades just below the top the others went over it and fell down inside of the stockade at the further end now william take good aim but before william could fire mr seagrave who had agreed to be stationed at the corner so that he might see if the savages went round to the other side fired his musket and the tall chief fell to the ground ready and william also fired and two more of the savages were seen to drop amidst the yells of their companions juno handed up the other muskets which were ready loaded and took those discharged and mrs seagrave having desired caroline to take care of her little brother and tommy to be very quiet and good came out turned the key of the door upon them and hastened to assist juno in reloading the muskets the spears now rushed through the air and it was well that they could fire from the stockade without exposing their persons or they would have had but little chance the yells increased and the savages now began to attack on every quarter the most active who climbed like cats actually succeeded in gaining the top of the palisades but as soon as their heads appeared above they were fired at with so true an aim that they dropped down dead outside this combat lasted for more than an hour when the savages having lost a great many men drew off from the assault and the parties within the stockade had time to breathe they have not gained much in this bout at all events said ready it was well fought on our side and william you certainly behaved as if you had been brought up to it do you think they will go away now said mrs seagrave oh no madam not yet they will try us every way before they leave us you see these are very brave men and it is clear that they know what gunpowder is or they would have been more astonished i should think so too replied mr seagrave the first time that savages hear the report of firearms they are usually thrown into great consternation yes sir but such has not been the case with these people and therefore i reckon it is not the first time that they have fought with europeans are they all gone ready said william who had come down from the plank to his mother no i see them between the trees now they are sitting round in a circle and i suppose making speeches well i'm very thirsty at all events said william juno bring me a little water juno went to the water tub to comply with william's request and in a few moments afterwards came back in great consternation oh massa oh missy no water water all gone water all gone cried ready and all of them in a breath yes not one little drop in the cask i filled it up to the top exclaimed ready very gravely the tub did not leak that i am sure of how can this have happened missy i tink i know now said juno you remember you send massa tommy the two or three days we wash to fetch water from the well in little bucket you know how soon he come back and how you say what good boy he was and how you tell massa seagrave when he come to dinner now missy i quite certain massa tommy no take trouble go to well but fetch water from tub all the while and so he empty it i'm afraid you're right juno replied mrs seagrave what shall we do i go speak massa tommy said juno running to the house this is a very awkward thing mr seagrave observed ready gravely mr seagrave shook his head the fact was that they all perceived the danger of their position if the savages did not leave the island they would perish of thirst or have to surrender and in the latter case all their lives would most certainly be sacrificed juno now returned her suspicions were but too true tommy pleased with the praise of being so quick in bringing the water had taken out the spigot of the cask and drawn it all off well observed mr seagrave it is the will of heaven that all our careful arrangements and preparations against this attack should be defeated by the idleness of a child and we must submit very true sir replied ready all our hopes now are that the savages may be tired out and leave the island if i had but a little for the children i should not care observed mrs seagrave but to see those poor things suffer is there not a drop left juno anywhere juno shook her head mrs seagrave said she would go and examine and went away into the house accompanied by juno this is a very bad business ready observed mr seagrave what would we give for a shower of rain now that we might catch the falling drops there are no signs of it sir replied ready we must however put our confidence in one who will not forsake us i wish the savages would come on again observed william for the sooner they come the sooner the affair will be decided i doubt if they will to day at night time i think it very probable we must make preparations for it why what can we do ready in the first place sir by nailing planks from cocoa nut tree to cocoa nut tree above the present stockade we may make a great portion of it much higher and more difficult to climb over some of them were nearly in this time if we do that we shall not have so large a space to watch over and defend and then we must contrive to have a large fire ready for lighting that we may not have to fight altogether in the dark it will give them some advantage in looking through the palisades and seeing where we are but they cannot well drive their spears through so it is no great matter we must make the fire in the centre of the stockade and have plenty of tar in it to make it burn bright and we must not of course light it until after we are attacked we shall then see where they are trying for an entrance and where to aim with our muskets the idea is very good ready said mr seagrave if it had not been for this unfortunate want of water i really should be sanguine of beating them off we may suffer very much mr seagrave i have no doubt but who knows what the morrow may bring forth true ready do you see the savages now no sir they have left the spot where they were in consultation i suppose they are busy with their wounded and their dead as ready had supposed no further attack was made by the savages on that day and he william and mr seagrave were very busy making their arrangements they nailed the planks on the trunks of the trees above the stockade so as to make three sides of the stockade at least five feet higher and almost impossible to climb up and they prepared a large fire in a tar barrel full of cocoa nut leaves mixed with wood and tar so as to burn fiercely dinner or supper they had none for there was nothing but salt pork and beef and live turtle and by ready's advice they did not eat as it would only increase their desire to drink the poor children suffered much and little albert wailed and cried for water water ready remained on the look out indeed everything was so miserable inside of the house that they were all glad to go out of it they could do no good and poor mrs seagrave had a difficult and most painful task to keep the children quiet under such severe privation for the weather was still very warm and sultry chapter sixty three but the moaning of the children was very soon after dusk drowned by the yells of the savages who as ready had prognosticated now advanced to the night attack every part of the stockade was at once assailed and their attempts now made were to climb into it a few spears were occasionally thrown but it was evident that the object was to obtain an entrance by dint of numbers it was well that ready had taken the precaution of nailing the deal planks above the original stockade or there is little doubt but that the savages would have gained their object as it was before the flames of the fire which juno had lighted by ready's order gave them sufficient light three or four savages had climbed up and had been shot by william and mr seagrave as they were on the top of the stockade when the fire burnt brightly the savages outside were more easily aimed at and a great many fell in their attempts to get over the attack continued more than an hour when at last satisfied that they could not succeed the savages once more withdrew carrying with them as before their dead and wounded i trust that they will now re embark and leave the island said mr seagrave i only wish they may sir it is not at all impossible but there is no saying i have been thinking mr seagrave that we might be able to ascertain their movements by making a look out you see sir that cocoa nut tree continued ready pointing to one of those to which the palisades were fastened is much taller than any of the others now by driving spike nails into the trunk at about a foot apart we might ascend it with ease and it would command a view of the whole bay we then could know what the enemy were about yes that is very true but will not anyone be very much exposed if he climbs up no sir for you see the cocoa nut trees are cut down clear of the palisades to such a distance that no savage could come at all near without being seen by anyone on the look out and giving us sufficient time to get down again before he could use his spear i believe that you are right there ready but at all events i would not attempt to do it before daylight as there may be some of them still lurking underneath the stockade certainly there may be sir and therefore until daylight we will not begin mr seagrave then went into the house ready desired william to lie down and sleep for two or three hours as he would watch in the morning when mr seagrave came out he would have a little sleep himself i can't sleep ready i'm mad with thirst replied william yes sir it's very painful i feel it myself very much but what must those poor children feel i pity them most i pity my mother most ready replied william it must be agony to her to witness their sufferings and not be able to relieve them yes indeed it must be terrible william to a mother's feelings but perhaps these savages will be off to morrow and then we shall forget our privations i trust in god that they may ready but they seem very determined yes sir iron is gold to them and what will civilised men not do for gold in the meantime mr seagrave had gone into the house he found the children still crying for water notwithstanding the coaxing and soothing of mrs seagrave who was shedding tears as she hung over poor little albert little caroline only drooped and said nothing mr seagrave remained for two or three hours with his wife assisting her in pacifying the children and soothing her to the utmost of his power at last he went out and found old ready on the watch ready i had rather a hundred times be attacked by these savages and have to defend this place than be in that house for even five minutes and witness the sufferings of my wife and children i do not doubt it sir replied ready but cheer up and let us hope for the best i think it very probable that the savages after this second defeat will leave the island i wish i could think so ready it would make me very happy but i have come out to take the watch ready will you not sleep for a while i will sir if you please take a little sleep call me in two hours it will then be daylight and i can go to work and you can get some repose yourself i am too anxious to sleep i think so at least william said he was too thirsty to sleep sir but poor fellow he is now fast enough i trust that boy will be spared ready i hope so too but we are all in the hands of the almighty mr seagrave took his station on the plank and was left to his own reflections that they were not of the most pleasant kind may easily be imagined he prayed earnestly and fervently that they might be delivered from the danger and sufferings which threatened them and became calm and tranquil prepared for the worst if the worst was to happen and confidently placing himself and his family under the care of him who orders all as he thinks best at daylight ready woke up and relieved mr seagrave who did not return to the house but lay down on the cocoa nut boughs where ready had been lying by the side of william as soon as ready had got out the spike nails and hammer he summoned william to his assistance and they commenced driving them into the cocoa nut tree one looking out in case of the savages approaching while the other was at work in less than an hour they had gained the top of the tree close to the boughs and had a very commanding view of the bay as well as inland william who was driving the last dozen spikes took a survey and then came down to ready i can see everything ready they have pulled down the old house altogether and are most of them lying down outside covered up with their war cloaks some women are walking to and fro from the canoes which are lying on the beach where they first landed they have pulled down the house to obtain the iron nails i have no doubt replied ready did you see any of their dead no i did not look about very much but i will go up again directly i came down because my hands were jarred with hammering and the hammer was so heavy to carry in a minute or two i shall go up light enough my lips are burning ready and swelled the skin is peeling off i had no idea that want of water would have been so dreadful i was in hopes of finding a cocoa nut or two on the tree but there was not one and if you had found one it would not have had any milk in it at this season of the year however william if the savages do not go away to day something must be done i wish now that you would go up again and see if they are not stirring william again mounted to the top of the tree and remained up for some minutes when he came down he said they are all up now and swarming like bees i counted of the men in their war cloaks and feather head dresses the women are passing to and fro from the well with water there is nobody at the canoes except eight or ten women who are beating their heads i think or doing something of the kind i could not make it out well but they seem all doing the same thing i know what they are about william they are cutting themselves with knives or other sharp instruments it is the custom of these people the dead are all put into the canoes and these women are lamenting over them perhaps they are going away since the dead are in the canoes but there is no saying chapter sixty four the second day was passed in keeping a look out upon the savages and awaiting a fresh attack they could perceive from the top of the cocoa nut tree that the savages held a council of war in the forenoon sitting round in a large circle while one got up in the centre and made a speech flourishing his club and spear while he spoke in the afternoon the council broke up and the savages were observed to be very busy in all directions cutting down the cocoa nut trees and collecting all the brushwood ready watched them for a long while and at last came down a little before sunset mr seagrave said he we shall have in my opinion no attack this night but to morrow we must expect something very serious the savages are cutting down the trees and making large faggots they do not get on very fast because their hatchets are made of stone and don't cut very well but perseverance and numbers will effect everything and i dare say that they will work all night till they have obtained as many faggots as they want but what do you imagine to be their object ready in cutting down trees and making the faggots either sir to pile them up outside the palisades so large as to be able to walk up upon them or else to pile them up to set fire to them and burn us out do you think they will succeed not without very heavy loss perhaps we may best them off but it will be a hard fight harder than any we have had yet we must have the women to load the muskets so that we may fire as fast as we can i should not think much of their attempt to burn us if it were not for the smoke cocoa nut wood especially with the bark on as our palisades have will char a long while but not burn easily when standing upright and the fire when the faggots are kindled although it will be fierce will not last long but suffering as we are now ready for want of water how can we possibly keep up our strength to meet them in a suffocating smoke and flame we must drop with sheer exhaustion we must hope for the best and do our best mr seagrave replied ready and recollect that should anything happen to me during the conflict and if there is any chance of your being overpowered you must take advantage of the smoke to escape into the woods and find your way to the tents i have no doubt that you will be able to do that of course the attack will be to windward if they use fire and you must try and escape to leeward i have shown william how to force a palisade if necessary the savages if they get possession will not think of looking for you at first and perhaps when they have obtained all that the house contains not even afterwards why do you say if any accident happens to you ready said william because william if they place the faggots so as to be able to walk to the top of the palisades i may be wounded or killed and so may you of course replied william but they are not in yet and they shall have a hard fight for it ready then told mr seagrave that he would keep the watch and call him at twelve o'clock during these two days they had eaten very little a turtle had been killed and pieces fried but eating only added to their thirst and even the children refused the meat the sufferings were now really dreadful and poor mrs seagrave was almost frantic as soon as mr seagrave had gone into the house ready called william and said william water we must have i cannot bear to see the agony of the poor children and the state of mind which your poor mother is in and more without water we never shall be able to beat off the savages to morrow we shall literally die of choking in the smoke if they use fire now william i intend to take one of the seven gallon barricos and go down to the well for water i may succeed and i may not but attempt it i must and if i fall it cannot be helped why not let me go ready replied william for many reasons william said ready and the chief one is that i do not think you would succeed so well as i shall i shall put on the war cloak and feathers of the savage who fell dead inside of the stockade and that will be a disguise but i shall take no arms except his spear as they would only be in my way and increase the weight i have to carry now observe you must let me out of the door and when i am out in case of accident put one of the poles across it inside that will keep the door fast if they attack it until you can secure it with the others watch my return and be all ready to let me in do you understand me yes perfectly ready but i am now i must confess really frightened if anything was to happen to you what a misery it would be there is no help for it william water must if possible be procured and now is a better time to make the attempt than later when they may be more on the watch they have left off their work and are busy eating if i meet any one it will only be a woman ready went for the barrico a little cask which held six or seven gallons of water he put on the head dress and war cloak of the savage and taking the barrico on his shoulder and the spear in his hand the poles which barred the door were softly removed by william and after ascertaining that no one was concealed beneath the palisades ready pressed william's hand and set off across the cleared space outside of the stockade and gained the cocoa nut trees william as directed closed the door passed one pole through the inner door posts for security and remained on the watch he was in an awful state of suspense listening to the slightest noise even the slight rustling by the wind of the cocoa nut boughs above him made him start there he continued for some minutes his gun ready cocked by his side it is time that he returned thought william the distance is not yards and yet i have heard no noise at last he thought he heard footsteps coming very softly yes it was so ready was returning and without any accident william had his hand upon the pole to slip it on one side and open the door when he heard a scuffle and a fall close to the door he immediately threw down the pole and opened it just as ready called him by name william seized his musket and sprang out he found ready struggling with a savage who was uppermost and with his spear at ready's breast in a second william levelled and fired and the savage fell dead take the water in quick william said ready in a faint voice i will contrive to crawl in if i can william caught up the barrico of water and took it in he then hastened to ready who was on his knees mr seagrave hearing the musket fired had run out and finding the stockade door open followed william and seeing him endeavouring to support ready caught hold of his other arm and they led him tottering into the stockade the door was then immediately secured and they went to his assistance are you hurt ready said william yes dear boy yes hurt to death i fear his spear went through my breast water quick water alas that we had some said mr seagrave we have papa replied william but it has cost us dearly william ran for a pannikin and taking out the bung poured some water out of the barrico and gave it to ready who drank it with eagerness now william lay me down on these cocoa nut boughs go and give some water to the others and when you have all drunk then come to me again don't tell mrs seagrave that i'm hurt do as i beg of you papa take the water do pray replied william i cannot leave ready i will my boy replied mr seagrave but first drink yourself william who was very faint drank off the pannikin of water which immediately revived him and then while mr seagrave hastened with some water to the children and women occupied himself with old ready who breathed heavily but did not speak chapter sixty five after returning twice for water to satisfy those in the house mr seagrave came to the assistance of william who had been removing ready's clothes to ascertain the nature of the wound he had received we had better move him to where the other cocoa nut boughs lie he will be more comfortable there said william ready whispered more water william gave him some more and then with the assistance of his father ready was removed to a more comfortable place as soon as they laid him there ready turned on his side and threw up a quantity of blood i am better now said he in a low voice bind up the wound william an old man like me has not much blood to spare mr seagrave and william then examined the wound the spear had gone deep into the lungs william threw off his shirt tore it up into strips and then bound up the wound so as to stop the effusion of blood ready who at first appeared much exhausted with being moved about gradually recovered so as to be able to speak in a low voice when mrs seagrave came out of the house where is that brave kind man cried she that i may bless him and thank him mr seagrave went to her and caught her by the arm he is hurt my dear and very much hurt i did not tell you at the time mr seagrave related what had occurred and then led her to where ready was lying mrs seagrave knelt by his side took his hand and burst into tears don't weep for me said ready my days have been numbered i'm only sorry that i cannot any more be useful to you dear good man said mrs seagrave whatever may be our fates and that is for the almighty to decide for us as long as i have life what you have done for me and mine shall never be forgotten mrs seagrave then bent over him and kissing his forehead rose and retired weeping into the house william said ready i can't talk now raise my head a little and then leave me you have not looked round lately come again in about half an hour leave me now mr seagrave i shall be better if i doze a little they complied with ready's request went up to the planks and examined carefully all round the stockade at last they stopped this is a sad business william said mr seagrave william shook his head he would not let me go replied he i wish he had i fear that he is much hurt i should say that he cannot recover william we shall miss him to morrow if they attack us i hardly know what to say papa but i feel that since we have been relieved i am able to do twice as much as i could have done before i feel the same but still with such a force against us two people cannot do much if my mother and juno load the muskets for us replied william we shall at all events do as much now as we should have been able to do if there were three so exhausted as we should have been perhaps so at all events we will do our best for we fight for our lives and for those most dear to us william went softly up to ready and found that he was dozing he therefore did not disturb him but returned to his father now that their thirst had been appeased they all felt the calls of hunger juno and william went and cut off steaks from the turtle and fried them they all made a hearty meal and perhaps never had they taken one with so much relish in their lives it was nearly daylight when william who had several times been softly up to ready found him with his eyes open how do you find yourself ready said william i am quiet and easy william and without much pain but i think i am sinking and shall not last long recollect that if you are obliged to escape from the stockade you take no heed of me but leave me where i am i cannot live and were you to move me i should only die the sooner i had rather die with you than leave you ready no that is wrong you must save your mother and your brothers and sister promise me that you will do as i wish william hesitated i point out to you your duty william i know what your feelings are but you must not give way to them promise me this or you will make me very miserable william squeezed ready's hand his heart was too full to speak they will come at daylight william you have not much time to spare climb to the look out and wait there till day dawns watch them as long as you can and then come and tell me what you have seen ready's voice became faint after this exertion of speaking so much william immediately climbed up the cocoa nut tree and waited there till daylight at the dawn of day he perceived that the savages were at work that they had collected all the faggots together opposite to where the old house had stood and were very busy in making arrangements for the attack at last every one shouldered a faggot and commenced their advance towards the stockade william immediately descended and called his father who was talking with mrs seagrave the muskets were all loaded and mrs seagrave and juno took their posts below the planking to reload them as fast as they were fired we must fire upon them as soon as we are sure of not missing william said mr seagrave for the more we check their advance the better when the first savages were within fifty yards they both fired and two of the men dropped they continued to fire as their assailants came up with great success for the first ten minutes after which the savages advanced in a larger body and took the precaution to hold the faggots in front of them for some protection as they approached by these means they gained the stockade in safety and commenced laying their faggots mr seagrave and william still kept up an incessant fire upon them but not with so much success as before although many fell the faggots were gradually heaped up till they almost reached to the holes between the palisades through which they pointed their muskets and as the savages contrived to slope them down from the stockade to the ground it was evident that they meant to mount up and take them by escalade at last it appeared as if all the faggots had been placed and the savages retired farther back to where the cocoa nut trees were still standing they have gone away father said william but they will come again and i fear it is all over with us i fear so too my boy replied mr seagrave they are only retreating to arrange for a general assault and they now will be able to gain an entrance i almost wish that they had fired the faggots we might have escaped as ready pointed out to us but now i fear we have no chance don't say a word to my mother said william let us defend ourselves to the last and if we are overpowered it is the will of god i should like to take a farewell embrace of your dear mother said mr seagrave but no it will be weakness just now here they come william in a swarm well god bless you my boy we shall all i trust meet in heaven the whole body of savages were now advancing from the cocoa nut wood in a solid mass they raised a yell which struck terror into the hearts of mrs seagrave and juno yet they flinched not the savages were again within fifty yards of them when the fire was opened upon them the fire was answered by loud yells and the savages had already reached to the bottom of the sloping pile of faggots when the yells and the reports of the muskets were drowned by a much louder report followed by the crackling and breaking of the cocoa nut trees which made both parties start with surprise another and another followed the ground was ploughed up and the savages fell in numbers it must be the cannon of a ship father said william we are saved we are saved it can be nothing else we are saved and by a miracle replied mr seagrave in utter astonishment the savages paused in the advance quite stupefied again again again the report of the loud guns boomed through the air and the round shot and grape came whizzing and tearing through the cocoa nut grove at this last broadside the savages turned and fled towards their canoes not one was left to be seen we are saved cried mr seagrave leaping off the plank and embracing his wife who sank down on her knees and held up her clasped hands in thankfulness to heaven william had hastened up to the look out on the cocoa nut tree and now cried out to them below as the guns were again discharged a large schooner father she is firing at the savages who are at the canoes they are falling in every direction some have plunged into the water there is a boat full of armed men coming on shore they are close to the beach by the garden point three of the canoes have got off full of men there go the guns again two of the canoes are sunk father the boat has landed and the people are coming up this way william then descended from the look out as fast as he could as soon as he was down he commenced unbarring the door of the stockade he pulled out the last pole just as he heard the feet of their deliverers outside he threw open the door and a second after found himself in the arms of captain osborn chapter sixty six before we wind up this history it will be as well to state to my young readers how it was that captain osborn made his appearance at so fortunate a moment it will be recollected how a brig came off the island some months before this and the great disappointment that the party on the island experienced in her not making her appearance again the fact was that those on board of the brig had not only seen their signals but had read the name of the pacific upon the flag hoisted but the heavy gale which came on drove them so far to the southward that the master of the brig did not consider that he should do his duty to his owners if he lost so much time in beating up for the island again he therefore decided upon making all sail for sydney to which port he was bound when captain osborn was put into the boat by mackintosh and the seamen of the pacific he was still insensible but he gradually recovered and after a stormy night captain osborn was so far recovered as to hear from mackintosh what had taken place and why it was that he found himself in an open boat at sea the next morning the wind moderated and they were fortunate enough to fall in with a vessel bound to van diemen's land which took them all on board from the account given by mackintosh captain osborn had no doubt in his mind but that the seagrave family had perished and the loss of the vessel with them on board was duly reported to the owners when at van diemen's land captain osborn was so much taken with the beauty and fertility of the country and perhaps not so well inclined to go to sea again after such danger as he had incurred in the last voyage that he resolved to purchase land and settle there he did so and had already stocked his farm with cattle and had gone round to sydney in a schooner to await the arrival of a large order from england which he had sent for when the brig arrived and reported the existence of some white people on the small island and also that they had hoisted a flag with the name pacific worked on it captain osborn hearing this went to the master of the brig and questioned him he found the latitude and longitude of the island to be not far from that of the ship when she was deserted and he was now convinced that by some miracle the seagrave family had been preserved he therefore went to the governor of new south wales and made him acquainted with the facts which had been established and the governor instantly replied that the government armed schooner was at his service if he would himself go in quest of his former shipmates inconvenient as the absence at that time was to captain osborn he at once acquiesced and in a few days the schooner sailed for her destination she arrived off the island on the same morning that the fleet of canoes with the savages effected their landing and when william made the remark to ready as they were hastening into the stockade that there was another vessel under sail off the garden point had ready had time to put his eye to the telescope he would have discovered that it was the schooner the schooner stood in to the reefs and then hauled off again that she might send her boat in to sound for an anchorage the boat when sounding perceived the canoes and the savages and afterwards heard the report of firearms on the first attack on her return on board the schooner they stated what they had seen and heard and their idea that the white people on the island were being attacked by the savages as the boat did not return on board till near dusk they had not time to canvas the question when the night attack was made and they again heard the firing of the muskets this made captain osborn most anxious to land as soon as possible but as the savages were in such numbers and the crew of the schooner did not consist of more than twenty five men the commander considered it was rash to make the attempt he did however show the utmost anxiety to bring his schooner to an anchor so as to protect his men and then agreed that they should land the boat had reported deep water and good anchorage close to the garden point and every preparation was made for running at daylight on the following morning but unfortunately it fell calm for the best part of the day and it was not until the morning after just as the savages were making their last attack upon the stockade that she could get in as soon as she did she opened the fire of her carronades and the result is already known my readers must if they can imagine the joy of mr and mrs seagrave when they beheld their old friend captain osborn all danger was now over the party who had landed with him went out under the command of the mate to ascertain if there were any more of the savages to be found but except the dead and dying all had escaped in some of the smaller canoes captain osborn remained with the seagraves and they informed him of the state of poor old ready whom william had gone to attend as soon as captain osborn was engaged with his father and mother captain osborn hurried out to see him ready knew his voice for his eyes were already so dim that he could not see that is captain osborn i know said ready in a faint voice you have come in good time sir i knew you would come and i always said so you have the thanks of a dying man i hope it is not so bad as that ready we have a surgeon on board and i will send for him at once no surgeon can help me sir replied ready another hour of time will not pass before i shall be in eternity the old man then joined his hands across his breast and remained for some time in silent prayer then he bade them farewell in a faint voice which at last was changed to a mere whisper they still remained in silence and in tears standing round him william only kneeling and holding his hand when the old man's head fell back and he was no more it is all over said mr seagrave mournfully and he has i have no doubt gone to receive the reward of a good and just man happy are those who die in the lord' mr seagrave then led away his wife and children leaving juno and william william closed his eyes and juno went and fetched the ship's ensign which they laid over the body after which they joined the rest of the party in the house it was decided that the following day should be passed in packing up and getting on board their luggage and that the day after the family should embark william then mentioned the wish of poor old ready as to his burial the commander of the schooner immediately gave directions for a coffin to be made and for his men to dig the grave at the spot that william should point out chapter sixty seven the hurry and bustle of preparing for their departure from the island and the rapid succession of events which had been crowded together within so very few days had not allowed time for much thought or reflection to mr and mrs seagrave and william at length however every preparation had been made and they were no longer urged by the commander of the schooner to hasten their packing up and arrangements for everything had been sent on board during the afternoon and it was proposed that they should sail on the following day now they had time to feel and bitterly did they lament the loss of their old friend and deplore that he had not survived to sail with them to sydney they had always indulged the hope that one day they should be taken off the island and in that hope they had ever looked forward to old ready becoming a part of their future household now that their wishes had been granted so much was the feeling of joy and gratitude mingled with regret that could he have been restored to them they felt as if they would have gladly remained on the island captain osborn the commander and the crew of the schooner had taken leave of them for the night and had gone on board having made arrangements for the interment of ready previous to their sailing on the following day the children had been put to bed and juno had quitted the house mr and mrs seagrave and william were sitting together in their now half dismantled room when juno entered the poor girl had evidently been weeping well juno observed mr seagrave with a view to break the silence which had continued for some time previous to her entrance are you not glad to leave the island one time i think i would be very glad but now i not care much replied juno island very nice place all very happy till savage come suppose they not kill old ready i not care yes indeed said mrs seagrave it is a sad blow to us all i did hope to have fostered the good old man and to have been able to have shown him our gratitude but it is the will of heaven that it should be otherwise continued mr seagrave i would give half that i am possessed of that he had not perished oh massa said juno i sit by him just now i take off the flag and look at his face so calm look so happy so good i almost tink he smile at me and then i cry oh massa tommy all because you idle boy it adds much to my regret replied mr seagrave that his life should have been sacrificed through the thoughtlessness of one of my own children what a lesson it will be to tommy when he is old enough to comprehend the consequences of his conduct that he must not know papa said william who had been leaning mournfully over the table one of ready's last injunctions was that tommy was never to be told of it his last wishes shall be religiously attended to my dear boy replied mr seagrave for what do we not owe to that good old man when others deserted us and left us to perish he remained with us to share our fate by his skill we were saved and landed in safety he provided for our wants added to our comforts instructed us how to make the best use of our means without his precautions we should have perished by the spears of the savages what an example of christian fortitude and humility did he ever show us and indeed i may truly say that by his example sinful as i must ever be i have become i trust a better man would that he were now sitting by us but the lord's will be done i feel as if i had lost a stay or prop replied mrs seagrave so accustomed have i been to look to him for advice since we have been on this island had he not been thus snatched from us had he been spared to us a few years and had we been permitted to surround his death bed and close his eyes in peace and mrs seagrave wept upon the shoulder of her husband after a time mrs seagrave recovered herself but silence ensued only broken by an occasional sob from poor juno william's heart was too full he could not for a long while utter a word at last he said in a low voice i feel that next to my dear father and mother i have lost my best friend i cannot forgive myself for allowing him to go for the water it was my duty to go and i ought to have gone and yet we could have ill spared you my dear boy you might have perished replied mrs seagrave it would have been as god willed replied william i might have perished or i might not we never know what the morrow may bring forth said mr seagrave or what may be in store for us had not this misfortune happened had old ready been spared to us how joyfully should i and all of you have quitted this island full of anticipation and indulging in worldly prospects what a check have i received i now am all thought and anxiety i have said to myself we have been happy on this island our wants have been supplied even our comforts have been great we have been under no temptations for we have been isolated from the world am i so sure that i shall be as happy in future as i have been am i confident now my long wished for return to the world is about to take place that i shall have no cause to lament that i ever quitted this peaceful quiet spot' i feel that it is a duty to my family that i should return to society but i am far from feeling that our happiness may be increased we have however a plain precept to follow which is to do our duty in that state of life to which it has pleased god to call us yes replied mrs seagrave i feel the truth of all you have just said we are in his hands let us put our trust in him we will replied mr seagrave but it is late and we have to rise early to morrow morning this is the last evening which we shall pass on this island let us return our thanks for the happiness we have enjoyed here we thought to have quitted this spot in joy it is his will that we should leave it in sorrow mr seagrave took down the bible and after he had read a chapter he poured forth a prayer suited to their feelings and they all retired to repose the next morning they were up early and packed up the few articles which still remained to go on board mr seagrave read the prayers and they went to breakfast few words were exchanged for there was a solemn grief upon all of them they waited for the arrival of captain osborn and the crew of the schooner to attend the funeral of poor old ready william who had gone out occasionally to look at the vessel now came in and said that two boats were pulling on shore a few minutes afterwards captain osborn and the commander of the schooner soon made their appearance the coffin had been brought on shore the body of ready was put into it and it was screwed down in half an hour all was prepared and the family were summoned from the house the coffin covered with the union jack as a pall was raised on the shoulders of six of the seamen and they bore it to the grave followed by mrs seagrave and the children the commander of the schooner and several of the men mr seagrave read the funeral service the grave was filled up and they all walked back in silence at the request of william the commander of the schooner had ordered the carpenter to prepare an oak paling to put round the grave and a board on which was written the name of the deceased and day of his death as soon as this had been fixed up william with a deep sigh followed the commander of the schooner to the house to announce that all was finished and that the boat waited for them to embark come my dear said mr seagrave to his wife i will i will replied mrs seagrave but i don't know how it is now that the hour is come i really feel such pain at quitting this dear island had it not been for poor ready's death i really do think i should wish to remain i don't doubt but that you feel sorrow my dear but we must not keep captain osborn waiting as mr seagrave was aware that the commander of the schooner was anxious to get clear of the islands before night he now led his wife down to the boat they all embarked and were soon on the deck of the schooner from whence they continued to fix their eyes upon the island while the men were heaving up the anchor at last sail was made upon the vessel the garden point was cleared and as they ran away with a fair wind each object on the shore became more indistinct still their eyes were turned in that direction as they ran down to the westward they passed the cove where they had first landed and mr seagrave directed mrs seagrave's attention to it she remained for some time looking at it in silence and then said as she turned away we shall never be more happy than we were on that island seagrave it will indeed be well my dear if we never are less happy replied her husband the schooner now ran fast through the water and the island was every minute less distinct after a time the land was below the horizon and the tops of the cocoa nut trees only to be seen these gradually disappeared juno watched on and when at last nothing could be seen she waved her handkerchief in the direction of the island as if to bid it farewell and then went down below to hide her grief the wind continued fair and after a favourable passage of little more than four weeks they arrived at sydney cove the port to which they were bound when they embarked from england on board of the good ship pacific ps as my young readers will probably wish to know a little more about the seagrave family i will inform them that mr seagrave like the patriarch job after his tribulation found his flocks and herds greatly increased on his arrival at sydney mr and mrs seagrave lived to see all their children grown up william inherited the greater part of the property from his father after having for many years assisted him in the management of it tommy notwithstanding all his scrapes grew up a very fine fellow and entered the army caroline married a young clergyman and made him an excellent wife little albert went into the navy and is at present a commander juno is still alive and lives at seagrave plantation with william and her greatest pleasure is to take his children on her knee and tell them long stories about the island and make them cry when she goes through the history of old ready's death and burial

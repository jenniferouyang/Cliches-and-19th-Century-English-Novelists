repulsed with loss to mistress respected madam in compliance with your request i shall now transcribe from the journal of my younger days some portions of my adventurous life when i wrote i painted the feelings of my heart without reserve and i shall not alter one word as i know you wish to learn what my feelings were then and not what my thoughts may be now they say that in every mans life however obscure his position may be there would be a moral found were it truly told i think madam when you have perused what i am about to write you will agree with me that from my history both old and young may gather profit and i trust if ever it should be made public that by divine permission such may be the result without further preface i shall commence with a narrative of my cruise off hispaniola in the revenge privateer the revenge mounted fourteen guns and was commanded by captain weatherall a very noted privateersman one morning at daybreak we discovered a vessel from the masthead and immediately made all sail in chase crowding every stitch of canvas as we neared we made her out to be a large ship deeply laden and we imagined that she would be an easy prize but as we saw her hull more out of the water she proved to be well armed having a full tier of guns fore and aft as it afterwards proved she was a vessel of tons burden and mounted twentyfour guns having sailed from st domingo and being bound to france she had been chartered by a french gentleman and a most gallant fellow we found him who had acquired a large fortune in the westindies and was then going home having embarked on board his whole property as well as his wife and his only son a youth of about seventeen as soon as he discovered what we were and the impossibility of escape from so fast a sailing vessel as the revenge he resolved to fight us to the last indeed he had every thing to fight for his whole property his wife and his only child his own liberty and perhaps life were all at stake and he had every motive that could stimulate a man as we subsequently learnt he had great difficulty in inspiring the crew with an equal resolution and it was not until he had engaged to pay them the value of half the cargo provided they succeeded in beating us off and forcing their way in safety to france that he could rouse them to their duty won by his example for he told them that he did not desire any man to do more than he would do himself and perhaps more induced by his generous offer the french crew declared they would support him to the last went cheerfully to their guns and prepared for action when we were pretty near to him he shortened sail ready for the combat having tenderly forced his wife down below to await in agony the issue of a battle on which depended every thing so dear to her the resolute bearing of the vessel and the cool intrepidity with which they had hove to to await us made us also prepare on our side for a combat which we knew would be severe although she was superior to us in guns yet the revenge being wholly fitted for war we had many advantages independent of our being very superior in men some few chaseguns were fired during our approach when having ranged up within a cables length of her we exchanged broadsides for half an hour after which our captain determined upon boarding we ran our vessel alongside and attempted to throw our men on board but met with a stout resistance the french gentleman who was at the head of his men with his own hand killed two of our stoutest seamen and mortally wounded a third and encouraged by his example his people fought with such resolution that after a severe struggle we were obliged to give it up and retreat precipitately into our own vessel leaving eight or ten of our shipmates weltering in their blood our captain who had not boarded with us was much enraged at our defeat stigmatizing us as cowards for allowing ourselves to be driven from a deck upon which we had obtained a footing he called upon us to renew the combat and leading the way he was the first on board of the vessel and was engaged hand to hand with the brave french gentleman who had already made such slaughter among our men brave and expert with his weapon as captain weatherall undoubtedly was he for once found rather more than a match in his antagonist he was slightly wounded and would i suspect have had the worst of this handtohand conflict had not the whole of our crew who had now gained the deck and were rushing forward separated him from his opponent outnumbered and overmatched the french crew fought most resolutely but notwithstanding their exertions and the gallant conduct of their leader we succeeded in driving them back to the quarterdeck of the vessel here the combat was renewed with the greatest obstinacy they striving to maintain this their last hold and we exerting ourselves to complete our conquest the frenchmen could retreat no further and our foremost men were impelled against them by those behind them crowding on to share in the combat retreat being cut off the french struggled with all the animosity and rage of mingled hate and despair while we infuriated at the obstinate resistance were filled with vengeance and a thirst for blood wedged into one mass we grappled together for there was no room for fair fighting seeking each others hearts with shortened weapons struggling and falling together on the deck rolling among the dead and the dying or trodden underfoot by the others who still maintained the combat with unabated fury numbers at last prevailed we had gained a dearbought victorywe were masters of the deck we had struck the colours and were recovering our lost breaths after this very severe contest and thought ourselves in full possession of the ship but it proved otherwise the first lieutenant of the privateer and six of us had dashed down the companion and were entering the cabin in search of plunder when we found opposed to our entrance the gallant french gentleman supported by his son the captain of the vessel and five of the french sailors behind them was the french gentlemans wife to whose protection they had devoted themselves the lieutenant who headed us offered them quarter but stung to madness at the prospect of the ruin and of the captivity which awaited him the gentleman treated the offer with contempt and rushing forward attacked our lieutenant beating down his guard and was just about to pierce him with the lunge which he made when i fired my pistol at him to save the life of my officer the ball entered his heart and thus died one of the bravest men i ever encountered his son at the same time was felled to the deck with a poleaxe when the remainder threw themselves down on the deck and cried for quarter so enraged were our men at this renewal of the combat that it required all the efforts and authority of the lieutenant to prevent them from completing the massacre by taking the lives of those who no longer resisted but who could paint the condition of that unhappy lady who had stood a witness of the horrid sceneher eyes blasted with the sight of her husband slain before her face her only son groaning on the deck and weltering in his blood and she left alone bereft of all that was dear to her stripped of the wealth she was that morning mistress of now a widow perhaps childless a prisoner a beggar and in the hands of lawless ruffians whose hands were reeking with her husbands and offsprings blood at their mercy and exposed to every evil which must befal a beautiful and unprotected female from those who were devoid of all principle all pity and all fear well might the frantic creature rush as she did upon our weapons and seek that death which would have been a mercy and a blessing with difficulty we prevented her from injuring herself and after a violent struggle nature yielded and she sank down in a swoon on the body of her husband dabbling her clothes and hair in the gore which floated on the cabindeck this scene of misery shocked even the actors in it our sailors accustomed as they were to blood and rapine remained silent and immoveable resting upon their weapons their eyes fixed upon the unconscious form of that unhappy lady the rage of battle was now over our passions had subsided and we felt ashamed of a conquest purchased with such unutterable anguish the noise of this renewed combat had brought down the captain he ordered the lady to be taken away from this scene of horror and to be carefully tended in his own cabin the wound of the son who was found still alive was immediately dressed and the prisoners were secured i returned on deck still oppressed with the scene i had witnessed and when i looked round me and beheld the deck strewed with the dead and dyingvictors and vanquished indiscriminately mixed up togetherthe blood of both nations meeting on the deck and joining their streamsi could not help putting the question to myself can this be right and lawfulall this carnage to obtain the property of others and made legal by the quarrels of kings reason religion and humanity answered no i remained uneasy and dissatisfied and felt as if i were a murderer and then i reflected how this property thus wrested from its former possessor who might if he had retained it have done much good with it would now be squandered away in riot and dissipation in purchasing crime and administering to debauchery i was young then and felt so disgusted and so angry with myself and everybody else that if i had been in england i probably should never again have put my foot on board of a privateer but employment prevented my thinking the decks had to be cleaned the bodies thrown overboard the blood washed from the white planks the wounded to be removed and their hurts dressed the rigging and other damages to be repaired and when all this had been done we made sail for jamaica with our prize our captain who was as kind and gentle to the vanquished as he was brave and resolute in action endeavoured by all the means he could think of to soften the captivity and sufferings of the lady her clothes jewels and every thing belonging to her were preserved untouched he would not even allow her trunks to be searched and would have secured for her even all her husbands personal effects but the crew had seized upon them as plunder and refused to deliver them up i am almost ashamed to say that the sword and watch of her husband fell to my lot and whether from my wearing the sword or from having seen me fire the pistol which had killed him the lady always expressed her abhorrence of me whenever i entered her presence her son recovered slowly from his wound and on our arrival at port royal was permitted by the admiral to be sent to the kings hospital and the lady who was most tenderly attached to him went on shore and remained at the hospital to attend upon him i was glad when she was gone for i knew how much cause she had for her hatred of me and i could not see her without remorse as soon as we had completed our repairs filled up our provisions and water we sailed upon another cruise which was not so successful as you will presently perceive for five or six weeks we cruised without success and our people began to grumble when one morning our boats in shore off hispaniola surprised a small schooner a negro who was among the prisoners offered to conduct us through the woods by night to the house of a very rich planter which was situated about three miles from a small bay and at some distance from the other plantations he asserted that we might there get very valuable plunder and moreover obtain a large ransom for the planter and his family besides bringing away as many of the negro slaves as we pleased our captain who was tired of his illsuccess and who hoped also to procure provisions which we very much wanted consented to the negros proposal and standing down abreast of the bay which was in the bight of lugan he ran in at dark and anchoring close to the shore we landed with forty men and guided by the negro we proceeded through the woods to the house the negro was tied fast to one of our stoutest and best men for fear he should give us the slip it was a bright moonlight we soon arrived and surrounding the house forced our way in without opposition having secured the negroes in the outhouses and placed guards over them and videttes on the lookout to give timely notice of any surprise we proceeded to our work of plunder the family consisting of the old planter and his wife and his three daughters two of them very beautiful was secured in one room no words can express their terror at thus finding themselves so suddenly in the power of a set of ruffians from whose brutality they anticipated every evil indeed the horrid excesses committed by the privateersmen when they landed on the coast fully justified their fears for as this system of marauding is considered the basest of all modern warfare no quarter is ever given to those who are taken in the attempt in return the privateersmen hesitate at no barbarity when engaged in such enterprises dumb with astonishment and terror the old couple sat in silent agony while the poor girls who had more evils than death to fear drowned in their tears fell at the captains feet and embraced his knees conjuring him to spare and protect them from his men captain weatherall who was as i have before stated a generous and humane man raised them up assuring them on his word that they should receive no insult and as his presence was necessary to direct the motions of his people he selected me as younger and less brutal than most of his crew as a guard over them menacing me with death if i allowed any man to enter the room until he returned and ordering me to defend them with my life from all insults i was then young and full of enthusiasm my heart was kind and i was pure in comparison with the major portion of those with whom i was associated i was delighted with the office confided to me and my heart leaped at having so honourable an employment i endeavoured by every means in my power to dissipate their terrors and soothe their anxious minds but while i was thus employed an irish seaman distinguished even amongst our crew for his atrocities came to the door and would have forced his entrance i instantly opposed him urging the captains most positive commands but having obtained a sight of the young females he swore with a vile oath that he would soon find out whether a boy like me was able to oppose him and finding that i would not give way he attacked me fiercely fortunately i had the advantage of position and supported by the justice of my cause i repelled him with success but he renewed the attack while the poor young women awaited the issue of the combat with trembling anxietya combat on which depended in all probability their honour and their lives at last i found myself very hard pushed for i had received a wound on my sword arm and i drew a pistol from my belt with my lefthand and fired it wounding him in the shoulder thus disabled and fearing at the same time that the report would bring back the captain whom he well knew would not be trifled with he retired from the door vowing vengeance i then turned to the young women who had witnessed the conflict in breathless suspense encircled in the arms of the poor old couple who had rushed towards them at the commencement of the fray offering them their useless shelter privateersman as i was i could not refrain from tears at the scene i again attempted to reassure them pledged myself in the most solemn manner to forfeit my life if necessary for their protection and they in some degree regained their confidence they observed the blood trickling down my fingers from the wound which i had received and the poor girls stained their handkerchiefs with it in the attempts to staunch the flow but this scene was soon interrupted by an alarm it appeared that a negro had contrived to escape and to rouse the country they had collected together from the other plantations and our party being as is usually the case when plunder is going on very negligent the videttes were surprised and had hardly time to escape and apprise us of our danger there was not a moment to be lost our safety depended upon an immediate retreat the captain collected all hands and while he was getting them together that the retreat might be made in good order the old planter who by the report of the firearms and the bustle and confusion without guessed what had taken place pressed me to remain with them urging the certainty of our men being overpowered and the merciless consequences which would ensue he pledged himself with his fingers crossed in the form of the crucifix that he would procure me safe quarter and that i should ever enjoy his protection and friendship i refused him kindly but firmly and he sighed and said no more the old lady put a ring on my finger which she took from her own hand and kissing my forehead told me to look at that ring and continue to do good and act nobly as i had just done i waved my hand for i had no time even to take the proffered hands of the young ones and hastened to join my shipmates already on the retreat and exchanging shots with our pursuers we were harassed by a multitude but they were a mixed company of planters mulattoes and slaves and not half of them armed and we easily repelled their attacks whenever they came to close quarters their violent animosity however against us and our evil doings induced them to follow close at our heels keeping up a galling irregular fire and endeavouring to detain us until we might be overpowered by their numbers every minute increasing for the whole country had been raised and were flocking in this our captain was well aware of and therefore made all the haste that he could without disturbing the regularity of his retreat to where our boats were lying as should they be surprised and cut off our escape would have been impossible notwithstanding all his care several of our men were separated from us by the intricacies of the wood or from wounds which they had received and which prevented them from keeping up with us at last after repelling many attacks each time more formidable than the preceding we gained our boats and embarking with the greatest precipitation we put off for the schooner the enemy emboldened by our flight flocked down in great numbers to the waters edge and we had the mortification to hear our stragglers who had been captured imploring for mercy but groans and then silence too plainly informed us that mercy had been denied captain weatherall was so enraged at the loss of his men that he ordered us to pull back and attack the enemy on the beach but we continued to pull for the schooner regardless of his threats and entreaties a panic had seized us all as well it might we even dreaded the illaimed and irregular fire which they poured upon us which under other circumstances would have occasioned only laughter the schooner had been anchored only two hundred yards from the beach and we were soon on board they continued to fire from the shore and the balls passed over us we put a spring upon our cable warped our broadside to the beach and loading every gun with grape and cannister we poured a whole broadside upon our assailants from the shrieks and cries the carnage must have been very great the men would have reloaded and fired again but the captain forbade them saying we have done too much already i thought so too he then ordered the anchor to be weighed and with a fresh landbreeze we were soon far away from this unlucky spot chapter ii we are pursued by two schoonerprivateers and failing to escape them a terrible contest ensuesthree acts of a murderous naval dramawe are worstedcaptain weatherall is killedi am plundered and wounded about six weeks after the unlucky affair before described we met with a still greater disaster we had cruised off the spanish main and taken several prizes shortly after we had manned the last and had parted company the revenge being then close in shore a fresh gale sprung up which compelled us to make all sail to clear the land we beat off shore during the whole of the night when the weather moderated and at daybreak we found out that we had not gained much offing in consequence of the current but what was more important the man who went to the lookout at the masthead hailed the deck saying there were two sail in the offing the hands were turned up to make sail in chase but we found that they were resolutely bearing down upon us and as we neared each other fast we soon made them out to be vessels of force one we knew wellshe was the esperance a french schoonerprivateer of sixteen guns and one hundred and twentymen the other proved to be a spanish schoonerprivateer cruising in company with her of eighteen guns and full manned now our original complement of men had been something more than one hundred but by deaths severe wounds in action and manning our prizes our actual number on board was reduced to fiftyfive effective men finding the force so very superior we made every attempt with sails and sweeps to escape but the land to leeward of us and their position to windward rendered it impossible making therefore a virtue of necessity we put a good face upon it and prepared to combat against such desperate odds captain weatherall who was the life and soul of his crew was not found wanting on such an emergency with the greatest coolness and intrepidity he gave orders to take in all the small sails and awaited the coming down of the enemy when every thing was ready for the unequal conflict he ordered all hands aft and endeavoured to inspire us with the same ardour which animated himself he reminded us that we had often fought and triumphed over vessels of much greater force than our own that we had already beaten off the french privateer on a former occasion that the spaniard was not worth talking about except to swell the merits of the double victory and that if once we came hand to hand our cutlasses would soon prove our superiority he reminded us that our only safety depended upon our own manhood for we had done such mischief on the coast and our recent descent upon the plantation was considered in such a light that we must not expect to receive quarter if we were overcome exhorting us to behave well and to fight stoutly he promised us the victory the men had such confidence in the captain that we returned him three cheers when dismissing us to our quarters he ordered st georges ensign to be hoisted at the mainmasthead and hove to for the enemy the french schooner was the first which ranged up alongside the wind was light and she came slowly down to us the captain of her hailed saying that his vessel was the esperance and our captain replied that he knew it and that they also knew that his was the revenge the french captain who had hove to replied very courteously that he was well aware what vessel it was and also of the valour and distinguished reputation of captain weatherall upon which captain weatherall who stood on the gunnel took off his hat in acknowledgment of the compliment now captain weatherall was well known and it was also well known that the two vessels would meet with a severe resistance which it would be as well to avoid as even if they gained the victory it would not be without great loss of men the french captain therefore addressed captain weatherall again and said he hoped now that he was opposed to so very superior a force he would not make a useless resistance but as it would be no disgrace to him and would save the lives of many of his brave men his well known humanity would induce him to strike his colours to this request our commander gave a gallant and positive refusal the vessels lay now close to each other so that a biscuit might have been thrown on board of either a generous expostulation ensued which continued till the spanish vessel was a short distance astern of us you now see our force said the french captain do not fight against impossible odds but spare your brave and devoted men in return for your kind feeling towards me replied captain weatherall i offer you both quarter and respect to private property upon hauling down your colours you are mad captain weatherall said the french captain you allow that i have lived bravely replied captain weatherall you shall find that i will conquer you and if necessary i will also die bravely we will now fight in courtesy i offer you the first broadside impossible said the french captain taking off his hat our captain returned the salute and then slipping down from the gunwale ordered the sails to be filled and after a minute to give the frenchman time to prepare he fired off in the air the fusee which he held in his hand as a signal for the action to begin we instantly commenced the work of death by pouring in a broadside it was returned with equal spirit and a furious cannonading ensued for several minutes when the spaniard ranged up on our lee quarter with his rigging full of men to board us clapping our helm aweather and hauling our fore sheets to windward we fell off athwart his hawse and raked him with several broadsides fore and aft our guns having been loaded with langridge and lead bullets and his men being crowded together forward ready to leap on board of us her deck became a slaughterhouse the officers endeavoured in vain to animate their men who instead of gaining our decks were so intimidated by the carnage that they forsook their own the frenchman perceiving the consternation and distress of his consort to give her an opportunity of extricating herself from her perilous condition now put his helm aweather ran us on board and poured in his men but we were well prepared and soon cleared our decks of the intruders in the meantime the spaniard by cutting away our rigging in which his bowsprit was entangled swung clear of us and fell away to leeward the frenchman perceiving this sheered off and springing his luff shot ahead clear of us such was the first act of this terrible drama we had as yet sustained little damage the enemys want of skill and our own good fortune combined having enabled us to take them at such a disadvantage but although inspirited by such a prosperous beginning our inferiority in men was so great that our captain considered it his duty to make all sail in hopes of being able to avoid such an unequal combat this our enemies attempted to prevent by a most furious cannonade which we received and returned without flinching making a running fight of it till at last our fore yard and foretopmast being shot away we had no longer command of the vessel finding that although we were crippled and could not escape our fire continued unabated both the vessels again made preparations for boarding us while we on our part prepared to give them a warm reception as we knew that the frenchman who was our most serious opponent must board us on our weather bow we traversed over four of our guns loaded to the muzzle with musket balls to receive him and being all ready with our pateraroes and hand grenades we waited for the attack as he bore down for our bows with all his men clinging like bees ready for the spring our guns were discharged and the carnage was terrible the men staggered back falling down over those who had been killed or wounded and it required all the bravery and example of the french captain who was really a noble fellow to rally the remainder of his men which at last he succeeded in doing and about forty of them gained our forecastle from which they forced our weak crew and retained possession not following up the success but apparently wailing till they were seconded by the spaniards boarding us on our lee quarter which would have placed us between two fires and compelled us to divide our small force by this time the wind which had been light left us and it was nearly a calm with a swell on the sea which separated the two vessels the spaniard who was ranging up under our lee having but little way and not luffing enough could not fetch us but fell off and drifted to leeward the frenchmen who had been thrown on board and who retained possession of our forecastle being thus left without support from their own vessel which had been separated from us by the swell or from the spaniard which had fallen to leeward we gave three cheers and throwing a number of handgrenades in among them we rushed forward with our halfpikes and killed or drove every soul of them overboard one only and he wounded in the thigh escaped by swimming back to his own vessel here then was a pause in the conflict and thus ended i may say the second act hitherto the battle had been fought with generous resolution but after this handtohand conflict and the massacre with which it ended both sides appeared to have been roused to ferocity a most infernal cannonade was now renewed by both our antagonists and returned by us with equal fury but it was now a dead calm and the vessels rolled so much with the swell that the shot were not so effective by degrees we separated more and more from our enemies and the firing was now reduced to single guns during this partial cessation our antagonists had drawn near to each other although at a considerable distance from us we perceived that the spaniard was sending two of his boats full of men to supply the heavy loss sustained by his comrade captain weatherall ordered the sweeps out and we swept our broadside to them trying by single guns to sink the boats as they went from one vessel to the other after two or three attempts a gun was successful the shot shattered the first of the boats which instantly filled and went down the second boat pulled up and endeavoured to save the men but we now poured our broadside upon them and daunted by the shot flying about them they sought their own safety by pulling back to the vessel leaving their sinking companions to their fate failing in this attempt both vessels recommenced their fire upon us but the distance and the swell of the sea prevented any execution and at last they ceased firing waiting till a breeze should spring up which might enable them to renew the contest with better success at this time it was about eleven oclock in the forenoon and the combat had lasted about five hours we refreshed ourselves after the fatigue and exertion which we had undergone and made every preparation for a renewal of the fight during the engagement we were so excited that we had no time to think but now that we were cool again and unoccupied we had time to reflect upon our position and we began to feel dejected and apprehensive fatigued with exertion we were weak and dispirited we knew that our best men were slain or groaning under their severe wounds that the enemy were still numerous and as they persevered after so dreadful a slaughter that they were of unquestionable bravery and resolution good fortune and our captains superior seamanship had up to the present enabled us to make a good fight but fortune might desert us and our numbers were so reduced that if the enemy continued resolute we must be overpowered our gallant captain perceived the despondency that prevailed and endeavoured to remove it by his own example and by persuasion after praising us for the resolution and courage we had already shown he pointed out to us that whatever might be the gallantry of the officers it was clear that the men on board of the opposing vessels were awed by their heavy loss and want of success and that if they made one more attempt to take us by the board and failed which he trusted they would do no persuasion would ever induce them to try it again and the captains of the vessels would give over such an unprofitable combat he solemnly averred that the colours should never be struck while he survived and demanded who amongst us were base enough to refuse to stand by them again we gave him three cheers but our numbers were few and the cheers were faint compared with the first which had been given but still we were resolute and determined to support our captain and the honour of our flag captain weatherall took care that this feeling should not subsidehe distributed the grog plentifully at our desire he nailed the colours to the mast and we waited for a renewal of the combat with impatience at four oclock in the afternoon a breeze sprang up and both vessels trimmed their sails and neared us fastnot quite in such gallant trim as in the morning it is truebut they appeared now to have summoned up a determined resolution silently they came up forcing their way slowly through the water not a gun was fired but the gaping mouths of the cannon and their men motionless at their quarters portended the severity of the struggle which was now to decide this hitherto wellcontested trial for victory when within half a cables length we saluted them with three cheers they returned our defiance and running up on each side of us the combat was renewed with bitterness the frenchman would not this time lay us on board until he was certain that the spaniard had boarded us to leewardhe continued luffing to windward and plying us with broadsides until we were grappled with the spaniard and then he bore down and laid his gunwale on our bow the spaniard had already boarded us on the quarter and we were repelling this attack when the frenchman laid us on the bow we fought with desperation and our pikes gave us such an advantage over the swords and knives of the spaniards that they gave ground and appalled by the desperate resistance they encountered quitted our decks strewed with their dead and dying shipmates and retreated in confusion to their own vessel but before this repulse had been effected the french had boarded us on the weatherbow and driving before them the few men who had been sent forward to resist them had gained our main deck and forced their way to the rise of the quarterdeck where all our remaining men were now collected the combat was now desperate but after a time our pikes and the advantage of our position appeared to prevail over numbers we drove them before uswe had regained the main deck when our brave commander who was at our head and who had infused spirit into us all received a bullet through his right wrist shifting his sword into his left hand he still pressed forward encouraging us when a ball entered his breast and he dropped dead with his fall fell the courage and fortitude of his crew so long sustainedand to complete the mischief the lieutenant and two remaining officers also fell a few seconds after him astonished and terrified the men stopped short in their career of success and wildly looked round for a leader the french who had retreated to the forecastle perceiving our confusion renewed the attack our few remaining men were seized with a panic and throwing down our arms we asked for quarter where a moment before victory was in our handssuch was the finale of our bloody drama out of fiftyfive men twentytwo had been killed in this murderous conflict and almost all the survivors desperately or severely wounded most of the remaining crew after we had cried for quarter jumped down the hatchway to avoid the cutlasses of their enraged victors i and about eight others having been driven past the hatchway threw down our arms and begged for quarter which we had little reason to expect would be shown to us at first no quarter was given by our savage enemies who cut down several of our disarmed men and hacked them to pieces perceiving this i got on the gunwale ready to jump overboard in the hopes of being taken up after the slaughter had ceased when a french lieutenant coming up protected us and saved the poor remains of our crew from the fury of his men our lives however were all he counted upon preservingwe were instantly stripped and plundered without mercy i lost every thing i possessed the watch ring and sword i had taken from the gallant frenchman were soon forced from me and not stripping off my apparel fast enough to please a mulatto sailor i received a blow with the buttend of a pistol under the left ear which precipitated me down the hatchway near which i was standing and i fell senseless into the hold chapter iii we are sent in on board the revenge and treated with great crueltyare afterwards recaptured by the hero privateer and retaliate on the frenchi am taken to the hospital at port royal where i meet the french ladyher savage exultation at my conditionshe is punished by one of my comrades on coming to my senses i found myself stripped naked and suffering acute pain i found that my right arm was broken my shoulder severely injured by my fall and as i had received three severe cutlasswounds during the action i had lost so much blood that i had not strength to rise or do any thing for myself there i lay groaning and naked upon the ballast of the vessel at times ruminating upon the events of the action upon the death of our gallant commander upon the loss of our vessel of so many of our comrades and of our liberty after some time the surgeon by the order of the french commander came down to dress my wounds he treated me with the greatest barbarity as he twisted about my broken limb i could not help crying at the anguish which he caused me he compelled me to silence by blows and maledictions wishing i had broken my rascally neck rather than he should have been put to the trouble of coming down to dress me however dress me he did out of fear of his captain who he knew well would send round to see if he had executed his orders and then he left me with a kick in the ribs by way of remembrance shortly afterwards the vessels separated fourteen of us who were the most severely hurt were left in the revenge which was manned by an officer and twenty frenchmen with orders to take her into portaupaix the rest of our men were put on board of the french privateer who sailed away in search of a more profitable adventure about an hour after they had made sail on the vessel the officer who had charge of her looking down the hatchway and perceiving my naked and forlorn condition threw me a pair of trousers which had been rejected by the french seamen as not worth having and a check shirt in an equally ragged condition i picked up in the hold this with a piece of old rope to tie round my neck as a sling for my broken arm was my whole wardrobe in the evening i gained the deck that i might be refreshed by the breeze which cooled my feverish body and somewhat restored me we remained in this condition for several days tortured with pain but more tortured perhaps by the insolence and bragging of the frenchmen who set no bounds to their triumph and selfapplause among those who had charge of the prize were two one of whom had my watch and the other my ring the first would hold it to me grinning and asking if monsieur would like to know what oclock it was and the other would display the ring and tell me that his sweetheart would value it when she knew that it was taken from a conquered englishman this was their practice every day and i was compelled to receive their gibes without venturing a retort on the eleventh day after our capture when close to portaupaix and expecting we should be at anchor before nightfall we perceived a great hurry and confusion on deck they were evidently making all the sail that they could upon the vessel and then hearing them fire off their sternchasers we knew for certain that they were pursued overjoyed at the prospect of being released we gave three cheers the french from the deck threatened to fire down upon us but we knew that they dared not for the revenge was so crippled in the fight that they could not put sail upon her so as to escape and their force on board was too small to enable them to resist if overtakenwe therefore continued our exulting clamours at last we heard guns fired and the shot whizzing over the vessela shot or two struck our hull and soon afterwards a broadside being poured into us the frenchmen struck their colours and we had the satisfaction of seeing all these gasconaders driven down into the hold to take our places it was now their turn to be dejected and downcast and for us to be merry and now also the tables had to be turned and we took the liberty of regaining possession of our clothes and other property which they carried on their backs and in their pockets i must say we showed them no mercy what oclock is it monsieur said i to the fellow who had my watch at your service sir he replied humbly taking out my watch and presenting it to me thank you said i taking the watch and saluting him with a kick in the stomach which made him double up and turn round from me upon which i gave him another kick in the rear to straighten him again that ring monsieur that your sweetheart will prize here it is replied the fellow abjectly thank you sir i replied saluting him with the double kick which i had given to the former tell your sweetheart i sent her those cried i that is when you get back to her hark ye brother cries one of our men ill trouble you for that jacket which you borrowed of me the other day and in return here are a pair of iron garters holding out the shackles which you must wear for my sakei think they will fit you well mounseer cries another that wig of mine dont suit your complexion ill trouble you for it its a pity such a face as yours should be disfigured in those curls and while you are about it ill thank you to strip altogether as i think your clothes will fit me and are much too gay for a prisoner i was left naked through your kindness the other day said i to another who was well and smartly dressed ill thank you to strip to your skin or you shall have no skin left and i commenced with my knife cutting his ears as if i would skin them it was a lucky hit of mine for in his sash i found about twenty doubloons he would have saved them and held them tight but after my knife had entered his side about half an inch he surrendered the prize after we had plundered and stripped them of every thing we set to to kick them and we did it for half an hour so effectually that they were all left groaning in a heap on the ballast and we then found our way on deck the privateer which had recaptured us proved to be the hero of new providence the frenchmen were taken out and some of her own men put in to take us to port royal we being wounded and not willing to join her remained on board on our arrival at port royal we obtained permission to go to the kings hospital to be cured as i went up stairs to the ward allotted to me i met the french lady whose husband had been killed and who was still nursing her son at the hospital his wounds not having been yet cured notwithstanding my altered appearance she knew me again immediately and seeing me pale and emaciated with my arm in a sling she dropped down on her knees and thanked god for returning upon our heads a portion of the miseries we had brought upon her she was delighted when she heard how many of us had been slain in the murderous conflict and even rejoiced at the death of poor captain weatherall which considering how very kind and considerate he had been to her i thought to be very unchristian it so happened that i was not only in the same ward but in the cradle next to her son and the excitement i had been under when we were recaptured and my exertion in kicking the frenchmen had done me no good a fever was the consequence and i suffered dreadfully and she would look at me exulting in my agony and mocking my groans till at last the surgeon told her it was by extreme favour that her son had been admitted into the hospital instead of being sent to prison and that if she did not behave herself in a proper manner he would order her to be denied admittance altogether and that if she dared to torment suffering men in that way on the first complaint on my part her son should go to the gaol and finish his cure there this brought her to her senses and she begged pardon and promised to offend no more but she did not keep her word for more than a day or two but laughed out loud when the surgeon was dressing my arm for a piece of bone had to be taken out and i shrieked with anguish this exasperated one of my messmates so much that not choosing to strike her and knowing how to wound her still worse he drove his fist into the head of her son as he lay in his cradle and by so doing reopened the wound that had been nearly healed theres pain for you to laugh at you french devil he cried and sure enough it cost the poor young man his life the surgeon was very angry with the man but told the french lady as she kneeled sobbing by the side of her son that she had brought it upon herself and him by her own folly and cruelty i know not whether she felt so or whether she dreaded a repetition but this is certain she tormented me no more on the contrary i think she suffered very severely as she perceived that i rapidly mended and that her poor son got on but slowly at last my hurts were all healed and i left the hospital hoping never to see her more chapter iv sail for liverpool in the sally and kittyfall in with a galeboy overboardnearly drowned in attempting to save himsee the owners at liverpoolembark in the dalrymple for the coast of africaarrive off senegal a great deal of prizemoney being due to us i called upon the agent at port royal to obtain an advance i found him in a puzzle owing to the death of captain weatherall and so many of the officers he hardly knew whether those who applied to him were entitled to prizemoney or not whether he thought i appeared more honest than the others or from what cause i know not he requested me as i knew every thing that had passed to remain with him for a short time and finding that i could read and write well he obtained from me correct lists of the privateers crew with those who were killed and on what occasion all this information i was able to give him as well as the ratings of the parties for on more than one occasion the privateersmen had come to him representing themselves as petty officers when they were only common seamen on board and had in consequence received from him a larger advance than they were entitled to as soon as his accounts were pretty well made up he asked me whether i intended to go to england as if so he would send me home with all the papers and documents to the owner at liverpool who would require my assistance to arrange the accounts and as i had had quite enough of privateering for a time i consented to go about two months after leaving the hospital during which i had passed a very pleasant life and quite recovered from my wounds and injuries i sailed for liverpool in the sally and kitty westindiaman commanded by captain clarke a very violent man we had not sailed twelve hours before we fell in with a gale which lasted several days and we kept under closereeftopsails and stormstaysails the gale lasting a week raised a mountainous swell but it was very long and regular on the seventh day the wind abated but the swell continued and at evening there was very little wind when a circumstance occurred which had nearly cost me my life as you will acknowledge madam when i relate the story to you during the dogwatch between six and eight some hands being employed in the foretop the other watch below at supper and the captain and all the officers in the cabin i being at the helm heard a voice apparently rising out of the sea calling me by name surprised i ran to the side of the ship and saw a youth named richard pallant in the water going astern he had fallen out of the forechains and knowing that i was at the helm had shouted to me for help i immediately called all hands crying a man overboard the captain hastened on deck with all the others and ordered the helm alee the ship went about and then fell round off driving fast before the swell till at last we brought her to the captain although a resolute man was much confused and perplexed at the boys dangerfor his friends were people of property at ipswich and had confided the boy to his particular care he ran backwards and forwards crying out that the boy must perish as the swell was so high that he dared not send a boat for the boat could not live in such a sea and if the boat were lost with the crew there would not be hands enow left on board to take the vessel home as the youth was not a hundred yards from the vessel i stated the possibility of swimming to him with the deepsea line which would be strong enough to haul both him and the man who swam to him on board captain clarke in a great rage swore that it was impossible and asked me who the devil would go piqued at his answer and anxious to preserve the life of the youth i offered to try it myself i stripped and making the line fast round my body plunged from the ships side into the sea it was a new deepsea line and stiff in the coil so that not drawing close round me it slipped and i swam through it but catching it as it slipped over my feet i made it secure by putting my head and one arm through the noose i swam direct for the boy and found that i swam with ease owing to the strength and buoyant nature of the water in those latitudes i had not swum more than halfway before the line got foul on the coil on board and checking me suddenly it pulled me backwards and under water i recovered myself and struck out again during this time to clear the line on board they had cut some of the entangled parts and in the confusion and hurry severed the wrong part so that the end went overboard and i had half the coil of line hanging to me and at the same time was adrift from the ship they immediately hailed me to return but from the booming of the waves i could not hear what they said and thought that they were encouraging me to proceed i shouted in return to show the confidence which i had in myself i easily mounted the waves as they breasted me but still i made my way very slowly against such a swell and saw the boy only at intervals when i was on the top of the wave he could swim very little and did not make for the ship but with his eyes fixed upon the sky paddled like a dog to keep himself above water i now began to feel the weight of the line upon me and to fear that i should never hold out i began to repent of my rashness and thought i had only sacrificed myself without any chance of saving him i persevered nevertheless and having as i guessed come to the spot where the boy was i looked round and not seeing him was afraid that he had gone down but on mounting the next wave i saw him in the hollow struggling hard to keep above water and almost spent with his long exertion i swam down to him and hailing him found he was still sensible but utterly exhausted i desired him to hold on by my hand but not to touch my body as we should both sink he promised to obey me and i held out my righthand to him and made a signal for them to haul in on board for i had no idea that the line had been cut i was frightened when i perceived the distance that the ship was from meat least a quarter of a mile i knew that the deepsea line was but a hundred fathoms in length and therefore that i must be adrift and my heart sunk within me all the horrors of my situation came upon me and i felt that i was lost but although death appeared inevitable i still struggled for lifebut the rope now weighed me down more and more while swimming forward it trailed behind and although it impeded my way i did not feel half its weight now however that i was stationary it sank deep and pulled me down with it the waves too which while i breasted them and saw them approach i easily rose over being now behind us broke over our heads burying us under them or rolling us over by their force i tried to disengage myself from the line but the noose being jammed and having the boy in one hand i could not possibly effect it but what gave me courage in my difficulties was that i perceived that the people on board were getting out the boat for although the captain would not run the risk for one person now that two were overboard and one of them risking his life for the other the men insisted that the boat should be hoisted out it was an anxious time to me but at last i had the satisfaction of seeing her clear of the ship and pulling round her bow the danger was however considered so great that when they came to man the boat only three men could be found who would go in her and in the confusion they came away with but two oars and no rudder under these disadvantages they of course pulled very slowly against a mountainous sea as they were obliged to steer with the oars to meet it that the boat might not be swamped but the sight of the boat was sufficient to keep me up my exertions were certainly incredible but what will not a man do when in fear of death as it approachedslowly and slowly did my powers decrease i was now often under water with the boy and rose again to fresh exertion when at last a crested wave broke over us and down we went several feet under the water the force of the sea drove the boy against me and he seized me by the loins with my head downwards i struggled to disengage myself it was impossible i gave myself up for lostand what a crowd of thoughts and memories passed through my brain in a few moments for it could not have been longer at last being head downwards i dived deeper although i was bursting from so long holding my breath under water this had the desired effect finding me sinking instead of rising with him the boy let go his hold that he might gain the surface i turned and followed him and drew breath once more another moment had sealed our fates i no longer thought of saving the boy but struck out for the boat which was now near me perceiving this the boy cried out to me for pitys sake not to leave him i felt myself so far recovered from my exhaustion that i thought i could save him as well as myself and compassion induced me to turn back i again gave him my hand charging him on his life not to attempt to grapple with me and again resumed the arduous struggle of keeping him as well as myself above water my strength was nearly gone the boat approached but slowly and we now sunk constantly under the water rising every few seconds to draw breath merciful god how slow appeared the approach of the boat struggle after strugglefainter and fainter stillstill i floated at last my senses almost left me i took in water in quantities i felt i was in green fields when i was seized by the men and thrown into the bottom of the boat where i lay senseless alongside of the boy there was great danger and difficulty in getting again to the ship more than once the boat was half filled by the following seas and when they gained the ship it was impossible to get us out as had they approached the side the boat would have been dashed to atoms they lowered the tackles from the yardarms the three men clambered up them leaving us to take our chance of the boat being got in or her being stove to pieces in which latter case we should have been lost they did get us in with great damage to the boat but we were saved the line was still round me and it was found that i had been supporting the weight of seventy yards so sore was i with such exertion that i kept my hammock for many days during which i reviewed my past life and vowed amendment we arrived at liverpool without any further adventure worth recording and i immediately called upon the owner with the papers intrusted to me i gave him all the information he required and he asked me whether i should like to return to privateering or to go as mate of a vessel bound to the coast of africa i inquired what her destination was to be and as i found that she was to go to senegal for ivory wax gold dust and other articles in exchange for english prints and cutlery i consented i mention this as had she been employed in the slavetrade as were most of the vessels from liverpool to the coast i would not have joined her a few days afterwards i went on board of the dalrymple captain jones as mate we had a very quick passage to senegal and brought our vessel to an anchor off the bar chapter v in crossing the bar at senegal the boat is upset by a tornadowe escape being devoured by sharks only to be captured by the nativesare taken into the interior of the country and brought before the negro king from whose wrath we are saved by the intercession of his female attendants a day or two after we had arrived the master of another vessel that was at anchor near to us came on board and borrowed our longboat and some hands that he might go in it to senegal the captain who was an old friend of the party who made the request agreed to lend it to him and as accidents are very frequent with boats crossing the bar on account of the heavy breakers the best swimmers were selected for the purpose and the charge of the boat was given to me we set off five men rowing and i at the helm when we approached the bar a tornado which had been for some time threatening came upon us the impetuosity of these blasts is to be matched in no part of the world and as it came at once in its full force we endeavoured by putting the boat before it to escape its fury this compelled us to run to the southward along the coast we managed to keep the boat up for a long while and hoped to have weathered it when being on the bar and in broken water a large wave curled over us filled the boat and it went down in an instant our only chance now was to reach the shore by swimming but it was at a distance with broken water the whole way and our great terror was from the sharks which abound on the coast and are extremely ravenousnor were we without reason for our alarm scarcely had the boat gone down and we were all stretching out for the shore when one of our men shrieked having been seized by the sharks and instantly torn to pieces his blood stained the water all around and this attracting all the sharks proved the means of our escape never shall i forget the horrible sensation which i felt as i struggled through the broken water expecting every minute a limb to be taken off by one of those voracious animals if one foot touched the other my heart sank thinking it was the nose of a shark and that its bite would immediately follow agonized with these terrors we struggled onnow a large wave curling over us and burying us under water or now forced by the waves towards the beach rolling us over and over so battered were we by the surf that we dived under the waves to escape the blows which we received and then rose and struck out again at last worn out with exertion we gained the shore but our toil was not over the beach was of a sand so light that it crumbled beneath us and at the return of the wave which threw us on shore we were dragged back again and buried in sand and water we rose to renew our endeavours but several times without success for we could not obtain a firm footing at last the negroes who had witnessed our accident and who now came down in great numbers on the beach laid hold of us as the sea threw us up and dragged us beyond the reach of the waves worn out with fatigue we lay on the sand waiting to ascertain what the savages would do with us they were not long in letting us know for they soon began to strip us of every article of clothing on our backs one of our men attempted to resist upon which a negro drove a spear through his thigh having divided our apparel after some consultation they tied our hands and placing us in the midst of a large force armed with spears and bows and arrows they went off with us for the inland part of the country we set off with heavy hearts taking as we thought a last farewell of the ocean and going forwards in great apprehension of the fate that awaited us the sand was very deep and the heat of the sun excessive for it was then about noon without any garments we were soon scorched and blistered all over and in intolerable anguish as well as fatigued but the negroes compelled us to move on goading us with their spears if we slackened our pace and threatening to run us through if we made a halt we longed for the night as it would afford a temporary relief to our sufferings it came at last and the negroes collected wood and lighted a fire to keep off the wild beasts lying round it in a circle and placing us in the midst of them we hoped to have some rest after what we had gone through but it was impossiblethe night proved even worse than the day the musquitoes came down upon us in such swarms and their bites were so intolerable that we were almost frantic our hands being tied we could not beat them off and we rolled over and over to get rid of them this made matters worse for our whole bodies being covered with raised blisters from the rays of the sun our roiling over and over broke the blisters and the sand getting into the wounds added to the bites of the musquitoes made our sufferings intolerable we had before prayed for night we now prayed for day some prayed for death when the sun rose we set off again our conductors utterly disregarding our anguish and goading us on as before in the forenoon we arrived at a village where our guards refreshed themselves a very small quantity of boiled corn was given to each of us and we continued our journey passing by several small towns consisting as they all do in that country of huts built of reeds round in form and gathered to a point at top this day was the same as the preceding we were pricked with spears if we stumbled or lagged threatened with death if we had not strength to go on at last the evening arrived and the fires were lighted the fires were much larger than before i presume because the wild beasts were more numerous for we heard them howling in every direction round us which we had not done on the night before the musquitoes did not annoy us so much and we obtained some intervals of broken rest at daylight we resumed our journey as near as we could judge by the sun in a more easterly direction during the first two days we were badly received by the inhabitants of the towns whose people had been kidnapped so often for the slavetrade they hated the sight of our white faces for they presumed that we had come for that purpose but as we advanced in the interior we were better treated and the natives looked upon us with surprise and wonder considering us as a new race of beings some of the women seeing how utterly exhausted we were with fatigue and hunger looked with compassion on us and brought us plenty of boiled corn and goats milk to drink this refreshed us greatly and we continued our journey in anxious expectation of the fate for which we were reserved on crossing a small river which appeared to be the boundary of two different states a multitude of negroes approached and seemed disposed to take us from our present masters but after a conference they agreed among themselves and a party of them joined with those who had previously conducted us we soon came to the edge of a desert and there we halted till the negroes had filled several calabashes and gourds full of water and collected a quantity of boiled corn as soon as this was done we set off again and entered the desert we were astonished and terrified when we looked around us not a single vestige of herbage not a blade of grass was to be seenall was one wide waste of barren sand so light as to rise in clouds at the least wind and we sank so deep in walking through it that at last we could hardly drag one foot after the other but we were repaid for our fatigue for when we halted at night no fires were lighted and to our great delight we found that there were no musquitoes to annoy us we fell into a sound sleep which lasted till morning and were much refreshed indeed so much so as to enable us to pursue our journey with alacrity in our passage over the desert we saw numbers of elephants teeth but no animals how the teeth came there unless it were that the elephants were lost in attempting to cross the desert i cannot pretend to say before we had crossed the desert our water was expended and we suffered dreadfully from thirst walking as we did during the whole day under a vertical sun the night was equally painful as we were so tortured with the want of water but on the following day when our strength was nearly exhausted and we were debating whether we should not lie down and allow the spears of our conductors to put an end to our miseries we came to the banks of a river which the negroes had evidently been anxiously looking for here we drank plentifully and remained all the day to recruit ourselves for the negroes were almost as exhausted as we were the next morning we crossed the river and plunged into a deep wood the ground being high the musquitoes did not annoy us so much as they did down on the low marshy land near the seacoast during our traverse through the wood we subsisted solely upon the birds and animals which the negroes killed with their bows and arrows when we had forced our way through the forest we found the country as before interspersed with wicker villages or small hamlets at a few miles distance from each other round each village there were small patches of guinea corn and we frequently came to clusters of huts which had been deserted between the seacoast and the desert we had traversed we observed that many of the inhabitants had european firearms but now the only weapons to be seen were spears and bows and arrows as we advanced we were surrounded at every village by the natives who looked upon us with surprise and astonishment examining us and evidently considering us a new species one morning we arrived at a very large negro town and as we approached our guards began to swell with pride and exultation and drove us before them among the crowds of inhabitants singing songs of triumph and brandishing their weapons having been driven through a great part of the town we arrived at a number of huts separated by a high palisade from the rest and appropriated as we afterwards found to the use of the king of the country his wives and attendants here we waited outside some time while our guards went in and acquainted this royal personage with the present which they had brought for him we had reason to think that our captors were not his subjects but had been at variance with him and had brought us as a present that they might make peace with an enemy too strong for them we were at last ordered to go inside the inclosure and found ourselves in a large open building constructed like the others of reeds and boughs in the centre was squatted a ferociouslooking old negro attended by four young negro women he was rawboned and lean and of a very large frame a diabolical ferocity was imprinted on his grim countenance and as he moved his arms and legs he showed that under his loose skin there was a muscle of extraordinary power i never had before seen such a living type of brutal strength and barbarity on a mat before him were provisions of different kinds behind him stood several grim savages who held his weapons and on each side at a greater distance were rows of negroes with their heads bent down and their arms crossed awaiting his orders the chief or king as well as the four women had clothes of the blue cotton cloth of the country that is one piece wrapped round the loins and descending to the ankles and another worn over their shoulders but with few exceptions all the rest as well as the inhabitants generally were quite naked so were we as the reader may recollect round the necks of the women were rows of gold beads longer by degrees until the last of the rows hung lower than their bosoms and both the king and they had large bracelets of gold round their arms wrists and legs the women who were young and welllooking stared at us with eager astonishment while the old king scowled upon us so as to freeze our blood at last rising from the ground he took his sabre from the man who held it behind him and walked up among us who with our heads bowed and breathless with fear awaited our impending fate i happened to be standing the foremost and grasping my arm with a gripe which made my heart sink with his hand which held the sword he bent down my head still lower than it was i made sure that he was about to cut off my head when the women who had risen from the ground ran crowding round him and with mingled entreaties and caresses strove to induce him not to put his intentions if such he really had into execution they prevailed at last the youngest took away his sword and then they led him back to his seat after which the women came to us to gratify their curiosity they felt our arms and breasts putting innumerable questions to those who brought us thither they appeared very much amazed at the length of my hair for i had worn it tied in a long cue taking hold of it they gave it two or three severe pulls to ascertain if it really grew to my head and finding that it did so they expressed much wonder when their curiosity was satisfied they then appeared to consider our condition and having obtained the old kings permission they brought us a calabash full of cushcush that is guinea corn boiled into a thick paste our hands being still tied we could only by shaking our heads express our inability to profit by their kindness understanding what we meant they immediately cut our thongs and the youngest of the four perceiving that my arms were benumbed from having been confined so many days and that i could not use them showed the most lively commiseration for my sufferings she gently chafed my wrists with her hands and showed every sign of pity in her countenance as indeed did all the other three but i was by far the youngest of the whole party who had been captured and seemed most to excite their pity and goodwill shortly afterwards we were all taken into an adjoining tent or hut and our bodies were rubbed all over with an oil which after a few days application left us perfectly healed and as smooth as silk so altered was our condition that those very people who had guarded us with their spears and threatened us with death were now ordered to wait upon us and as the kings wives frequently came to see how we were treated we were served with the utmost humility and attention chapter vi i am given as a slave to the old kings favourite whynaassist my young mistress to make her toilethold frequent conversations with her and become strongly attached to hermy hatred and dread of the old king increasehe shoots a man with birdarrows one morning after we had been about three weeks in these comfortable quarters i was summoned away from my companions into the presence of the king when i came before him a small manacle was fixed round my left ankle and another round my left wrist with a light chain connecting the two a circle of feathers was put round my head and a loose cloth wrapped round my loins i was then led forward to him with my arms crossed over my breast and my head bowed by his orders i was then placed behind the youngest of the four women the one who had chafed my wrists and i was given to understand that i was her slave and was to attend upon her to which i must say i gave a joyful assent in my heart although i did not at that time show any signs of gladness there i remained with my arms folded and bowed as before until dinner was brought in and a calabash full of cushcush was put into my hands to place before the king and his wives my first attempt at service was not very adroit for in my eagerness to do my duty i tripped over the corner of the mat which served them for a table and tumbling headlong forward emptied the calabash of cushcush which i held in my hand upon the legs of the old king who sat opposite to where i was advancing he jumped up roaring out with anger while i in my fear sprung on my legs and rushed to the side of the apartment expecting immediate death fortunately the victuals in this country are always served up cool and my new mistress easily obtained my pardon laughing heartily at the scene and at my apprehension the repast being over i was ordered to follow my mistress who retired to another hut according to their custom to sleep during the heat of the day i was placed before the door to prevent her being disturbed my only duty now was to attend upon my young mistress she was the kings favourite wife and as she was uniformly kind and gentle i should have almost ceased to lament my loss of liberty had it not been from the fear i had of the old monarch i knew that my preservation depended entirely upon my mistresss favour and i endeavoured all i could to conciliate her by the most sedulous attentions to please young and generous in disposition she was easily satisfied by my ready obedience and careful service i do not think that she was more than seventeen years of age but they are women at fourteen in that country and even earlier she was a negress as to colour but not a real negress for her hair although short and very wavy was not woolly and her nose was straight her mouth was small and her teeth beautiful her figure was perfect her limbs being very elegantly formed when she first rose in the morning i attended her to the brow of a hill just without the palisades where with devout but mistaken piety she adored the rising sunat least it appeared to me that she did so she then went down to the river to bathe and as soon as her hair was dry she had it dressed this office after a short time devolved upon me and i became very expert having to rub her hair with a sweet oil and then roll it up in its natural curls with a quill so as to dispose them to the most fanciful advantage as to form after her toilet was complete she went to feed her poultry and some antelopes and other beasts and then she practised at a mark with her bow and arrows and javelin till about ten oclock when she went to the kings hut and they all sat down to eat together after the repast which lasted some time if she did not repose with the king she retired to her own hut where she usually refreshed herself till about four oclock when she returned to the king or ranged the woods or otherwise amused herself during the rest of the evening i will say for the old savage that he did not confine his wives such was our general course of life and wherever she went i attended her the attachment i showed and really felt for her secured her confidence and she always treated me in a kind and familiar manner their language consists of few words compared to our own and in a short time by help of signs we understood each other tolerably well she appeared to have a most ardent curiosity to know who we were and from whence we came and all the time that we passed alone was employed in putting questions and my endeavouring to find out her meaning and answer them this although very difficult at first i was eventually enabled to accomplish indifferently well she was most zealous in her mistaken religion and one morning when i was following her to her devotions on the hill she asked me where my god was i pointed upwards upon which she told me with great joy and innocency that hers was there too and that therefore they must be the same god or if not they must be friends convinced that she was right she made me worship with her bowing my head down to the sand and going through the same forms which of course i did not understand the meaning of but i prayed to my god and therefore made no objection as it was pleasing to her this apparent conformity in religion recommended me more strongly to her and we became more intimate and i was certainly attached to her by every tie of gratitude i was quite happy in the friendship and kindness she showed towards me the only drawback was my fear of the proud old king and the recollection of him often made me check myself and suddenly assume a more distant and respectful demeanour towards her i soon found out that she dreaded the old savage as much as i did and hated him even more in his presence she treated me very sternly and ordered me about in a very dictatorial manner but when we were alone and had no fear of being seen she would then be very familiar sometimes even locking her arm into mine and laughing as she pointed out the contrast of the colours and in the full gaiety of her young heart rejoicing that we were alone and could converse freely together as she was very intelligent she soon perceived that i possessed much knowledge that she did not and that she could not comprehend what i wanted to teach her this induced her to look upon me with respect as well as kindness one day i purposely left her bow behind in the hut where my companions resided and on her asking me for it i told her that i had done so but that i would make my companions send it without my going back i tore off a piece of the bark of a tree and with the point of an arrow i wrote to one of them desiring him to send it by bearer and calling a young negro boy told him in her presence to give that piece of bark to the white man and come back again to the queen whyna for such was the name of my mistress queen stood in suspense waiting the result in a few minutes the boy returned bringing the bow astonished at this she made me write again and again for her arrows her lance and many other things finding by these being immediately sent that we had a method of communicating with each other at a distance she earnestly insisted upon being taught so surprising an art going at a distance from me she ordered me to talk to her when out of hearing and finding that i could not or as she seemed to suppose that i would not she became discontented and out of humour i could by no means make her comprehend how it was performed but i made her understand that as soon as i was fully acquainted with her language i should be able to teach her she was satisfied with this but made me promise that i would teach nobody else by the canoes in the river i easily made her comprehend that i came in a vast boat from a distant land over a great expanse of water and also how it was that we fell into the negroes power i then found out from her that the negroes had pretended that we had invaded their land to procure slaves and that they had vanquished us in battle hence their songs of triumph on bringing us to the king i pointed out the heavenly bodies to her in the evenings trying to make her comprehend something of their nature and motions but in vain this had however one good effect she looked up to me with more respect hoping that some day when i could fully explain myself she might be herself taught all these wonders with these feelings towards me added to my sedulous endeavours to please her and obey her slightest wishes it is not surprising that she treated me as a companion and not as a slave and gave me every innocent proof of her attachment more i never wished and almost dreaded that our intimacy would be too great happy when alone with her i ever returned with reluctance to the presence of the old king whose sight and company i dreaded the boundless cruelty of this monster was a continual check to all my happiness accustomed to blood from his childhood he appeared wholly insensible to human feelings and derided the agonies of the wretches who daily fell by his hands one day he amused himself by shooting small birdarrows at a man who was bound to a post before the tent which was placed there for the punishment of those who were his victims he continued for hours fixing the arrows in different parts of his body mimicking and deriding his cries at last contrary to his intentions one of the arrows hit the man in the throat and his head drooped as the old savage saw that the poor man was dying he drew another arrow and sent it through his heart very much annoyed at his disappointment in not prolonging the poor creatures sufferings i was witness to this scene with silent horror and many more of a similar nature i hardly need say that i felt what my punishment would be if i had by any means roused the jealousy of this monster and i knew that without giving him real cause a moment of bare suspicion would be sufficient to sacrifice my mistress as well as me chapter vii i attend the king on a hunting expeditionchase of wild animalswhyna and i in great danger from a tigerbarbarity of the king to my young mistressi try to soothe heri and my companions are ransomedsad parting with whynaafter an encounter with a hostile people we reach senegalreturn to england i had been about three months in captivity when the old king with his four wives and a large party of negroes left the town and went into the woods to hunt my companions were left in the town but i was ordered to attend my mistress and i went with the hopes of being able by some means to make my escape for my fear of the old monarch was much greater than my regard for my mistress as i had not become a proficient with the bows and arrows or in hurling the javelin i was equipped with a strong spear my mistress was skilful to admiration with the arrow and javelin she never missed her aim that i knew and she certainly never appeared to such advantage as she did at this huntingparty her activity her symmetry of limb and her courage her skill with her weapons all won the heart of the old king and i believe that his strong attachment to her arose more from her possession of the above qualities than from any other cause certain it is that the old savage doted on hershe was the only being who could bend his stubborn will as his age prevented him from joining in the chase he always appeared to part with her with regret and to caution her not to run into useless danger and when we returned at night the old mans eyes sparkled with the rapture of dotage as he welcomed her return the method of our chase was to beat the country with a number of men in a vast circle until we had gathered all the game into one thicket then the strongest warriors with their large spears went in and drove out the game which was killed by the hunters who hovered about within the circle the animals which we had to encounter were large fierce black pigs leopards jackals tigers mountain cats and others which i have no name forand in spite of the ferocity of many of these animals when they bounded out they were met with such a shower of javelins or transfixed by the strong stabbingspears of the warriors that few escaped and they rarely did any mischief one day however the beaters having just entered a thicket whyna who was eager for the sport and plied within the circle with the other hunters hearing a rustling in the jungle went to the verge of it to be the first to strike the animal which came out as usual i was close to her when a large tiger burst out and she pierced him with her javelin but not sufficient to wound the animal so severely as to disable him the tiger turned and i drove my spear into his throat this checked him as it remained in but in a spring which he gave the handle broke short off and although the iron went further in our danger was imminent whyna ran and so did i to escape from the beasts fury for although after i had wounded it with my spear we had both retreated we were not so far but that in two or three bounds he would have been upon us my mistress was as fleet as the wind and soon passed me but as she passed me she caught me by the hand and dragged me along at a pace that with difficulty i could keep my legs the surrounding hunters alarmed at her danger and knowing what they had to expect from the mercy of the old king if she was destroyed by the animal closed in between us and the tiger and after a fierce combat in which some were killed and many wounded they despatched him with their spears the head of the animal which was of unusual size was cut off and carried home to the old king in triumph and when he heard of the danger that whyna had been in he caressed her with tears and i could not help saying that the old wretch had some heart after all whyna told the king that if i had not pierced the animal with my spear and prevented his taking his first spring she should have lost her life and the monster grinned a ghastly smile at me which i presume he meant for either approbation or gratitude at other times the chase would be that of the multitude of birds which were to be found in the woods the bow and arrow only were used and all i had to do now was to pick up all my mistress had killed and return her arrowsshe would constantly kill on the wing with her arrow which not many could do besides her by degrees i imbibed a strong passion for the sport attended as it was with considerable danger and was never so happy as when engaged in it we remained about two months in the woods when the king was tired and we returned to the town where i continued for some time to pass the same kind of life as i had done before i should have been quite happy in my slavery from my affection to my mistress had not a fresh instance of the unbounded cruelty of the old monarch occurred a few days after our return from the chase which filled us all with consternation and horror for we discovered that not even my mistress whyna could always prevail with the savage monster one morning i perceived that one of the kings guards who had always treated me with great kindness and with whom i was very intimate was tied up to the executioners post before the hut aware of the fate which awaited him i ran to the hut of whyna and so great was my distress that i could not speak all i could do was to clasp her knees and repeat the mans name pointing to the post to which he was tied she understood me and eager to save the man or to oblige me she ran to the large hut and attempted to intercede with the old barbarian for the mans life but he was in an agony of rage and passion he refused her lifting up his sabre to despatch the man whyna was rash enough to seize the kings arm and prevent the blow at this his rage redoubled his eyes glowed like live coals and turning to her with the look of a demon he caught her by the hair and dragging her across his feet lifted up his scimitar in the act to strike off her head i sickened with horror at the danger she was in but i thought he would not strike i had no weapon but if he had done so i would have revenged her death even if i had lost my life at last the old monster let go her hair spurning her away with his foot so that she rolled over on the sand and then turning to the unhappy man with an upward slanting blow of his sabre he ripped him up from the flank to the chest so that his bowels fell down at his feet he then looked round at us all with an aspect which froze our blood and turned away sulkily to his hut leaving us to recover our spirits how we might poor whyna terrified and enraged at the same time as soon as i had led her to her hut and we were by ourselves gave way to the storm of passion which swelled her bosom execrating her husband with the utmost loathing and abhorrence and lamenting in the most passionate manner her having ever been connected with him trembling alike at the danger to which i had exposed her and moved by her condition i could not help mingling my tears with hers and endeavoured by caresses and condoling with her to reduce her excitement had the old king seen me i know what both our fates would have been but at that time i cared not i was very young very impetuous and i was resolved that i would not permit either her or myself to die unavenged at last she sobbed herself to sleep and i took my usual station outside of the hut it was well that i did so for not five minutes afterwards the old wretch having got over his temper came out of his tent and bent his steps towards the hut that he might make friends with her for she was too necessary to his happiness he soon treated her with his accustomed kindness but i perceived that after the scene i have described her aversion for him was doubled there were some scores of women in the various huts within the palisade all of whom i understood were wives to the old monarch but none but the four we found with him when we were first brought into his presence were ever to be seen in his company i had by means of my kind mistress the opportunity of constantly supplying my companions with fowls and venison which was left from the kings table and through her care they always met with kind and gentle usage for another two months did i thus remain happy in the company of whyna and miserable when in the presence of the king whose eye it was impossible to meet without quailing when one morning we were all ordered out and were surrounded by a large party armed with spears javelins and birdarrowsi say birdarrows as those that they use in war are much larger we soon discovered that we were to be sent to some other place but where or why we could not find out shortly afterwards the crowd opened and whyna made her appearance she took the feather circle off my head and the manacles off my wrist and leg and went and laid them at the kings feet she then returned and told me that i was free as well as my companions but that i only if i chose had permission to remain with her i did not at first reply she then in the most earnest manner begged me to remain with her as her slave and as she did not dare to say what she felt or use caresses to prevail upon me she stamped her little feet with eagerness and impatience the struggle in my own heart was excessive i presumed that we were about to be made a present to some other king and i felt that i never could expect so easy and so pleasant a servitude as i then enjoyed i was sincerely attached and indeed latterly i was more than attached to whyna i felt that it was dangerous had the old king been dead i would have been content to pass my life with her and i was still hesitating notwithstanding the remonstrances of my companions when the crowd opened a little and i beheld the old king looking at me and i felt convinced that his jealousy was at last aroused and that if i consented to remain my life would not be worth a days purchase whyna also turned and met the look of the old king whether she read in his countenance what i did i know not but this is certain she made no more attempts to persuade me but waving her hand for us to set off on our journey she slowly retired and when arrived at the hut turned round towards us we all prostrated ourselves before her and then set off on our journey she retired to the door of her own hut and two or three times waved her hand to us at which our guards made us every time again prostrate ourselves she then walked out to the little hill where she always went up to pray and for the last time waved her hand and then i perceived her sink down on the ground and turn her head in the direction which she always did when she prayed we now proceeded on our journey in a northwest direction our guards treating us with the greatest kindness we rested every day from ten till four oclock in the afternoon and then walked till late at night corn was supplied us from the scattered hamlets as we passed along and our escort procured us flesh and fowl with their bows and arrows but we were in a state of great anxiety to know where we were going and nobody appeared able or willing to tell us i often thought of whyna and at times repented that i had not remained with her as i feared falling into a worse slavery but the recollection of the old kings diabolical parting look was sufficient to make me think that it was best as it was now that i had left my mistress i thought of her kindness and amiable qualities and her affection for me and although it may appear strange that i should feel myself in love with a black woman i will not deny but that i was so i could not help being so and that is all the excuse i can offer our guards now informed us that we were about to pass for a few miles through the territory of another king and that they were not sure what our reception might be but this was soon made evident for we observed a party behind us which moved as we moved although they did not attack us and soon afterwards a larger body in front were blocking up our passage and we found that we were beset the commander of our party therefore gave orders for battle and he put into our hands strong spears they being the only weapons we could use and entreated us to fight our party was greatly outnumbered by the enemy but ours were chosen warriors as for us white men we kept together agreeing among ourselves that we would defend ourselves if attacked but would not offend either party by taking an unnecessary part in the fray as it was immaterial to us to whom we belonged the battle or rather skirmish soon began they dispersed and shot their arrows from behind the trees and this warfare continued some time without damage to either party till at last they attacked us closely then our commander killing that of the enemy they gave way just as another party was coming forward to attack us white men but finding us resolute in our defence and our own warriors coming to our assistance the rout was general they could not however prevent some prisoners from being taken most of them wounded with the birdarrows which having their barbs twisted in the form of an s gave great pain in their extraction i observed that a particular herb chewed and bound up with the bleeding wound was their only remedy and that when the bone was injured they considered the wound mortal we now turned to the eastward to get back into our own territory we left the prisoners and wounded at a village and receiving a reinforcement we took a circuit to avoid this hostile people and continued our route on the eighth morning just as we were stopping to repose one of the warriors who had mounted a hill before us shouted and waved his hand we ran up to him and as soon as we gained the summit were transported with the sight of the british flag flying on senegal fort on the other side of the river we now understood that by some means or another we had been ransomed and so it proved to be for the governor hearing that we were prisoners up the country had sent messengers offering the old king a handsome present for our liberation i afterwards found out that the price paid in goods amounted to about fiftysix shillings ahead the governor received us kindly clothed us and sent us down to the ship which was with a full cargo in the road and intending to sail the next day and we were received and welcomed by our messmates as men risen from the dead we sailed two days afterwards and had a fortunate voyage home to liverpool chapter viii the liverpool ladies are very civil to mei am admitted into good societyintroduced to captain leveeagain sail to senegaloverhear a conspiracy to seize

town liferemove to a genteel boardinghousemeet with a government spyreturn to liverpool as the captain reported me to be a very attentive and good officer although i was then but twentythree years of age and as i had been previously on good terms and useful to the owner i was kindly received by him and paid much more attention to than my situation on board might warrant my captivity among the negroes and the narrative i gave of my adventures were also a source of much interest i was at first questioned by the gentlemen of liverpool and afterwards one of the merchants ladies who had heard something of my adventures and found out that i was a young and personable man with better manners than are usually to be found before the mast invited me one evening to a teaparty that i might amuse her friends with my adventures they were most curious about the negro queen whyna inquiring into every particular as to her personal appearance and dress and trying to find out as women always do if there was any thing of an intrigue between us they shook their little fingers at me when i solemnly declared that there was not and one or two of them cajoled me aside to obtain my acknowledgment of what they really believed to be the truth although i would not confess it when they had tired themselves with asking questions about the negro queen they then began to ask about myself and how it happened i was not such a bear and coarse in my manners and address as the other seamen to this i could give no other reply but that i had been educated when a child they would fain know who were my father and mother and in what station of life it had pleased god to place them but i hardly need say my dear madam to you who are so well acquainted with my birth and parentage that i would not disgrace my family by acknowledging that one of their sons was in a situation so unworthy not that i thought at that time nor do i think now that i was so much to blame in preferring independence in a humble position to the life that induced me to take the step which i did but as i could not state who my family were without also stating why i had quitted them i preserved silence as i did not think that i had any right to communicate family secrets to strangers the consequences of my first introduction to genteel society were very agreeable i received many more invitations from the company assembled notwithstanding that my sailors attire but ill corresponded with the powdered wigs and silk waistcoats of the gentlemen or the hoops and furbelows of satin which set off the charms of the ladies at first i did not care so much but as i grew more at my ease i felt ashamed of my dress and the more so as the young foplings would put their glasses to their eyes and look at me as if i were a monster but supported as i was by the fair sex i cared little for them the ladies vowed that i was charming and paid me much courtesy indeed my vanity more than once made me suspect that i was something more than a mere favourite with one or two of them one especially a buxom young person and very coquettish who told me as we were looking out of the bay window of the withdrawingroom that since i could be so secret with respect to what took place between the negress queen and myself i must be sure to command the goodwill and favour of the ladies who always admired discretion in so young and so handsome a man but i was not to be seduced by this flattery for somehow or another i had ever before me the french lady and her conduct to me and i had almost a dislike or i should rather say i had imbibed an indifference for the sex this admission into good society did however have one effect upon me it made me more particular in my dress and all my wages were employed in the decoration of my person at that time you may recollect madam there were but two styles of dress among the seamen one was that worn by those who sailed in the northern seas and the other by those who navigated in the tropical countries both suitable to the climates the first was the jacket woollen frock breeches and petticoat of canvas over all with worsted stockings shoes and buckles and usually a cap of skin upon the head the other a light short jacket with hanging buttons red sash trowsers and neat shoes and buckles with a small embroidered cap with falling crown or a hat and feather it was this last which i had always worn having been continually in warm climates and my hair was dressed in its natural ringlets instead of a wig which i was never partial to although very common among seamen my ears were pierced and i wore long gold earrings as well as gilt buckles in my shoes and by degrees i not only improved my dress so as to make it very handsome in materials but my manners were also very much altered for the better i had been at liverpool about two months waiting for the ship to unload and take in cargo for another voyage when a privateer belonging to the same owner came into port with four prizes of considerable value and the day afterwards i was invited by the owner to meet the captain who commanded the privateer he was a very different looking person from captain weatherall who was a stout stronglimbed man with a weatherbeaten countenance he on the contrary was a young man of about twentysix very slight in person with a dark complexion hair and eyes jet black i should have called him a very handsome jewfor he bore that cast of countenance and i afterwards discovered that he was of that origin although i cannot say that he ever followed the observances of that remarkable people he was handsomely dressed wearing his hair slightly powdered a laced coat and waistcoat blue sash and trowsers with silvermounted pistols and dagger in his belt and a smart hanger by his side he had several diamond rings on his finger and carried a small clouded cane altogether i had never fallen in with so smart and prepossessing a personage and should have taken him for one of the gentlemen commending the kings ships rather than the captain of a liverpool privateer he talked well and fluently and with an air of command and decision taking the lead in the company although it might have been considered that he was not by any means the principal person in it the owner during the evening informed me that he was a firstrate officer of great personal courage and that he had made a great deal of money which he had squandered away almost as fast as he received it with this person whose name was captain levee an alteration i suspect from levi i was much pleased and as i found that he did not appear to despise my acquaintance i took much pains to please him and we were becoming very intimate when my ship was ready to sail i now found that i was promoted to the office of first mate which gave me great satisfaction we sailed with an assorted cargo but very light and nothing of consequence occurred during our passage out we made good traffic on the coast as we ran down it receiving ivory golddust and wax in exchange for our printed cottons and hardware after being six weeks on the coast we put into senegal to dispose of the remainder of our cargo which we soon did to the governor who gave us a fair exchange although by no means so profitable a barter as what we had made on the coast but that we did not expect for what might be called the refuse of our cargo the captain was much pleased as he knew the owner would be satisfied with him and moreover he had himself a venture in the cargo and we had just received the remainder of the ivory from the governors stores and had only to get on board a sufficiency of provisions and water for our homeward voyage when a circumstance took place which i must now relate our crew consisted of the captain and myself as first mate the second mate and twelve seamen four of which were those who had been taken prisoners with me and had been released as i have related in our previous voyage these four men were very much attached to me i believe chiefly from my kindness to them when i was a slave to the queen whyna as i always procured for them every thing which i could and through the exertions of my mistress had them plentifully supplied with provisions from the kings table the second mate and other eight men we had shipped at liverpool they were fine stout fellows but appeared to be loose characters but that we did not discover till after we had sailed there was anchored with us at senegal a low black brig employed in the slavetrade which had made the bay at the same time that we did and to their great surprisefor she was considered a very fast sailershe was beaten at all points by our ship which was considered the fastest vessel out of liverpool the crew of the slaver were numerous and as bloodthirsty a set of looking fellows as ever i fell in with their boat was continually alongside of our vessel and i perceived that their visits were made to the eight men whom we had shipped at liverpool and that they did not appear inclined to be at all intimate with the rest of the crew this roused my suspicions although i said nothing but i watched them very closely one forenoon as i was standing at the foot of the companionladder concealed by the boobyhatch from the sight of those on deck i heard our men talking over the side and at last as i remained concealed that i might overhear the conversation one of the slavers men from the boat said tonight at eight oclock we will come to arrange the whole business the boat then shoved off and pulled for the brig now it was the custom of the captain to go onshore every evening to drink sangaree and smoke with the governor and very often i went with him leaving the ship in charge of the second mate it had been my intention and i had stated as much to the second mate to go this evening as it was the last but one that we should remain at senegal but from what i overheard i made up my mind that i would not go about an hour before sunset i complained of headache and sickness and sat down under the awning over the after part of the quarterdeck when the captain came up to go on shore he asked me if i was ready but i made no answer only put my hand to my head the captain supposing that i was about to be attacked by the fever of the country was much concerned and desired the second mate to help him to take me down to the stateroom and then went on shore the boat was as usual pulled by the four men who were prisoners with me and whom the captain found he could trust on shore better than the others belonging to the crew who would indulge in liquor whenever they had an opportunity i remained in my bedplace till it was nearly eight oclock and then crept softly up the companionhatch to ascertain who was on deck the men were all below in the forepeak at their suppers and as i had before observed that their conferences were held on the forecastle i went forward and covered myself up with a part of the maintopsail which the men had been repairing during the day from this position i could hear all that passed whether they went down into the forepeak or remained to converse on the forecastle about ten minutes afterwards i heard the boat grate against the ships side and the men of the slaver mount on the deck all right inquired one of the slavers yes replied our second mate skipper and his men are on shore and the first mate taken with the fever all the better replied another one less to handle and now my lads lets to business and have every thing settled tonight so that we may not be seen together any more till the work is done they then commenced a consultation by which i found it was arranged that our ship was to be boarded and taken possession of as soon as she was a few miles out of the bay for they dared not attack us while we were at anchor close to the fort but the second mate and eight men belonging to us were to pretend to make resistance until beaten down below and when the vessel was in their power the captain i and the other four men who were ashore in the boat were to be silenced for ever after which there came on a discussion as to what was to be done with the cargo which was very valuable and how the money was to be shared out when the cargo was sold then they settled who were to be officers on board of the ship which there is no doubt they intended to make a pirate vessel i also discovered that if they succeeded it was their intention to kill their own captain and such men of the slaver who would not join them and scuttle their own vessel which was a very old one the consultation ended by a solemn and most villainous oath being administered to every man as to secrecy and fidelity after which the men of the slaver went into their boat and pulled to their own vessel the second mate and our men remained on deck about a quarter of an hour and then all descended by the ladder to the forepeak and turned into their hammocks as soon as i thought i could do so with safety i came out of my lurkingplace and retreated to the stateroom it was fortunate that i did for a minute afterwards i heard a man on deck and the second mate came down the companionhatch and inquired whether i wanted any thing i told him no that i was very ill and only hoped to be able to go to sleep and asked him if the captain had returned he replied that he had not and then went away as soon as i was left to myself i began to consider what would be best to be done i knew the captain to be a very timorous man and i was afraid to trust him with the secret as i thought he would be certain to let the men know by his conduct that they were discovered and their plans known the four men who were prisoners with me i knew that i could confide in this was the tuesday night and we proposed sailing on the thursday now we had no means of defence on board except one small gun which was honeycombed and nearly useless it did very well to make a signal with but had it been loaded with ball i believe it would have burst immediately it is true that we had muskets and cutlasses but what use would they have been against such a force as would be opposed and twothirds of our men mutineers of course we must have been immediately overpowered that the slavers intended to take possession of their own vessel before they took ours i had no doubt it is true that we outsailed them when we had a breeze but the bay was usually becalmed and it was not till a vessel had got well into the offing that she obtained a breeze and there was no doubt but that they would take the opportunity of boarding us when we were moving slowly through the water and a boat might easily come up with us the slaver had stated his intention of sailing immediately to procure her cargo elsewhere and if she got under weigh at the same time that we did no suspicion would be created to apply for protection to the governor would be uselesshe could not protect us after we were clear of the bay indeed if it were known that we had so done it would probably only precipitate the affair and we should be taken possession of while at anchor for the shot from the fort would hardly reach us it was therefore only by stratagem that we could escape from the clutches of these miscreants again allowing that we were to get clear of the slavers we were still in an awkward position for supposing the captain to be of any use we should still only be six men against nine and we might be overpowered by our own crew who were determined and powerful men all night i lay on my bed reflecting upon what ought to be done and at last i made up my mind the next morning i went on deck complaining very much but stating that the fever had left me the longboat was sent on shore for more water and i took care that the second mate and eight men should be those selected for the service as soon as they had shoved off i called the other four men on the forecastle and told them what i had overheard they were very much astonished for they had had no idea that there was any thing of the kind going forward i imparted to them all my plans and they agreed to support me in every thingindeed they were all brave men and would have if i had acceded to it attempted to master and overpower the second mate and the others and make sail in the night but this i would not permit as there was a great risk they perfectly agreed with me that it was no use acquainting the captain and that all we had to do was to get rid of these men and carry the vessel home how we could how that was to be done was the point at issue one thing was certain that it was necessary to leave the bay that night or it would be too late fortunately there was always a light breeze during the night and the nights were dark for there was no moon till three oclock in the morning by which time we could have gained the offing and then we might laugh at the slaver as we were lighter in our heels the boat came off with the water about noon and the men went to dinner the captain had agreed to dine with the governor and i had been asked to accompany him it was to be our farewell dinner as we were to sail the next morning i had been cogitating a long while to find out how to get rid of these fellows when at last i determined that i would go on shore with the captain and propose a plan to the governor his knowledge of what was about to be attempted could do no harm and i thought he would help us so i went into the boat and when we landed i told the men what i intended to do as soon as i arrived at the governors i took an opportunity while the captain was reading a book to request a few moments conversation and i then informed the governor of the conspiracy which was afloat and when i had so done i pointed out to him the propriety of saying nothing to the captain until all was safe and proposed my plan to him which he immediately acceded to when he returned to where the captain was still reading he told him that he had a quantity of golddust and other valuables which he wished to send to england by his ship but that he did not wish to do it openly as it was supposed that he did not traffic and that if the captain would send his longboat on shore after dark he would send all the articles on board with instructions to whom they were to be consigned on our arrival the captain of course consented we bade the governor farewell about half an hour before dark and returned on board after i had been a few minutes on deck i sent for the second mate and told him as a secret what the governor had proposed to do and that he would be required to land after dark for the goods telling him that there was a very large quantity of golddust and that he must be very careful i knew that this intelligence would please him as it would add to their plunder when they seized the vessel and i told him that as we sailed at daylight he must lose no time but be on board again as soon as he could that we might hoist in the longboat about eight oclock in the evening the boat with him and the eight men went on shore the governor had promised to detain them and ply them with liquor till we had time to get safe off as soon as they were out of sight and hearing we prepared every thing for getting under weigh the captain had gone to his cabin but was not in bed i went down to him and told him i should remain up till the boat returned and see that all was right and that in the mean time i would get every thing ready for weighing the next morning and that he might just as well go to bed now and i would call him to relieve me at daylight to this arrangement he consented and in half an hour i perceived that his candle was out and that he had retired being now so dark that we could not perceive the slaver which lay about three cables length from us it was fairly to be argued that she could not see us i therefore went forward and slipped the cable without noise and sent men up aloft to loose the sails there was a light breeze sufficient to carry us about two knots through the water and we knew that it would rather increase than diminish in half an hour weakhanded as we were we were under sail every thing being done without a word being spoken and with the utmost precaution you may imagine how rejoiced we all were when we found that we had manoeuvred so well notwithstanding we kept a sharp lookout to see if the slaver had perceived our motions and had followed us and the fear of such being the case kept us under alarm till near daylight when the breeze blew strong and we felt that we had nothing more to dread as the day broke we found that we were four or five leagues from the anchorage and could not see the lower masts of the slaver which still remained where we had left her satisfied that we were secure i then went down to the captain and as he lay in bed made him acquainted with all that had passed he appeared as if awakened from a dream rose without making any reply and hastened on deck when he found out that we were under weigh and so far from the land he exclaimed it must all be true but how shall we be able to take the ship home with so few hands i replied that i had no fears on that score and that i would answer for bringing the vessel safe to liverpool but he said at last how is it that i was not informed of all this i might have made some arrangements with the men yes sir i replied but if you had attempted to do so the vessel would have been taken immediately but why was i not acquainted with it i want to know he said again i had by this time made up my mind to the answer i should give him so i said because it would have placed a serious responsibility on your shoulders if as captain of this vessel you had sailed to england with such a valuable cargo and so few hands the governor and i therefore thought it better that you should not be placed in such an awkward position and therefore we considered it right not to say a word to you about it now if any thing goes wrong it will be my fault and not yours and the owner cannot blame you when i had said this the captain was silent for a minute or two and then said well i believe it is all for the best and i thank you and the governor too having got over this little difficulty i did not care we made all sail and steered homewards and after a rapid passage during which we were on deck day and night we arrived very much fatigued at liverpool of course the captain communicated what had occurred to the owner who immediately sent for me and having heard my version of the story expressed his acknowledgment for the preservation of the vessel and to prove his sincerity he presented me with fifty guineas for myself and ten for each of the men the cargo was soon landed and i was again at liberty i found captain levee in port he had just returned from another cruise and had taken a rich prize he met me with the same cordiality as before and having asked me for a recital of what had occurred at senegal of which he had heard something from the owner as soon as i had finished he said you are a lad after my own heart and i wish we were sailing together i want a firstlieutenant like you and if you will go with me say the word and it will be hard but i will have you i replied that i was not very anxious to be in a privateer again and this brought on a discourse upon what occurred when i was in the revenge with captain weatherall well he said at last all this makes me more anxious to have you i like fair fighting and hate buccaneering like yourself however we will talk of it another time i am about to start for london what do you say will you join me and we will have some sport with plenty of money you may do any thing in london yes i replied but i have not plenty of money that shall make no difference money is of no use but to spend it that i know of replied captain levee i have plenty for both of us and my purse is at your service help yourself as you please without counting for i shall be your enemy if you offer to return it thats settled the horses are all ready and we will start on wednesday how will you dress i think it might be better to alter your costume now you are going to london youll make a pretty fellow dress how you will before i give you an answer to all your kind proposals i must speak to the owner captain levee of course you must shall we go there now willingly i replied and we accordingly set off captain levee introduced the subject as soon as we arrived at the countinghouse stating that he wanted me to be firstlieutenant of the privateer and that i was going to london with him if he had no objection as for going to london with you for five or six weeks captain levee there can be no objection to that replied the owner but as for being your firstlieutenant that is another question i have a vessel now fitting out and intended to offer the command of it to mr elrington i do so now at once and he must decide whether he prefers being under your orders to commanding a vessel of his own i will decide that for him replied captain levee he must command his own vessel it would be no friendship on my part to stand in the way of his advancement i only hope if she is a privateer that we may cruise together i cannot reply to that latter question replied the owner her destination is uncertain but the command of her is now offered to mr elrington if he will accept of it before his trip to the metropolis i replied that i should with pleasure and returned the owner many thanks for his kindness and after a few minutes more conversation we look our leave now i should advise you said captain levee as we walked towards his lodgings to dress as a captain of a vessel of war much in the style that i do you are a captain and have a right so to do come with me and let me fit you out i agreed with captain levee that i could not do better so we went and ordered my suits of clothes and purchased the other articles which i required captain levee would have paid for them but i had money sufficient and would not permit him indeed with my pay and present of fifty guineas i had upwards of seventy guineas in my purse and did not disburse more than fifty in my accoutrements although my pistols and hanger were very handsome we did not start until three days after the time proposed when i found at daylight two stout wellbred horses at the door one for captain levee and the other for me we were attended by two servingmen belonging to the crew of the privateer commanded by captain leveepowerful fiercelooking and determined men armed to the teeth and mounted upon strong jades one carried the valise of captain levee which was heavy with gold the other had charge of mine which was much lighter as you may suppose we travelled for three days without any interruption making about thirty miles aday and stopping at the hostelries to sleep every night on the fourth day we had a slight affair for as we were mounting a hill towards the evening we found our passage barred by five fellows with crape masks who told us to stand and deliver we will replied captain levee firing his pistol and reining up his horse at the same time the ball struck the man who fell back on the crupper while the others rushed forward my pistols were all ready and i fired at the one who spurred his horse upon me but the horse rearing up saved his master the ball passing through the head of the animal who fell dead holding his rider a prisoner by the thigh which was underneath his body our two men had come forward and ranged alongside of us at the first attack but now that two had fallen the others finding themselves in a minority after exchanging shots turned their horses heads and galloped away we would have pursued them but captain levee said it was better not as there might be more of the gang near and by pursuing them we might separate and be cut off in detail what shall we do with these fellows asked our men of captain levee leave them to get off how they can replied captain levee i will not be stopped on my journey by such a matter as this i dare say they dont deserve hanging more than half the people we meet let us push on and get into quarters for the night after all mr elrington said captain levee to me as we were setting off its only a little land privateering and we must not be too hard upon them i confess madam when i recalled all that i had witnessed on board of the revenge that i agreed with captain levee that these highwaymen were not worse than ourselves no other adventure occurred during our journey and when we arrived in london we directed our horses steps to a fashionable tavern in st pauls and took possession of apartments and as captain levee was well known we were cordially greeted and well attended the tavern was in great repute and resorted to by all the wits and gay men of the day and i soon found myself on intimate terms with a numerous set of dashing blades full of life and jollity and spending their money like princes but it was a life of sad intemperance and my head ached every morning from the excess of the night before and in our excursions in the evenings we were continually in broils and disturbances and many a broken head nay sometimes a severe wound was given and received after the first fortnight i felt weary of this continual dissipation and as i was dressing a swordcut which captain levee had received in an affray i one morning told him so i agree with you he replied that it is all very foolish and discreditable but if we live with the gay and pretty fellows we must do as they do besides how could i get rid of my money which burns in my pocket if i did not spend as much in one day as would suffice for three weeks still i would rather dress a wound gained in an honourable contest with the enemy than one received in a night brawl and i would rather see you commanding your men in action than reeling with other drunkards in search of a quarrel in the streets i feel that it is beneath me and im sure that its beneath you you are a mentor without a beard replied captain levee but still it requires no beard to discover that i have made an ass of myself now what do you say shall we take lodgings and live more reputably for while in this tavern we never shall be able to do so i should prefer it to tell you the honest truth i replied for i have no pleasure in our present life be it so then he replied i will tell them that i take lodgings that i may be near to a fair lady that will be a good and sufficient excuse the next day we secured lodgings to our satisfaction and removed into them leaving our horses and men at the tavern we boarded with the family and as there were others who did the same we had a very pleasant society especially as there were many of the other sex among the boarders the first day that we sat down to dinner i found myself by the side of a young man of pleasing manners although with much of the coxcomb in his apparel his dress was very gay and very expensive and he wore a diamondhilted sword and diamond bucklesat least so they appeared to me as i was not sufficient connoisseur to distinguish the brilliant from the paste he was very affable and talkative and before dinner was over gave me the history of many of the people present who is the dame in the blue stomacher i inquired you mean the prettiest of the two i suppose he replied that one with the patches under the eye she is a widow having just buried an old man of sixty to whom she was sacrificed by her mother but although the old fellow was as rich as a jew he found such fault with the ladys conduct that he left all his money away from her this is not generally known and she takes care to conceal it for she is anxious to make another match and she will succeed if her funds which are not very great enable her to carry on the game a little longer i was nearly taken in myself but an intimacy with her cousin who hates her gave me a knowledge of the truth she still keeps her carriage and appears to be rolling in wealth but she has sold her diamonds and wears paste and that plain young person on the other side of her has money and knows the value of it she requires rentroll for rentroll and instead of referring you to her father and mother the little minx refers you to her lawyer and man of business ugly as she is i would have sacrificed myself but she treated me in that way and upon my soul i was not very sorry for it for she is dear at any price and i have since rejoiced at my want of success who is that elderly gentleman with such snowwhite hair i inquired that replied my companion nobody exactly knows but i have my idea i think said he lowering his voice to a whisper that he is a catholic priest or a jesuit perhaps and a partisan of the house of stuart i have my reasons for supposing so and this i am sure of which is that he is closely watched by the emissaries of government you may remember madam how at that time the country was disturbed by the landing of the pretender in the summer of the year before and the great successes which he had met with and that the duke of cumberland had returned from the army in the low countries and had marched to scotland has there been any intelligence from scotland relative to the movements of the armies i inquired we have heard that the pretender had abandoned the siege of fort william but nothing more and how far the report is true it is hard to say you military men must naturally have a war one way or the other said my companion in a careless manner as to the fighting part of the question i replied i should feel it a matter of great indifference which side i fought for as the claim of both parties is a matter of mere opinion indeed he said and what may be your opinion i have none i think the claims of both parties equal the house of stuart lost the throne of england on account of its religionthat of hanover has been called to the throne for the same cause the adherents of both are numerous at the present moment and it does not follow because the house of hanover has the strongest party that the house of stuart should not uphold its cause while there is a chance of success that is true but if you were to be obliged to take one side or the other which would it be by preference certainly i would support the protestant religion in preference to the catholic i am a protestant and that is reason enough i agree with you replied my companion is your brave friend of the same opinion i really never put the question to him but i think i may safely answer that he is it was fortunate madam that i replied as i did for i afterwards discovered that this precious gossiping young man with his rings and ribbons was no other than a government spy on the lookout for malcontents certainly his disguise was good for i never should have imagined it from his foppish exterior and mincing manners we passed our time much more to my satisfaction now than we did before escorting the ladies to the theatre and to ranelagh and the freedom with which captain levee and i may say i also spent his money soon gave us a passport to good society about a fortnight afterwards the news arrived of the battle of culloden and great rejoicings were made my foppish friend remarked to me yes now that the hopes of the pretender are blasted and the hanoverian succession secured there are plenty who pretend to rejoice and be excessively loyal who if the truth were known ought to be quartered as traitors and i must observe that the day before the news of the battle the old gentleman with snowwhite hair was arrested and sent to the tower and he afterwards suffered for high treason but letters from the owner saying that the presence of both of us was immediately required broke off this pleasant london party indeed the bag of gold was running very low and this combined with the owners letter occasioned our breaking up three days afterwards we took leave of the company at the lodgings and there was a tender parting with one or two buxom young women after which we again mounted our steeds and set off for liverpool where we arrived without any adventure worthy of narration chapter ix i am put in command of the sparrowhawkam directed to take four jacobite gentlemen secretly on boardrun with them to bordeauxland them in safetydine with the governormeet with the widow of the french gentleman i had unfortunately killedam insulted by her second husbandagree to fight with himsail down the river and prepare for action on our arrival captain levee and i as soon as we had got rid of the dust of travel called upon the owner who informed us that all the alterations in captain levees vessel which was a large lugger of fourteen guns and a hundred and twenty men were complete and that my vessel was also ready for me and manned but that i had better go on board and see if any thing else was required or if there was any alteration that i would propose captain levee and i immediately went down to the wharf alongside of which my vessel lay that we might examine her now that she was fitted out as a vessel of war she had been a schooner in the spanish trade and had been captured by captain levee who had taken her out from under a battery as she lay at anchor having just made her port from a voyage from south america being at that time laden with copper and cochineala most valuable prize she had provedand as she was found to be a surprising fast sailer the owner had resolved to fit her out as a privateer she was not a large vessel being of about a hundred and sixty tons but she was very beautifully built she was now armed with eight brass guns of a calibre of six pounds each four howitzers aft and two cohorns on the taffrail you have a very sweet little craft here elrington said captain levee after he had walked all over her and examined her below and aloft she will sail better than before i should think for she then had a very full cargo and now her top hamper is a mere nothing did the owner say how many men you had fiftyfour is i believe to be our full complement i replied and i should think quite enough yes if they are good men and true you may do a great deal with this vessel for you see she draws so little water that you may run in where i dare not venture come we will now return to our lodgings pack up and each go on board of our vessels we have had play enough now to work again and in good earnest i was about to propose it myself i replied for with a new vessel officers and men not known to me the sooner i am on board and with them the better it will take some time to get every thing and everybody in their places spoken like a man who understands his business replied captain levee i wonder whether we shall be sent out together i can only say that i hope so i replied as i should profit much by your experience and hope to prove to you that if necessary i shall not be a bad second and as i made this reply we arrived at the house where we had lodged captain levee was a man who when once he had decided was as rapid as lightning in execution he sent for a dealer in horses concluded a bargain with him in five minutes paid his lodgings and all demands upon him and before noon we were both on board of our respective vessels but previous to the seamen coming up for our boxes i observed to him i should wish levee that you would let me know if it is only at a rough guess what sum i may be indebted to you as i may be fortunate and if so it will be but fair to repay you the money although your kindness i cannot so easily return ill tell you exactly said levee if i take no prizes this cruise and you do make money why then we will on our return have another frolic somewhere and you shall stand treat that will make us all square if i am not fortunate but if i am i consider your pleasant company to have more than repaid me for any little expense i may have incurred you are very kind to say that i replied but i hope you will be fortunate and not have to depend upon me i hope so too he replied laughing if we come back safe and sound we will take a trip to bathi am anxious to see the place i mention this conversation madam that i may make you acquainted with the character of captain levee and prove to you how worthy a man i had as a companion it required about ten days to complete my little schooner with every thing that i considered requisite and the politeness of the owner was extremely gratifying we were however but just complete when the owner sent for me in a great hurry and having taken me into a back room next to the countinghouse he locked the door and said captain elrington i have been offered a large sum to do a service to some unfortunate people but it is an affair which for our own sakes will demand the utmost secrecy indeed you will risk more than i shall but at the same time i trust you will not refuse to perform the service as i shall lose a considerable advantage if you will undertake it i shall not be ungrateful i replied that i was bound to him by many acts of kindness and that he might confide in my gratitude well then he replied lowering his voice the fact is this four of the jacobite party who are hotly pursued and for whose heads a large reward is offered have contrived to escape to this port and are here concealed by their friends who have applied to me to land them at some port in france i understand i replied i will cheerfully execute the commission i thank you captain elrington i expected no other answer from you i would not put them on board captain levees vessel for many reasons but at the same time he knows that he is to sail tomorrow and he shall wait for you and keep company with you till you have landed them after which you may concert your own measures with him and decide whether you cruise together or separate captain levee will of course know that i have them on board certainly but it is to conceal these people from others in his ship and not from him that they are put on board of your vessel at the same time i confess i have my private reasons as well which i do not wish to make known you can sail tomorrow i can sail tonight if you wish i replied no tomorrow night will be the time that i have fixed at what time will they come on board i cannot reply to that till tomorrow the fact is that the government people are on a hot scent and there is a vessel of war in the offing i am told ready to board any thing and every thing which comes out captain levee will sail tomorrow morning and will in all probability be examined by the government vessel which is i understand a most rapid sailer will he submit to it yes he must and i have given him positive orders not to make the least attempt to evade her or prevent a search he will then run to holyhead and layto there for you to join him and you will proceed together to the port which the people taken on board shall direct for that is a part of the agreement they have made with me then of course i am to evade the kings vessel certainly and i have no doubt but that you will be able so to do your vessel is so fleet that there will be little difficulty at all events you will do your best but recollect that although you must make every attempt to escape you must not make any attempt at resistanceindeed that would be useless against a vessel of such force should you be in a position which might enable them to board you you must find some safe hidingplace for your passengers for i hardly need say that if taken with them on board the vessel will be confiscated and you will run some danger of your life i have nothing more to say to you just now except that you may give out that captain levee sails tomorrow and that you are to follow him in ten days your powder is on board yes i got it on board as soon as we hauled out in the stream well then you will call here tomorrow morning about eleven oclock not before and i hardly need repeat it but i again saysecrecyas you value your life as soon as i had left the owner i went down to the wharf stepped into the boat and went on board captain levees vessel which i have omitted to state was named the arrow i found him on board and very busy getting ready for sea so you are off tomorrow levee said i before all the people on the deck yes he replied i wish i was too but i am to remain ten days longer i find i was in hopes we should have cruised together replied captain levee but we must do as our owner wishes what detains youi thought you were ready i thought so too i replied but we find that the head of the mainmast is sprung and we must have a new one i have just come from the owners and must set to work at once and get ready for shifting our mast so fare you well if i do not see you before you sail i am to see the owner tonight replied levee shall we not meet then and take a parting glass i fear not but i will come if i can i replied if not success to the arrow and success to the sparrowhawk replied levee and god bless you my good fellow i shook hands with my kind friend and went over the side of the lugger into my boat and then pulled for my own vessel as soon as i got on board i sent for the officers and men and said to them we are to shift our mainmast for one that is three feet longer and must work hard that we may be able to sail as soon as possible i cannot allow any of you to go on shore till the work is finished when it is done you will have leave as before till we sail that afternoon i sent down the topsailyard and topmast unbent the mainsail maintopsail and gaffsent down the topmast and runningrigging on deckcast loose the lanyards of the lower rigging and quite dismantled the mainmast so as to make it appear as if we were about to haul to the wharf and take it out the men all remained on board expecting that we should shift our berth the next day on the following morning i laid out a warp to the wharf as if intending to haul in and at the time appointed i went on shore to the owner and told him what i had done but he said i find that you will have to sail this night as soon as it is dark how will you get ready i replied that at nightfall i would immediately replace every thing and in an hour would be ready for sea if such be the case you have done well mr elrington and i thank you for your zeal on my behalf which i shall not forget every thing has been arranged and you must come up here with some of your seamen as soon as you are ready to sail your men or rather four of them must remain in the house the four gentlemen who are to be embarked will be dressed in seamens attire and will carry down their boxes and trunks as if they were your men taking your things on board you will then remain a little distance from the wharf in the boat till your own men come down and if there is no discovery you will take them on board with you if on the contrary there is any suspicion and the officers of the government are on the watch and stop your men you will then push off with the passengers slip your cable if it is necessary and make all sail for holyhead where you will fall in with the arrow which will be waiting there for you is the arrow still in sight no i replied she was out of sight more than an hour ago and from our masthead we could see the topgallant sails of the vessel of war bearing nnw keep a lookout upon her and see how she bears at dark replied the owner for you must not fall in with her if possible i think you had better return on board now that you may keep your people quiet when i arrived on board the schooner i told my officers that i did not think that we should shift the mast as proposed and that every thing must be got ready for refitting i did not choose to say more but i added that i was to go on shore in the evening to smoke a pipe with the owner and then i should know for certain i employed the men during the whole of the day in doing every thing in preparation which could be done without exciting suspicion and as soon as it was dark i called the men aft and told them that i thought it was very likely from the arrow not having made her appearance that we might be sent to join her immediately and that i wished them to rig the mainmast and make every thing ready for an immediate start promising them to serve out some liquor if they worked well this was sufficient and in little more than an hour the mast was secured the rigging all complete and the sails ready for bending i then ordered the boat to be manned and telling the officers that they were to bend the sails and have every thing ready for weighing on my return on board which would be in an hour or thereabouts i pulled on shore and went up to the owners taking four men with me and leaving three men in the boat i ordered these three men to remain till the others came down with my trunks and effects and not to leave the boat on any consideration when i arrived at the owners i told him what i had done and he commended my arrangements in the back room i found four gentlemen dressed in seamens clothing and as there was no time to be lost they immediately shouldered the trunks and valises desiring my own men to remain with the owner to bring down any thing that he might wish to send on board i left them in the countinghouse the gentlemen followed me with their loads down to the boat and when i got there the men told me that some people had come down and asked whose boat it was and why they were lying there and that they had told the people that the captain had taken four men with him to bring down his things and that they were waiting for him so it was lucky that i said to my men what i did we hastened to put the trunks into the boat and to get in ourselves after we had received this intelligence and then i shoved off from the wharf and laid about a stones throw distant for my other men at last we heard them coming down and shortly afterwards we perceived that they were stopped by other people and in altercation with them i knew then that the officers were on the alert and would discover the stratagem and therefore desired my men and the gentlemen who had each taken an oar in readiness to give way and pull for the schooner as we did so the kings officers on search who had stopped my four men came down to the wharf and ordered us to come back but we made no reply as soon as we were alongside we hoisted the things out of the boat veered her astern by a towrope slipped the cable and made sail fortunately it was very dark and we were very alert in our movements we could perceive lights at the wharf as we sailed out of the river and it was clear that we had had a narrow escape but i felt no alarm on account of the owner as i knew that although they might suspect they could prove nothing when about three miles out we hove to hoisted in the boat and shaped our course all i had now to fear was the falling in with the ship of war in the offing and i placed men to keep a sharp lookout in every direction and told the officers that it was necessary that we should avoid her when last seen about an hour before dark she was well to windward and as the wind was from the northward she would probably sail faster than we could as a schooner does not sail so well free as on a wind we had run out about four hours and were steering our course for holyhead when suddenly we perceived the ship of war close to us and to leeward she had been lying with her mainsail to the mast but she evidently had made us out for she filled and set topgallant sails i immediately hauled my wind and as soon as she had way she tacked and followed in pursuit being then right astern of us about half a mile off it was very dark and i knew that as our sails were set and we bore from her it would be difficult for her to keep us in sight as we only presented what we call the featheredge of our sails to her i therefore steered on under all sail and finding that the schooner weathered on her i kept her away a little so as to retain the same bearings and to leave her faster in an hour we could not make out the ship and were therefore certain that she could not see us so as i wanted to get clear of her and be at holyhead as soon as possible i lowered down all the sails and put my helm up so as to cross her and run to leeward under bare poles while she continued her windward chase this stratagem answered and we saw no more of her for two hours afterwards we fell in with the arrow and hailing her we both made sail down the bristol channel as fast as we could and at daybreak there was no vessel in sight and of course we had nothing more to fear from the liverpool cruiser as we now sailed rapidly along in company with the wind on our quarter it was high time for me to look to my passengers who had remained on deck in perfect silence from the time that they had come on board i therefore went up to them and apologized for not having as yet paid them that attention that i should have wished to have done under other circumstances captain replied the oldest of them with a courteous salute you have paid us every attention you have been extremely active in saving our lives and we return you our sincere thanks yes indeed replied a young and handsome man who stood next him mr elrington has saved us from the toils of our enemies but now that we are in no fear from that quarter i must tell him that we have hardly had a mouthful of food for twentyfour hours and if he wishes to save our lives a second time it will be by ordering a good breakfast to be prepared for us campbell speaks the truth my dear sir said the one who had first spoken we have lately gained the knowledge of what it is to hunger and thirst and we all join in his request you shall not wait long i replied i will be up again in a moment or two i went down into the cabin and ordering my servant to put on the table a large piece of pressed hamburg beef a cold pie of various flesh and fowl combined some bread and cheese and some bottles of brandy and usquebaugh i then went up again and requested them all to descend hungry they certainly were and it was incredible the quantity that they devoured i should have imagined that they had not been fed for a week and i thought that if they were to consume at that rate my stock would never last out and the sooner they were landed the better as soon as they left off eating and had finished two bottles of usquebaugh i said to them gentlemen my orders are to land you at any port of france that you should prefer have you made up your minds as to which it shall be for it will be necessary that we shape a course according to your decision mr elrington on that point we would wish to advise with you i hardly need say that our object is to escape and that falling in with and being captured by a ship of war and there are many out in pursuit of us and other unfortunate adherents to the house of stuart would be extremely disagreeable as our heads and our bodies would certainly part company if we were taken now which port do you think we should be most likely to reach with least chance of interruption i think i replied as you pay me the compliment to ask my opinion that it would be better to run down the bay of biscay and then put in the port of bordeaux or any other where you could be landed in safety and my reason is this the channel is full of cruisers looking after those of your party who are attempting to escape and my vessel will be chased and searched now although we might sail faster than any one vessel in the channel yet it is very possible that in running away from one we may fall into the jaws of another and besides we are two privateers and cruising off bordeaux will excite no suspicion as it is a favourite cruisingground so that if we were boarded there would be little danger of discovery but of course as long as i can prevent that by taking to my heels i shall not be boarded by any one the only objection to what i propose is that you will be confined longer in a vessel than you may like or than you would be if you were to gain a nearer port i agree with the captain of the vessel said a gravelooking personage who had not yet spoken and whom i afterwards discovered to be a catholic priest the stanchest adherent to the cause could not have given better advice and i should recommend that it be followed the others were of the same opinion and in consequence i edged the schooner down to the arrow and hailed captain levee stating that we were to run to bordeaux after that i prepared for them sleeping accommodations as well as i could and on my making apologies they laughed and told me such stories of their hardships during their escape that i was not surprised at their not being difficult i found out their names by their addressing one another to be campbell mintyre ferguson and mdonald all of them very refined gentlemen and of excellent discourse they were very merry and laughed at all that they had suffered sang jacobite songs as they were termed and certainly did not spare my locker of wine the wind continued fair and we met with no interruption and on the fourth evening at dusk we made the mouth of the garonne and then hove to with our heads off shore for the night captain levee then came on board and i introduced him to my passengers to my surprise after some conversation he said i have now escorted captain elrington according to the orders i received and shall return to liverpool as soon as possible if therefore gentlemen you have any letters to send to your friends announcing your safety i shall be most happy to present them in any way you may suggest as most advisable that captain levee had some object in saying this i was quite certain and therefore i made no remark the passengers thanked him for his proposal and being provided with writing materials they all wrote to their friends and put their letters into captain levees hands who then bade them farewell and went on deck with me of course you were not serious in what you said captain levee i inquired as we walked forward no he replied but i considered it prudent to make them believe so although englishmen they are enemies to our country so far as they are enemies to our government and of course wish no harm to the french who have so warmly supported them now if they knew that i remained here waiting for your coming out of the river they would say so and i might lose the chance of a good prize as nothing would sail if they knew that the coast was not clear now i shall part company with you in an hour and make all sail for england as they may suppose but without fail tomorrow night i shall be off here again about five leagues from the port with my sails furled therefore stay in the river as long as they will let you as while you are in port with the flag of truce vessels may sail out i understand you and will do all i can to assist your views captain levee now we will go down again i will give you a receipt for a coil of rope which you will send your boat for and write a letter to the owners after which you will wish me good bye and make sail exactly captain levee replied who then ordered his boat to go for a coil of three inch and bring it on board we then descended to the cabin and i wrote a letter to the owner and also a receipt for the coil of rope which i delivered to captain levee the boat soon returned from the lugger the rope was taken on board and then captain levee wished me farewell and made his polite adieus to the gentlemen who followed him on deck and waited there till he had hoisted in his boat and made all sail how long will she be before she arrives at liverpool with this wind inquired mr campbell she will carry her canvas night and day i replied and therefore as she sails so fast i should say in five or six days well i am grateful that we have such an early and safe opportunity of communicating with our friends in england we might have waited two months otherwise very true replied the priest but heaven has assisted our anxious wishes let us be grateful for all things my passengers watched the lugger until she was nearly out of sight i dare say that their thoughts were that those on board of her were going to the country of their birth from which they were exiles probably for ever they did not speak but went down below and retired to their beds at daylight the next morning i ran the schooner in and as soon as i was within three miles of the coast i hoisted the white flag of truce and stood for the mouth of the river garonne i perceived that the batteries were manned but not a shot was fired and we entered the river when we were a mile up the river we were boarded by the french authorities and my passengers who had dressed themselves in their proper costume informed the officer in the boat who they were upon which he was very polite and calling a pilot out of the boat the schooner was taken charge of by him and we very soon afterwards having wind and tide in our favour were anchored alongside of two large merchant vessels and a french privateer of sixteen guns which i instantly recognized as our old antagonist off hispaniola in the action in which the revenge was captured and captain weatherall lost his life however i kept my knowledge to myself as the french officer and the jacobite gentleman were present as soon as we had anchored the passengers were requested to go into the boat and the french officer and i to accompany them that i might report myself to the governor and we pulled away to the town one of my boats following with the passengers luggage on our landing there was a great crowd assembled and they looked very hard at me as i was dressed in my lace coat and a cockedup hat also bound with broad gold lace on our arrival in the presence of the governor we were received with much urbanity and as i had brought the jacobite gentlemen in my schooner it was presumed that i was favourable to the cause and i was very politely treated the governor invited us all to dine with him on that day i made some excuse saying that i was anxious to return to liverpool that i might fit out for the coast of africa in which service i was to be employed by my owners but the passengers insisted upon my staying a day or two and the governor added to their solicitations his own i therefore accepted not only because i was glad to have an opportunity to see so celebrated a town but because it would meet the views of captain levee we took leave of the governor and went to an hotel and i then sent my boat on board for necessaries and hired a handsome apartment in the hotel i had not been there half an hour when the priest came to me and said captain you are not aware of the rank and consequence of the three gentlemen whom you have been so successful in escorting to a place of safety i am requested by them to make you a handsome remuneration for your kindness and skilful conduct on this occasion sir i replied that must not be i am most happy in having assisted in the escape of unfortunate gentlemen and all the pleasure i feel at having so done would be destroyed if i were to accept of what you offer it is useless to repeat it and if you do i shall consider it an insult and immediately repair on board of my vessel you will therefore tender my best thanks and my refusal with ardent wishes for their future welfare after what you have said captain elrington i will of course not resume the offer i will tell my fellowpassengers what you have said and i am sure that they will as i do admire your high sense of honourthe priest shook me by the hand and then quitted my apartment i did not see the other passengers till it was the hour to go to dine at the governors when they embraced me cordially and the one calling himself campbell said should you ever be in distress or a prisoner in this country recollect you have a friend who is ready to serve you here is an address to a lady to whom you must write and say that you wish the assistance of your passenger to bordeauxthat will be sufficienti trust you may never require it we had a pleasant dinner at the governors and among the people invited to meet us i perceived the french captain of the privateer i knew him immediately although he did not recognize me we had some conversation together and he spoke about his cruises in the west indies and asked me whether i knew captain weatherall i said there was a captain weatherall who commanded the revenge privateer and who was killed when his vessel was taken exactly said the captain he was a brave man and fought nobly and so did all his peoplethey fought like devils yes i replied they fought as long as they could but captain weatherall was very shorthanded he had but fiftyfive men on board at the commencement of the action more than that im sure replied the french captain he had not i assure you i replied he had lost so many in an attack on shore and had so many away in prizes our conversation had attracted general notice and a french army officer observed monsieur speaks so positively that one would imagine that he was actually on board and so i was sir replied i and have my wounds to show for it i knew this officer immediately i saw him for i was close to captain weatherall at the time that this officer expostulated with him before the action and i crossed my sword with him during the combat you have convinced me that you were on board replied the captain of the privateer by your mentioning the expostulations previous to the combat taking place i am delighted to have met with so brave an enemy for every man on board that vessel was a hero the conversation was then general and many particulars were asked and i will do the french captain the justice to say that he was very correct in all his statements and neither vaunted his own success nor did us less than justice the party then broke up to go to the theatre and afterwards we repaired to the hotel i remained there two days more and on the last of these two days i had promised to sup with the french captain of the privateer who had called upon me and behaved very politely the following day after noon when the tide served i was to sail accordingly after the theatre was over i went with the french captain to his house in company with two or three more supper was on the table when we arrived there and we went into the room waiting for the presence of the captains lady who had not gone to the theatre and to whom i had not been introduced after a few minutes she made her appearance and as she entered the room i was struck with her extreme beauty although she was past the meridian of life i thought i had seen her face before and as she came forward with her husband it at once rushed into my mind that she was the widow of the french gentleman who had so gallantly fought his vessel and who fell by my handthe lady who was nursing her son at the kings hospital at jamaica and who had been so inveterate against me our eyes met and her cheeks flushed she recognized me and i coloured deeply as i bowed to her she was taken with a faintness and fell back fortunately her husband received her in his arms what is the matter my love he said nothing but i am taken with a vertigo replied she it will go off directly make my excuses to the company while i retire for a few minutes her husband went out of the room and after a minute or two came back saying that madam was not well enough to return to the room and begged that they would admit her excuse and sit down to supper without her whether his wife had informed him of who i was i know not but nothing could exceed the civility of the french captain towards me during the supper we did not however remain very late as the lady of the house was indisposed i found out as i walked home with another french officer that the captain of the privateer had fallen in with the french lady on her return from jamaica where her son died in the hospital and had married her and that moreover unlike most french husbands he was most ardently attached to her i had breakfasted the next morning and packed up my clothes preparatory to going on board and had just returned from a visit of leavetaking with the governor when who should walk up into my apartment but the french captain of the privateer accompanied by three or four french officers of the army i perceived by his looks when he entered that he was a little excited but i met him cordially he began a conversation about his action with captain weatherall and instead of speaking handsomely as he had done before he used expressions which i considered offensive and i at once took him up by observing that being under a flag of truce it was impossible for me to notice what he said no he replied but i wish we were once more on the high seas together for i have a little debt of gratitude to pay off well i replied you may have and i should not be sorry to give you an opportunity if it were possible may i inquire whether you intend to go home as a cartel and carry your flag of truce to liverpool no sir i replied i shall haul down my flag of truce as soon as i am out of gunshot of your batteries i understand what you mean sir it is very true that your vessel carries nearly double the number of men and guns that mine does but nevertheless i shall haul down my flag of truce as i say i will not if i follow you down the river i presume he said with a sort of sneer follow me if you dare i cried you will meet with your master depend upon it sacre replied he in a passion i will blow you out of the water and if i take you i will hang you for a pirate not the last certainly i said coolly look you sir he cried shutting his fist upon the palm of his other hand if i take you i will hang you and if you take me you may serve me in the same way is it a bargain or are you a coward gentlemen i said to the officers present you must feel that your countryman is not behaving well he has insulted me grossly i will however consent to his terms on one condition which is that he will permit one of you after he has sailed to make known the conditions upon which we fight to his wife and that one of you will pledge me his honour that he will impart these conditions as soon as we are gone agree to do sopledge yourself to do so xavier cried the french captain to one of the officers present since you wish it certainly he said you pledge yourself to make the conditions known to madam as soon as we have sailed i do upon the honour of an officer and a gentleman replied he painful as it will be to me then captain i replied i agree to your conditions and one or the other of us shall hang you may suppose madam that i must have been in a state of great irritation to have consented to such terms i was so and could not brook such insult in the presence of the french officers moreover as you will observe in my conversation i did not commit myself in any way there was nothing dishonourable i told him that i should haul down my flag of truce and i also told him that he would meet with his master which was true enough as he would meet with the arrow commanded by captain levee as well as with my vessel while he thought that he would have to fight with my inferior vessel alone and making sure of conquest he purposely insulted me to make me accept such conditions as would administer to the revenge of his wife who had evidently worked him up to act in such a manner and i accepted them because i hoped the fate would be his if captain levee joined me and if not i was determined that i never would be taken alive after i had agreed to his conditions they all took a very ceremonious leave and i bowed them out with great mock humility i then bade farewell to my passengers who lodged in the same hotel and went down to my boat and pulled on board as soon as the tide served the pilot came on board and we got under weigh i observed a great bustle and a hurrying to and fro of boats on board of the french privateer and we had not gone above two miles down the river before i perceived the men were aloft and lowering her sails i told my officers that i had received a challenge from the french privateer and had accepted it and that we must get every thing ready for action they were much astonished at this as the disparity of force was so great but they went cheerfully to their duty as did the men among whom the news was soon spread chapter x captain levee and i engage with the french privateerwe come off victoriousmy revenge against the french ladywe take our prize to liverpool the wind was light and we did not gain the mouth of the river till near sundown when the pilot left us and as soon as we were three miles in the offing i hauled down the flag of truce in the sight of the french privateer who was following us close and was not more than four miles from us to avoid mistake i had agreed with captain levee that should i be coming out after dark i would carry a light at the peak and this light i now hoisted it enabled the french privateer to follow me and appeared only as a mark of contempt towards him i stood on in the direction where i was to find captain levee and could make out the frenchman following me and gradually nearing me as it became dark i made more sail to keep him further off till i had joined the arrow but the light at my peak pointed out to him where i was all this seemed a mystery to my officers and men until having run out about four leagues i desired them to keep a sharp lookout for the arrow about halfpast eight oclock we perceived her lyingto she had furled her sails after dark as usual the light i bore told her who i was and i ran close to her and hailing captain levee desired him to prepare for action and that i would come on board to speak to him this of course created a great bustle on board of the arrow and i hastened on board that they might not show any lights i then informed captain levee of all that had passed and that the frenchman was not more than five miles from us we agreed that i should still keep up the light and bear away a little to draw the frenchman to leeward of the port and also to leeward of the arrowthat the arrow should lower her sails again so as not to be perceived until i had drawn the frenchman past him and that then i should commence the action under sail and fight till the arrow came up to my assistance this being arranged i hastened on board of my schooner and keeping away four points i waited for the coming up of my antagonist in half an hour we could perceive him through the gloom not more than a mile from us under all sail standing steadily for the light which we carried at our peak as i had already discovered that my little schooner sailed faster than my opponent i allowed her to come up within a quarter of a mile of me when i rounded to and desiring my men to aim at his rigging so as to dismantle him poured in my broadside of grape and langridge and then shifted my helm and resumed my course putting more sail on so as to increase my distance to what it was before this manoeuvre i executed three times with success and i had the satisfaction of perceiving that his foretopmast was shot away but when i roundedto the fourth time he did the same and we exchanged broadsides the effect of his superior artillery was evident for my rigging and sails were much damaged happily nothing so serious as to impede our speed and i again put before the breeze as before and increased my distance previous to again roundingto for as the water was very smooth i knew that if i was crippled she would lay me by the board immediately and i might be taken and hanged before the arrow could come up to my assistance i therefore continued a running fight at such a distance as rendered me less liable to suffer from his guns it is true that this distance made my guns even more ineffective but i was decoying my frenchman off from the land and placing the arrow between him and his port so that his return would be intercepted this continued for about an hour when i perceived that the frenchman had got up a new foretopmast and had set the sail upon it he now ran out his bowchasers and continued to fire upon me with them alone not choosing to lose ground by roundingto to give me a broadside and as his canvas was all out and i was occasionally roundingto to dismantle him we retained much the same distance from one another at last a shot from his bowchaser struck off the head of my mainmast and my gaff came down this was serious we hastened to reef the mainsail and hoist it up again upon the remainder of the mast but having no gafftopsail our speed was necessarily decreased and the enemy appeared to be gradually closing with us i looked out for the arrow but could perceive no signs of her indeed it was too dark to see farther than half a mile finding that on the point of sailing we were on i had no chance i determined to alter my course and put my schooner right before the wind so that i might set the square mainsail which would give time for the arrow to arrive indeed at this time i was in a state of great anxiety however i had made up my mind not to be taken alive and to sell my life as dearly as i could when the enemy perceived that we had put before the wind he did the same and as we were about half a mile from each other we continued to exchange broadsides as we ran she gradually nearing us so as to make her heavy artillery more effective this portion of the contest continued for an hour during which my little schooner had received much injury and we were constantly repairing damages at last much to my delight the day began to dawn and i then discovered the arrow about a mile and a half from us right astern under a press of sail i pointed her out to my officers and men who were inspired with fresh courage at the sight the enemy also perceived her and appeared determined to bring the combat to an issue previous to her coming up and i feared that at all events i might swing at the yardarm let the issue of the coming combat be what it might she neared steering a course so as to cut me off and i continued to pour in my broadsides to cripple her if possible as she did not now fire but ran steadily for me and my chances were bad anxious that the arrow should close as soon as possible i hauled down my square mainsail that we might not run from her and prepared for an obstinate resistance if boarded at last the frenchman was within a cables length and at this critical moment the arrow was about a mile to windward we poured in our last broadside and hastened to seize our pikes and cutlasses to repel the boarders when to my satisfaction i found that one of our shot had cut his gaff in two i immediately rounded to the wind and as my antagonist was within pistolshot of me with her men all ready for the leap on board i put my helm down went round in stays and crossed her so near to windward that you might have thrown a biscuit on board this manoeuvre prevented his boarding and i may say saved my life for his gaff being shot away he could not heave in stays to follow me but was obliged to wear round after me which increased his distance at least a cables length to leeward a furious broadside however which he poured in crippled me altogether every thing came running down upon the decks and i was left a complete wreck but i was to windward of him and although he might sink me he could not board or take possession until he had refitted his aftersail but now his time was come a fresh antagonist with equal weight of metal was close to him and he had to decide whether he would fight or run whether he conceived that running was useless which it certainly was or was determined to take us both or die i know not certain it is that he did not put his vessel before the wind but waited with determination the coming up of the arrow captain levee passed under the frenchmans stern raking him with a broadside that almost unrigged him and then engaged him to leeward so as to cut off all chance of his escape the frenchman returned the fire with spirit and i took my men from my guns that we might set some sail upon the vessel for after the arrow commenced her fire no further notice was taken of me by the frenchman after a contest well maintained for half an hour the mainmast of the frenchman went by the board and this almost settled the question as he could not keep his vessel to the wind and consequently she fell off and received a raking fire from the arrow at last her bowsprit was between the main and fore rigging of the arrow and her decks were swept by the arrows raking fire i had got some sail up forward and was anxious to be at the close of the action i perceived that the frenchman was attempting to board the lugger and was pouring all his people on the forecastle and i therefore edged down to him that i might with my people board him on the quarter which would place him as we say between two fires the conflict was at its highest the french attempting and the arrows crew repelling them when i laid my schooner on her quarter and leaped on board of her with my few remaining men the frenchmen turned to repel my attack and thus weakened their party opposed to the arrows men the consequence was that they were first beaten back and then boarded by captain levee and his crew as soon as i had gained the deck of the frenchman i thought of nothing but to single out the french captain at first i could not see him but as his crew retreated from captain levee and his men i perceived him pale and exhausted but still attempting to rally them as my object was to take him alive i rushed in advance at him wrestled and threw him on his back on the deck there i held him while the combatants fighting and retreating tumbled over us one after another and bruised us severely with their weight at last the french were beaten below and i had time to breathe calling to two of my men i desired them to take charge of the french captain and as they valued their lives not to let him escape or destroy himself but to take him into our vessel and guard him carefully in my cabin having done this i went to captain levee and we embraced you did not come a minute too soon i said wiping the blood from my face no indeed and but for your clever manoeuvre you would have been beaten your vessel is a mere nutshell compared to thisyou did well more than well to maintain the combat so long have you lost many men we had ten sent below before we boarded what may have followed since i do not know i have the french captain safe in my cabin i saw the men hand him overwell now to repair damages and then i will tell you what you shall do i must send on board and help you the arrow has not suffered much considering and i can spare the men as soon as we have cleared up the decks a little we will breakfast together and talk the matter over it required two hours before we could clear the decks of our vessels for we had separated and the arrow had taken charge of the prize before i took the boat to go on board the arrow i went down into my cabin where the french captain lay bound and watched by two of the men you are prepared to pay the penalty agreed upon monsieur said i i am sir he replied i now understand what you meant when you said that i should meet with my match i have no one to blame but myself i urged you to the conditions expecting an easy and certain conquest with my superior vessel i have fallen into my own net and theres an end of the matterexcept that when things go wrong a woman is certain to be at the bottom of it i am aware sir i replied that your wife instigated you to act as you did or you would never have so behaved in attempting to revenge the death of one husband she has lost two cest vrai replied the frenchman composedly and i then quitted the cabin and went on board of the arrow well elrington said captain levee what do you intend to do with the french captain is he to pay the forfeit and swing at the yardarm i dont like hanging a man especially a brave man in cold blood i replied it was all his wifes doing and he has confessed as much he would certainly have hanged you replied levee yes that i believe but it would have been that he might have a quiet life at homenot from any resentment against me now i have no feeling of that kind to actuate me what will you do then not hang him certainly and yet i should like to punish her she deserves it replied captain levee now elrington will you approve of my suggestion let me hear it it is this they do not know that i have assisted in taking the privateer as they have no idea that i am here as soon as we have refitted her and your vessel i will remain where i am you shall run into the mouth of the garonne with your colours flying and the english jack over the french flag on board of the prize this will lead them to suppose that you have taken the vessel without assistance when just out of gunshot heaveto fire a gun and then swing an effigy to the yardarm and remain there to make them suppose that you have hung the french captain at nightfall you can make sail and rejoin me that will punish her and annoy them generally i will do so it is an excellent device and she will never know the truth for a long time to come we remained all that day refitting in the evening i made sail in company with the french schooner which was manned by captain levee and stood in shore at break of the following day i ran in standing for the harbour without my colours being hoisted and then it occurred to me that i would make their disappointment greater by allowing them first to imagine that the victory was theirs so when about six miles off i hoisted french colours on the french schooner and french colours over english on board of my own i continued to stand on till within two miles and a half of the batteries and could see crowds flocking down to witness the supposed triumphant arrival of their privateer into port when of a sudden i hauled my wind hoveto brailed up my sails and changed the colours firing a gun in bravado allowing them half an hour to comment upon this disappointment i then fired another gun and hoisted up to the yardarm the figure of a man composed of clothes stuffed with hay made to represent the french captain and having so done i remained during the whole forenoon with my sails brailed up that they might have a clear view of the hanging figure at last we perceived a large boat with a flag of truce coming out of the river i remained where i was and allowing it to come alongside i perceived in it the french officer who had pledged himself to give the conditions of the combat to the lady and seated by him was the french captains wife with her head sunk down on her knees and her face buried in her handkerchief i saluted the officer as he came on the deck he returned my bow and then said sir the fortune of war has proved in your favour and i perceive that the conditions of the issue of the combat have been adhered to on your side against that i have not a word to say as my friend would have as rigidly adhered to them but sir we war not with the dead and i have come off at the request of his miserable wife to beg that you will now that your revenge is satisfied deliver up to her her husbands body that it may receive the rites of the church and christian burial you surely as a brave man will not deny this small favour to a woman whom you have twice deprived of her husband sir i replied on condition that his lady will step on board and make the request herself i will comply with it but on no other terms it will be most painful and her feelings might well have been spared such a trial as to meet your face again and make the request in person but as you insist upon it i will make known your terms as he went into his boat i ran down into the cabin and desired them to cast loose the french captain saying to him sir your wife is here requesting your body which she believes to be swinging at the yardarm for i have put that trick into execution to punish her i never intended to take your life and i shall now do more i shall give you not only life but libertysuch shall be my revenge the french captain stared as if confounded but made no reply i then went on deck where i found the lady had been lifted up the side they led her to me and she fell on her knees but the effort was too much for her and she fainted away i ordered her to be taken down into the cabin and without any explanation desired the french officer to accompany her not wishing to be present at the unexpected meeting i therefore remained on deck and ordering the men to lower down the effigy they did so laughing at the french seamen in the boat who for the first time perceived for they had not looked up before that it was only a sham captain i looked over the side and told them that the captain was alive and well and would be in the boat very soon at which they were greatly rejoiced in the mean time the explanation took place in the cabin and after a few minutes the french officer came up and expressed his satisfaction at what i had done you have given a lesson sir without being guilty of barbarity your conduct has been noble he was soon followed by the french captain and his lady who was now all gratitude and would have kissed my hands but i prevented her and said madam at least now you have no occasion to hate me if i was so unfortunate in selfdefence as to slay your first husband i have restored to you your second let us then part in amity the french captain squeezed my hand but said nothing i begged they would take some refreshment but they were too anxious to return and undeceive their friends and requested permission to go into the boat of course i consented and as the boat pulled away the crew gave three huzzas as a compliment to us when they were a mile in shore i hauled down the colours of both vessels and made sail out to rejoin captain levee which i did in the evening and then related all that had passed he was much pleased with the result of the affair and we then having consulted considered it advisable to run back to liverpool with the prize for she required so many hands to man her as to render us by no means efficient vessels moreover i have omitted to state that while i was in the garonne the arrow had taken two good prizes which she had manned and sent to liverpool we therefore made sail to the northward and in a week were again in port with our prize we found that the other vessels had arrived safe and the owner was much pleased with the results of this short and eventful cruise chapter xi i cause myself to be dismissed from my owners serviceam arrestedconveyed to london and confined in the toweram visited by a romish priest and through his interference obtain my liberationset off to liverpool and find my owner and captain leveetheir surprisemiss trevannion when i called upon our owner which i did as soon as i had dropped my anchor and furled sails he embraced me and then led me into the back room next to his countinghouse my dear elrington said he well as you managed to get off the jacobite gentlemen there is a strong suspicion on the part of the government that they were on board of your vessel and that i was a party to their escape whether they will take any measures now that you have returned i know not they may have gained some intelligence or they may worm out something by their emissaries from those who compose your crew and if so we must expect their vengeance now tell me where you landed them and all the events of your cruise for i have heard but little from those who brought in the prizes taken by the arrow captain levee is too busy with his own vessel and the prize to come on shore for these two hours and i wish to talk with you alone upon this affair after i had narrated all that had passed and the manner in which the french privateer had been captured the owner said if the government spies and there are plenty of them about find out from your crew that you landed passengers at bordeaux depend upon it you will be arrested and examined without you get out of the way till the affair has blown over now the men will narrate in the taverns the curious history of this french privateer and in so doing cannot fail to state that you were on shore in france now elrington you have run the risk to oblige me and i must keep you out of difficulty and if you feel inclined to hide yourself for a time i will of course pay all your expenses no i replied if they find out what has taken place and wish to get hold of me in consequence i think it will be better to brave it out if i hide away it will make them more anxious to have me and will confirm their suspicions that i am what they are pleased to call a traitor a reward will be offered for my apprehension and at any time that i do appear the reward will cause me to be taken up if on the contrary i brave it out and if i am asked say at once that i did land passengers at all events they will not make it high treason so with your leave i will stay i hardly need say that i shall take the whole responsibility on myself and declare that i took them on board without your knowledge that you may rest assured of on consideration i think that your plan is the best replied my owner i am grateful for your offer of screening me which i would not permit were it not that i shall be useful to you if any mischance takes place and if in prison could be of no service then sir i replied the wisest course will be for you at once to dismiss me from the command of the privateer in consequence of your having been informed that i carried passengers and landed them in france that step will prove you a friend to the government and will enable you after a time to get me out of my scrape more effectually you are sacrificing yourself elrington and all for me not so sir i am only securing a friend in case of need that you certainly are replied my owner squeezing my hand well it will be the best plan even for you and so let it be then i will now return on board and tell the officers that i am dismissed there is no time to be lost and here comes captain levee so for the present sir farewell on my return on board i called up the officers and men and told them that i had offended the owner and that he had dismissed me from the command of the privateer one of the officers inquired what i had done and i said before the men that it was for landing the passengers in france they all condoled with me and expressed their sorrow at my leaving them and i believe that they were sincere it was fortunate that i did as i had done for i found that the government emissaries were on board at the time that i made the communication and had already gained the information from some of my crew i ordered my chest and bedding to be put into the boat and as soon as they were ready i gave up the command to the first officer and bidding them all farewell went down the side and pulled on shore repairing to my former lodgings i had not been there two hours before i was arrested and taken to prison i was however very comfortably lodged because i was a state prisoner and i presume that more respect is paid to a man when he is to be drawn and quartered and his head set above the tower gates then a petty malefactor the next day i was summoned before what was called the commission and asked whether i had not landed some people in france i replied immediately that i had done so who were they was the next inquiry they stated themselves to be roman catholic priests replied i and such i believed them to be why did i do so because in the first place they paid me one hundred guineas each and in the second because i considered them mischievous dangerous men conspiring against the government and that the sooner they were out of the country the better how did i know that they were traitors all roman priests were traitors in my opinion and i hated them as bad as i did the french but it is difficult to deal with a priest and i thought that i was performing a good service in ridding the country of them who else was privy to the affair no one i had made the arrangement with them myself and not an officer or man on board knew any thing about it but my owner mr trevannion was he a party to it no he was not and on my return he dismissed me from the command of the privateer as soon as he found out that i had landed the priests in france a great many more questions were put to me all of which i answered very cautiously yet without apparent hesitation and after an examination of four hours the president of the commission told me that i had been by my own acknowledgment aiding and abetting the escape of malignant traitors and prevented them meeting their just fate on the scaffold that in so doing i had been guilty of treason and must abide the sentence of the supreme commission in london whither i should be sent the following day i replied that i was a loyal subject that i hated the french and romish plotters and that i had done what i considered was best that if i had done wrong it was only an error in judgment and any one that said i was a traitor lied in his throat my reply was taken down and i was sent back to prison the following afternoon the gaoler came into my room accompanied by two persons one of whom informed me that i was delivered over to their custody to be taken to london i was led out and at the door i found three horses upon one of which i was desired to mount as soon as i was in the saddle a rope was passed from one leg to the other under the horses belly so as to prevent my escape and my horse was led between the other two upon which my keepers rode each having a handrein made fast from my horses bridle to his own a crowd was assembled round the entrance of the gaol and among the lookerson i perceived captain levee and my owner but of course i thought it imprudent to take any notice of them and they did not make any recognition of me i hardly need say my dear madam how very revolting it was to my feelings to be thus led away like a felon but at the same time i must acknowledge the courtesy of my conductors who apologized for being compelled to take such measures of security and on the way showed great kindness and goodfeeling every thing being arranged we proceeded on our journey but it was late when we set off owing to one of my conductors being sent for by the commissioner and having to wait for letters for nearly three hours as it may be supposed we could not travel at speed and we seldom went faster than a walk which i was sorry for as i was anxious that the journey should be over and my fate decided as soon as possible almost an hour after dark a party of men rushed from the side of the road and some seizing the bridles of the horses the others threw the two conductors off their saddles by taking them by the leg and heaving them over on the other side this was done so quickly that the two men who were well armed had not time to draw out a pistol or any other weapon of defence and as soon as they were on the ground they were immediately seized and overpowered the faces of the men who had thus assailed the kings officers were blackened so as to disguise them but from their voices i knew them to be the men and officers of the privateer now then captain elrington said one of them be off with you as fast as possible and we will take care of these fellows i still remained in my saddle and although somewhat flurried with the surprise of the attack i had had time to recover myself and had decided upon my mode of behaviour i felt as i had said to the owner when we consulted together that an escape now would be only putting off the evil day and that it was better to meet the case boldly at once so i rose in my stirrups and said to the men in a loud voice my good fellows i am much obliged to you for your exertions in my behalf as it proves your goodwill but i cannot and will not take advantage of them by some mistake i am accused of being a traitor when i feel that i am a true and loyal subject which i have no doubt will be fully established upon my arrival in london i cannot therefore take advantage of this opportunity to escape i respect the laws of my country and i beg you to do the same oblige me by releasing the two gentlemen whom you have made your prisoners and assist them to remount their horses for i am resolved that i will go to london and be honourably acquitted once more my lads many thanks for your kind intentions and now i wish you farewell and if you would do me a great favour you will disperse peaceably and leave us to proceed on our journey the men perceived that i was in earnest and therefore did as i requested and in another minute i was again alone with my two keepers you have behaved honourably sir and perhaps wisely observed one of my conductors as he was about to remount his horse i will not ask you who those people were although i have no doubt but you recognized them yourself no i replied i did not i guessed from whence they came but i did not recognize any one individual i gave this cautious answer although i had recognized captain levee and one of my own officers well captain elrington you have proved to us that you may be trusted and therefore on your pledging your word that you will not escape we shall have a great pleasure in removing all unpleasant precautions i certainly have proved that i would not escape and will readily give you my assurance that i will not alter my mind that is sufficient sir replied the officer and he then cut away the rope which bound my legs and also look off the two leading reins attached to the other horses we shall now he said proceed not only more pleasantly but more rapidly my conductors then mounted their horses and we set off at a good trot and in an hour arrived at the place where we were to put up for the night we found supper prepared for us and good beds my conductors now left me free of all restraint and we retired to our beds the next day we continued our journey in the same manner my companions were pleasant and gentlemenlike men and we discoursed freely upon every topic no one could have imagined that i was a state prisoner we arrived at london on the fifth day and i was then delivered over to the keeper of the tower according to the instructions that my conductors had received they bade me farewell and promised that they would not fail to represent my conduct to the authorities and gave me hopes of a speedy release i had the same idea and took possession of the apartments prepared for me which were airy and well ventilated with almost cheerfulness on the third day after my arrival a commission was sent to the tower to examine me and i gave the same replies as before they were very particular in obtaining the descriptions of the persons of those whom i had landed in france and i answered without disguise i afterwards found out that i had done a very foolish thing had i misrepresented their persons it would have been supposed that they really were four catholic priests but from my exact description they discovered that i had rescued the four traitors as they termed them that they were most anxious to secure and make an example of and their annoyance at this discovery had so angered them against me that my subsequent conduct could not create any feeling favourable towards me three weeks elapsed and i was wearied of confinement my gaoler told me that he feared my case was a bad one and after another week had passed he said that i was condemned as aiding and abetting treason i must say that i little expected this result and it quite overthrew me i asked my gaoler what was his authority he said that so many people had assisted and effected the escape of the rebels without one having been convicted of having so done except myself on my own avowal that they deemed it absolutely necessary that an example should be made to deter others from aiding those who were still secreted in the country and that in consequence it had been decided by the privy council that i should be made an example of he told me much more which i need not repeat except that it proved the malignant feeling that was indulged by the powers in authority against those who had assisted their defeated opponents and i felt that i had no chance and prepared my mind to meet my fate alas my dear madam i was but illprepared to dienot that i feared death but i feared what must be my condition after death i had lived a reckless lawless life without fear of god or man all the religious feelings which had been instilled into me by my good tutor you know my family history and i need say no more during my youth had been gradually sapped away by the loose companionship which i had held since the time that i quitted my fathers house and when i heard that i was to die my mind was in a state of great disquiet and uncomfortable feeling i wished to review my life and examine myself but i hardly knew where to begin all was chaos and confusion i could remember many bad actions but few good ones i felt that i was like a vessel without a rudder and without a pilot and after hours and hours of deep thought i would give up the task of examination in stern despair saying to myself well if it must be so it must i felt an inclination to defy that heaven which i felt would never be opened to me this was the case for more than a week after i heard of my condemnation until i began to reflect upon the nature of our creed and the terms of salvation which were offered and as i thought over them i felt a dawn of hope and i requested the gaoler to furnish me with a bible i read it day and night for i expected every morning to be summoned to execution i felt almost agony at times lest such should be the case but time passed on and another fortnight elapsed during which i had profited by my reading and felt some contrition for my many offences and my life of guilt and i also felt that i could be saved through the merits of him who died for the whole world day after day my faith became more lively and my mind more at ease one morning the gaoler came to me and said that there was a priest who wished to see me as i understood he was a roman i was about to refuse but on consideration i thought otherwise and he was admitted he was a tall spare man with a dark spanish countenance you are i believe said he captain elrington who effected the escape of some of our poor friends and who are now condemned for your kind act i am sir replied i i am aware said he that your profession of faith is not mine and do not therefore come to talk with you on serious points without you should wish it yourself my object is being indebted as we are to you for saving our friends to offer to be of any use that i can to you in executing any wishes or delivering any messages which you may wish to give should you suffer for your generous conduct and you may trust any thing to me with safety that i swear to you and he took a crucifix from the folds of his garment and kissed it as he said so i thank you for your kind offer sir replied i but i have nothing to trouble you with i have long quitted my family who know not whether i am alive or dead for reasons that i need not explain i am under an assumed name and it is my intention to suffer under that name that my family may not be disgraced by my ignominious death or be aware that i have perished on the scaffold perhaps you are right replied the priest but let us talk upon another point have you no friends that could exert themselves in your favour so as to procure your pardon and release none replied i except those who i am sure are exerting themselves to the utmost of their power and to whom no message from me is necessary do you know nobody at court said the priest no person of rank in the governmentor i may say opposed to the governmentfor people nowadays are not what they seem or pretend to be i have no knowledge of any titled person replied i when i parted with one of the gentlemen whom i landed at bordeaux he gave me the name of a lady of quality at paris desiring me if in difficulty to apply to him through her but that was if in difficulty in france of course she could do nothing for me in this country have you the name of the lady yes replied i it is on the first leaf of my pocketbook here it is the priest read the name and then said you must write immediately a few words acquainting her with your position i will see the letter safely delivered before the week is over what good can she possibly do me replied i i cannot say but this i know that if any thing is to be done it will be write immediately the priest called the gaoler and requested writing materials which were brought and in a few minutes i had done as he requested there sir i have written to please you but i candidly state that i consider it a useless attempt were i of your opinion i should not have advised you to write replied he there are wheels within wheels that you have no conception of in these troubled times what i most fear is that it may arrive too late the priest took his leave of me and i was left to my own thoughts when i considered that the address of this lady had been given to me by the very man whom they were so anxious to secure as a traitor i at once decided that no benefit could arrive from any interference on her part and i therefore after a quarter of an hour dismissed the whole subject from my thoughts and commenced my reading of the sacred writings the following morning when the gaoler came in i could not help observing to him that as i had been condemned so many days i felt much surprise at the delay of my execution his reply was that he heard that others were in custody upon the same charge and that they waited for their convictions that we might all suffer at the same time for the order for my execution had come on the friday last but had been countermanded on the afternoon of the same day although this satisfied me that i had no hopes of escape yet i was pleased that i had obtained more time for preparation and i renewed my reading with ardour another week passed when the gaoler with a solemn face and much apparent concern came in and informed me that the other parties arrested had been tried before the commission and had been condemned and that it was expected that the execution would take place either on the morrow or the day after the announcement did not affect me much i had made up my mind that i should suffer and had to a degree weaned myself from life i considered how all hopes of my ever enjoying the delight of family and kindred ties had flown away and i looked with disgust upon my career as a privateersmana career of recklessness and blood so denounced by the sacred writings which i had before me i reflected that if i were to leave the prison i should have no other means of sustenance and should probably return to my former life and load my soul with a still heavier weight of crime and although i felt an occasional bitter pang at the idea of leaving the world so younga world which i could not hatestill i was after a few hours communing and reflection resigned to my fate and exclaimed with sincerity thy will be done i think madam you may have observed that sinful as i was my whole career proved that i was not a hardened sinner good was not driven entirely out of me but was latent notwithstanding all my excesses and the bad company which had influenced me i now prayed and prayed earnestly and i thought that my prayers were heard such was my state of mind on the day before the one appointed for my execution when the gaoler and one of the sheriffs officers came into my cell accompanied by the roman catholic priest whom i have before mentioned i perceived by the countenance of the gaoler who was a humane man that he had no unpleasant news the sheriffs officer delivered to him an order for my liberation and to my astonishment i was told by the gaoler that my pardon was signed and that i was free i was stupified with the intelligence and i stood without making any reply the priest waved his hand to them as a hint to leave the room which they both did as they left my eyes followed them and then i cast them down upon the bible which lay before me on the table and slipping down from the bench upon my knees i covered up my face and prayed my prayers were confusedi hardly knew what i saidbut i knew that they were intended to be grateful to heaven for my unexpected preservation from an ignominious death after a time i rose up and perceived the priest whose presence i had till then forgotten he had been kneeling at the other side of the table praying with me and i am sure for meand he was rising up just after i had i trust captain elrington said he after a pause that the peril you have been in will influence your future life and that this severe trial will not be thrown away upon you i trust not sir replied i i feel that it has been good for me to have been afflicted i believe that i have been indebted to your exertions for my deliverance no further than having seen your letter duly and speedily delivered i could do no more for with all will i have no power and that was little to do for one who so generously assisted our friends in their distress am i then to believe that i am indebted to the interest of a french lady residing at the court of versailles for my deliverance even sothis may appear strange to you captain elrington but such is the case understand that in these troubled times the ruling monarch of this country cannot distinguish his friends from his enemies he can only trust to professions and they are not always sincere there are many in the council at this time who if the pretender as he is called had succeeded would long before this have joined him and who had wished him success although they dared not venture to assist him the interest of the lady in question with these people has prevailed over the true adherents of the hanoverian king and thus through this lady have you obtained your release i state this to you in confidence to publish what i have told you would be to betray your friends can i be of any further service to you for you can leave your prison as soon as you please none i thank you good sir replied i i have money more than sufficient to reward my gaoler and to defray my expenses to liverpool you have my best thanks and sincere wishes for your happiness then i will not intrude upon you any more except to give you my address in case of need you have made warm friends by your conduct and if you ever require their assistance it will not be withheld the priest gave his address upon a piece of paper and then came to me our creeds are not exactly the same but you will not my son refuse my blessing said he putting his hand upon my head oh no said i dropping on my knees i receive it all in thankfulness may god bless you my son said he with emotionand he then quitted the cell what with the previous excitement when my liberation was announced and the parting with the kind priest my feelings were so powerful that as soon as i was alone i gave vent to them in a flood of tears as soon as i was more composed i rose from the bench put my necessaries into my valise and summoned the gaoler to whom i made a handsome present thanking him for his kindness during my incarceration i then shook hands with him feed the turnkey who had attended upon me and in a minute more i was clear of the tower gates how my heart heaved when i was once more in the open air i looked around me and perceived that many men were busy in erecting a scaffolding my heart sank as i beheld them as i felt certain what it was for but to verify my opinion i turned to an old woman who had a sort of stall from which she dispensed mead to the populace and inquired of her for what the scaffold was being erected its for the men who are to be executed tomorrow for aiding the jacobites to escape said she wont your worship take a glass of mead this morning i am not thirsty i replied as i walked hastily away with my valise upon my shoulders a stranger to this part of london i hardly knew where to direct my steps i walked past the square before the tower until i came into a street called catherinestreet where a tavern met my view and into it i entered immediately glad as it were to hide myself for i felt as if all the world looked upon me as a person just discharged from prison i obtained good entertainment there and slept there that night the next morning the host having provided me two good horses and a youngster to take them back i set off for liverpool and after five days travel without adventure i arrived at the town and proceeded direct to the house of mr trevannion my owner i took my valise off the boys horse and having paid him for his attendance i knocked at the door for it was late in the evening and dark when i arrived the door for it was at his private house door which was next to the countinghouse door that i knocked was opened and the woman who opened it shrieked and let drop the candle exclaiming help oh goda ghost a ghost for it appeared that the news had arrived at liverpool from a messenger who had been sent express after i had been condemned stating that there was no hope and that i was to suffer on the monday previous and this was the saturday evening on which i had arrived mr trevannions clerk hearing a noise in the passage came out with another candle and seeing me and the woman lying on the floor in a swoon stared staggered to the door of the room where his master was sitting and the door being ajar he fell back with great force into the room dropping under the table between mr trevannion and captain levee who was sitting with him smoking as was very often their wont this brought out captain levee with one of the tablecandlesticks who upon seeing me ran to me and embracing me warmly cried out as the clerk made his escape here is elrington alive and well sir at this announcement mr trevannion came out and threw himself into my arms saying i thank god for all his mercies but above all that i have not been the cause of your death my dear elrington come in he exclaimed in a faultering voice and as soon as he gained his seat he laid his head down and sobbed with excitement and joy i followed captain levee into the room and was taking a chair when i perceived there was another person present besides captain levee and mr trevannion which was the daughter of the latter that is i presumed as much for i knew that he was a widower and had one daughter living out of a family of three children she appeared to be about seventeen years of age and had just come from a protestant convent as they called establishments where young women were educated at chester mr trevannion was still with his face covered and not yet recovered from his burst of feeling when this young gentlewoman came up to me and said captain elrington you have behaved nobly to my father accept my hand and my friendship i was so dazzled from coming out of the dark and so excited from what had just passed that i was almost bewildered but i accepted the offered hand and bowed over it although i declare that at the time i could not distinguish her features although i perceived that her person was slight and elegant as she retreated to her seat mr trevannion who had recovered from his emotion said i thought that at this moment your head was exhibited over the gates of templebar the idea as captain levee will tell you has haunted me for i felt and should always have felt that i was the cause of your death god bless you my dear sir and may i have an opportunity of showing you my gratitude and regard for your noble conduct towards me and the sacrifice which you would have made you need not tell me for i know too well that you took all the onus and blame of the affair upon your own shoulders and preferred death to impeaching me my dear elrington said captain levee i told our crew and you have proved me a true prophet that you never would peach but die game we were talking of you supposing you dead when you came in i must tell you that more than once mr trevannion had made up his mind to deliver himself up and acknowledge the truth but i prevented him as it would have been a useless sacrifice you did but nevertheless it was so heavy on my conscience that had it not been for your perseverance and the thoughts of leaving my poor girl here an orphan in the world i certainly should have so done for i felt life to be a burden i am very glad that you did not sir i replied my life is of little value i have no one to support no one to love and no one to lament me if i fall a shot from the enemy may soon send me out of the world and there will only be a man the less in it as far as people are interested about me that is not the case now at all events replied mr trevannion but pray tell us how it is that you have escaped i have not escaped i replied here is my pardon with the signmanual and how was it obtained exclaimed captain levee all intercession made through some of the strongest friends of the government was in vain that i can assert for you must not suppose that we have been idle down here we did not leave london till after you were condemned and every entreaty to see you or to communicate by letter was denied to us i had better then begin at the beginning and state all that occurred i will first thank you my dear levee for your kind assistance which i would not avail myself of as i calculated wrongly i own that it would be wiser to remain a prisoner and i considered that my very refusal to escape would be admitted by the government as a proof of my innocence i did not know that i had to deal with such malignant people i then commenced my narrative which occupied the remainder of the evening and having received their congratulations we had a pipe or two and as i was fatigued we retired to bed i slept little on this i may say first night of rest and quiet after my liberation i was happy and yet perplexed during the time of my imprisonment it had occurred to me that the life of a privateersman was not one which i could follow up with a good conscience and i had on my journey down to liverpool made up my mind that i would give it up i knew this might annoy mr trevannion and that i should have to meet with the ridicule of captain levee and i was thinking whether it were possible in the first place that i could give some wellgrounded excuse and in the next what other means of gaining my livelihood i could substitute in its stead my restlessness induced me to get up earlier than usual and i went out for an hours walk upon the wharfs i saw my little schooner riding on the stream and as she gently rose and dipped to the swell which ran in with the tide she looked so beautiful that my resolutions were already giving way i would look at her no longer so i turned from the river and walked back to the owners house it was still early when i went into the eatinghall where i found miss trevannion alone chapter xii i state my newlyawakened scruples as to the lawfulness of a privateersmans life to mr trevannion but nevertheless undertake another cruisesave a youth from drowning who he proves to beconflict with a french privateertake her and deliver a prizereturn to liverpoolresign the command of the sparrowhawk and agree to superintend mr trevannions business miss trevannion my dear madam was taller than your sex usually are her figure slight and still unformed to a certain degree but promising perfection her hair was very dark her features regular and handsome her complexion very pale and her skin fair as the snow as she stood in silence she reminded you of a classical antique statue and hardly appeared to breathe through her delicate lips but when she was animated with conversation it almost reminded you of the promethean fire which poets state was stolen from heaven to animate a piece of marble then the colour came in her cheeks intelligence played on her countenance and every thing which at first sight appeared wanting was like magic found to light up her face her smiles were the sweetest i ever beheld and one of those smiles she bestowed upon me as i entered the room and paid her my obeisance the night before i had not observed her much i was too busy with her father and captain levee and she sat remote from the table and distant from the light and she never spoke but when she took my hand and thanked me as i mentioned before i thought then that her voice was like a silver bell but made no other remark upon her we had however exchanged but few words before her father came in accompanied by captain levee and we sat down to our mornings repast of chocolate after we had broken our fast captain levee hastened away on board of his vessel my imprisonment had detained him from sailing and mr trevannion was anxious that he should be off as soon as possible to make up for lost time as the expenses of the vessel were heavy farewell elrington for the present said he i shall come to you on board of your schooner some time during the day when captain levee was gonefor to tell the truth i was afraid of his ridiculei thought it a good opportunity to give my thoughts to my owner and as i had nothing to say which his daughter might not hear i began as follows mr trevannion i think it right to state to you that during my imprisonment a great change has come over my feelings upon certain points i am not ashamed to acknowledge that it has been occasioned by the death which stared me in the face and from my having seriously communed with myself and examined more than i perhaps have done during the whole of my former life the sacred writings which are given us as our guide the point to which i refer is that i have come to a conviction that privateering is not a lawful or honourable profession and with these feelings i should wish to resign the command of the schooner which you have had the kindness to give me indeed elrington replied mr trevannion well i should not have thought to have heard this from you i confess much as i respect your scruples you are too scrupulous i can hardly imagine that you have turned to the sect of the quakers and think fighting is contrary to the scriptures no sir not so far as that i consider war as a profession both necessary and honourable and a nation is bound to be prepared for any foreign attack and to act upon the defensive or on the offensive if it is necessary it is not that i do not consider the soldier who fights for his country is not doing his duty nor the seamen who are employed by the state are not equally justified in their profession what i refer to is privateering that is vessels fitted out for the purpose of aggression by private merchants and merely for the sake of profit they are not fitted out with any patriotic motives but merely for gain they are speculations in which the lives of people on both sides are sacrificed for the sake of lucreand had you witnessed such scenes of bloodshed and cruelty as i have during my career such dreadful passions let loose and defying all restraint you would agree with me that he who leads such miscreants to their quarry has much to answer for were it possible to control the men on board of a privateer as the men are controlled in the kings service it might be more excusable but manned as privateers always will be with the most reckless characters when once they are roused by opposition stimulated by the sight of plunder or drunken with victory no power on earth can restrain their barbarity and vengeance and a captain of a privateer who attempted would in most cases if he stood between them and their will unless he were supported fall a victim to his rashness all this i have seen and all i now express i have long felt even when younger and more thoughtless you know that i did give up privateering at one time because i was shocked at the excesses to which i was a party since that i have accepted the command of a vessel for the idea of being captain was too flattering to my vanity to permit me to refuse but reflection has again decided me not to engage in it further i hope this communication will not displease you mr trevannion if i am wrong in my opinion at all events i am sincere for i am giving up my only source of livelihood from a sense of duty i know that you are sincere elrington replied mr trevannion but at the same time i think that you are much too straitlaced in your opinions when nations are at war they mutually do all the mischief that they can to each other and i cannot see what difference there is between my fitting out a privateer under the kings authority or the king having vessels and men for the national service the government fit out all the vessels that they can and when their own funds are exhausted they encourage individuals to employ their capital in adding to the means of distressing the enemy if i had property on the high seas would it be respected any more than other english property by the enemy certainly not and therefore i am not bound to respect theirs the end of war is to obtain an honourable peace and the more the enemy is distressed the sooner are you likely to obtain one i do not therefore consider that privateering is worse than any other species of warfare or that the privateersman is a whit more reckless or brutal than soldiers or menofwars men in the hour of victory in the kings service there is this difference sir replied i first in the officers commanding although glad to obtain prizemoney they are stimulated by nobler feelings as well they look to honour and distinction they have the feeling that they are defending their king and country to support them and throw a halo on their exertions and they have such control over their men that although i admit they are equally inclined to excess as the privateersman they are held in check by the authority which they dare not resist now mr trevannion privateersmen seek not honour and are not stimulated by a desire to serve the country all they look to is how to obtain the property of others under sanction and could they without any risk do so they would care little whether it was english property or not provided that they put the money into their pockets if i held this opinion as a seaman on board of a privateer what must i feel now when i am the leader of such people and the responsibility of their acts is thrown upon my shoulders for such i feel is the case i think replied mr trevannion that we had better not discuss this question any further just now of course you must decide for yourself but i have this favour to ask of you trusting to your resuming the command of the vessel i have no one to replace you at present and i hope you will not refuse to take the command of her for one more cruise should you on your return and on mature reflection be of the same opinion as you are now i certainly shall no longer press you to remain and will do all i can to assist you in any other views you may have to that sir i can have no objection replied i it would be unfair of me to leave you without a captain to the vessel and i am therefore ready to sail in her as soon as you please upon the understanding that i may quit her if i am of the same opinion as i am now upon my return to port i thank you my dear sir said mr trevannion rising that is all i request i must now go to the countinghouse so saying he left the room but his countenance showed that he was far from pleased miss trevannion who had been a silent listener to the conversation as soon as her father had closed the door after him thus spoke captain elrington the opinion of a young maiden like me can be of little value but you know not how much pleasure you have given me by the sentiments you have expressed alas that a man so good so generous and so feeling in every other respect should be led away by the desire of gain to be the owner of such a description of property but in this town wealth is every thing the way by which it is obtained is not thought of my fathers father left him a large property in vessels employed wholly in the slavetrade and it was through the persuasions of my poor mother that my father was induced to give up that nefarious traffic since that his capital has been chiefly employed in privateering which if not so brutal and disgraceful is certainly nearly as demoralizing i have been home but a short time and i have already ventured to express my opinion certainly not so forcibly and so well as you have upon the subject but i was laughed at as a tenderhearted girl who could not be a fit judge of such matters but now that you a captain of one of his vessels have expressed your dislike to the profession i think some good may arise if my father were a poor man it would be more excusable if excuse there can be but such is not the case he is wealthy and to whom has he to leave his wealth but to me his only child captain elrington you are rightbe firmmy fathers obligations to you are very great and your opinion will have its influence i am his daughterhis only daughterhis love for me is great i know and i also have my power over him supported as i have been by you i will now exert it to the utmost to persuade him to retire from further employment of his means in such a speculation i thanked you yesterday when i first saw you for your noble behaviour i little thought that i should have again in so short a time to express my thanks miss trevannion did not wait for any reply from me but then quitted the room i must say that although so young a person i was much pleased at miss trevannions approval of my sentiments she appeared from the very short acquaintance i had had with her to be a person of a firm and decided disposition and very different from the insipid class of females generally met with her approval strengthened my resolution still as i had promised her father that i would go another cruise in the privateer i left the house and went on board to resume the command my return was joyfully hailed by the officers and men which is not always the case i found her as may be supposed ready for sea at a minutes warning so that i had nothing to do but to embark my effects which i did before the noon was passed and then went on shore to mr trevannion to receive his orders i found him with captain levee in the back room and i told mr trevannion that i had resumed the command and was ready to sail as soon as he pleased we must make up for lost time elrington replied he i have ordered captain levee to cruise to the northward of the western isles occasionally working up as far as the scilly isles now i think you had better take your ground in the channel between dunkirk and calais there is as much to be made by salvage in recapturing english vessels in that quarter as there is in taking the enemys vessels and i am sure added mr trevannion smiling you will think that legitimate warfare at this captain levee laughed and said i have been told what you said to mr trevannion elrington i said that it was the effects of being condemned for high treason and would wear off in a threemonths cruise good impressions do wear off very soon i fear replied i but i hope that it will not be the case in this instance we shall see my good fellow replied captain levee for my part i hope they will for otherwise we shall lose the best privateersman i ever fell in with however its no use bringing up the question now let us wait till our cruises are over and we meet again goodbye elrington and may you be fortunate my anchor is short stay apeak and i shall be under sail in half an hour captain levee sailed at the time that he mentioned i remained at anchor till the next morning and then once more was running down the irish channel before a stiff breeze i forgot to mention that while at mr trevannions i had looked at the address of the catholic priest who had announced to me my release from prison and had left copies of it as well as of that of the lady at paris in the care of mr trevannion it was now cold autumnal weather and the channel was but rough sailingground during the first fortnight we were fortunate enough to make two recaptures of considerable value which arrived safely in the thames after which we had a succession of gales front the southward it being the time of the equinox which drove us close to the sands of yarmouth and we even had difficulty in clearing them and getting into searoom by standing to the eastward the weather still continued very bad and we were lyingto under storm sails for several days and at last found ourselves a degree and a half to the northward off the coast of norfolk when the weather moderated and the wind changed to the northward it was a fine clear night but with no moon and we were running before the wind to regain our cruisingground but the wind again shifted and baffled us and at last it fell light and being on a wind we did not make more than four miles an hour although there was very little sea about one oclock in the morning i had gone on deck and was walking to and fro with the first officer mr james when i thought that i heard a faint hallo from to windward stop said i silence there forward i listened and thought that i heard the cry again mr james said i did you not hear some one shout no sir replied he wait then and listen we did so but i could not hear it repeated i am certain that i heard a voice as if on the waters said i perhaps some one has fallen overboard turn the hands up to muster and haul the foresheet to windward the men were mustered but no one was missing it was your fancy sir observed the first officer it may have been replied i but i am still in my own mind persuaded that such was the case perhaps i was mistaken shall we let draw the foresheet sir said mr james yes we may as well but the wind is lighter than it was i think we shall have a calm it will be as much as she can do to stem the tide and hold her own observed mr james let draw the foresheet my lads somehow or another i had a feeling which i could not surmount that i certainly had heard a faint shout and although admitting such to be the case there was little chance of being of service to any one i felt a reluctance to leave the spot and as i walked the deck silent and alone this feeling became insurmountable i remained on deck till the tide turned and then instead of taking advantage of it so as to gain to the southward i put the schooners head the other way so as to keep as near as i could to the spot where i heard the voice reducing her sail so as just to stem the tide i cannot now account for my anxiety which under the circumstances i most certainly never should have felt unless it was that providence was pleased to interpose on this occasion more directly than usual i could not leave the deck i waited for daylight with great impatience and as the day dawned i had my telescope in my hand looking round the compass at last as the sun rose from the fog on the horizon something attracted my eye and i made it out to be the two masts of a vessel which had sunk in about six fathoms water still i could see nothing except the masts however to make sure i made sail on the schooner and stood towards them a short tack enabled us to fetch and in half an hour we passed the wreck about a halfmusketshot to windward when we perceived an arm lifted up out of the water and waved to us there is somebody there said i and i was right quickly my lads foresheet to windward and lower down the sternboat this was done in a minute and in a short time the boat returned bringing with them a lad about sixteen years old whom they had found in the water clinging to the masts of the vessel he was too much exhausted to speak or move he was put into bed covered up with blankets and some warm spirits and water poured down his throat we then hoisted up the boat and made sail upon the schooner and i went down below to breakfast rejoicing that i had acted upon the impulse which i had felt and had thus been instrumental in saving the life of a fellowcreature a few minutes after he was put into bed the lad fell into a sound sleep which continued during the whole of the day the next morning he awoke greatly recovered and very hungry and as soon as he had eaten he rose and dressed himself i then sent for him as i was impatient to see him and learn his history when he entered the cabin it struck me i had seen his features before but where i could not say to my inquiries he stated that the brig was the jane and mary of hull laden with coals that they had started a wooden end during the gale and that she had filled so rapidly that they got the boat from off the boom to save their lives but from the heavy sea running and the confusion the boat had been bilged against the bulwarks and went down as they were shoving off that he had supported himself by one of the oars and was soon separated from his companions who floated around him that during this time the brig had sunk and he clinging to the oar had been drawn towards her as she sank and carried some feet under water on his rising he perceived the topgallant masts above water and had made for them and on looking round he could not see any of the rest of the crew who must have all perished that he had been two days on the mast and was perished with cold finding that his feet which hung down on the water were much warmer than the other portions of his body exposed to the wind he had sunk himself down in the water and remained there and had he not done so he must have perished i asked him how long he had been at sea and he said he had only gone one voyage and had been but three months on board there was something in his manner so superior to the condition of apprentice which he stated himself to be on board of such a vessel and i felt such an interest which i could not account for towards the lad that i then asked who were his friends he replied stammering that he had not a friend in the world except a brother older than himself by many years and he did not know where he was but your fathers name is he alive and who is he you must tell me that or i shall not know where to send you the youth was very confused and would not give me any answer come my lad i said i think as i have saved your life i deserve a little confidence and it shall not be misplaced i perceive that you have not been brought up as a lad for the sea and you must therefore trust me i will sir he replied if you will not send me back to my father andmother certainly not against your will my good lad i replied although i shall probably persuade you all i can to return to them i presume you ran away from your home yes sir i did replied he for i could not possibly stay there any longer and my brother did so before me for the same reason that i did well i promise you if you will confide in me that i will not force your inclinations so now tell me who are your father and mother and why you left home you want a friend now and without confidence you cannot expect friendship i will tell you all sir he replied for i see by your face that you will not take advantage of me he then commenced and you may imagine my surprise my dear madam when i found that it was my own brother philip whom i had left a child of ten years old who was addressing me he had as he had asserted left his home and thrown himself on the wide world for the same reason which i had for his spirit like mine could not brook the treatment which he received i allowed him to finish his narrative and then made myself known to him you may imagine the scene and the delight of the poor fellow who as he encircled me in his arms clinging to me with the tears of joy on his cheeks told me that his great object had been to find me out and that although he had no idea what had become of me he thought it most likely that i had taken to a seafaring life i now felt certain that providence had specially interposed in this business and had for its own good reasons created those unusual feelings of interest which i described to you that i might be the saviour of my brother and most grateful was i i can assure you i had now a companion and friend one to love and to cherish i was no longer alone in the world and i do not know when i had felt so happy for a long while i left my brother below in the cabin and went on deck to acquaint the officers with this strange meeting the intelligence soon ran through the vessel and of course the poor shipwrecked boy became an object of unusual interest that whole day i was interrogating and receiving intelligence from him relative to our family i made him describe his sisters and every member of it even the servants and our neighbours were not forgotten and for the first time since i had quitted home i knew what had occurred during the six years of my absence from the accounts he gave me i certainly had no inclination ever to return as long as certain parties were in existence and my brother declared that nothing but force should ever induce him the more i talked with him the more i was pleased with him he appeared of a frank noble disposition full of honour and high sentiments winning in his manners and mirthful to excess indeed his handsome countenance implied and expressed as much and it did not deceive i hardly need say that he took up his quarters in my cabin and having procured for him more suitable apparel he looked what he was the perfect young gentleman he was soon a general favourite on board not only with the officers but with the men one would have thought that the danger and distress we had found him in would have sickened him for the sea for ever but it was quite the contrary he delighted in his profession and was certainly born to be a sailor i asked him what he felt when he had remained so long clinging to the mast if he had not given up all hopes of being saved and he replied no that he had not that he did not know how long he might have had to remain there but that he had never abandoned the idea of being taken off by some vessel or another and that he thought that he might have continued there for twentyfour hours longer without being exhausted as after he had sunk himself into the water he felt warm and no exertion was necessary it is of such buoyant spirits as these madam that seamen should be made you cannot have an idea of the pleasure which i experienced at this falling in with my brother philip it appeared to have given a new stimulus to my existence even privateering did not appear so hateful to me after i had heard him express his delight at being likely to be so employed for such he stated had long been his ardent wish two days afterwards we had regained our cruisingground and perceived a french privateer steering for the port of calais in company with a large merchant vessel which she had captured the wind was light and we discovered her at daybreak just as the fog cleared away she being then about midchannel and not more than five miles distant we made all sail and soon were within gunshot the frenchman appeared determined not to part with his prize without a trial of strength but as the captured vessel was the nearest to us i decided to retake her first and then fight him if he wished i therefore steered to lay the prize by the board the frenchman a lugger of twelve guns perceiving our intention made also for the prize to defend her he steering up for her closehauled we running down to her free the prize lying between us and sheltering each of us from the others guns it is difficult to say whether the frenchman or we were the first to touch her sides with our respective vessels i rather think that the frenchman was a second or two before us at all events they were quicker than we were and were on the deck first besides having the advantage of the assistance of their men already on board so that we were taken at a great disadvantage however we did gain the deck by boarding at two points forward and aft and a fierce contest ensued the french were more numerous than we were but my men were better selected being all very powerful athletic fellows philip had boarded with the other party forward which was led by my chief officer my party who were abaft not being so numerous were beaten back to the taffrail of the vessel where we stood at bay defending ourselves against the furious assaults of the frenchmen but if we lost the other party gained for the whole body of the frenchmen were between us and them and those who faced philips party were driven back to abaft the mainmast it so happened that philip was thrown down on the deck and his men passed over him and while in that position and unable to rise from the pressure upon him he heard a calling out from below this told him that the english prisoners were in the hold and as soon as he could rise he threw off the hatches and they rushed up to the number of twentythree stout fellows to our support cheering most manfully and by their cheers announcing to the french that we had received assistance this gave fresh courage to my men who were hard pressed and faint with their great exertion we cheered and rushed upon the enemy who were already weakened by many of them having turned round to resist the increased impetus from forward our cheers were replied to by philips party and the prisoners and the french were losing the day they made another desperate rush upon philips men and succeeded in driving them back to before the mainhatches but what they gained forward they lost abaft as we pushed on with vigour this was their last attempt the mainhatch being open several of them in the confusion fell into it others followed them of their own accord and at last every one of them was beaten down from the deck and the hatches were put over them with three cheers now for the privateershe is our own cried philip follow me my men continued he as he sprang upon the bulwarks of the prize and from thence into the main rigging of the lugger alongside most of my men followed him and as there were but few men left on board of the lugger she was soon in our possession and thus we had both the enemy and the prize without firing a cannonshot it was strange that this combat between two privateers should thus be decided upon the deck of another vessel but such was the fact we had several men badly wounded but not one killed the french were not quite so fortunate as seven of their men lay dead upon the decks the prize proved to be the antelope westindiaman laden with sugar and rum and of considerable value we gave her up to the captain and crew who had afforded us such timely assistance and they were not a little pleased at being thus rescued from a french prison the privateer was named the jean bart of twelve guns and one hundred and fifteen men some away in prizes she was a new vessel and this her first cruise as it required many men to man her and we had the prisoners to incumber us i resolved that i would take her to liverpool at once and six days afterwards we arrived there without further adventure philips gallant conduct had won him great favour with my officers and men and i must say that i felt very proud of him as soon as we had anchored both vessels i went on shore with philip to mr trevannions to give him an account of what had occurred during the short cruise and i hardly need say that he was satisfied with the results as we had made three recaptures of value besides a privateer i introduced philip to him acquainting him with his miraculous preservation and mr trevannion very kindly invited him for the present to remain in his house we then took our leave promising to be back by dinnertime and i went with philip to fit him out in a more creditable way and having made my purchases and given my orders it being then almost two oclock post meridiem we hastened to mr trevannions that we might be in time for dinner i was i must confess anxious to see miss trevannion for she had often occupied my thoughts during the cruise she met me with great friendliness and welcomed me back our dinner was very agreeable and philips sallies were much approved of he was indeed a mirthful witty lad full of jest and humour and with a good presence withal mr trevannion being called out just as dinner was finished miss trevannion observed i presume mr elrington that your good fortune and the reputation you have acquired in so short a time have put an end to all your misgivings as to a privateersmans life i am not quite so light and inconstant miss trevannion replied i i rejoice that in this cruise i have really nothing to lament or blush for and trust at the same time we have been serviceable to our country but my opinion is the same and i certainly wish that i had fought under the kings pennant instead of on board of a privateer you are then of the same mind and intend to resign the command i do miss trevannion although i admit that this lads welfare makes it more important than ever that i should have some means of livelihood i rejoice to hear you speak thus mr elrington and i think my fathers obligations to you are such that if he does not assist you i should feel ashamed of himbut such i am certain will not be the case he will forward your views whatever they may be to the utmost of his powerat the same time i admit from conversations i have had with him that he will be mortified at your resigning the command and so shall i said philip for i do not agree with you or my brother i see no more harm in privateering than in any other fighting i suppose miss trevannion you have been the cause of my brothers scruples and i tell you candidly to your face that i do not thank you for it miss trevannion coloured up at this remark and then replied i do not think mr philip that i have had the pleasure of seeing your brother more than three times in my life and that within these last six weeks and sure i am that we have not had a quarter of an hours conversation altogether it is therefore assuredly too much to say that i am the cause and your brother will tell you that he expressed these opinions before i ever had had any conversation with him that may be replied philip but you approved of his sentiments and that concluded the business i am sure and i dont wonder at it i only hope that you wont ask me to do any thing i do not wish to do for i am sure that i could never refuse you any thing i am glad to hear you say so mr philip for if i see you do that which i think wrong i shall certainly try my influence over you replied miss trevannion smiling i really was not aware that i had such power here mr trevannion came in again and the conversation was changed and shortly afterwards miss trevannion left the room philip who was tired of sitting while mr trevannion and i took our pipes and who was anxious to see the town also left us and i then stated to mr trevannion that having now completed the cruise which i had agreed that i would i wished to know whether he had provided himself with another captain as you appear so determined my dear elrington i will only say that i am very sorry and will not urge the matter any longer my daughter told me since your absence that she was certain that you would adhere to your resolution and although i hoped the contrary yet i have been considering in which way i can serve you it is not only my pleasure but my duty so to do i have not forgotten and never will forget that you in all probability saved my life by your selfdevotion in the affair of the jacobites when you first came to me you were recommended as a good accountant and to a certain degree a man of business and at all events you proved yourself well acquainted and apt at figures do you think that a situation on shore would suit you i should endeavour to give satisfaction sir i replied but i fear that i should have much to learn of course you would but i reply that you would soon learn now elrington what i have to say to you is this i am getting old and in a few years shall be past work and i think i should like you as an assistant for the present and a successor hereafter if you would like to join me you shall superintend the more active portion of the business and i have no doubt but that in a year or two you will be master of the whole as you know i have privateers and i have merchant vessels and i keep my storehouses i have done well up to the present not so well perhaps now as i did when i had slavevessels which were most profitable but my deceased wife persuaded me to give up that traffic and i have not resumed it in honour of her memory these foolish women should never interfere in such matters but let that pass what i have to say is that if you choose after a year to join me as a partner i will give you an eighth of the business and as we continue i will make over a further share in proportion to the profits and i will make such arrangements as to enable you at my death to take the whole concern upon favourable terms mr trevannion knocked the ashes out of his pipe and as he concluded i am i replied as you may imagine sir much gratified and honoured at your proposal which i hardly need say that i willingly accept i only hope you will make allowance for my ignorance at first setting off and not ascribe to any other cause my imperfections you may assure yourself that goodwill shall never be wanting on my part and i shall work day and night if required to prove my gratitude for so kind an offer then it is settled said mr trevannion but what are we to do with your brother philip he thinks for himself sir and does not agree with me on the question in point of course i have no right to insist that my scruples should be his indeed i fear that i should have little chance in persuading him as he is so fond of a life of adventure it is natural in one so young age will sober him then you have no objection to his going on board of a privateer i would rather that he was in any other service sir but as i cannot control him i must submit if he insist upon following that profession he is a gallant clever boy and as soon as i can i will try to procure him a situation in a kings ship at present he must go to sea in some way or the other and it were perhaps better that he should be in good hands such as captain levees for instance on board of a privateer than mix up with those who might demoralize him more well then he shall have his choice replied mr trevannion he is a smart lad and will do you credit wherever he may be if i may take the liberty to advise sir replied i i think you could not do better than to give the command of the sparrowhawk to the chief officer mr james he is a good seaman and a brave man and i have no doubt will acquit himself to your satisfaction i was thinking the same and as you recommend him he shall take your place now as all this is settled you may as well go on board and make known that you have resigned the command tell mr james that he is to take your place bring your clothes on shore and you will find apartments ready for you on your return for in future you will of course consider this house as your residence i assure you that now that you do not leave me i am almost glad that the affair is arranged as it is i wanted assistance that is the fact and i hold myself fortunate that you are the party who has been selected we shall meet in the evening mr trevannion then went away in the direction of his daughters room instead of the countinghouse as usual and i quitted the house i did not go immediately down to the wharf to embark i wanted to have a short time for reflection for i was much overpowered with mr trevannions kindness and the happy prospects before me i walked out in the country for some distance deep in my own reflections and i must say that miss trevannion was too often interfering with my train of thought i had of course no fixed ideas but i more than once was weighing in my mind whether i should not make known to them who i was and how superior in birth to what they imagined after an hour passed in building castles i retraced my steps passed through the town and going down to the wharf waved my handkerchief for a boat and was soon on board i then summoned the officers and men told them that i had resigned the command of the vessel and that in future they were to consider mr james as their captain i packed up my clothes leaving many articles for my successor which were no longer of any use to me but which he would have been compelled to replace philip i found was down in the cabin and with him i had a long conversation he stated his wish to remain at sea saying that he preferred a privateer to a merchant vessel and a kings ship to a privateer not being old enough or sufficient time at sea to be eligible for a kings ship i agreed that he should sail with captain levee as soon as he came back from his cruise he had already sent in a good prize as soon as my clothes and other articles were put into the boat i wished them all farewell and was cheered by the men as i pulled on shore my effects were taken up to mr trevannions house by the seamen to whom i gave a gratuity and i was met by mr trevannion who showed me into a large and wellfurnished bedroom which he told me was in future to be considered as my own i passed away the afternoon in arranging my clothes and did not go down to the parlour till suppertime where i found miss trevannion who congratulated me upon my having changed my occupation to one more worthy of me i made a suitable reply and we sat down to supper having described this first great event in my life i shall for the present conclude chapter xiii after staying a year with him mr trevannion proposes to take me into partnership but i decline the offer from conscientious motivesmiss trevannion treats me with unmerited coldnessthis and her fathers anger make me resolve to quit the housewhat i overhear and see before my departurethe ring you may now behold me in a very different position my dear madam instead of the laced hat and hanger at my side imagine me in a plain suit of gray with black buttons and a pen behind my ear instead of walking the deck and balancing to the motion of the vessel i am now perched immoveably upon a high stool instead of sweeping the horizon with my telescope or watching the straining and bending of the spars aloft i am now with my eyes incessantly fixed upon the ledger or daybook absorbed in calculation you may inquire how i liked the change at first i must confess not over much and notwithstanding my dislike to the life of a privateersman i often sighed heavily and wished that i were an officer in the kings service the change from a life of activity to one of sedentary habits was too sudden and i often found myself with my eyes still fixed upon the figures before me absorbed in a sort of castlebuilding reverie in which i was boarding or chasing the enemy handling my cutlass and sometimes so moved by my imagination as to brandish my arm over my head when an exclamation of surprise from one of the clerks would remind me of my folly and angry with myself i would once more resume my pen but after a time i had more command over myself and could sit steadily at my work mr trevannion had often observed how absent i was and it was a source of amusement to him when we met at dinner his daughter would say so i hear you had another seafight this morning mr elrington and her father would laugh heartily as he gave a description of my ridiculous conduct i very soon with the kind assistance of mr trevannion became master of my work and gave him satisfaction my chief employment consisted in writing the letters to correspondents at first i only copied mr trevannions letters in his private letterbook but as i became aware of the nature of the correspondence and what was necessary to be detailed i then made a rough copy of the letters and submitted them to mr trevannion for his approval at first there were a few alterations made afterwards i wrote them fairly out and almost invariably they gave satisfaction or if any thing was added it was in a postscript mr trevannions affairs i found were much more extensive than i had imagined he had the two privateers two vessels on the coast of africa trading for ivory and golddust and other articles two or three vessels employed in trading to virginia for tobacco and other produce and some smaller vessels engaged in the newfoundland fisheries which when they had taken in their cargo ran to the mediterranean to dispose of it and returned with mediterranean produce to liverpool that he was a very wealthy man independent of his large stakes upon the seas was certain he had lent much money to the guild of liverpool and had some tenanted properties in the county but of them i knew nothing except from the payment of the rents what surprised me much was that a man of mr trevannions wealth having but one child to provide for should not retire from businessand i once made the remark to his daughter her reply was i thought as you do once but now i think differently when i have been on a visit with my father and he has stayed away for several weeks you have no idea how restless and uneasy he has become from want of occupation it has become his habit and habit is second nature it is not from a wish to accumulate that he continues at the countinghouse but because he cannot be happy without employment i therefore do not any longer persuade him to leave off as i am convinced that it would be persuading him to be unhappy until you came i think the fatigue was too great for him but you have as he apprizes me relieved him of the heaviest portion of the labour and i hardly need say that i am rejoiced that you have so done it certainly is not that he requires to make money miss trevannion and as he is so liberal in every thing i must credit what you assert that it is the dislike to having no employment which induces him to continue in business it has not yet become such a habit in me continued i smiling i think i could leave it off with great pleasure but is not that because you have not yet recovered from your former habits which were so at variance with a quiet and a sedentary life replied she i fear it is so said i and i believe of all habits those of a vagrant are the most difficult to overcome you used to laugh at me the first few months that i was here i presume that i am a little improved as i have not been attacked lately my father says so and is much pleased with you mr elrington if my telling you so gives you any satisfaction certainly it does because i wish to please him and me too i hope yes most truly miss trevannion i only wish i had it in my power to show how much i study your good opinion will you risk my fathers displeasure for it replied she looking at me fixedly yes i will provided oh there is a proviso already i grant that there should not have been any as i am sure that you would not ask me to do any thing which is wrong and my proviso was that i did not undertake what my conscience did not approve your proviso was good mr elrington for when a woman would persuade a man should be particularly guarded that he is not led into error by a rash promise i think however that we are both agreed upon the point i will therefore come at once to what i wish you to do it is the intention of my father in the course of a few days when you shall have accomplished your year of service to offer to take you into partnership and i am certain it will be on liberal terms now i wish you to refuse his offer unless he gives up privateering i will do so at all risks and i am truly glad that i have your encouragement for taking such a bold step i tell you frankly that he will be very indignant there is an excitement about the privateering which has become almost necessary to him and he cares little about the remainder of his speculations he is so blind to the immorality to which it leads that he does not think it is an unlawful pursuit if he did i am sure that he would abandon it all my persuasion has been useless and if a favourite and only daughter cannot prevail what chance have i miss trevannion a better chance mr elrington he is partial to me but i am a woman and he looks upon my observations as a womans weakness the objections raised by a man a young man and one who has so long been actively engaged in the service will therefore carry more weight besides he has now become so accustomed to you and has had so much trouble taken off his hands and at the same time has such implicit confidence in you that i do not think if he finds that he has to choose between your leaving him and his leaving off privateering he will hesitate in relinquishing the latter you have moreover great weight with him mr elrington my father is fully aware of the deep obligation he is under to your courage and selfdevotion in the affair of the jacobite refugees you will therefore succeed if you are firm and if you do succeed you will have my gratitude if that is of any importance to you my friendship you know you have already the entrance of mr trevannion prevented my reply we had been waiting for his return from a walk and dinner had been ready some time i have just seen some of the men of the arrow said mr trevannion taking off his hat and spencer and that detained me has captain levee arrived then sir said i no but he has sent in a prizeof no great valueladen with light wares the men in charge tell me he has had a rough affair with a vessel armed en flute and that he has lost some men your brother philip as usual is wounded i should here observe that during the year which had passed away the two privateers had been several times in portthey had met with moderate success barely sufficient to pay their expenses my brother philip had always conducted himself very gallantly and had been twice wounded in different engagements well sir replied i i do not think that the loss of a little blood will do any harm to such a hotheaded youth as master philip but i hope in a short time to give him an opportunity of shedding it in the service of the king instead of in the pursuit of money indeed continued i as i sat down to table the enemy are now so cautious or have so few vessels on the high seas that i fear your privateering account current will not be very favourable when balanced as it will be in a few days notwithstanding this cargo of wares just arrived then we must hope better for next year replied mr trevannion amy my dear have you been out today yes sir i was riding for two hours have they altered your pillion yet yes sir it came home last night and it is now very comfortable i called at mrs carletons who is much better what a fop that mr carleton isi dont know what scented powder he uses but it perfumed the whole room had not mrs carleton been such an invalid i should have opened the window mr trevannion then turned the conversation to some political intelligence which he had just received and this engaged us till the dinner was over and i returned to the countinghouse where i found the men who had brought in the prize and who gave me a letter from philip stating that his wound was of no consequence the communication of mr trevannion took place as his daughter had assured me it would on the anniversary of my entering into mr trevannions countinghouse after dinner as we as usual were smoking our pipes mr trevannion said elrington you have been with me now one year and during that time you have made yourself fully master of your business much to my surprise i acknowledge but still more to my satisfaction that i have every reason to be satisfied with you you may imagine when i tell you that it is now my intention to take you into partnership and i trust by my so doing that you will soon be an independent man you know the capital in the business as well as i do i did say an eighth but i now propose to make over to you onefourth and to allow your profits of every year deducting your necessary expenses to be invested in the business until you have acquired a right to onehalf of future arrangements we will speak hereafter mr trevannion replied i that i am truly grateful for such unexpected liberality i hardly need say and you have my best thanks for your noble offer but i have scruples which i must confess i cannot get over scruples exclaimed mr trevannion laying down his pipe on the table oh i see now continued he after a pause you think i am robbing my daughter no no the labourer is worthy of his hire and she will have more than sufficient you carry your conscientiousness too far my dear fellow i have more than enough for amy out of the business altogether i am aware of that sir added i and i did not therefore refer to your daughter when i said that i had scruples i must be candid with you sir how is it that i am now in your employ why because you had a dislike to privateering and i had a debt of gratitude to pay exactly sir but whether you had been pleased to employ me or not i had made up my mind as you well know from conscientious motives not to continue on board of a privateer well i grant that the same motives sir will not allow me to be a sharer in the profits arising from such sources i should consider myself equally wrong if i did so as if i remained on board do not be angry with me sir continued i if i with many thanks decline your offer of being your partner i will faithfully serve you upon any salary which you may consider i may merit and trust to your liberality in every thing mr trevannion made no reply he had resumed his pipe and continued to smoke it with his eyes fixed upon the mantelpiece as soon as his pipe was out he rose put on his hat and walked out of the room without making any further observation i waited a few minutes and then went back to the countinghouse that mr trevannion was seriously offended i was convinced but i valued the good opinion of his daughter more than i did that of mr trevannion indeed my feelings towards her had during the year that i had been in the house gradually become of that nature that they threatened much my peace of mind i cannot say that i loved her in the usual acceptation of the term adoration would better express what i felt she was so pure so perfect such a model of female perfection that i looked up to her with a reverence which almost quelled any feeling of love i felt that she was above me and that with her wealth it would be madness for one in my present position to aspire to her yet with this feeling i would have sacrificed all my hopes and present advantages to have obtained her approving smile it is not therefore to be wondered at that i risked mr trevannions displeasure to gain her approbation and when i resumed my seat at my desk and thought of what had passed i made up my mind to be once more an outcast in the world rather than swerve from the promise which i had made to her i knew mr trevannion to be a very decided man and hasty when offended that he was seriously offended with me there was no doubt i found that he had quitted the house immediately after he had left the room i had hoped that he had gone to his daughters apartments and that a conversation with her might have produced a good effect but such was not the case in about half an hour mr trevannion returned and as he walked into the back room adjoining the countinghouse he desired me to follow him i did so mr elrington said he sitting down and leaving me standing at the table i fear after what has passed that we shall not continue on good terms you have reproached me an old man with carrying on an unlawful business in short in raising your own scruples and talking of your own conscience you have implied that i am acting contrary to what conscience should dictate in short you have told me by implication that i am not an honest man you have thrown back in my face my liberal offer my wish to oblige you has been treated not only with indifference but i may add with contumely and that merely because you have formed some absurd notions of right and wrong in which you will find no one to agree with you except perhaps priests and women i wish you well mr elrington nevertheless i am truly sorry for your infatuation and wished to have served you but you will not be assisted by me here mr trevannion paused but i made no reply after a time wiping the perspiration from his forehead with his handkerchief for he evidently was in a state of great excitement he continued as you do not choose to join me from conscientious scruples i cannot but imagine that you do not like to serve me from similar motives for i see little difference between the two and here madam there was some force in his observation but it never occurred to me before at all events without weighing your scruples so exactly as to know how far they may or may not extend i feel that we are not likely to go on pleasantly together i shall always think that i am reproached by you when any thing is said connected with the privateersand you may have twinges of conscience which may be disagreeable to you let us therefore part quietly for your services up to the present and to assist you in any other engagements you may enter on take this mr trevannion opened a lower drawer of the table and put before me a bag containing as i afterwards discovered gold jacobuses i wish you well mr elrington but i sincerely wish that we had never met mr trevannion then rose abruptly and before i could make any reply brushed past me went out at the door and again walked away at a rapid pace down the street i remained where i stood my eyes had followed him as he went away i was completely surprised i anticipated much anger much altercation but i never had an idea that he would be so unjust as to throw off in this way one who for his sake had gone through a heavy trial and come out with honour my heart was full of bitterness i felt that mr trevannion had treated me with harshness and ingratitude alas thought i such is the world and such will ever be the case with such imperfect beings as we are how vain to expect any thing like consistency much less perfection in our erring natures hurt but the selflove of a man wound his vanity and all obligations are forgotten i turned away from the bag of money which i was resolved not to accept although i had not at the time twenty guineas at my own disposal it was now within half an hour of dark i collected all my books put some in the iron safe others as usual in my desk and having arranged every thing as completely as i could i locked the safe and inclosed the keys in a parcel which i sealed putting mr trevannions name on the outside i laid the parcel on the table in the room where we had had our conference by the side of the bag of money it was now dark or nearly so and leaving the confidential porter as usual to shut up the house i went up to the sittingroom with the expectation of seeing miss trevannion and bidding her farewell i was not disappointed i found her at her netting having just lighted the lamp which hung over the table miss trevannion said i advancing respectfully towards her i have fulfilled my promise and i have received my rewardshe looked up at mewhich is i am dismissed from this house and your presence for ever i trust said she after a pause that you have not exceeded my wishes it appears to me so strange that i must think that such is the case my father never could have dismissed you in this way for merely expressing an opinion mr elrington you must have gone too far miss trevannion when you meet your father you can then ascertain whether i have been guilty of intemperance or rudeness or a proper want of respect in making the communicationwhich i did in exactly the manner you yourself proposed and my reward has been such as i state you have a better reward mr elrington if what you assert is really correct you have the reward of having done your duty but i cannot imagine that your dismissal has arisen from the mere expression of an opinion youll excuse me mr elrington that as a daughter i cannot in justice to a much respected father believe that such is the case this was said in so cold a manner that i was nettled to the highest degree miss trevannion had promised me her gratitude instead of which i felt that she was doubting my word and as it were taking the side of her father against me and this was the return from her i could have upbraided her and told her what i felt namely that she had taken advantage of my feelings towards her to make me a catspaw to obtain her end with her father and that now having failed i was left to my fate without even commiseration but she looked so calm so grave and so beautiful that i could not do it i commanded my wounded feelings and replied since i have the misfortune to meet the displeasure of the daughter as well as of the father miss trevannion i have not another word to say but farewell and may you prosper my voice faltered as i said the last words and bowing to her i quitted the room miss trevannion did not even say farewell to me but i thought that her lips appeared to move as quitting the room i took my last look upon her beautiful face i shut the door after me and overpowered by my feelings i sank upon a settee in the anteroom in a state of giddy stupor i know not how long i remained there for my head turned and my senses reeled but i was aroused from it by the heavy tread of mr trevannion who came along the corridor without a light and not perceiving me opened the door of the sittingroom where his daughter still remained he threw the door too after he had entered but it did not quite close leaving a narrow stream of light through the anteroom father said miss trevannion in my hearing you look warm and excited i have reason so to be replied mr trevannion abruptly i have heard from mr elrington the cause of it replied miss trevannion that is i have heard his version of it i am glad that you have come back as i am most anxious to hear yours what has mr elrington said or done to cause such irritation and his dismissal he has behaved with insolence and ingratitude replied mr trevannion i offered him partnership and he refused unless i would give up privateering so he stated but in what manner was he insolent to you insolenttold me that he acted from conscientious motives which was as much as to say that i did not was his language very offensive no not his languagethat was respectful enough but it was the very respect which made it insolent so i told him that as he could not from scruples of conscience join me in privateering of course his scruples of conscience could not allow him to keep the books and i dismissed him do you mean to say my dear father that he in a respectful manner declined entering into partnership from these scruples which you mention that he gave you no other offence than expressing his opinion and declining your offer and what would you have more replied mr trevannion i wish to know where was the insult the ingratitude on his part which you complain of simply in refusing the offer he ought to have felt grateful and he was not and he had no right to give such reasons as he did for the reasons were condemning my actions but you women cannot understand these things i rather think my dear father that we cannot for i cannot perceive either the insult or the ingratitude which you complain of and such i think will be your own opinion when you have had time to reflect and are more cool mr elrington expressed nothing more today when he stated his dislike to privateering from conscientious motives than he did after his return from his confinement in the tower when he gave up the command of the privateer on those very grounds and then when still warm with gratitude to him for his selfdevotion you did not consider it an insult but on the contrary took him still nearer to you into your own house why then should you consider it an insult now neither can i see any ingratitude you made him an offer the value of which in a worldly point of view he could not but appreciate and he declined it from conscientious motives declined it as you acknowledge respectfully proving that he was ready to sacrifice his worldly interests to what he considered his duty as a christian when mr elrington told me that you had dismissed him i felt so certain that he must have been guilty of some unpardonable conduct towards you to have induced you to have resorted to such a step that i did not credit him when he asserted the contrary i could not believe as a daughter any thing so much to the prejudice of my own father and so much at variance with his general conduct i now feel that i have been most unjust to mr elrington and conducted myself towards him in a way which i bitterly regret and hope by some means to be able to express my contrition for amyamy said mr trevannion severely are you blinded by regard for this young man that you side against your own father am i to understand that you have given your affections without my sanction or approval no sir replied miss trevannion that i do respect and regard mr elrington is true and i cannot do otherwise for his many good qualities and his devotion towards you but if you would ask me if i love him i reply that such a thought has not yet entered my head without a knowledge of who he is or his family and without your approval i should never think of yielding up my affections in so hasty a manner but i may say more these affections have never been solicited by mr elrington he has always behaved towards me with that respect which as the daughter of his patron i have had a right to expect but in no instance has he ever signified to me that he had any preference in my favour having assured you of this my dear father i cannot but say that i consider that he has in this instance not only been treated with injustice by you but also by me say no more replied mr trevannion as he said this i heard footsteps in the passage and was about to retreat to my own room but as the party came without a light i remained it was the porter who knocked at the sittingroom door and was requested to come in by mr trevannion if you please sir mr elrington is gone out i believe and i found this packet directed to you on the table of the inner room and also this bag of money which i suppose you forgot to put away before you left very well humphrey leave them on the table the man did so and quitted the room not perceiving me in the dark as he passed through the anteroom he has not taken the money observed mr trevannion he might have done so as he ought to be paid for his services i presume my dear father that his feelings were too much hurt by what passed said miss trevannion there are obligations which cannot be repaid with gold these i perceive are the keys of the safe i did not think that he would have gone away this night i now considered it high time to quit the anteroom where i had been irresistibly detained by the conversation which took place i hastened to my own chamber determined that i would leave the house the next morning before any one was stirring i gained it in the dark but having the means of striking a light i did so and packed up all my clothes ready for my departure i had just fastened down my valise when i perceived a light on the further end of the long corridor which led to my apartment thinking it might be mr trevannion and not wishing to see him i blew out my own light and retreated to a small dressingroom within my chamber communicating by a glass door the light evidently approached and at last i perceived the party was entering my room the door of which was wide open it was miss trevannion who entered and turning round with her chamberlight in her hand appeared to survey the apartment with a mournful air she perceived my valise and her eyes were fixed upon it for some time at last she walked up to the dressingtable and sitting on the stool before it leant down her head upon her hands and wept alas thought i if those tears were but for me but it is not soshe has been excited and her tears have come to her relief after a time she raised her head from the table and said how unjust have i beenand i shall see him no moreif i could but beg his pardon i should be more happy poor fellowwhat must he have felt at my harsh bearing oh my father i could not have believed it and what did i saythat i had no feeling forwell i thought so at the time but nowi am not quite sure that i was correct though hewell its better that hes gonebut i cannot bear that he should have gone as he has done how his opinion of me must have changed that is what vexes me and again she bent her head down on the table and wept in a moment she again rose and took her candle in her hand perceiving on the dressingtable a small gold ring which i had taken off my finger the day before and had forgotten she took it up and examined it after a little while she laid her light down on the table and put the ring upon her finger i will keep it till i see him again murmured she and then taking her light she walked slowly out of the room the knowledge i had gained by this unintentional eavesdropping on my part was the source of much reflectionand as i lay on the bed without taking off my clothes it occupied my thoughts till the day began to break that i still retained the good opinion of miss trevannion was certain and the mortification i had endured at our final interview was now wholly removed it was her duty to suppose her parent not in fault till the contrary was proved she had known her father for yearsme she had only known for a short time and never before had she known him guilty of injustice but her expressions and her behaviour in my roomwas it possible that she was partial to me more partial than she had asserted to her father when she was questionedand her taking away the ring chapter xiv a conspiracy which ends satisfactorily to all partiesprivateering is abandoned and captain levee and philip serve the king the night passed away in attempts at analyzing the real feelings of miss trevannion and also my own towards her and now that i was to be separated from her i discovered what i really had not before imagined that my future happiness was seriously endangered by my sentiments towards her in short dear madam that i was most seriously in love and now thought i of what avail is it to have made this discovery now except it were to convince me as miss trevannion had said that it were better that i were gone i did not fail to call to mind her observation about my unknown parentage and family and this i reflected upon with pleasure as it was the chief objection raised by her and at the same time one that i could proudly remove from my birth being really more distinguished than her own should i make it known how could iwe should probably never meet again all this and much more was canvassed in my mind during the night and also another question of more real importance which was what i was to do and where i was to go on this last point i could not make up my mind but i determined that i would not leave liverpool for a day or two but would take up my quarters at my old lodgings where i had lived with captain levee as the day dawned i rose from the bed and taking my valise on my shoulder i went softly downstairs opened the street door and shutting it again carefully i hastened down the street as fast as i could i met nobody for it was still early and arrived at the lodginghouse where i had some trouble to obtain admittance the old lady at last opening the door in great dishabille captain elrington is it possible exclaimed she why whats the matter nothing madam replied i but that i have come to take possession of your lodgings for a few days and welcome sir replied she will you walk upstairs while i make myself more fit to be seen i was in bed and fast asleep when you knocked i do believe i was dreaming of my good friend captain levee i went upstairs and threw myself on the old settee which was so familiar to me and somehow or another in a few minutes i was in a sound sleep how long i might have slept on i cannot tell but in less than an hour i was waked up by loud talking and laughter and a few seconds afterwards found myself embraced by my brother philip and captain levee the arrow had anchored at break of day and they had just come on shore i was delighted to see them as every one is when he meets with friends when he is in distress i briefly stated how it was that they found me there and when breakfast was on the table i entered into full details of what had passed with the exception of miss trevannion having entered my roomthat i considered too sacred to repeat to any one you know my dear elrington said captain levee that i have not the scruples which you have relative to privateering but still i respect the conscientious scruples of others there is no excuse for mr trevannions conduct and i cannot think but there is something else at the bottom of all this you havent been making love to his daughter or what would amount to the same thing she has not been making advances to you i have not dared the first levee and you do not know her to suppose her capable of the latter well if she had done so there would have been no harm done replied he but i will say no more as you look so grave philip and i will now call upon mr trevannion and while i engage the old gentleman philip shall run alongside of the young maiden and between the two we shall get our bearings and distance and know how the land liesand i will tell you more elrington although i have no objection to be captain of a privateer i certainly consider the command of a kings ship more reputable and if i could manage to get the arrow hired into the kings service i still remaining in command of her i should prefer it being so at all events ill side with you and that will drive the old gentleman on a dead leeshore come along philipwe shall be with you in two hours elrington with these words captain levee left the room followed by my brother it was nearly three hours before they returned and then i received the following narratives captain levee as he sat down said now philip well hear your account first well mine is soon told replied philip i had made up my mind how to act and did not tell captain levee what i intended to do when mr trevannion met us in the room behind the countinghouse he appeared very much flurried he shook hands with captain levee and offered me his hand which i refused saying mr trevannion i have just seen my brother and i hardly need say that nothing will induce me to remain in your employ i will therefore thank you for my wages at your convenience heyday young man cried he you give yourself strange airs well sir you shall have your discharge i can do without such snipjacks as you are snipjacks mr trevannion replied i if i must say it we are better born and better bred than you or any of your connections and you were honoured by our service you said that philipthen you were wrong i told the truth still you should not have said it we took his service and therefore we are not snipjacks interrupted philip and his calling names brought on the reply you must admit the provocation elrington said captain levee well go on philip indeed said mr trevannion in a great passion well then i will soon rid myself of the obligation call this afternoon master philip and you shall receive your wages you may now quit the room i did so and put my hat acock to annoy him so far his narrative is quite correct said captain leveenow go on well said philip instead of turning out of the house i turned into it and went to the young ladys sittingroom i opened the door softly and found her with her hand up to her head looking very sedate and sorrowful master philip said she you startled me i am glad to see youwhen did you arrive this morning miss trevannion well sit down and bear me company for a time have you seen your brother i have miss trevannion replied i still remaining on my feet and i have just seen your father i come now to bid you farewell i have left the privateer and shall never join her again perhaps i may never see you again either which believe me i am truly sorry for she covered her eyes with her hand as she leant on the table and i saw a tear fall as she said it is a sad business altogether and has distressed me very much i hope your brother does not think that i blame him tell him that i do not in the least and that he must forget my behaviour to him when we parted i did him injustice and i beg his pardon tell him so philip did she say those words philip yes word for word and looked like an angel when she said so i replied that i would certainly deliver her message but that i must not remain for fear of mr trevannion finding me with her as he ordered me to quit the house indeed said she what can be the matter with my poor father why miss trevannion said i he was very angry and he had reason for i was very saucy and thats the truth why philip what did you say to him oh i hardly know replied i but i know that i said more than i ought for i was very angry at my brothers dismissal goodbye miss trevannion miss trevannion was taking a ring off her finger as i said goodbye and i thought she was going to give it me as a keepsake but after a little hesitation she put it on again and then held out her hand saying goodbye master philip let us not part in anger at all events i took her hand bowed and turned away to quit the room when i was at the door i looked round and she was sitting with her face in her hands and i think she was weeping i went out into the street and waited for captain levee and theres an end of my story well now ill give you my portion elringtonas soon as philip went out of the room mr trevannion said thats a most impudent boy and i am glad that he is gone you are of course aware that his brother has left me and the cause of our disagreement yes sir replied i drily i have heard the whole particulars did you ever hear of such ridiculous scruples said he yes sir i heard them before and so did you when he gave up the command of the privateer and i respected them because i knew that mr elrington was sincere indeed his observations on that head are undeniably true and have had great weight with me so much so that i intend to enter into the kings service as soon as i possibly can i wish you had seen the look of mr trevannion when i said thishe was stupified that i captain levee who had commanded his vessels so longi the very beau ideal of a privateersman a reckless extravagant daredevil should also presume to have scruples was too much for him et tu brute he might have exclaimed but he did not but he stared at me without speaking for some time at last he said is the golden age arrived or is this a conspiracy neither one nor the other sir i replied i follow privateering because i can do no better but as soon as i can do better i shall leave it off perhaps said mr trevannion you would wish to resign the command at once if so i beg you will not make any ceremony i have not wished to put you to any inconvenience mr trevannion replied i but as you kindly beg me to use no ceremony i will take advantage of your offer and resign the command of the arrow this day surely levee you have not done so yes i have replied captain levee and i have done so in the first place out of friendship to you and in the second because i wish to be employed in the kings service and my only chance of obtaining that wish is doing what i have done how will that effect your purpose because the men have sailed so long with me that they will not sail under any other person if i tell them not mr trevannion will find himself in an awkward position and i think we can force him to hire his vessel to government who will gladly accept such a one as the arrow that i believe if from her reputation alone replied i well levee i thank you very much for this proof of sincere friendship the plot thickens and a few days will decide the question very true and now let me finish my story i am afraid said mr trevannion in a very sarcastic tone that i shall not be able to find any one to replace you in this moral age captain levee but i will try sir i replied i will now answer your sarcasm there is some excuse for ignorant seamen before the mast who enter on board of privateers they are indifferent to blood and carnage and their feelings are bluntedthere is some excuse even for decayed gentlemen like me mr trevannion for i am a gentleman born who to obtain a maintenance without labour risk their lives and shed their blood but there is no excuse for those who having already as much wealth and more than they can require still furnish the means and equip vessels of this description to commit the destruction which they do for the sake of gain there is a sermon sir for you from a captain of a privateer and i now wish you good morning i then got up and making a profound bow i quitted the room before mr trevannion made any reply and here i am now all we have to do is to wait quietly and see what takes place but first i shall go on board the arrow and let them know that i have quarrelled with the owner the men are not very well pleased as it is with their want of success these two last voyages and it will require but little to blow up the discontent into a mutiny come philip i shall want you to assist me we shall be back to dinner elrington when i was again alone i had time to consider what had passed what i chiefly dwelt upon was the interview between philip and miss trevannionher message to meher hesitationand keeping the ring i could not help surmising that our feelings towards each other were reciprocal and this idea gave me infinite delight and repaid me for all that had passed then my brothers hasty declaration to her father that we were better born and bred than he was would certainly be repeated by him to his daughter and must make an impression and what would mr trevannion do would he give way to the unanimous opinion against him i feared not at least without another struggle all these questions occupied my thoughts till the return of captain levee and philip from the privateer they had well managed their business the crew of the arrow had come to an unanimous resolution that they would not sail with any other captain but captain levee and that if he did resign the command of the vessel as soon as their wages were paid and they received their share of prizemoney they would leave and enter into the kings service that afternoon mr trevannion sent for the officer next in command to give him the command of the vessel but as he went over the side the men expecting that he was sent for for that purpose told him that they would serve under no one but captain levee and that he might acquaint the owner with their determination this put the finishing blow to mr trevannion as soon as this was communicated to him he was wild with rage in being thus thwarted in every way as i afterwards was informed he went even to his daughter acquainted her with all that had passed and gave vent to his indignation accusing her of being a party in the conspiracy but this was to be his last effort the excitement had been too great and after dinner he felt so unwell that he went to bed the next morning he was in a raging fever and at times delirious the fever was so violent that the doctors had much to do to reduce it and for ten days mr trevannion was in great danger at last it was got under leaving him in a state of great weakness and exhaustion and his recovery was any thing but rapid humphrey the porter had brought us this intelligence as now there was no one to transact the business of the house and the poor fellow did not know what to do i desired him to apply to miss trevannion for directions and told him that although i would not enter the house i would if she wished it see to the more important concerns which could not be neglected she was then attending her father and sent me a message requesting as a favour to her that i would assist all i could in the dilemma i consequently sent for the books and gave orders and made the necessary arrangements as i had done before i had been dismissed by mr trevannion it was nearly five weeks before mr trevannion had sufficiently recovered to mention any thing about business to him and then it was that he learnt from his daughter that i had carried it on for him during his illness and that every thing had gone on as well as if he had acted for himself although miss trevannion had not expressed a wish that i should call she had sent humphrey for my brother philip to let us know the dangerous state in which her father was and after that philip called every day and was the bearer of messages to me as her father recovered she told philip that he had expressed himself very strongly as to his conduct towards me and had acknowledged that i was right in my scruples and that he was astonished that he had not viewed privateering in the same light that i did that he felt very grateful for my considerate and kind conduct in conducting the business during his illness and that as soon as he was well enough he would call upon me to beg my pardon for his conduct towards me miss trevannion also told him that her father had said that he considered his illness a judgment upon him and a warning to open his eyes to his sacrifice of principle to the desire of gain and that he received it accordingly with humility and thankfulness that it was his intention to offer the privateer vessels to government and if they did not hire them he should dispose of them in some other way this was very agreeable intelligence and was the source of much conversation between captain levee and me about a fortnight afterwards mr trevannion who was still weak sent me a billet in which he said that he was afraid that his anxiety to see me and his being still confined to his room rather retarded his recovery and begged as a favour that i would accept his acknowledgment in writing and come to see him that i consented to do and repaired to his house accordingly i found him in his room sitting in his dressinggown and he had evidently suffered much mr elrington said he i trust to your excellent nature to accept my apologies for the very unjust treatment you have received at my hands i am ashamed of myself and i can say no more i beg mr trevannion that you will say no more i accept the return of your friendship with pleasure replied i i am sorry that you have been so ill i am not replied he it is good for us to be chastised at times my sickness has opened my eyes and made me i trust a better man may i ask a favour of you most certainly sir replied i it is that you will execute a commission for me which is to go to london on my account see the government people who control the naval affairs and offer the arrow as a hired vessel you know all her qualities so well and have kept her accounts so long that you will be able to furnish them with all necessary information i should wish captain levee to go with you and if you possibly can make it a condition that he is taken into the kings service and appointed the captain of her i will do so with pleasure replied i one more favour i have to beg mr elrington when i so foolishly quarrelled with you you left a bag of money to which you were fully entitled from your good services upon the table in the inner room i trust now that you will not mortify me by refusing it or i shall think that you have not really forgiven me i bowed assent i thank you mr elringtonthank you very much now i shall soon get well tomorrow perhaps you will have the kindness to come and see me again i feel rather overcome at present remember me kindly to philip goodbye for today said mr trevannion holding out his emaciated hand god bless you i took his hand and quitted the room shutting the door softly mr trevannion was quite alone when i was with him humphrey the porter had shown me upstairs to the room anxious as i was to see miss trevannion i did not venture into the sittingroom but passed the door and went downstairs when i was going out of the street door humphrey followed me and said miss trevannion wished to see me i went back again with a beating heart a sensation i had not felt before when about to go into her presence she was standing by the table mr elrington said she as i bowed upon entering i did not think that you could carry your resentment against me so far as to leave the house without asking to see me but if you do not wish to see me tis a duty i owe to myself to wish to see you if only for a moment that i may beg your pardon for my conduct towards you when we last parted i have suffered much since that mr elrington do not make me suffer more by continuing your resentment recollect i am but a weak woman and must not be judged so severely as one of your own sex i have nothing to pardon that i am aware of miss trevannion replied i i did not intrude upon you just now because being no longer an inmate of the house and not having parted with you in complete amity i thought it would be presumptuous in me so to do you are very generous mr elrington replied she now take my hand and i promise never to be so hasty again i took the proffered hand and raised it respectfully to my lips i had never done so before but miss trevannion showed no signs of displeasure or attempt to withdraw it do you think my father looks very ill mr elrington said she from his appearance i think that he must have suffered much i am most thankful that you have come to see him mr elrington you have no idea how his mind was troubled and how he longed to be reconciled to you i trust he has made his peace i have always had too much respect for your father and gratitude for his kindness to me to have made that a work of difficulty you rejoice me muchmake me very happy mr elrington replied miss trevannion as the tears dropped fast from her eyes you must excuse me said she i have become very weak and nervous during my fathers illnessand sitting up with him so muchbut it is over now you have had much anxiety i see miss trevannion you are pale and thin to what you were did my father but i have no right to ask such questions you would inquire miss trevannion whether any thing was said as to future arrangements miss trevannion made a sign of assent i have promised to execute a commission for him and am going to london accompanied by captain levee to get rid of those wretched privateers is it not yes it is and i am to come tomorrow to arrange further but i think you want to return to your fathers room so i will now take my leave you are considerate mr elrington i did want to go upstairs but before i go i have some property of yours to place in your hands i bowed thinking that she referred to the ring which i perceived on her finger and was annoyed that she was in such haste to return it but on the contrary she went to the buffet and brought out the bag of gold jacobuses which she laid on the table you are very proud mr elrington not to take what was fairly your due said miss trevannion smiling it is much more than i have ever earned replied i but your father made me promise not to refuse it a second time and of course i shall now take it my heart was much lightened when i found that it was the gold and not the ring then goodbye mr elrington tomorrow i shall see you of course miss trevannion then left the room and hastened upstairs to her father and i went home to my lodgings i narrated the substance of what had passed between mr trevannion and me to captain levee and philip and also that i had been kindly received by miss trevannion well i like the reconciliation and arrangement very much said captain levee and as you have such a bag of gold and i have not fifty guineas in the world you shall stand treat in london elrington that i will with pleasure it will only be discharging an old debt levee philip shall go with us but said captain levee do you not think they will recognize their state prisoner and be cautious of a jacobite they may remember the name said i but my person was seen but by few i do however think it would be advisable as i shall have to sign papers to take another i think so too replied captain levee what shall we call you let me see ill have a good name i had a relative of the name of musgrave i think i will borrow his name what say you philip will you be for the future philip musgrave yes brother with all my heart the name appears to fit me better than that of elrington thus madam did i resume my real name without any suspicion on the part of captain levee but i could not well sign government papers with an assumed one on the following day i called upon mr trevannion who received me with great affection and it was arranged that i should set off in three days which time would be required for preparation and to make the necessary purchases to supply funds for the journey mr trevannion gave me another bag of jacobuses of the same amount as the former saying that he wished us to appear bravely when we arrived in london and that he should require no account of the expenditure only that if the contents of the bag were not sufficient he would supply more this was nothing more but an excuse on his part to be generous for one quarter of the money would have been sufficient for all needful expenses i told him that i had taken the name of musgrave as that of elrington might be remembered to the injury of the proposal and he said that it was well thought of by me miss trevannion had entered the room when i mentioned that to her father and afterwards had quitted it after i had taken leave of mr trevannion i went down to the sittingroom where i found his daughter waiting for me we had much friendly discourse and at one time she said i heard you say that you had taken the name of musgrave for your intended journey do you intend to retain that name when you return why should i replied i because replied she perhaps it is your real name excuse a ladys curiosity but is not that the fact miss trevannion replied i my real name must at present remain a secret that is to say it will no longer be a secret if intrusted to me i thank you sir for the compliment i do not intend to imply that miss trevannion i fully believe that you can keep a secret if you fully believe so you might then reply to my question the more so as i now pledge myself to keep your secret most faithfully then miss trevannion my real name is musgrave replied i i thank you for your confidence mr musgrave which shall not be misplaced i might now follow up my inquiries as to why you changed your name with many other queries but i am too discreet for thatthe time may come when i shall know all but i am content with your proof of confidence and thank you for it miss trevannion never was so lively and communicative with me before as she was this morning there was a friendliness without any of her usual reserve and i left her more full of admiration and devotion than ever in three days more our preparations were made and taking leave of miss trevannion and her father who was recovering and had admitted company to his room we set off on horseback as we had done before and attended by the same two men of captain levees who had served us on a former journey to london we had no adventure whatever on this journey which could be worth narrating and i shall therefore say that we arrived in good health and spirits and took up our abode at once at our former lodginghouse instead of going to the inn we were welcomed by the hostess who had her house almost empty the following day i made inquiries and in consequence went to the navy office and requesting to see one of the head clerks informed him of the occasion of my coming up to london he was very civil and replied that the government were in want of vessels and he had no doubt but they would have the arrow as she was well known as a strong privateer i then inquired whether they thought it likely that captain levee might be taken into the service stating what an excellent crew the arrow had and that they would not remain in her unless they were commanded by him in whom they had great confidence the clerk replied that it might be done certainlybut added hesir you cannot expect people to do such kind offices without they are rewarded i perfectly understood him and replied that of course i did not expect it but i was so ignorant as to what ought to be done that i begged that he would give me his advice for which i should be most grateful well well you understand me mr musgrave and that is sufficient i will be plain with you it will cost guineas to obtain what you want for captain levee and of that money i shall not receive a doit i shall be most happy to give that sum and half as much more to obtain my wish sir and shall feel much obliged to you in the bargain and while i am negotiating i may as well state that i have a brother who sails with captain levee who is most anxious to be with him and sail as his lieutenant that will cost another fifty guineas mr musgrave i am most willing replied i well we must first get the vessel hired into the service you have your tonnage and equipment all on paper every thing that is requisite and moreover every cruise she has made the actions she has fought and the prizes she has taken under the command of captain levee and with the crew now on board furnish all these documents mr musgrave and leave it to me i am to understand that you perfectly agree to the terms i have proposed perfectly sir and if you please i will sign a memorandum to that effect no no replied he we never put such things down on paper it is an affair of honour and good faith you say your money is all ready at a minutes warning that is sufficient mr musgrave i will now wish you good morning send me the documents i have them in my pocket sir better still then the affair may be arranged this afternoon and you may call tomorrow at about two in the afternoon and you may as well bring the money with you as you can but take it away again if every thing is not to your satisfaction i returned to the lodgings quite delighted with the prospect of such a fortunate issue to my mission and was in good time for dinner i did not tell captain levee or philip of what had passed but merely that i considered that there was a good chance of success and that i was to call on the following day that night we went to the theatre and saw a play performed written by shakspeare in the time of queen elizabeth and called the merry wives of windsor we were much pleased with the character falstaff a fat knight full of humour the next day at the time appointed i called upon the head clerk who told me that every thing was arranged according to my wishes that the hiring of the vessel was according to her tonnage and he considered that the price offered by the government was fair and liberal so did i and immediately accepted it he then drew from his desk the articles of agreement between the government and the owner of the vessel and at the same time the warrants for captain levee and philip to act as commander and lieutenant now mr musgrave all you have to do is to sign the first paper and fulfil the other portion of our agreement i immediately pulled out the bag of money which i had brought with me and after counting it over the clerk gave me his pen to sign the document and handed to me the warrants for philip and captain levee you have behaved liberally in this affair mr musgrave said the gentleman as he locked up the bag of money in his desk if at any time i can be of use to you you may command me i thank you sir replied i i may byandby have to ask you to exert your influence in behalf of my brother that he may obtain the command of one of the kings ships and if you can help me i shall be most grateful depend upon it i will replied he and i beg you will use no ceremony on making the application he then shook hands with me and i went home dinner was over when i came back but the hostess had put away some victuals for me and while i was eating them i gave them an account of my success handing their warrants to captain levee and philip they could hardly credit me even when the documents were in their hands but pledging them to secrecy i told them by what means i had been so successful whereupon they thanked me and we then went out to procure the uniforms suitable to their respective ranks and this occupied us till the evening when we agreed to go to the cockpit and see the fights between the various animals with which philip particularly was much delighted as we had nothing to detain us in london and it was necessary that the arrow should immediately run round to the nore we determined as the uniforms were to be ready on the following day that the day after that we would return to liverpool chapter xv we return to liverpooli have an interview with miss trevannionplutus interferes with cupid and i sail again for the coast of africa we set off and arrived at liverpool without accident late on the sixth night when we repaired to our usual lodgings the next day i called to tell mr trevannion that i had returned and was informed by humphrey that he was quite strong again and very anxious to see me although he had no idea that i should return so soon humphrey went up to announce my arrival and mr trevannion admitted me immediately although he was not yet out of bed i fear that you have not been successful said he as he took my hand on the contrary sir i have succeeded in every thing and i then gave him an account of what had happened well replied he i am very glad of it and recollect i must be at the expense as without you had incurred it the schooner would not in all probability have been hired and now i want to consult with you about something else here is a letter from captain irving of the amy brought home by the chester lass these were two vessels employed on the gold coast which belonged to mr trevannion read it said mr trevannion and give me your opinion i did so captain irving stated that he had pushed the two vessels up a small river on the coast which he had not known of before and had fallen in with a black ruler who had never yet treated with the english but only with the spaniards for slaves that his english commodities were quite new to the natives and that in consequence he had made a most fortunate traffic with them and had loaded a vessel with ivory wax and golddust to the amount of pounds and that he had sent the chester lass remaining himself to continue the barter before it was known to the other ships on the coast which it would soon be he continued that he had not sufficient of the articles which were most valued by the natives and requested that mr trevannion would immediately despatch another vessel with various goods enumerated and that then he should be able to fill his own vessel as well as the one that he had despatched home that the river was in such a latitude and the mouth difficult to discover that he sent a little sketch of the coast which would facilitate the discoverybut that no time was to be lost as the sickly season was coming on and it was very unhealthy at that time as i folded up the letter mr trevannion said now here is an invoice of the whole cargo sent home by the chester lass i reckon it worth about l i looked over the invoice and agreed with mr trevannion that it was well worth that if not more this is most important you will acknowledge musgrave said mr trevannion but before i go any further i trust that now the only difficulty is got over you will not refuse to be my partner the only difference i intend to make is that i now offer you onefourth instead of oneeighth silence gives consent continued mr trevannion as i did not immediately reply i was so astonished at your munificent offer sir that i could not well speak then its agreed so say no more about it said mr trevannion taking me by the hand and pressing it warmlyand now to business my idea is to sent out the sparrowhawk being so fast a sailer of course as a privateer she has done her work and as the government wish the complement of the arrow to be increased i think we cannot do better than to fill her up with some of the sparrowhawks men leaving about twentyfive on board of her and sending her out as soon as possible to the coast with the articles which captain irving requests i agree with you sir that it will be the best plan but whom to send is the difficulty said mr trevannion captain paul of the chester lass is very ill and not likely to be out of bed for some time and even if he were well i have no opinion of him in an affair of this moment if as captain irving says he can fill the amy her cargo will be worth three times that of the chester lass but of course the destination of the sparrowhawk must be a secret and i do not know whom to intrust her to we require some one in whom we can put confidence i agree with you sir replied i and if you have no objection i think that the best plan will be for me to go myself i shall be back again in ten weeks at the furthest well as you will now have a strong interest in it i really think so too in fact i dont know whom else we can trust i agree with you sir and i will go myself and i think the sooner the better but i do not know whether we can obtain all the goods requisite immediately we can have them in five or six days replied mr trevannion i sent humphrey out to make inquiry at all events i must look to them myself and there are many other things to manage so i had better wish you a good morning now mr trevannion and in the evening i will call again and let you know what i have done do so said he and i then took my leave i certainly was very much astonished as well as much pleased at mr trevannions liberality relative to the partnership and i could now look forward to competency in a few years at the furthest certainly if mr trevannion had been hasty in his conduct towards me he had made most noble reparation i first returned to the lodgings and told captain levee and philip what had passed they immediately proposed that we should all go together on board the sparrowhawk that i might make my arrangements and that they might persuade some of the men to join the arrow i first picked out the men i wished to sail with me and then they talked over the rest who that evening went on shore for their wages and the next morning joined the arrow as captain levee was anxious to get round to the nore the day after the men joined the arrow sailed which i was not sorry for as it left me more at leisure to expedite my own affairs philip promised to be my correspondent and i bade them both farewell with regret i called in the evening as i had promised upon mr trevannion and he then gave me the deed of partnership signed and dated the day when he first made the offer and we had quarrelled but i did not see miss trevannion much to my regret her father said that she was ailing the business i had to transact and fitting out the sparrowhawk so completely occupied me that it was now three days that i had been at liverpool without having seen her and i was much annoyed at it as i had called every day my feelings towards her were now stronger than before she was never out of my thoughts and i hardly know how it was that i transacted business as i did this evening i was determined if possible that i would see her and find out why she avoided me as it appeared to me that she did when i called therefore i did not ask to see her father but told humphrey to find out where miss trevannion was and say that i requested to speak with her humphrey returned and said that she was in the sittingroom to which i instantly repaired i am fearful that i have given you some unintentional cause of displeasure miss trevannion said i as i entered for you have appeared to avoid me since my return indeed mr musgrave i have not replied she i was most anxious to see you and have thought it very unpolite i may add unkind on your part not to have come to me i have been in the house every day and sometimes twice aday with your father miss trevannion and have never met you once i inquired for you and your father told me you were unwell whereas humphrey had but five minutes before told me that you were well and in good spirits humphrey told the truth and so did my father i was in good health and spirits and in five minutes afterwards i was ill and unhappy i trust i was no party to it miss trevannion you were a party to it but not the great offender who was my father he had told me that upon your return he had installed you as his partner and had done you the justice you had deserved and then he told me that you were going out to the coast of africa in the sparrowhawk it is very true miss trevannion but where is the offence the offence is this my father no sooner does you justice than he wants more ivory and golddust having more than enough already but i told him it was as bad as privateering for in either case he sends people out to sacrifice their lives that he may gain more money i have no patience with this foolish pursuit of wealth after all your fathers kindness to me miss trevannion i could do no less than accept the offer you would have been more wise and more just to yourself to have refused it mr musgrave i read the letters to my father when they arrived and you know what captain irving says about the unhealthiness of the climate you have been my fathers best friend and he should not have treated you thus i never did value life miss trevannion but really the kind interest you have expressed on this occasion makes me feel as if my poor life was of some value to one who has been such a football of fortune as i have been and who has hardly known a kind feeling towards him ever expressed it is a gratification that i really appreciate and coming from one whom i respect and esteem more than any other person in the world it quite overpowers me indeed miss trevannion i am truly grateful i was correct when i said that it overpowered me for it did completely and i was so oppressed by my feelings that i reeled to a chair and covered up my face with my hands what would i have given to have dared to state what i felt you are ill mr musgrave said miss trevannion coming to me can i offer you any thing i made no reply i could not speak mr musgrave said miss trevannion taking my hand you frighten me what is the matter shall i call humphrey i felt her hand tremble in mine and uncertain what to think i came to the resolution to make the avowal miss trevannion said i after a pause and rising from my chair i feel that this internal conflict is too great for me and if it lasts it must kill me i give you my honour that i have for months tried every thing in my power to curb my desires and to persuade myself of my folly and rash ambition but i cannot do so any longer it were better that i knew my fate at once even if my sentence should be my death you will ridicule my folly be surprised at my presumption and in all probability spurn me for the avowal but make it i must miss trevannion i have daredto love you i have but one excuse to offer which is that i have been more than a year in your company and it is impossible for any one not to love one so pure so beautiful and so good i would have postponed this avowal till i was able to resume my position in society by the means which industry might have afforded me but my departure upon this business and the kind of presentiment which i have that i may not see you again has forced it from me in a few days i leave yoube gentle with me for my involuntary offencepity me while you condemn and i will return no more miss trevannion did not reply she breathed quick and stood motionless i gathered courage i looked in her face there was no displeasurei approached her she was halffainting and put her hand upon my shoulder to steady herself i put my arm round her waist and led her to the sofa and knelt at her feet watching every change in her beautiful countenance i took her hand and pressed it to my lips by degrees i became more bold and got by her side and pressed her to my heart she burst into tears and wept with her head on my bosom do not be angry with me said i after a time do i appear as if i was angry with you replied she raising her head oh no but i cannot believe my happiness to be real it must be a dream what is life but a dream replied she mournfully oh the coast of africa how i dread it and so i confess did i from that moment i had a presentiment as i had told her that something would go wrong and i could not get over the feeling i shall no longer dwell upon what took place on that delightful evening madam suffice to say that miss trevannion and i were mutually pledged and after an exchange of thought and feeling we parted and when we did part i pressed those dear lips to mine i went home reeling with excitement and hastened to bed that i might have unrestrained freedom of thought i enacted the scene of the evening over and over again recalled each motion each look every word which had passed and defying fever and presentiment of evil imagined also our happy meeting to part no more it was long before i could compose myself to sleep and when i did i need not say who it was who occupied my dreams i called as soon as i could venture so to do on the following day and had a long interview with my dear amy before i went up to her father i tried to soothe her anxiety upon my approaching voyage and to persuade her that there was little or no danger to be apprehended in so short a stay willingly would i have given it up but mr trevannion had so set his mind upon it and i had by my consent rendered it so impossible for him to find a substitute in time that i could not do so and i persuaded miss trevannion that i was right in acting to my promise one question that came forward was whether we should make known our engagement to her father at once and this was decided in the negative much as he liked me he was not yet prepared to receive me so suddenly as a soninlaw and amy was of opinion that the communication had better be postponed to this of course i gave a willing assent i was satisfied with the knowledge of her affection which i felt would never change as i was talking with her father after my interview with amy he said really elrington or musgrave i hardly know which to call you musgrave is my real name sir replied i musgravemusgravewhere did i know a musgrave we are from the north replied i well said he i was going to say that i really wish i could find some one else to take your place in this voyage for i do not much like your going do my dear father said miss trevannion who was standing by him hey miss amy what have you to do with it i should like to know and how can it concern you whether mr musgrave goes or not i said so sir because i know how you will feel his loss for so long a period you know how you did feel his loss before and i do not wish to see you working so hard as you will have to do it without his assistance well thats kindly thought amy at all events but still i fear that mr musgrave must go and i must work by myself till he comes back so its no use saying any more about it amy sighed and made no reply on the third day after this interview every thing was ready and on the following morning i was to sail mr trevannion had so many directions to give and kept me so wholly with him that i could hardly find time to speak to his daughter however it was agreed that as i was to sail at daylight that she would see me after her father had gone to bed our meeting took placeneed i say that it was a tender one we renewed our vows over and over again and it was not till past midnight that i tore myself away old humphrey looked very knowingly at me when he let me out of the streetdoor i slipped a guinea in his hand and wished him goodbye i hastened on board of the sparrowhawk and desiring to be called before daylight went down into the cabin there i remained sitting at the table and thinking of amy so long that when the mate came down to wake me he found that i was still sitting there having never been to bed during the whole of the night i started from my reverie and hastened on deck to get the schooner under weigh it was soon done although we were comparatively speaking shorthanded there was a fine breeze and lightened as she now was the little vessel flew through the water liverpool was soon out of sight and we were dashing down the irish channel she sails well now said i to the second mate a very clever man and much better educated than most seamen for he could navigate as well as being a firstrate seaman yes sir replied olivarez she walks fast she is not too deep now replied he what a slaver she would make this man was not an englishman but a brazilian portuguese by birth although he had long been out of his country having set her course i went down below that i might indulge in my castlebuilding more at my ease the wind increased to a gale but as it was from the northward and bore us to our destination it was welcomed we soon crossed the bay of biscay and were in more genial latitudes and after a rapid run of about four weeks i found myself nearly in the latitude given to us of the river where the amy was at anchor i then hauled in for the shore which was very low and required being approached with caution we saw some towering palmtrees at sunset and then we hove to the next day we again stood in and having ascertained our exact latitude at noon we found ourselves about four miles to the northward of the rivers mouth we shaped a course and in two hours i made out the marks given for our guidance in the rough sketch of captain irving and thus satisfied that i was right ran directly for the mouth of the river captain irving was correct in saying it was difficult for it was not until we were within a mile that we could find any opening but at last we did and at the same time perceived the mast of two vessels at some distance up the river we stood in and found that there was no bar at the river mouth which was a very unusual circumstance on this coast the soundings were gradual and in an hour afterwards we anchored between the amy and a fine schooner under british colours captain irving recognized the sparrowhawk and immediately came on board after the usual salutations he told me that his vessel was halfladen but that he waited for the articles he had sent for to enable him to complete his cargo i told him that i had them on board and he should have them as soon as he sent his boats he stated that no vessels except those engaged in the slavetrade had ever come into this river and that they only brought the cloth and other articles usual in the trade but that his assorted cargo had astonished the people and they were wild to possess things which they had never before seen they had offered slaves in quantities but finding that he would not take them in exchange they had now brought down ivory and golddust he told me how glad he was that i had come as the river was very sickly and was becoming more and more so every day that out of twelve men he had already four down with fever i inquired of him what that vessel was on the other side of us he replied it was a liverpool slavetrader and that the captain appeared to be a very good sort of man that he never indulged in liquor nor was given to profane language a few minutes afterwards the captain of the slaver came on board to pay his respects and i asked him down in the cabin and gave him beer and cheese the two greatest luxuries in those climes he appeared as captain irving stated a very quiet wellbehaved serious person which i was rather surprised at when we repaired on deck i observed as the vessel was close to us that there were two very large dogs on board who at the sight of the captain bayed furiously he told me that they were cuba bloodhounds and that he never went on shore without them as they were the most faithful and courageous animals and he considered that he was safer with them than with half a dozen armed men shortly afterwards captain irving and he both took leave as there were still some hours of daylight captain irving sent his boats for the goods and after that as the evening fell i went down below as captain irving requested i would do and by no means remain on deck after sundown as it was extremely unhealthy on the following day captain irving went on shore with his goods and trafficked most favourably indeed as we afterwards found out he had procured in exchange more ivory than his vessel would hold besides much golddust the day after i went on shore with captain irving to call upon the king as he called himself he was seated in front of a hut made of palmetto leaves with a lace coat on but no other garment whatever so that he made a curious appearance after a little conversation i went away and hearing that the slaver was taking her cargo on board about a hundred yards further up i walked in that direction the slaves were brought down in about twenty at a time all of them fastened by the neck to a long bamboo pole which confined them all together one string of them had been sent down and put in the boat and another was standing ready for embarkation when as i cast my eyes over them and commiserated their misery i observed a female whom i thought i had seen before i looked again and behold is was whyna the princess who had been so kind to me in my captivity i went up to her and touched her on the shoulder she turned round as well as the lashing to the pole would permit her and on seeing me gave a faint scream without ceremony i took out my knife and released her and led her away she fell down at my feet and kissed them the black man who had charge of the delivery of the slaves was very angry and ran up to me brandishing his long stick but the captain of the schooner who was on shore and who had witnessed what i had done saluted him with a kick in the stomach which made him quiet enough in few words i told the captain of the slaver that i was once in captivity and this woman had befriended me requesting him to name his price and i would willingly pay it its not worth mentioning sir replied he women are as cheap as dirt take her and welcome not so replied i i must pay her ransom well then sir said he i am in great want of a telescope you have one on board will you let me have it most certainly replied i and many thanks into the bargain i lifted up the poor creature who was sadly emaciated and weak and led her to the boat of the amy and put her in captain irving came down and we returned on board it was with great difficulty that after i had given the poor creature some refreshment which she was really in need of i could recollect sufficient of her language to make myself understood by her but by degrees words came to my memory and as she spoke i recovered more as well as i could make her out the warriors had risen against the king on account of his barbarity and had cut him to pieces and that all his wives and servants had been sold as slaves i promised her that she should not be a slave but should come to my country and be taken care of she kissed my hands and as she smiled her thanks she reminded me of the whyna of former times i did not however think it advisable that she should come on board of the schooner and i requested captain irving to take charge of her and let her want for nothing telling him that i intended that she should go home in his vessel he willingly consented and i hailed the schooner for a boat and went on deck whyna followed but i told her i was obliged to go on board of the schooner and that she had better go and lie down as she probably thought that the amy was my vessel and that i was going away on a visit she complied with my request and went down with captain irving who led her into a stateroom which was not occupied as soon as i arrived on board the schooner i sent the telescope which the captain of the slaver had begged for whyna had said to me i shall be your slave now evidently expecting that she was to remain with me but that i could not consent to miss trevannion had heard from me my adventures when in captivity and i would not on that account allow whyna to be in the same vessel with me the next day captain irving came on board to tell me that he had two more men down with the fever and that he wished i could give them some assistance in getting his cargo on board which i did and before night the amy was loaded up to the hatchways and there still remained a considerate number of elephants teeth on shore in the hut where he received them i therefore determined as his crew were evidently sickening fast that he should sail immediately and that i would take the remainder of the ivory on board of the schooner and follow him giving him a rendezvous to wait at until i joined him that we might proceed home in company that night three of my men were ill i was on board of the amy and had been talking with whyna who wanted to know why i did not sleep on board of the vessel i told her that i could not but that we were to go to england directly and that i was living on board of the schooner captain irving weighed at daybreak and in an hour was out of the river and as i was as anxious to be clear of such an unhealthy spot i manned my boats and went on shore for the ivory that was left i found that it would take the whole of the day to embark it as we had to go two miles further up the river than the depth of water would permit the vessel to do for the ivory was in a hut close to the kings house i had sent off four boatloads and it being then noon i went off with the fifth myself that i might get my dinner leaving the second mate to attend on shore and taking with me the first mate who messed in the cabin as we were in the middle of the stream the boat struck against a stump of a tree as we supposed and knocked so large a hole in the bow that she began to fill i immediately ordered the men to pull for the nearest point which was on the opposite side of the river that we might ground the boat to prevent her sinking the first mate who was a very active man finding that the elephants teeth prevented his reaching the bow of the boat and stuffing into it some oakum which he had found in the stern sheets sounded with the boathook and finding that there was not more than three feet of water where we were pulling jumped over the bows to push the oakum into the hole but the poor fellow had not been a few seconds in the water when he gave a shriek and we perceived that a large shark had snapped him in two this was a sad mishap and the men terrified pulled as hard as they could while two of them baled out the boat to gain the shore for we knew what fate awaited us if we sunk in the river with great exertion we succeeded running her up among the canes with grew on that side of the river so thick that it was difficult to force your way through them we landed up to our knees in mud and throwing out the ivory we found that a whole plank was rent out and that it was impossible to repair our boat and we were hidden by the canes from those who could have assisted us had they known that we required their assistance and we had no possible means of communication at last i thought that if i could force my way through the canes to the point down the river i could hail and make signals for assistance and desiring the men to remain by the boat i set off upon my expedition at first i got on pretty well as there were little paths through the canes made as i imagined by the natives and although i was often up to my knees in thick black mud i continued to get on pretty fast but at last the canes grew so thick that i could hardly force my way through them and it was a work of excessive labour still i persevered expecting each second that i should arrive at the banks of the river and be rewarded for my fatigue but the more i laboured the worse it appeared to be and at last i became worn out with fatigue and quite bewildered i then tried to find my way back and was equally unsuccessful and i sat down with any thing but pleasant thoughts in my mind i calculated that i had been two hours in making this attempt and was now quite puzzled how to proceed i bitterly lamented my rashness now that it was too late having reposed a little i resumed my toil and was again after an hours exertion compelled from fatigue to sit down in the deep black mud another respite from toil and another hour or more of exertion and i gave myself up for lost the day was evidently fast closing inthe light overhead was not near so bright as it had been and i knew that a night passed in the miasma of the cane was death at last it became darker and darker there could not be an hour of daylight remaining i determined upon one more struggle and reeking as i was with perspiration and faint with fatigue i rose again and was forcing my way through the thickest of the canes when i heard a deep growl and perceived a large panther not twenty yards from me it was on the move as well as i was attempting to force his way through the canes so as to come to me i retreated from him as fast as i could but he gained slowly on me and my strength was fast exhausting i thought i heard sounds at a distance and they became more and more distinct but what they were my fear and my struggles probably prevented me from making out my eyes were fixed upon the fierce animal which was in pursuit of me and i now thanked god that the canes were so thick and impassable still the animal evidently gained grounduntil it was not more than five yards from me dashing and springing at the canes and tearing them aside with his teeth the sounds were now nearer and i made them out to be the howling of other animals a moments pause and i thought it was the baying of dogs and i then thought that i must have arrived close to where the schooner was and that i heard the baying of the bloodhounds at last i could do no more and i dropped exhausted and almost senseless in the mud i recollect hearing the crashing of the canes and then a savage roar and then yells and growls and struggles and fierce contentionbut i had fainted i must now inform the reader that about an hour after i had left the boat the captain of the slaver was pulling up the river and was hailed by our men in our longboat perceiving them on shore on that side of the river and that they were in distress he pulled towards them and they told him what had happened and that an hour previous i had left the boat to force my way through the canebrakes and they had heard nothing of me since madness cried he he is a lost man stay till i come back from the schooner he went back to the schooner and taking two of his crew who were negroes and his two bloodhounds into the boat he returned immediately and as soon as he landed he put the bloodhounds on my track and sent the negroes on with them they had followed me in all my windings for it appeared that i had travelled in every direction and had come up with me just as i had sunk with exhaustion and the panther was so close upon me the bloodhounds had attacked the panther and this was the noise which sounded in my ears as i lay stupified and at the mercy of the wild beast the panther was not easily although eventually overcome and the black men coming up had found me and borne me in a state of insensibility on board of the sparrowhawk the fever had come on me and it was not till three weeks afterwards that i recovered my senses when i learnt what i have now told the reader and much more with which i am about to make him acquainted when i recovered my senses i found myself in the cabin of the sparrowhawk for some hours i was confused and wandering but i rallied from time to time till i could at last recognize the beams and carlines over my head i was too weak to move and i continued to lie on my back till i again fell asleep how long i do not know but it must have been for many hours and then when i awoke i found myself much stronger i could now turn on my bed and doing so i perceived a young man of the name of ingram by my side in a doze with his eyes shut i called him in a faint voice and he started up i have been very ill said i have i not yes sir indeed you have i have been trying to recollect all about it but i cannot as yet its not worth remembering sir replied he do you wish any thing to drink no replied i then you had better go to sleep again i cannot do that i feel as if i should like to get up where is mr thompson i must see him mr thompson sir replied he dont you recollect what why sir he was bitten in two by a shark shark this was the keynote required and my memory returned yes yes i recollect now all all i recollect the panther and the canebrakes how was i preserved the bloodhounds killed the panther and you were brought on board insensible and have been in a raging fever ever since it must be so replied i collecting my senses after a few moments of thought it must be so how long have i been ill this is the twentyfirst day the twentyfirst day cried i is it possible are none of the men ill no sir they are all well but i hear the water against the bends are we not still at anchor no sir the second mate got the schooner under weigh as he found you were so ill and i have been ill twentyone days why we must be near home we expect to make the land in a few days sir replied ingram thank heaven for all its mercies said i i never expected to see old england again but what a bad smell there is what can it be i suppose it is the bilgewater sir replied ingram people who are ill and weak always are annoyed by it but i think sir if you would take a little gruel and then go to sleep again it would be better well i fear i am not very strong and talking so much has done me no good i think i could take a little gruel then sir ill go and get some made and be back very soon do ingram and tell mr olivarez the second mate that i would speak to him yes i will replied the man and he left the stateroom i waited some time listening for the arrival of the second mate and then i thought that i heard odd noises in the hold before the bulkhead of the stateroom in which i was lying but i was still very weak and my head swam after a time ingram came down with the gruel into which he put some sugar and a spoonful of rum to flavour it as he said he offered it to me and i drank it all for i had an appetite but whether it was that i was very weak or the rum he put in was more than he said it is certain that i had hardly given him back the basin than i felt so drowsy that i turned away from him and was soon again in forgetfulness this ingram was a young man who had been apprenticed to an apothecary and had taken to the sea he was well educated and a very merry fellow and i had chosen him as one who could attend upon me in the cabin and at the same time be otherwise useful if required as he was a very good seaman and very active when i awoke again i felt convinced that i must have slept through the night as it was broad daylight as before but ingram was not by my bedside there was no bell in the stateroom and i was obliged to await his coming i felt much stronger than the day before and now proposed getting out of bed as soon as ingram should come down into the cabin i now remembered that the second mate had not come down to me and heard noises and murmurings in the hold as i had the day previous which surprised me and i became more anxious for the return of ingram at last he came and i told him that i had been awake more than an hour how do you feel yourself sir said he quite strong i should like to get up and dress perhaps i may be able to get on deck for a quarter of an hour i think replied he that you had better wait and hear what i have to tell you sir i would not tell you yesterday because i thought it would be too much for you but as i see you are really better today i must say that i have strange things to tell you indeed cried i with surprise strange things by the bye why did not olivarez come to me yesterday i will explain all to you sir if you will lie down and listen to what i have to say and take the news quietly very well ingram i will do so now pray go on you were brought on board in a state of fever and insensibility by the captain of the slaver he said as he lifted you over the side that you were a dead man we all thought the same and you were taken down into the cabin with that persuasion on the part of the whole crew your delirium and fever increased and every hour it was expected that you would give up the ghost now sir two days afterwards the slaver sailed with his cargo and we were left alone in the river olivarez who of course commanded talked to the men he said that you were as good as dead already and that he thought that this was a fair opportunity for their making money he proposed that the ivory still on shore should be changed for slaves which he said the negroes would gladly do and that we should run with our cargo to the brazils he said that it was useless our remaining in the river as we should all lose our lives in the same way that you had done and that he thought as commanding the schooner he knew what would best please the owner who had long employed vessels in the slavetrade and would not be sorry to find that we had run a cargo and would reward them all liberally that this would be an excuse to leave the river immediately whereas otherwise they would have to wait till you recovered or died and by that time they might half of them be dead themselves do you understand me sir yes perfectly go on ingram well sir the men did not perceive what he was about and replied that so long as they left the river they did not care how soon and that it was better that we should take a cargo of slaves at all events for olivarez was in command now and they should do as he ordered them i made no reply indeed olivarez never put the question to me well sir the ivory was soon exchanged for slaves who are now on board and it is the slaves whom you have smelt and complained of we received on board and provisions sufficient with what we had and having taken in all the water we could below and on deck we made sail out of the river and have since steered for the brazils but olivarez has taken a most unwarrantable responsibility said i and one that he shall answer for stop sir replied ingram you have only heard the first part of the story when we had been three days at sea olivarez who had been talking to the men one by one and apart called them together and said it was an opportunity not to be lost that they had possession of the vessel and the owner would never have a clue to where she had gone and that now was the time to take possession of her for themselves and employ her in the slavetrade on their own account that sailing so fast nothing could overhaul her or board her and therefore they were free from danger he then proposed that he should command and navigate and receive onehalf of the profits and that the other half should be divided among the crewthe expense of the provisions c being paid out of it previous to their sharing and making a calculation he showed them that every voyage would be worth about l aman after all expenses were paid the crew consented at once to the termsall but me and when he asked me my answer was that i would consent to nothing while you were yet alive i said that because i was afraid that they would murder me or throw me overboard go on ingram go on and let me hear it all at once then you will soon be freed from your difficulty said olivarez i do not know that sir i replied for i think mr musgrave may get over it indeed he returned well then so much the worse for him as he olivarez said this the whole of the crew to do them justice cried out that there should be no murder for if there was they not only would have nothing to do with the affair but would make it known at the first port to which they came that you had always been a kind good officer and were too brave a man to die in that way well my men said olivarez i never had an idea of the kind and i promise you if he lives through it there shall be no murder i will put him on shore at the first port we arrive at but in such a way as to secure our safetythat we must look to the men said that that was all right and then they all agreed to join him and you ingram said olivarez what do you say what i said before i replied that as long as mr musgrave lives i will come to no agreement whatever well said olivarez it is but postponing your decision i know that you will join us so now my lads as were all agreed we may as well go to dinner the scoundrel shall pay for this cried i hush sir hush i pray say nothing but wait patiently and see what turns up we are not yet at rio and when we are we may be able to do something but every thing depends upon keeping quiet for if the men become alarmed they may be persuaded to kill you to save themselves that is very true ingram replied i leave me now for half an hour i wish to be alone you may imagine my dear madam my agitation at hearing this intelligence i who had thought that i was within a few days sail of liverpool to be there received by my cherished amy to find myself in the hands of pirates and close to the brazils with a cargo of slaves which they or rather olivarez had taken in the vessel to rio that he might not be discovered for he might have found a better mart for his live cargo and then what would be the anxiety of amy and her father when i was not heard of it would be supposed that the schooner was upset in a squall and all hands had perished excited and angry as i was i felt the truth of what ingram said and that it was necessary to be quiet perhaps i might by that means not only preserve my life but again find myself in my own country when ingram returned i asked him if olivarez knew that i was better and had recovered my reason he replied that he did but that he had told him i was so weak that i could hardly recover that is well said i keep him in that belief as long as you can he now offered me more gruel which i took and i believe that he put an opiate in it for shortly after i had taken it i again felt drowsy and was soon fast asleep i awoke sooner than before for it was night and i heard the voice of olivarez on deck from what i gathered land was in sight and i heard him order the schooner to be hove to in the morning ingram came down in the cabin bringing me some breakfast which i ate heartily for i was recovering fast and had become quite ravenous land is in sight said i yes sir it is but we are many miles to the northward of rio i understand for olivarez knows the coast well we shall not be in today if we are tomorrow i feel quite strong now replied i and i want to get up do so sir said he but if you hear any one coming down the ladder get into bed again with ingrams assistance i dressed myself and went into the cabin i reeled as i walked but as soon as i felt the cool breeze from the sternports i was revived and in an hour i could walk quite strong have you heard any more inquired i of ingram olivarez asked me this morning how you were i replied that you were recovering fast very well said he you will share his fate whatever it may be since you have been so careful of him and have put us in such a dilemma but ill contrive to dispose of you both i made no reply sir as i knew that would only irritate him you did right ingram a few days will decide our fate i do not think that he dares to murder us nor do i think he wishes it if he can be clear of us with safety to himself replied ingram two days more passed away and then ingram told me that we were a few miles from the town and should soon be at anchor go softly replied i and tell me what is going on he went up the ladder but soon came down again saying we are locked in sir i was very much annoyed at this but it could not be helpedour only remedy was patience but i must confess that i was in a state of great anxiety we heard the anchor let go and boats came on board after which all was silent for the night the next morning we heard them open the hatches and the slaves were ordered upon deck the day was passed in landing them i was ravenously hungry and asked ingram whether they intended to starve us he went up the ladder to call for victuals when he found on the upper step of the ladder a large vessel full of water and some cooked provisions which had probably been put there during the night there was enough to last two or three days the next day passed and no one came near us and i had some thoughts of dropping out of the sternports and attempting to swim on shore but ingram who had put his head out of them as far as he could told me that we must be at some distance from the shore and there were several sharks playing round the stern as is always the case with vessels laden with slaves the next morning however put an end to our suspense for the companion was unlocked and olivarez accompanied by four portuguese came down into the cabin he spoke to them in portuguese and they advanced and seizing ingram and me by the collar led us up the ladder i would have expostulated but of course could not make myself understood olivarez however said resistance is useless mr musgrave all you have to do is to go quietly with these men as soon as the schooner has sailed you will be released well replied i it maybe so olivarez but mark my words you will repent this and i shall see you on a gibbet i trust the wood is not yet out of the ground replied he but i cannot waste any more words with you he then spoke to the portuguese who appeared to be government officers of some kind and they led us to the gangway we went into the boat and they pulled us to the shore where can they be taking us ingram said i heaven knows sir but we shall find out i attempted to speak to the officers but they cried silentio which word i fully understood to mean silence and finding that i could not induce them to hear me i said no more we landed at a jetty and were then led through the streets to a large square on one side of it was a heavy building to which they directed their steps the door was opened for us and we were led in a paper was produced by our conductors and was apparently copied into a book after which they went away leaving us with the people who had received us and who by their appearance i knew to be gaolers of what crime am i accused inquired i no reply was given but two of the subordinates took us away unlocked a massive door and thrust us into a large courtyard full of men of every colour well said i as the door closed upon us we are in gaol at all events but the question now is shall we be released as olivarez had stated it is hard to say replied ingram the question is what gaol is this could we find any one who could speak english we might discover several of those around us had come towards us to examine us and then left us when as we were conversing a negro came up and hearing what we said addressed us in english massa want one to speak englishi speak englishsome long while on board english vessel well then my good fellow said i can you tell us what this gaol is and what prisoners are confined here for yes massa every body know that suppose he live at rio this gaol for people that go dig diamonds how do you mean mean massapeople sent here to work in diamondmines all life long till they die keep em here till hab plenty to send up all at one time then guard take them up the country and they go dig and wash for diamond suppose you find very big diamond you go free suppose not den you die there merciful heavens cried i to ingram then we are condemned as slaves to the mines yes replied ingram with a sigh well its better than working in the quicksilvermines at all events we shall have fresh air fresh air without liberty cried i clasping my hands come sir courage we do not yet know our fate perhaps we may as olivarez said be allowed to go free after the schooner sails i shook my head for i was convinced otherwise chapter xvi the diamondmines and what occurred therei lose my friend ingram and another acquaintance but they both leave me valuable legacies after remaining in the court about two hours it being then near to nightfall the gaolers came out into the yard and we were all driven into a large apartment the walls of which were of such solid materials and the floor of large flagstones as to prevent any possibility of escape i was never in such a scene of filth and wretchedness there was not a spot where one could be driven without being defiled in some way or another and so many human beingsone half of whom were negroesbeing crowded into so small a space with only one barred window so high up as only to serve as a ventilator created an atmosphere worse than any slavevessels hold i leaned with my back against the wall and i must say never was so miserable in my life i thought of amy and my sanguine hopes and anticipations of happiness now all wrecked i thought of captain levee and my brother philip careering over the seas free as the wind i thought of poor whyna and the distress she must feel at finding i did not rejoin her i planned a hundred schemes to make known my situation but every scheme as soon as i weighed it i found was hopeless still weak from previous disease i felt as if i should be suffocated if i remained long in this pestiferous abode and i wept like a child daylight came at last and soon afterwards the door was opened we were admitted into the yard and all hastened to the large tub of water which was soon emptied the fighting and scrambling to obtain first possession was really revolting an hour afterwards some coarse provisions were served out and then we learnt to our great delight that we were immediately to set out for the mines it would be thought that this could be no great cause for exaltation we were about to go to pass the rest of our lives in bondage but all misery is comparative and sooner than have remained another night in that dreadful hole i would have welcomed any change about an hour afterwards a guard of dirtylooking soldiers came in we were all handcuffed to a long chain at about two feet apart one on each side so that we walked in pairs and as soon as the first chain was fulland i was handcuffed to itwe were ordered out into the square to wait for the others my superior dress and appearance as an englishman excited much curiosity people pointed to me and made remarks but i had no opportunity of communicating with any of the authorities nor would it have been of any use if i had had we remained there more than an hour as the other chains of prisoners came out one by one we were five chains in all about forty on a chain we were then ordered to move on walking between a guard of about twenty or thirty soldiers who marched on each side of us with their muskets and bayonets fixed about three yards from each other in another hour we were clear of the town and threading our way through a lane bounded on each side by prickly pears and other shrubs there was no want of merriment among the party they talked and laughed with one another and the soldiers who guarded them and appeared to care little for their fate as for me i was brokenhearted with the disgrace and the villainous manner in which i had been thus sacrificed my heart was full of bitterness and i could gladly have lain down and died had i not been still buoyed up with some faint hope that i should have an opportunity of making my position known and obtain my release i will pass over the journey as one day was but the forerunner of the other we halted at noon and were supplied with fruit and maize but we were never unchained day or night in a short time i was like all the restcovered with vermin and disgusting to myself it was i think between four and five weeks before we arrived at our destination which was in the district of tejuco and the locality of the diamondmines was called the sierra de espinhaco this sierra or mountain was a ridge of inaccessible precipices on each side of a narrow valley traversed by a small river called the tequetinhonha and in this valley and in the bed of the river were the diamonds found for which we were condemned to toil for the remainder of our days as we entered the ravine i perceived how impossible it would be to escape even if a person could find his way back after having succeeded in his escape for many miles the road was a narrow path cut on the side of the mountain yawning precipice below and inaccessible rocks above and this narrow way was at every two miles blocked up by a guardhouse built upon it and through the portcullis of which it would be necessary to force a way and here we were thousands of miles away from civilized life in the heart of a country uninhabited except by occasional bands of indians at last we filed through the last of the guardhouses and found ourselves in a wider part of the ravine which was crowded with buildings of various descriptions we were led up to the directors house and our names persons and descriptions were taken down by a clerk when my turn came and i was asked in portuguese who i was i shook my head and replied ingles an interpreter was called and i then stated my name and begged the director would hear what i had to say he shook his head and after they had taken my description desired me to go away why did you not explain for me said i to the interpreter because he wont hear what you have to say if he would every man on the chain would attempt to prove that he was sent here by mistake you may byandby find an opportunity to speak to him that is after you have learnt portuguese and have been here a year or two but it will do no good during the whole of the journey i had been separated from ingram and now for the first time since we left prison i had an opportunity of shaking him by the hand i need not say how glad i was to meet again my companion in misfortune and our only fear was now that we should be again separated but such was not the case there were regular lodgings or barracks for the slaves which were certainly not bad but as all escape was considered impossible any one who chose to raise a little hut for himself out of the bushes which grew on the rocks was permitted so to do the hours of work were regular we were allotted out in gangs which took up a certain square of the river or rivers side we worked from daylight till near dusk with only an hour allowed for repose in the heat of the day there was a superintendent over each gang of twenty who watched them and made them work these superintendents were controlled by inspectors who had the charge of four or five gangs and who brought unto the director the produce of the days toil the work was simple the sand and alluvial soil were thrown into troughs with small sieve bottoms out of which escaped all the smaller matter when it was washed with the water from the river the stones and larger particles were then carefully examined and any diamonds found were taken out and delivered to the superintendents who then made them over to the inspectors when they came round the inspectors carried them to their houses for they had houses from government and in the evening delivered every diamond found to the director after a short time i found that the office of superintendent and also of inspector was open to any of the slaves who conducted themselves well and that the whole of those now employed in the offices were slaves for life as well as ourselves what puzzled me was how so many people for in all we amounted to seven hundred or more were to be found in food but i afterwards discovered that the government had farms and herds of cattle at a few miles distance cultivated by slaves and indians expressly for the purpose our rations were scanty but we were permitted to cultivate as well as we could any spot we could find on the arid side of the mountain as a garden and some of them who had been there for many years had in course of time produced a good soil and reared plenty of vegetables to my surprise i found at least twenty englishmen among the whole mass of slaves and one or two of them were inspectors and several of them superintendentssaying much in favour of my countrymen their conversation and their advice tended much to soothe the hardships of my captivity but i found from them that any hopes of ever leaving the mines were useless and that our bones must all be laid by the side of the mountain of course ingram and i were inseparable we worked in the same gang and we very soon built a hut for ourselves and ingram who was a lighthearted young man set to work to make a garden he moved heavy stones on the sides of the mountain and scraped up all the mould he could find sometimes he would get his handkerchief full but not often but as he said every little helped he killed lizards for manure and with them and leaves he made a little dungheap which he watered to assist putrefaction every thing that would assist he carefully collected and by degrees he had sufficient for a patch of four or five yards square this he planted and with the refuse made more manure and in the course of a few months by incessant activity and assisted by me he had a very tolerable patch of ground covered with this manure and the alluvial soil washed out by the diamondseeking mixed up together we then obtained seeds and grew vegetables like the rest and this proved a great increase to our comfortsthat is our bodily wants but my mind was far away amy trevannion was never out of my thoughts and i fell into a deep melancholy i worked hard at my vocation and was fortunate enough to find some good diamonds long before i had been a year at the mines having acquired the portuguese language i was soon after raised to the office of superintendent i now no longer worked but overlooked others with a cane in my hand to administer punishment to those who neglected their business i cannot say that i liked the change i was not so miserable when i was employed but i did my duty with diligence ingram was in my gang and another englishman an old mani should think not less than seventy years old he told me that he belonged to a merchant vessel and in a drunken brawl a portuguese had been killed he and two others had been condemned to the mines but the others were dead long ago about a month after my elevation this old man who was very feeble and whom i treated with great kindness on account of his ageexacting no more than i thought he could well performfell sick i reported him as being really ill and ingram who was by no means a bad doctor told me that he would die a few hours before his death he sent for me to his hut and after thanking me for my kindness to him he said that he knew he was dying and that he wished to leave me all his property which the slaves are permitted to do that is he left me his garden which was the best on the sierra his hut which also was a very good one and then putting his hand under the leaves which formed his bed he pulled out a tattered thumbed book which he told me was a bible at first i read said he to pass away time in this melancholy place but of late i have read it i hope to a better purpose i thanked the poor man for his present and wished him goodbye a few hours afterwards he was dead and ingram and i buried him by the side of the mountain shortly afterwards our inspector died and to my astonishment i was put into his place i could not imagine why i was thus so fortunate in being promoted but i afterwards found out that although i had never but casually seen her i was indebted for my good fortune to a fancy which the directors eldest daughter for he had his family with him had taken for me this was singular for i had never spoken to her and what is more strange i never did speak to her nor did she ever attempt to speak to me so that it was wholly disinterested on her part i had now still less to do and was in constant communication with the director and one day stated to him how it was that i had been brought there he told me that he believed me but could not help me and after that the subject was never again mentioned between us having little to do i now took up the bible given me by the old englishman as i had time to read it which i had not before when i was employed the whole day but now i had a convenient cottage as i may call it of my own and plenty of leisure and retirement i studied the bible carefully and found much comfort in it not that i was content with my lotthat i never could be while i was separated from amybut still i found much consolation and i became to a certain degree resigned i thought of my former life with disgust and this second reading of the bible for the reader may recollect that the first took place when i was first confined in the tower was certainly of great advantage to me i had more time to dwell upon itmore time for reflection and selfexaminationand every day i reaped more advantage and became more worthy of the name of christian i now prayed fervently and i think my prayers were heard as you my dear madam will also think as i continue my narrative about three months after i had been appointed an inspector ingram was taken ill at first he complained of disordered bowels but in a few days inflammation came on which ended in mortification he was in great agony until the mortification took place when he obtained comparative relief my dear mr musgrave he said as i was at his bedside in a few hours i shall have escaped from the mines and be no more in bondage i shall follow the poor old englishman who left you his executor i am about to do the same i shall now make my will verbally as we have no writingmaterials here and leave you all i possess why are you not more serious ingram i said at such a moment as this i am most serious he replied i know that in a few hours i shall be no more and i trust in the mercy of him who died for kings and for slaves but musgrave i have a secret to tell you do you recollect the story in the fairy tales of the little white cat whose head was obliged to be cut off and who then turned into the most beautiful princess in the world well my secret is something like hers i thought by his continuing in this strain that his head was wandering i was about to speak to him when he continued do you know what has occasioned my death i will tell you the secret i was washing for diamonds when i found one of a size which astonished me i knew it was of great value and i did not choose that the king of portugal should receive such a benefit from my hands i put it into my mouth to secrete it hardly knowing what i should do afterwards but i was thinking how i should act when one of the superintendents passing that crabbed old portuguese belonging to the next gang and seeing me idle and in deep thought he struck me with his cane such a smart rap on the shoulders that he not only made me jump out of my reverie but the diamond went down my throat im sure if i had tried to swallow it i could not have done so but the shock forced it down well this has occasioned my death for it has remained in my stomach and occasioned the stoppage which has ended in inflammation and mortification i feel it here even now give me your finger dont you feel it well now you understand why i talked of the little white cat dont cut off my head but when i am dead just put your knife down there and take out the diamond and bury it for i tell youand they say dying men see clearer than othersbut that i am certain you will be released from these mines and then the diamond will be a fortune to you and you will find that being my executor was of some value to you now prayno scruplei entreat it as a last favour promise me that you will do as i wishpray promise me or i shall die unhappy i could not help promising him to execute his wishes he appeared so earnest and asked it as a last favour but i felt very repugnant at the idea in another hour poor ingram breathed his last and i was most melancholy at the loss of so worthy a friend who had by serving me been subjected to the same slavery as myself i left the hut and went to my own house thinking over the strange communication that had been made to me and why thought i should i obtain this diamond i have no chance of leaving this yet who knows ingram prophesied in his dying moments that i shouldwell at all events i will keep my promise to the poor fellow i reported his death to the director and about an hour afterwards went to the hut where he lay his countenance was placid and i looked at him for a long while and queried whether he was not happier than i was or ever could be but to comply with his requesti could not bear the idea i did not want the diamond and i who in my early career had thought nothing of cutting and maiming the living man now shuddered at the idea of making an incision in a dead body but there was no time to be lost the burials always took place at sunset and it was near the hour i bent a piece of bamboo cane double like a pair of sugartongs and then putting my finger to the part of his stomach which he had pointed out i felt that there was a hard substance and i made an incision with my knifeprobing with the blade i touched the diamond and then using the piece of cane as a pair of pincers i contrived after one or two attempts to extract it i threw the diamond without examination into a pan of water which stood by the bed and covering up the body i made a hole in the floor of the hut and buried the knife which i felt i never could use again i looked out of the hut and perceived two of the slaves who performed that office coming towards me to take away the body i desired them to carry it leaving the clothes on followed them and saw it deposited in the earth after which i read prayers over the grave and could not refrain from shedding many tears to the memory of my faithful associate i then returned to the hut and taking the pan of water in my hand went to my own abode i could not bear to touch the diamond but i dared not leave it where it was so i poured all the water out of the pan and then rolled the diamond out on the floor which was of hardened clay i saw at once that it was one of great value weighing i should think thirteen or fourteen grammes and of a very pure water it was in the form of an obtuse octohaedron and on one side was quite smooth and transparent having made this examination i picked up some of the clay with a piece of iron and rolling the diamond into the hole i jammed the clay down over it there said i you may remain till doomsday or till some one finds you you will be of no use to me and i thought of the cock in the fable my tattered bible caught my eye and i said to it you are of more value than all the diamonds in the world and i only uttered what i felt for a long time i mourned for ingram and thought nothing of the diamond three months more passed away and i had been eighteen months in the mines when some visitors made their appearanceno less than one of the principals of the jesuit order who had been sent by the king of portugal out to the brazils on a tour of inspection as it was called but in fact to examine into the state of affairs and the way in which the government revenue was collected there had lately been so much peculation on the part of the various officers that it was considered necessary to make minute inquiry a portuguese nobleman had been sent out the year before but had died shortly after his arrival and there was every reason to suppose that he had been poisoned that the inquiry might be got rid of now this jesuit priest had been sent out probably because a portuguese who thought little of poisoning and stabbing a layman would not dare to attempt the life of so sacred a character having full and extraordinary powers he had made a short inquiry into the different departments of government and had now come to the mines to ascertain how far the delivery of the diamonds at the treasury agreed with the collection at the mines for these mines had usually produced from a million to a million and a half of revenue the director was in a great fuss when he heard of this arrival at the further barrier although immediately announced to him he had scarcely an hour to prepare before the superior of the jesuits arrived with his suite consisting of about twenty people and fifty or sixty sumpter mules and ridinghorses we were all called out to receive him that is all the inspectors i went to attend the parade and awaited with much indifference but my feelings were soon changed when in this superior of the jesuits i beheld the catholic priest who had visited me in the tower and obtained my release the superior bowed to the director and to all around him and as he then looked at us all he recognized me immediately you here my son said he yes holy father replied i and i thank heaven that your arrival will enable me to prove my innocence pray how is this said he in a few words i narrated my story and you were thrown into prison without being permitted to defend yourself even so good father and sent to the mines to slave for life did you not make known your case to the director of the mines i did sir but he stated that he pitied me but could not help me is this the case mr director said the jesuit severely it is sir replied the director i have more than once reported cases of what appeared to me great hardship if what those condemned have said was true and have been told that i was too officious and that there could be no reversal of sentence i can prove to you sir by my journals and letterbooks how many cases i did formerly attempt to bring before the government but i at last received such replies which i can show you as will prove that there has been no fault of mine allow me to add holy father said i that the kindness and consideration of the director have been very great to all those under his charge and i think it very fortunate that such a person has been appointed to this situation as he has done every thing that has been in his power to alleviate the miseries of bondage i am glad to hear you say so mr elrington mr director this gentleman is a dear friend of mine let him instantly be released my orders are not to be disputed by the viceroy himself the superior then embraced me cordially and told me that i was free and should return with him to rio imagine my dear madam my joy and gratitude i fell on my knees before him and kissed his hands he gave me his blessing and raised me up where is your companion in misfortune said he alas sir he is dead replied i the superior shook his head and turned away saying i will search into this affair to the bottom depend upon it when i get back to rio he then desired the director to bring out his books and his own secretary to follow him leaving his servants in the courtyard with me and the other inspectors i received the congratulations of all parties present and as soon as possible i escaped from them and returned to my own room where i knelt and fervently thanked god for my unexpected deliverance and having paid my duty to the most high i sat down and fell into a most delightful reverie of anticipations in the evening after the superior had dismissed him the director sent for me and said allow me to return you many thanks for your kindness in speaking so favourably of me as you have done you have indeed been of service to me and i am most grateful i only did you justice director replied i yes but how few have justice done them in this world replied he the superior desired me to tell you that you are to live with the gentlemen of his suite of course you know it is not etiquette for him to admit any body to his table at all events you must allow me one pleasure which is to supply you with clothes proper to your appearance which i can easily do without inconvenience to myself the director then led me into his room and opened a wardrobe full of rich suits selected two of the handsomest with linen and every other article requisite a handsome sword and hat all of which he begged me to accept calling one of his servants he ordered him to put them into a valise and take them to my apartment is there any thing else that i can dospeak freely no director replied i i will accept these things from you as i cannot procure them here but when at rio i have means to obtain every thing that i require i return you many thanks i will send my servant to arrange your hair said he and i pray you to consider him at your disposal during the few days which the superior may remain here do you think it will take him so long yes replied the director i will tell you in confidence that he has brought with him the produce of the mines accounted for to the government at home and on his first inspection has found such defalcation from that which has been transmitted by me to rio that i expect there will be serious business they never imagined at rio that he would have undertaken such a tedious journey as he has done and they are in much alarm about it but i will leave you now that you may go home and make your toilet allow me to congratulate you with all my heart at the fortunate termination to your unjust bondage having again thanked him for his kindness i went to my lodging where i found his servant waiting for me and having had my hair arranged in a very tolerable manner and a little powder thrown in i put on one of the suits which fitted me pretty well requiring but a slight alteration from being rather full which the servant soon managed thus did i once more appear as a gentlemancontrary to all my expectationsand i then went and joined the suite of the superior who when they perceived the difference which dress made in my appearance congratulated me and warmly welcomed me to join the meal which had just been prepared for them on the following day the superior sent for me and ordering me to sit down requested that i would enter into full detail of what had happened to me since we last parted i did so and my narrative occupied the whole afternoon your life has been full of vicissitude replied he i trust however that your adventures are now over and that you will be restored to your friends the service you performed for our cause will never be forgotten i ventured to ask him how it was that he was now in the employ of the king of portugal he replied i am an irishman by birth and educated at st omers i was first sent to spain by the order when i was young and have since been employed all over the world in the advancement of our holy church country with our order is of no consequence we all serve the holy church and go wherever our services are required i would you were a catholic i could advance you beyond all your hopes but you are engaged to be married and that puts an end to the question as i thought the holy father must be tired with our long conference i rose and took my leave three days afterwards i was informed by him that he intended to set off on his return to rio and now i thought of the diamond which i resolved to carry with me i had no fear of being searched while under this excellent superiors protection and therefore i went to my lodging dug up the diamond and having washed it for the first time gave it the examination which it deserved it certainly was a stone of great value but of what value i could not exactly say from what i had learnt from the director who usually put his idea of the value upon any diamond of size which was brought to him i considered that l was the least which could be put upon the stone i took the precaution not to carry it loose in my pocket but to sew it within the lining of my clothes glad i was indeed when the orders to start the next morning were given out i found that a horse was appointed for me and having made up my valise not forgetting my tattered bible i went to my bed thanking god that this was to be the last night that i was to pass in the accursed sierra de espinhaco at daylight the superior took his leave mounted his mule and we set forth passing the guardhouse in the narrow road which i never expected to pass again before noon we were clear of the sierra and once more in the open country the attendants with a portion of the sumpter mules went in advance to prepare for the superiors arrival at the spot where we were to halt the weather was excessively sultry and the glare of the sun was very distressing at noon we stopped to take our dinner and the usual siesta after it the attendants in advance had raised a sort of palanquin for the superior and every thing was ready the superior alighted and sat down under the palanquin which protected him from the rays of the sun we all sat round at a respectful distance the heat was so intense that to relieve himself the superior had when he sat down thrown off his long black robe such as is worn by the priests of his order dinner was served up and we had a merry party notwithstanding the great heat after our meal we all shaded ourselves as well as we could and took our siesta for about two hours when the superior rose up and gave the signal for resuming our journey the horses were soon ready and the superiors mule being brought up to the palanquin he rose up and one of his attendants was lifting up his robe for the superior to resume it when my eye detected the head of a snake just showing itself out of the sidepocket of the robe in which he carried his breviary and his handkerchief i knew the snake well for we often found them in the sierra de espinhaco and some two or three of the slaves had lost their lives by their bite which was so fatal that they died in less than five minutes afterwards the superior had his handkerchief in his hand and would have undoubtedly put it in his pocket before he mounted his mule and if so would certainly have been bitten and lost his life as the superior was fastening his robe at the throat i darted forward seized it threw it on the ground and commenced stamping upon it with all my force much to the surprise of the whole party some of them thought me mad and others who were horrified at such treatment of the holy garment called out heretico maldetto which madam you must know means accursed heretic having felt the snake which is very short but very thick in the body with a head like a toad several times moving under my feet and then moving no more i then stepped off the garment and turning it over i lifted it up by the skirt so that the dead snake rolled out of the pocket i thank the god whom we all worship and the son of god who died for us all whether catholic or heretic cried i that i have been the means of preserving our holy father i had knelt down as i thus prayed and the superior perceiving the danger that he had been in did the same and silently returned his thanks at his example all the rest went down on their knees yes said the superior would to god that instead of reviling each other all denominations of christians would join in thus bruising the head of the serpent which seeks our spiritual death he then rose and said my son i thank thee for the kind service thou hast performed i then explained to the superior the deadly nature of the animal and my fear that he would have put his handkerchief in the pocket of his robe before i had time to prevent him and begged him to excuse my seeming abruptness there needs no apology for saving a mans life replied he smilingcome let us go forward i hardly need say that we were not quite so long in returning to rio as we were in going to the mines we accomplished our journey without using extreme haste in about half of the time on our arrival we took up our quarters at a magnificent palace which had been appropriated to the superior during his residence at rio and i found myself sumptuously lodged for some days during which the superior had frequent interviews with the viceroy i did not see him but one day i was summoned to his pretence my son said he i have lost no time in investigating your affair and i find that all you have said is quite correct to the disgrace of the government here and the manner in which justice is administered it appears that this man olivarez on his arrival went to the secretary of the judge of that court in which such offences are tried and stated that he had two english mutineers on board who had attempted to take the vessel and wounded several of his men dangerously that he wished of course to deliver them up to justice but that the immediate departure of his vessel would be prevented by so doing as his crew would be required as evidence that the delay would be very disadvantageous and he inquired whether it could not be managed that these men might be punished without the appearance of himself and his men as he would pay a good sum rather than be detained the secretary perfectly understood the trick and upon the receipt of five hundred cruzados he accepted the deposition of olivarez sworn to by him as sufficient evidence and you were consigned to the mines upon this deposition by a warrant from the judge we have had some trouble to obtain all the facts but the question has been severely applied and has elicited them now first as to the judge and his secretary they have gone to the gaol and will take your place in the mines for life next as to olivarez it appears that on his arrival he sold his cargo of slaves very advantageously that having received the money he gave a small portion to each of his men and that they went on shore and like all english seamen were soon in a state of intoxication that olivarez took such steps with the police as to have them all thrown into prison when in that state and on the following morning he went to them persuaded them that they had committed themselves during their intoxication and that it required a large sum to free them this he pretended to have paid for them and having purchased a cargo for his voyage he got them all on board and again ran for the coast of africa in three months he returned with another cargo which he sold he had found out his mother and now he expended the money he had made in purchasing a good property about seven miles from rio where he placed his mother and some slaves to take care of it and cultivate it he contrived to defraud his crew as much as he could and before he went to the coast again he married an amiable young person the daughter of a neighbour he made a third and a fourth voyage with equal success but on the third voyage he contrived to get rid of a portion of his english crew who were now becoming troublesome by taking some portuguese sailors out with him and leaving the english on the coast as if by mistake previous to the fourth voyage it appears that he satisfied the remainder of the english crew by producing accounts and sharing out to them several hundred dollars previous to their departure for the coast he made a slight addition to his portuguese sailors not putting too many on board to avoid suspicion and when on the coast of africa a portion of the english crew died whether by poison or not is not known and the others he put on shore seizing all their property and the dollars with which he had satisfied them on his return from his fourth voyage having now nothing to fear from the partners in his atrocious deed having realized a large sum he determined to remain on shore altogether and live on his property with his mother and wife he did so and sent out the schooner under a portuguese captain and crew to be employed for him as owner in the slave traffic and she has made two voyages since and is expected back again every day now my son retribution has fallen heavily upon this bad man had he been discovered and punished when he first did the deed it would have been as nothing compared to what it has been now he then had no propertyno tiesin fact nothing or little to regret but now with a wife and child with a valuable property living in independence and increasing that wealth dailynow when he is at the very summit of his ambition restored to his own country respected and considered as being a man of wealth he has been seized thrown into a dungeon put to the question and now lies in a state of misery awaiting the sentence of death which has been pronounced against him neither has he the consolation of knowing that he leaves those whom he loves in a state of affluence for all his property having been gained by making use of your property necessarily is your property and not his and it has been confiscated accordingly for your use and benefit as soon as every thing is collected it will be paid into your hands thus my son i have at last attained justice for you i was as you may imagine my dear madam profuse in my acknowledgments but he stopped me saying i was sent here to see that justice was done to every body if i possibly couldno easy task when all are amassing money not caring how they obtain it but surely if any one has peculiar claims upon me it is you the superior then asked me many questions relative to my parentage and i did not conceal any thing from him i told who i was and why at an early age i had left my fathers house he asked me many questions and after about two hours conversation he dismissed me saying you may always depend upon my protection and gratitude before he dismissed me he told me that he was about to send a despatchboat to lisbon and as i might wish to inform my friends of my safety if i would write letters he would insure their being safely delivered to my friends in england i gladly availed myself of this offer and indeed would have begged a passage for myself if it had not been that i considered olivarezs money to be the property of mr trevannion and was determined to remit it to him before i left rio this detained me about six weeks longer during which interval olivarez had suffered the penalty due to his crimes having been strangled in the marketplace the money received was cruzados and not knowing how to dispose of it i applied to the superior who gave me orders for it in duplicates upon the treasury at lisbon one of which i had very soon an opportunity of sending home to mr trevannion with a duplicate of my first letter and a second to him and amy stating my intention of returning as soon as possible but this was by a portuguese frigate which made a very circuitous route home and i did not choose to go by that conveyance as her detention at the different ports was so uncertain at last i became very impatient for my departure and anxiously awaited the sailing of some vessel to any port of europe i had reserved cruzados for my own expenses which i considered as quite sufficient but they were gradually wasting away for i was everywhere received and in the best company of rio at last one day the superior sent for me and told me that he was about to send an adviceboat to lisbon and i might take a passage if i wished that it was a very small one but a very fast sailer i thanked him heartily accepted the proposal and went to my room to pack up my clothes in the afternoon the captain of the xebeque called upon me and told me that he would start on the following morning if i would be ready i replied that i should be put some dollars into his hands requesting that he would procure for me any thing that he considered would be necessary and agreeable and if the sum i had given him was not enough i would repay him the remainder as soon as we were out of harbour i took my leave of the superior who parted with me with many protestations of regard on his side and tears of gratitude on mine and early the next morning i was on board of the xebeque in light winds she was extremely fast but she certainly was too small to cross the atlantic ocean nevertheless as the captain said she had crossed it several times and he hoped that she often would again the passage however that he usually made was to run up to the northward of the antilles and then cross over making the bahama isles and from thence taking a fresh departure for lisbon our crew consisted of only eight men besides the captain but as the vessel was not more than thirty tons they were sufficient we made a good run until we were in about twentyfour degrees of north latitude when as we stretched to the eastward to cross the atlantic we met with a most violent gale which lasted several days and i fully expected every hour that the vessel would go down buried as she was by the heavy sea at last we had no chance but to scud before the wind which we did for two days before a raging and following sea that appeared determined upon our destruction on the second night as i was on deck watching the breaking and tossing of the billows and the swift career of the little bark which enabled her to avoid them the water suddenly appeared of one white foam and as we rose upon the next sea we were hurled along on its crest reeling on the foam until it had passed us and then we struck heavily upon a rock fortunately it was a soft coral rock or we had all perished the next wave lifted us up again and threw us further on and on its receding the little xebeque laid high and dry and careened over on her bilge the waters rose and fell and roared and foamed about us but they lifted us no more neither did they wash us off the decks as we clung to the rigging for the stout short mast upon which the lateen sail was hoisted had not been carried away we remained where we were till morning every one holding on and not communicating with each other as the night wore away so did the gale decrease and the sea subside the waters now gradually left us at intervals when the waves receded we could walk on shore but we remained on the vessel till noon by which time we found our vessel high and dry having been carried over a coral reef which appeared to extend one or two miles into the offing the men who had been much buffeted by the waves and who were exhausted by clinging so long to the rigging now that they found themselves safe and were warmed by the heat of the sun rallied and began to move about we had a long consultation as to how we should act there was no chance of getting the vessel off again and we did not exactly know where we were but the captain and i agreed that it must be upon one of the small islands of the bahama group that we had been cast away and our conjecture was right after some consultation the captain and i called the men together and told them that it was very probable that we might be some time before we could find the means of getting off the island and that therefore we must all do our best that we would land and erect a tent with the sails and obtain provisions after that we would consider the vessel and her stores as public property but that every mans private property should be secured to him as if we were still on board of the xebeque that the captain should retain the command as before and his orders should be obeyed by every body as long as they were reasonable and just the men who were wellbehaved quiet fellowsand not like english seamen given to liquorreadily agreed and it was arranged that the following morning we should commence our labours this was a sad blow to me who was anticipating a speedy meeting with amy i knew how doubtful was the chance of our being seen by any vessel and that i must remain here for months if not longerbut i had been schooled and could now say with fervency thy will oh lord and not mine be done we remained on board of the vessel that night and the next morning the gale had ceased and the waters to our astonishment had receded so as to leave us at least sixty yards from the sea which was now almost calm we first took a survey of the island to ascertain if there was any water and as the island was not more than two miles in circumference this did not take us long fortunately in the centre we found a deep hole sunk in the soft coral rock by some other people who had been wrecked here and in the hole the water was although a little brackish somewhat palatable it evidently was the seawater filtered through the soft rock the whole of the island was surrounded with coral reefs with lanes of deep water running between them and the fish were sporting in thousands after the storm but there was not a tree or vestige of vegetation upon the whole island we soon however discovered that it was frequented by turtle for we found some eggs freshburied in the sand having made this survey we then went back to the vessel and with spars and sails rigged a tent upon the highest point of the island which might be ten or fifteen feet above the level of the sea the tent was large enough to hold fifty men if required so we brought our bedding and chests and all our cooking apparatus on shore made a fireplace outside the tent with the little cabouse we had on board of the vessel sent a man to obtain water from the hole and put on some meat to boil for our dinners in the evening we all went out to turn turtle and succeeded in turning three when we decided that we would not capture any more until we had made a turtlepond to put them in for we had not more than two months provisions on board of the vessel and did not know how long we might be detained the men behaved very well and indeed seemed determined to make themselves as comfortable as they could under existing circumstances the next day we put out some lines in deep water and caught several large fish and then we went to find a proper spot for a turtlepond we selected a hole in the reef which we thought would answer as we had only one end of it to fill up and we commenced breaking away the rock with crowbars and worked hard the whole of the day some breaking and others carrying the masses broken off by degrees they rose to the surface of the water and in two days more we calculated that the pond would be ready to receive the turtle we had killed one turtle in the morning and we now lived upon it altogether as we wished to save our salt provisions the captain and i had many consultations as to what we should do and what attempts we should make to get off from this spot build a boat we could not as we had not a carpenter among us or the means of making the ironwork necessary we had some tools such as are usually used on board of vessels and several pounds of large nails but none fit for boatbuilding i proposed that we should examine the bottom of the xebeque and see what damage was done to it we did so and found that the garboard streak was broken and two of her timbers but they were easy to repair in every other respect she was sound i then proposed that we should cut down the xebeque to a large boat which we could easily do by ripping off her planks and decks and sawing down her timbers to the height we required it would be a heavy boat it was true but we should be able to launch her with rollers and the draught of water would be so small that we could get her over the reefs which we could not possibly do the xebeque the captain approved of the idea and we agreed that as soon as the turtlepond was finished we would make the attempt in two days more we had finished the pond and had turned thirty turtle which we put into it the men now that they found that they had plenty to eat began to show signs of laziness and did not very readily commence the work upon the xebeque they ate and slept ate and slept again on the mattresses spread in the tent at times they would fish but it was with difficulty that the captain and i could persuade them to work and if they did work half an hour they then threw down their axes and crowbars and went back to the tent they had plenty of tobacco and they smoked half the day ate turtle and then slept again nevertheless as the captain and i worked hard the work progressed in about ten days after we began the work we had ripped off her decks and her sideplanks as low as we thought right and we were now sawing through the timbers when the quiet of our party was disturbed by what may be considered a very strange quarrel one of the men asserted in conversation that st antony was born in padua one or two of the other seamen denied it and this difference of opinion which at first was a mere nothing from sullenness i presume and something being required to excite them in the course of a day or two ended in a serious feud the paduans terming the antipaduans heretics and jews the epithet of jew was what irritated so much and the parties being exactly even four on each side on the third day after an angry altercation they all rushed out of the tent to decide the affair with their knives the conflict was very fierce and took place when the captain and i were at the xebeque and before we could separate them four of them had fallen two were killed and the other two badly wounded it may appear ridiculous that people should take each others lives for such a trifle but after all nations declare war against each other and thousands are killed on both sides for causes almost as slight with great difficulty we separated the remaining combatants and such was their rage and excitement that every now and then they would attempt to break from us and attack each other again but at last we disarmed them this was a sad business and it was melancholy to think that companions in misfortune should take each others lives instead of feeling grateful to the almighty for their preservation we buried the two men who had fallen and dressed the wounds of the hurt but after this quarrel the four others came to their work and continued steady at it we had now removed the upper portion of the xebeque and commenced fixing beams and carlines on the lower part so as to make a decked boat of it and in another week we had decked her over but we had a great deal more to do we had to reduce the mast and yard to a proper size to alter the sail and rigging to make a small rudder and rollers to launch her upon all this with our reduced force occupied us another month for the two wounded men although recovering could but just crawl about we turned many more turtle at night that we might have a sufficient supply we now looked out for a channel of deep water through the reef to get our boat out and made one out to a certain extent but could not survey further without getting off the reef and the sharks were so numerous that we dared not venture however we took it for granted as we had found deep water in shore that we should be sure to do so in the offing and we now got our boat upon the rollers which we had made by digging away the sand from beneath her and a trench to the waters edge we had been two months on the island when all was ready for launching anxious as i was to return to england i cannot say that i was unhappy when on this island there was always a fine seabreeze which cooled the air and enabled us to work without exhaustion with the exception of the unfortunate quarrel i have referred to every thing went on quietly after work was over i resorted as usual to my bible and read for hours and this calmed and allayed any impatient feelings which might at times arise i felt that i had great cause to be grateful to the almighty for preserving me as he had done and that it would be folly and wickedness on my part to repine because i could not obtain all that i wished i waited therefore for his own good time without murmuring and in full confidence that all was for the best at last we contrived to get our boat into the water and she floated much lighter than we thought she would have done considering the weight of wood that was in her as soon as she was anchored about ten feet from the beach we made a gangway to her with planks and commenced getting all our salt provisions water and stores which we had selected as most necessary on board of her the stowage of these occupied us two days we then got the yard up and bent the sail and having fitted oars we determined that the next day we would embark as she still swam light we got on board of her as many turtle as we could conveniently carry and then for the last time went onshore to sleep as there was no room for our chests it was agreed that we each should have a bundle on board selecting those things which we most required and most valued this proposal which was made by the captain put me in mind of the diamond which had scarcely once entered my thoughts since i had been on the island when i took it out of my chest i thought that i might as well make it more convenient to carry as there was no saying what might be the result of our new expedition so when the other men were all busy about their own effects or asleep i first took the precaution to roll it up in a covering of pitch so that if taken from me or lost it might not be known to be a diamond and then i sewed it up in a piece of leather which i cut from an old glove putting a strong leather lanyard to it so that i might wear it round my neck having done this without any one taking notice and having nothing else to do i took some fine twine and worked it over like the mousing of a stay in a way peculiar to sailors so that when finished it was very much in the shape of a miniature buoy to an anchor and reminded me of a fendoff or fender such as they use to prevent any injury to the sides of a vessel when coming in contact with another having finished my work i put the leather lanyard round my neck inside of my shirt so that my diamond was concealed from sight i then put up my remaining piecesofeightwhich were nearly the best of my clothes for during my stay at rio i had very much increased my stock and i hardly need say that the old bible was not left behind it was a beautiful calm morning when we embarked and lifting the anchor took to our oars and pulled out through the deep channel the captain standing at the bow and conning us through while i took the helm the boat pulled well and steered well we had yet to see what she could do under canvas after a pull of two hours we were clear of the reef and out in the open sea we then laid in the oars and commenced our preparations for hoisting the sail to a breeze which then blew from the southward when all was ready the men hoisted the sail but in so doing a rope being foul as i was attempting to clear it i was tripped up and fell with my right knee on a spike which entered deep putting me to excruciating pain and laming me completely i was obliged to sit down abaft for i nearly fainted away in the mean time the sail was set and the boat stood well up to it she proved to be very stiff under canvas which was a source of great congratulation my knee became so painful and stiff that i could not move it i took one of my shirts out of my bundle tore it up into bandages and put them on we had resolved to attempt to make new providence the largest of the bahama group where we knew that there was a town called nassau and from whence we hoped to obtain some conveyance to europe but we knew nothing of the port or the inhabitants or what trade was carried on with them for several hours our little bark went gaily over the water but towards nightfall the wind shifted and the weather looked threatening we hardly knew how to steer as we did not know the position of the island which we had left and now the wind heading us we hauled up on the larboard tack with our head to the northward and eastward as the sun went down the wind increased and the sea ran fast our boat behaved well till it began to blow very hard and then it took in so much water that we were forced to bale we had reefed our sail and made every thing as snug as we could but the sea rising fast and the boat taking in more water we considered it prudent to lighten her which we did by throwing overboard all the turtle this we did without regret as we were tired of eating them for so long a while the day broke and there appeared every sign of bad weather and the waves now tossed and foamed too much for such a small craft as we were in about noon we saw a vessel on a wind to leeward of us which was a source of great delight to us all and we bore down to her we soon made her out to be an hermaphrodite brig under her closereefed topsails and trysails we ran under her counter and hailed we perceived several men standing abaft and apparently they suspected us for a rover for they had muskets and other weapons in their hands we told them that we had been shipwrecked and the boat was sinking in the gale and then we rounded to under her lee there we remained for four or five hours during which the wind and the sea went down very fast and the boat no longer took in water but we had been all too much alarmed with the danger in which we had been to like to continue our voyage in her and as we thought that we could now go alongside with safety we hailed again and asked permission after some parleying they threw us a rope which we made fast to the boat and lowered our sail keeping off on a broad sheer as there still was a great deal of sea they then entered into conversation with us i told them all that had happened and inquired where the brig was bound to they replied to james town virginia i asked them if they could give us a passage there as we were afraid to proceed in our boat or if not would they see us safe into new providence the captain then came forward he was a very dark man dark as a mulatto with keen small eyes and a hooked nose i never beheld a more deformed and repulsive countenance he said that he could not go to new providence as it was out of his way and that we might easily get there ourselves if we thought proper i replied that the boat was not sufficiently large and seaworthy and that we had already nearly gone down and if another gale should come on we certainly should founder and again requested that he would take us on board have you any money to pay for your passage inquired he why said i common charity and the feelings of a seaman towards sailors in distress should be sufficient to induce you to take us on board and not leave us to perish but if you require money i replied we have more than sufficient to satisfy you how much screamed out a lad of about fourteen who was the very image of the captain in miniature i did not reply to this question and the captain then said what do you propose to do with the boat let her go adrift to be sure replied i what have you got on board of her said he i enumerated as well as i could recollect the provisions and stores that we had well replied he i will wait till it is a little smoother and then we will clear the boat and take you on board he then left the gangway where he had been standing and we continued to be towed by the brig i do not like that fellow said i to the portuguese captain he appears or pretends to take us for pirates but he is more like a pirate himself he looks like the devil himself replied the captain and to ask people in our condition to pay for their passage he is a monster however we all have a few doubloons thank heaven about an hour afterwards it being much more moderate the captain of the brig told us to sheer alongside and that four of us might come out and the others remain in the boat till she was cleared i think you had better go said i to the captain for with so much motion i never shall be able to get up the side with my bad knee we then sheered the boat alongside and the captain and three of our men got on board but not without difficulty i saw them go aft and down below with the captain of the brig but i never saw them on deck again much to my surprise although we were more than half an hour before they again hailed us and told us to come alongside again during this halfhour my mind misgave me sadly that all was not right from not seeing the portuguese captain or either of the three men and i took it into my head that the vessel was a pirate and i knew if such was the case we should instantly be rifled if not murdered i took the precaution of taking off the bandage from my knee and having removed the diamond from my neck i put it under my ham in the cavity which held it with ease and then put the bandage on again over it as i thought they would hardly take a bandage off a bad knee to see if there was any thing concealed beneath it it was with difficulty that i contrived to get on board the brig and as soon as i had gained the deck i was ordered to go down into the cabin as i went aft i looked round for the portuguese captain and the men but could not see them i contrived with difficulty to get down into the cabin and as soon as i was there i was seized by the arms and held fast by two of the men while others bound me with seizings as the captain was looking on i inquired into the cause of this outrage he replied that we were a parcel of rascally pirates who would have taken his vessel if he had not been too deep for us i told him it was false and that i could easily prove it as we still had the despatches on board with which we had been charged and that i could show full proof that i was the same person that i stated myself to be that i very much feared that we had fallen into the hands of pirates ourselves but that i would have justice done as soon as we arrived at james town without he intended to murder us all before we arrived his answer was that he was too old a bird to be caught with such chaff and that he would secure us and deliver us up to the authorities as soon as he arrived i replied in great anger that he would then be convinced of his error if it was an error on his part that his conduct was infamous and he looked like a scoundrel and i believed him to be one you call me a scoundrel do you said he levelling a pistol at my head you call us scoundrels do you cried the boy i have made mention of and who was evidently the son of the captain taking up another pistol in his hand shall i shoot him father no peleg not yet we will pay them all when we get in take him away and put him in irons with the rest said the captain and i was immediately dragged forward between decks through a door in the bulkheads where i found the portuguese captain and three seamen already in irons this is pretty treatment said he to me yes it is indeed replied i but i will make him smart for it when we arrive shall we ever arrive said the portuguese captain looking at me and compressing his lips i say my man said i to the seaman who stood over us with a pistol and a cutlass who are you and what are you tell us the truth are you pirates i never was yet replied he nor do i mean to be but our skipper says that you are and that he knew you as soon as you came alongside thats all i can say about it why if we are pirates as he says and he recognizes us he must have been in pirates company that is clear well he may have been for all i know replied the man i dont consider him any very great things but he is our captain and we must obey orders the man now brought forward the other three men who had been left in the boat they told us that the boat had been cleared all the provisions stores sails c had been taken out of hera proof that she had been gutted and then cut adriftthat all our bundles were down in the captains cabin and that the illlooking urchin his son had overhauled them one after another and handed to his father all the money that he had found that they had been searched very carefully and that they had heard the captain say that we were all to be sent up one by one and searched in the same mannerand so it proved i was first taken aft to have my pockets rummaged by the little villain and as soon as i had been led forward and again put into irons the portuguese captain and three other seamen were sent for and treated in the same way we inquired of the men what money they had in their bundles and about their persons they had each man four doubloons at rio for wages and the captain had about forty doubloons i had five hundred piecesofeight so that altogether we had been robbed to the tune of about four hundred pounds sterling independent of our clothes which were of some value to us that is mine were at all events the seamen who guarded us and who relieved each other every watch were not at all surly or illnatured i asked one of them during the night watch whether he thought the captain would take our lives no said he we will not allow that you may be pirates as he says although we do not think you are but if pirates you shall have fair play that we have all made up our minds to no hanging first and trying afterwards i had a long conversation with this man who appeared very much inclined to be sociable he told me that the vessel was named the transcendant that she sailed from virginia to the west indies and that sometimes she went to england that the captain of her was also the owner but where he came from or what he was they did not know except that he was a virginianthey believed so for that he had a tobacco estate there which was carried on by his eldest son he called the captain a stingy miserly fellow who would sacrifice any mans life to save a shilling and that there were odd stories about him at james town i was well satisfied with my conversation with this man as it assured me that our lives would not be taken and i had no fear of the result upon my arrival at james town for as i have mentioned before mr trevannion had vessels which sailed to that port and i well recollected the names of the parties to whom the vessel and cargo were consigned on the following day the captain of the brig followed by his illfavoured son came forward and looked at us as we sat in irons upon which i addressed him you have put me in irons sir when i threw myself upon your protection you have robbed us of our money to the amount of nearly l and you detain our other property i now again desire that i may be released i offered to convince you that i was a person of property but you refused to listen to me now sir i will tell you that i am a partner in the house of trevannion at liverpool and that we have vessels that trade between james town and that port our vessels are consigned to messrs fairbrother and wilcocks of james town and on my arrival i will soon prove that to you and also not only make you surrender the property you have robbed us of but i will make you smart pretty handsomely for your treatment of us that you may depend upon fairbrother and wilcocks muttered he confound the fellow oh said he turning to me you got the name of that firm from some ship you have plundered and sunk i suppose no no that wont do old birds are not to be caught with chaff i believe you to have been a pirate yourself if you are not one now replied i at all events you are a thief and a paltry villainbut our time will come yes it will said the captain of the xebeque and remember you scoundrel if you can escape and buy off justice you shall not escape seven portuguese knives mind you that no no cried the portuguese sailors stop till we are on shore and then come on shore if you dare i say father said young hopeful this looks like mischief better hang them i reckon than to be stuck like pigs they look as if theyd do it dont they i shall never forget the diabolical expression of the captain of the brig after the portuguese sailors had done speaking he had a pistol at his belt which he drew out thats right shoot em father dead men tell no tales as you have always said no no said the seaman who was on guard motioning them back with his cutlass there will be no shooting nor hanging either we are all sworn to that if so be they be pirates theres the law of the country to condemn them and if they be not pirates why then thats another story the captain looked at the seaman as if he could have shot him if he dared then turned round hastily and went back to the cabin followed by his worthy offspring for seven days we remained in irons when we heard land announced by the sailors on deck and the brigs head was put towards it at night she was hove to and the next morning again stood in and we perceived that we were in smooth water towards night the anchor was let go and we asked the guard if we had arrived at james town he replied no but we were in a river on the coast but he did not know what river it was nor did any of the crew nor could they tell why the captain had anchored there but they had seen several canoes with indians cross the river but that there appeared to be no white settlement that they could discover the mystery was however cleared up on the following morning a small boat which could barely hold eight people was lowered from the stern and hauled up alongside we were taken up one by one the scoundrel of a captain having first stripped each of us to our trowsers not even allowing us a shirt we were ordered to get into the boat as soon as we were all in and our weight brought the boat down to her gunnel two oars were handed to us and then the captain of the brig said now you rascally pirates i might have hanged you all and i would have done so for i know you well i recollect your faces when you plundered the eliza when i was off porto rico but if i put you in prison at james town i shall have to wait two or three months until the court sits and i cannot be detained for such scoundrels as you so now you may pull on shore and get on how you can shove off directly or ill put a bullet through your brains hold fast cried i and let him fire if he dares you men belonging to the transcendant i call you to witness this treatment your captain has robbed us of a large sum of money and now turns us adrift so as to compel us to land among savages who may kill us immediately i appeal to you will you permit this cruelty and injustice if you are english i conceive you will not there was some talk and expostulation with the captain of the brig in consequence of what i said but while it was going on the captains son leaned over the side and with his knife cut the painter or rope which held the boat and as the tide was running on very strong in less than half a minute we were a long way astern of the brig and drifting fast up the river we got out our oars and attempted to pull for the brig for we knew that the seamen were taking our parts but it was in vain the tide ran several miles an hour and in another minute or two with all our exertions we were nearly a quarter of a mile astern of her and the boat was so loaded that we hardly dared move lest we should upset it we had therefore no option but to go on shore and take our chance but when the men were pulling round for the shore on reflection i thought that we had better not land so soon as the sailors had told us that they had seen the indians in their canoes i therefore recommended that we should allow the boat to drift up the river with the tide and then drift down again when the tide turned remaining in the middle of the stream till it was dark when we would land and make our way into the woods my advice was followed we sat still in the boat just keeping her head to the stream with the oars and being without our shirts the sun scorching and blistering our backs till past noon during which time we must have drifted nearly twenty miles up the river which was as broad as the arm of a sea at the entrance then the tide turned and we drifted back again till it was dusk when it was again slack water all this while we kept a sharp lookout to see if we could perceive any indians but not one was to be seen i now proposed that we should take our oars and pull out of the river as if we had only gone up on a survey for the brig had got under weigh and had anchored for want of wind about four miles off and the indians if there were any would suppose that we were returning to the ship we did so and pulled till it was dark and were within two miles of the brig where the floodtide again made strong when we turned the boats head up the river and pulled with the oars to get up as far as we could before we landed this we did suffering much from hunger and thirst as well as being confined so long in one position as my knee was quite well i now took off the bandage and hung my diamond round my neck as before i could not help feeling a satisfaction when i thought that the thief of a captain little imagined what a mine of wealth he was losing when he turned me adrift it was about midnight when the tide ceased to flow and we then agreed to land and the question then was whether we should separate or keep together after some discussion we agreed to separate in twos and the portuguese captain and i agreed to keep each other company we first pushed the boat into the stream that she might drift away and then shaking each other by the hand and bidding adieu we all started in different directions for some time the captain and i threaded the woods in silence when we were stopped by a stream of deep water with such high banks that in the dark we did not know how to cross it we walked by the side of it for some time to discover a passage and in so doing we at last found ourselves again on the banks of the river and our boat lying close to us having grounded not far from where we had shoved her off we tasted the water in the creek and found it quite fresh we had several times tried it on the river and found it quite salt from the tide running in we drank plentifully and sat down to recover ourselves for although we had not walked more than half an hour the pushing through the brushwood was very fatiguing i think said i that this boat will certainly betray us and would it not be better to take possession of it again it will hold two comfortably and i think we shall get on as well if not better in a boat than in the woods without compass and without guide i agree with you said the captain but what shall we do let us retrace our steps let us pull again with the ebbtide for the mouth of the river and then coast it along shore we may arrive at some settlement if we do not starve by the way i agree with you he said it will be the best plan we must conceal ourselves in the day and coast along at night we waded into the river got into the boat and again pulled out the boat being light now pulled well and we made good speed and at daylight we were clear of the river and close to a small island near the mouth of it upon this we agreed to land to try if we could procure food for we were much exhausted and also to conceal ourselves from the natives we ran our little boat on shore and concealed her among some bushes which grew down at the waters edge we looked well round but could see nothing and we then walked out in search of food we found some wild plums which we eagerly devoured and going down again to the beach where there were some rocks we found shellfish of which we broke the shells between two stones and made a meal of after our hunger was satisfied we lay down under the shelter of the boat and fell fast asleep we were so tired that we did not wake up till it was nearly dark when we agreed to start again and pull along the coast to the northward we were just launching our boat when we perceived a canoe about three miles off steering for the mouth of the river to the island this stopped us and we remained in our hidingplace the canoe approached steering directly for the spot where we lay concealed and we imagined that they had discovered us such however proved not to be the case for they ran on shore about fifty yards from us and hauling up the canoe they got out and walked away on land there were four men but it was now too dark to distinguish any more we remained quiet for a quarter of an hour when i proposed that we should embark have you ever managed a canoe said the portuguese captain to me i have been in one in africa very often i said but they are dugouts as we call them so have i and i do not think there is so much difference between them and these canoes can you paddle yes i replied so can i he said now observe the best thing we can do is to take possession of that canoe and then we shall get on better for our boat will always attract notice whereas a canoe will not besides it will prevent these indians if they are come to look for us which i suspect they have from following us i think you are right i said but how shall we manage in this way you shall shove off our boat and walk by its side dragging it up to where the canoe lies i will go to the canoe launch it and then we will make off with both till we are too far out to be taken then when we have got into the canoe we will turn our boat adrift i agreed to the proposals we launched our boat very quietly and i walked in the water up to my knees drawing it after me till i arrived opposite to the canoe the portuguese crept on his hands and knees till he had gained the canoe pushed her off and joined me we made her fast to the towrope of our own boat then got into the boat and pulled away from the island we had not gained more than a hundred yards when the whiz of an arrow met our ears the indians had discovered us it was evident two or three more arrows came flying by us but we had now got well out and they fell harmless we continued to pull till we were half a mile from the island and then we laid on our oars the stars shone bright there was a young moon so as to enable us to see pretty well we found the paddles of the canoe lying on the crosspieces we had nothing to take from the boat but our towrope and the two small oars these we put into the canoe and then getting in ourselves we let the boat go adrift we put her head to the northward between the island and the main and paddled away as fast as we could the captain was a much better hand than i was and he therefore took the office of steersman the water was as smooth as glass and we made rapid progress and did not discontinue our exertions except now and then resting for a few moments till the morning dawned when we could hardly distinguish the island we had left and found ourselves about five miles from the mainland we had now time to examine the contents of the canoe and had much reason to be gratified with our acquisition it had three bearskins at the bottom several pounds of yams cooked and uncooked two calabashes full of water bows and arrows three spears a tomahawk three fishinglines and hooks and some little gourds full of black white and red paint and what we prized more than all some flints and a large rusty nail with rotten wood to serve as tinder we are fortunate said the captain now before we pull in for the shore we must paint ourselves like indians at all events you must black yourself as you have no shirt and i must do the same although i do not require it so much as you do let us have something to eat and drink first replied i and we will proceed to our toilet afterwards chapter xvii my adventures with the indians with what happened to the portuguese captain my companion having eaten some venison and drunk out of the calabash the captain painted me black with here and there a line of red and white on the face and shoulders i performed the same duty towards him and we then resumed our paddles and pushed in a slanting direction for the shore the tide now ran down against us and we could hardly stem it and finding ourselves opposite a beach clear of trees for a quarter of a mile we agreed to run on shore to look for a large stone we soon found one which answered our purpose and paddling off again to three or four hundred yards we made the stone fast to the bowrope of our boat and anchored the canoe with it having succeeded in this we got out the fishinglines and with a piece of raw meat as a bait we soon had several fish in the canoe after which we put on no more baits but pretended to fish till the tide slacked when we lifted our anchor and recommenced our paddling to the northward at night we landed on a rock close to the beach having well reconnoitred before it was dark to see if there were any canoes or indians to be seen on the shore and thus we continued for five days during which we passed the mouths of one or two rivers and had gained as we supposed more than miles along the coast but how much to the northward we could not tell as we followed the windings of the shore we were twice obliged to land to obtain water but we always did so in the daytime having taken the precaution to black the whole of our bodies and take off our trowsers before we landed our deers flesh was all gone and we continued to live on fish cooking as much as we could at one time the collecting firewood was the great risk which we ran for we were then obliged to land where there was wood it was on the sixth day that we were first in danger as we rounded a point we fell in with another canoe with six or seven people in it they were not more than yards off when we first saw them the indians stood up in the canoe looked at us very earnestly and then perceiving that we were not of their tribe i presume pulled towards us we immediately turned and pulled away they had been fishing and two of them were pulling up the lines while the others paddled which gave us a little advantage but they had three paddles and we had only two they shouted and paddled with all their might but they gained little as they were seven in the canoe five men and two women and deep in consequence as they gained slowly upon us notwithstanding all our exertions the portuguese said to me they have no weapons in the boat i should think if they had they would use them for we are within bowshot can you use a bow and arrow i could once replied i use it very fairly for when i was captive with whyna she would often practise the bow and arrow with me and i became somewhat expert before i left her well then said he let me paddle on and do you put an arrow in the bow and threaten them at all events i did so and stood up taking aim as if about to shoot at which they ceased paddling and after talking a little they turned the head of their canoe round and made for the shore we proceeded as may be imagined with all diligence i laid down my bow and arrows and resumed my paddle and in an hour we could no longer see our late pursuers we continued our voyage and for three days met with no further adventures when about noon on the fourth day the sky became overcast and there was every prospect of rough weather before night the wind and sea rose and it was no longer possible for us to keep along the coast which already was covered with breakers we had therefore no remedy but to make for the shore and haul up the canoe for we could not perceive any inlet which might shelter us it was quite dark when we dashed the canoe through the breakers and landed we hauled her up some distance as there was every appearance of worse weather and sheltered ourselves under the lee of a high rock the wind now blew fiercely and rain descended in torrents we tried to light a fire to warm ourselves but could not succeed so we lay down on one bearskin and covered ourselves with the others waiting impatiently for daylight when the day dawned the weather was worse than ever we now looked out for a better place of concealment for ourselves and our canoe and found one at about fifty yards distance between two high rocks there was a narrow cleft or passage which was large enough for us and for the canoe and this hid us both from the storm and from the sea into this cleft we hauled our canoe and withdrew ourselves making a meal off some fish we roasted on the embers we remained there for two days when the weather moderated but the sea was still too rough for us to launch the canoe so we decided upon remaining one day more although our provisions were all gone and our calabashes quite empty on the third day to our great surprise and alarm we heard the report of a musket not far from us from this we knew that we could not be very far from the english settlements for it was only the indians near to the settlements who had obtained muskets but whether it was an indian or a white man who fired we could not of course tell i recollected that in the last advices we had had from james town our factors had stated that there was a cruel war carried on between the indians and the settlers and that the indians had ravaged the plantations but that was two years ago and how it might be now it was impossible to tell a second report of a musket still nearer induced me to creep along by the side of the rock and look out to see if any one was near to my great alarm i perceived five indians with muskets not a hundred yards off i drew back as i hoped unperceived but the eye of an indian was too keen they had discovered me and whilst i was relating to the portuguese captain what i had seen they were suddenly upon us we had no time to make resistance even if we were inclined so to do we therefore sat still they came up and looked at us the wet had washed off a great portion of the paint upon my back and shoulders one of the indians touched me on the shoulder and said ughwhite man paint like indian they then examined the canoe and its contents and having spoken a few words to each other apparently relating to the canoe they put a thong of leather round each of our arms and making a motion for us to follow them they led us away weve done our best and could do no more said the portuguese i feel that its all over with me now and i shall soon sleep in the bosom of jesus my heart was too full to make any reply the indians led on and i followed in silence we passed through the woods which appeared to be interminable till the night closed in and then the indians halted and while one remained as guard over us the others collected wood for a fire they had some provisions but offered none to us after an hour they lay down to sleep round the fire placing me and the portuguese captain next to the fire and lying outside of us they were soon fast asleep or appeared to be when i said to the captain have you your knife for if they remain asleep let us wait an hour or so and if you can cut the leather thong which the indian holds in his hand and then watch your opportunity i will do the same and we may escape i have my knife but my indian is not asleep replied he i will wait till he is what signal shall we make if we succeed said i when you are ready lift your arm up i shall understand and if i am ready i will do the same agreed and now let us be quiet for depend upon it our conversation has roused them all we then composed ourselves as if to sleep and remained in that way for more than an hour by which time we were convinced that our captors were slumbering i then drew out my knife for the indians had not attempted to rifle us and cut the thong which was round my arm without awaking the indian who had the other end in his hand i remained quiet for a quarter of an hour when the portuguese lifted up his arm as a signal that he was free i listened attentively and being certain that the indians were asleep i lifted up my arm also the portuguese then rose up carefully and without noise stepping past the bodies of the indians till he was clear of the circle i did the same and pointed to the muskets which lay on the grass by the indians he took one up and i another and we retreated to a short distance we must have the other muskets said i stay where you are i advanced cautiously and took up the other three muskets and was retreating with them when one of the indians turned round as if awaking i ran past the portuguese and making a sign for him to follow me we retreated a few yards into the wood where we could watch the indians without being seen ourselves the portuguese motioned to be off but i detained him and i was right the indian roused up and sat upon his haunches perceiving that we had escaped he waked up the others they started on their feet and looking round found that the muskets were all gone and then they held a consultation at last they appeared to have made up their minds to follow and if possible recapture us for they went back in the direction of the sea now then we must hide three of the muskets said i in a whisper and keep the others to defend ourselves we examined and found that they were all loaded and the portuguese then said to me there are five of them if they meet with us and we discharge two muskets and we do not kill we shall be at their mercy if we do kill still there will be three against two we had better carry all the muskets do you take two and i will take three as i thought he was right i consented and we now went the same path towards the sea which the indians had done before us in pursuit of us we walked fast as we knew the indians would do the same and they had the start of us so that we were not likely to come up with them it was severe work but we did not slacken our pace and before dawn the sea was quite visible through the branches of the trees for we had arrived at the outskirts of the wood as soon as we had gained the beach which was yards wide we looked round to see if we could perceive the indians but we could observe nobody let us while it is yet dark go round so as to get on the opposite side of the rocks where we were concealed said the portuguese if they are there we shall take them by surprise keeping just within the wood we walked half a mile to the southward and then emerged just as the day was breaking and made for the rocks as soon as we arrived we examined very cautiously before we entered the cleft but there was nobody there and the canoe was safe they are not here said i where can they be they cannot be far off said the portuguese i suspect they are hidden somewhere and intend to surprise us while we are launching our canoe and when our muskets will be out of our hands i agree with you let us now wait at some little distance from the rocks till broad daylight we shall then be secure from surprise we did so and when the sun rose we looked well round but could see nobody we entered the cleft and were about to lay down the muskets and lay hold of the canoe when i perceived a small piece of rock to drop down this caused me immediately to suspect the truth and i cried to the portuguese to come back with me he did so and i told him that i was certain that the indians had climbed the rock and were lying down on the top of it ready to pounce upon us depend upon it they must be there said he when i mentioned the falling piece of rock let us walk round and see if we can discover them we did so but they were too well concealed but what must be done now said he it is useless our attempting to clamber to the top of the rock for no one could do it with a musket in his hand no replied i that is certain and if we attempt to bring the canoe out of the cleft they may drop down upon us i think said he that if we were to go in and take the towrope in our hands which is several yards long we might haul out the canoe by it and when once it is clear of the cleft they cannot move without our seeing them we will try at all events replied i do you stay on the watch while i get hold of the towrope and bring it out the indians did not expect this manoeuvre it was clear still keeping the muskets in our possession the butts on the sand and the muzzles resting on our shoulders we laid hold of the towrope and by great exertion hauled the canoe several yards away from between the two rocks we then paused for breath after a minute or two with our eyes fixed upon the top of the rock to see if they moved and then we hauled it at least a hundred yards further off when for the first time i perceived that the bow and arrows were not in the canoe and that they must have been taken by the indians then we must haul again said the portuguese when i stated this to him till we are out of bowshot let us put the muskets into the canoe and drag it as fast as we can we did so and gained another hundred yards before we stopped when an arrow was discharged from the summit of the rock and buried itself in the sand close to my feet haul again said the portuguese we are not out of shot yet again we exerted ourselves and gained another hundred yards during which two more arrows were discharged and one of them went through the left arm of my comrade but as it was through the fleshy part and did not touch the bone it did not disable him a third arrow was sent after us but did not reach us and we knew that we were out of distance cut the shaft of the arrow and draw it through the arm said the portuguese not now said i they will perceive me doing so and will think that you are disabled that may induce them to rush upon us thinking they have only one man to deal with well its no great matter replied he we must now drag our canoe down to the water and launch her if they will let us we have outwitted them so far we now turned the head of the canoe towards the sea and slowly dragged her down our eyes as may be supposed constantly kept upon the rock to see if the indians would move but they did not they perhaps felt that they had no chance with us having all the firearms and an open beach in our favour we launched our canoe without further interruption on their part and in a few minutes taking care to be out of arrow distance we passed the rock with our head to the northward when about two miles off we perceived the indians to descend from the rock and walk away into the woods let us praise god for this miraculous escape said i to the portuguese i do and the holy patron saint who has preserved me replied the portuguese captain but i am still heavy at heart i feel that we have escaped only to come into more strange and fresh calamity i shall never get back to lisbon that i feel convinced of i tried all i could to encourage him but it was of no avail he told me that the presentiment was too strong and could not be overcome by any argument indeed he appeared to have allowed the idea so to have taken possession of his mind that his reason became enervated and having heard how the indians burnt their prisoners he talked about martyrdom at the stake and rising up to heaven in great glory there to be received by the whole body of saints and legions of angels what is the use of our thus labouring at the paddle said he why not at once let us go ashore and receive the crown of martyrdom i am ready for i long for the hour and shall rejoice i said all i could to keep him quiet but it was useless and such was his insanity that he gradually neared the shore by steering against me with his paddle so that i could not prevent it i had drawn the shaft of the arrow through his arm and he appeared to feel no pain i expostulated with him at his keeping the canoe so near to the shore but he smiled and gave no reply we had the stream against us and made but little way and it vexed me very much to hear him talk so loud as he did as the indians must have heard him and i thought would follow us along the coast but he ransacked the whole book of martyrs telling me how one had his body sawn in two another was pinched to death this one burnt that tortured every variety of death he entered upon during the whole of that day without ceasing i ascribed much of this to the pain arising from the wounded arm notwithstanding which he paddled with as much vigour as ever as the night came on i entreated him to hold his tongue but it was in vain and i felt assured that his reason was quite gone he continued to talk loud and rave without intermission and i now considered our fate as sealed we had no water in the boat or provisions of any kind and i proposed that we should heaveto and catch some fish telling him that if he talked we should scare them away this made him quiet for a time but as soon as we had hooked four or five fish he again commenced his history of the glorious martyrs i prayed him to be silent for a short time at least and he was so for about four or five minutes when he would break out into some ejaculation which i immediately stopped at last he could talk no more for want of water his lips were glued together and so were mine nevertheless i continued paddling for two hours more when i found by the canoe grounding that he had steered her on the beach there was no help for it we landed and went in search of water which we found about half of a mile from where our canoe was beached we drank heartily filled the calabash and were returning to the canoe when he again commenced talking as loud as ever i was in great anger but i put my hand before his mouth beseeching him in a whisper to be quiet as we were doing this we were suddenly sprung upon and seized by several indians and in a minute were bound hands and feet i knew it cried the portuguese i knew it would be so well i am prepared are not you my good friend i made no reply i felt that in his madness he had sacrificed his own life and mine also but it was the will of heaven the indians left two to guard us and went down to the canoe returning with their muskets i soon perceived that they were the same whom we had escaped from the night before and the one who had spoken a little english when we were first captured now came to me and said white man paint like indian steal gunugh when the indians had returned from the canoe our feet were unbound and we were again led away by the leather thong which was fast to our arms the portuguese now began to find his tongue again and talked incessantly the indians not checking him from which it was evident that they were on their own domains after four hours walking they kindled a fire and went to repose as before but this time they took our knives from us and bound our legs so tight that they gave us much pain i did not expostulate as i knew it was useless my companion as the thong entered into his flesh seemed pleased saying now my martyrdom is commencing alas poor man but i will not anticipate we travelled three days during which we were supplied with a small portion of parched indian corn every day just sufficient for our sustenance and no more on the fourth morning the indians after an hours travelling set up some shrill and barbarous cries which i afterwards discovered was their warhoop these cries were replied to by others at a distance and in about a quarter of an hour afterwards we found ourselves close to a number of wigwams as they are termed the indian houses and soon surrounded by a large party of men women and children who greeted us with taunts and menaces we were led into a larger wigwam than the others where we found several indians of grave aspect assembled and a man who could speak english was ordered in as interpreter he asked us where we came from in the canoe i replied that we came from the south but we had been wrecked in a big ship and had taken the canoe which we found on the beach they asked no more questions we were led out and in about an hour afterwards the indian who had spoken english to us when we were captured came up with two others and painted us black saying the white man like paint black paint good i did not know till afterwards that this painting black was a sign that we were condemned to death but so it was they took off our trowsers the only garments we had on and left us naked to my surprise they did not take the diamond which was sewed up in leather from off my neck but as i learnt subsequently the indians are much given to conjurors and charms wearing many round their own necks and about their persons and they respect the charms that their enemies wear indeed are afraid of them lest they should be harmed by having them in their possession we remained in a wigwam during that day with guards over us the following day we were led out and cast loose and we found all the indians women and children ranged in two lines each holding in their hands a club or stick or rod of some description or another we were led to the end of the row and looked about us in amazement they made signs to us which we did not understand and while we were remaining in doubt as to what was to be our fate an old woman who had been menacing and grinning at me for some time and who was the most hideous animal that i ever beheld in the shape of a woman thrust a straw into my eye giving me most excruciating agony i was so carried away by rage and pain that i saluted her with a kick in the stomach which laid her doubled up on the ground expecting to be scalped for so doing the next moment on the contrary the indians laughed while some of the other women dragged her away at last the interpreter came and from him we learnt that we had to run the gauntlet and that as soon as we gained the large lodge where we had been examined by the old indians on the day previous we were safe and that we must run for that as fast as we could the portuguese who was still as mad as ever was then pushed on he would not run but walked glorying in the blows which showered down upon him like hail and moreover he prevented me from running for some time till i got past him i had been cruelly punished and was mad with pain when i perceived a tall gaunt indian waiting for me with a heavy club careless of life or consequences i rushed past him and as i passed i threw out my fist with such impetus that hitting him under the right ear he fell senseless and it appears that he never rose again for the blow killed him after which i at last gained the councilhouse and was soon afterwards followed by my companion who was streaming with blood we were then led away and tied by our necks to two stakes about twenty yards apart and there we remained for the night the portuguese passed the night in singing i passed it in silence and prayer i felt convinced that we were to die and i feared that it would be by fire or torture for i had heard something of the manners and customs of these indians i made my peace with god as well as a poor sinner could prayed for mercy through jesus christ sighed my adieu to amy and made up my mind to die early the next morning the indians brought firewood and placed it in bundles round the stakes at a distance of about fourteen yards from the centre they then went to the portuguese tied his hands behind him and exchanged the rope by which he had been fastened for a much stronger one one end of which they fastened to his wrists behind him and the other to the stake as they left me as i was before it was plain that the portuguese was to suffer first they then set fire to the piles of wood which were round the stake which were too far from him to burn him and i could not imagine what they intended to do but you may conceive that i was in a state of awful suspense and anxiety as i was well convinced that his fate whatever it might be would be my own during these appalling preparations the portuguese appeared as if he really enjoyed the scene now my good friend said he to me you shall see how i can suffer for the true faith even a heretic like you shall be converted by my example and i shall ascend to heaven with you in my arms come on ye fiends come on ye heathens and see how a christian can suffer much as i felt for him and for myself i could not lament that his reason had left him as i thought his sufferings would be less but his exclamations were soon drowned by a loud yell from the indians who all rushed upon my unfortunate companion for a moment or two they were crowded so thick round him that i could not perceive what they were doing but after that they separated and i beheld him bleeding profusely his ears and nose having been cut off and a broken iron ramrod passed through both cheeks and now a scene took place at the remembrance of which even now my blood curdles some caught up the burning sticks and applied them to his flesh others stuck him full of small splints the ends of which they lighted the indian warriors shot at him with muskets loaded with powder only so as to burn him terribly on every part of the body the women took up handfuls of lighted ashes and showered them down on him so that the ground he trod upon was a mass of burning embers and he walked upon fire redhot irons were now brought forward and his body seared in all parts his tormentors seeking out where they could give him the most pain at last one applied the hot iron to his eyes and burnt them out imagine my feelings at this horrid sceneimagine the knowledge that this was to be also my fate in a short time but what is more strange to tell imagine madam my companion not only deriding his torturers but not flinching from the torture on the contrary praising god for his goodness in thus allowing him to be a martyr for the true faith offering his body to their inflictions and shouting manfully but such was the behaviour of my insane friend and this behaviour appeared to give great satisfaction to the indians for nearly two hours did this torture continue his body was black and bloody all over and the smell of the burning flesh was horrible but by this time it appeared as if he was much exhausted and indeed appeared to be almost insensible to pain he walked round the stake as before upon the burning coals but appeared not to know when further torture was applied to him or not he now sang hymns in portuguese in a low voice for he was much exhausted soon afterwards he staggered and fell down with his face upon the burning embers but even the flesh of his face grilling as it were appeared to have no effect upon him an indian then went up to him and with his knife cut a circle round his head and tore off the whole scalp flesh and hair together and when he had done this the old woman whom i had saluted with a kick before i ran the gauntlet and who had his ears hanging on her neck to a string lifted up a handful of burning coals and put them upon his bleeding head this seemed to rouse him he lifted up his head but his features were no longer to be distinguished as his face was burnt to a black coal and he said take me ye holy saints angels receive me and to my great astonishment he again rose on his legs and tottered round and round for a few minutes at last he sank down with his back against the stake and one of the indians cleaved his brain with his tomahawk and thus ended the life and the misery of my unfortunate companionand it was now my turn well thought i it is but two hours of suffering and then i shall be beyond their malice may god have mercy upon my soul the same preparations were now made for me i was fastened with the stout rope and my arms tied behind me the wood was fired and one of the chiefs was haranguing the indians he finished the low yell was given when the old woman whom i had before mentioned ran up to me and saying something which i could not understand put her hand upon me when she did this the other indians who were about to rush on me drew back with signs of disappointment on many of their wild countenances the chiefs then went into the councilhouse leaving me tied where i was and the wood burning around me the mass of indians standing about as if waiting the decision of the chiefs after a time three indians one of whom was the interpreter came up to me and kicking aside the burning poles cast me loose i asked the interpreter what he was about to do he replied you kill indian here pointing to his own ear you kill him dead squaw lose husbandwant anothertake youstead of him they led me to the councilhouse before the chiefs the old woman whom i had kicked was there it was her husband that i had killed by the blow behind the ear and she had claimed me in his stead and according to the custom of the country her claim was allowed and i was made over to her and received into the tribe strange custom for a woman to marry the murderer of her husband but still such it was and thus did i find myself freed from the stake when i least expected it the principal chief made me a speech which was interpreted in which he told me that i was now the husband of manou and was one of their own tribe that i must be strong in war and must hunt and procure venison for my family they then washed off the black paint and after a few more speeches and ceremonies i was handed over to the hideous old hag whose neck was still decorated with the two ears of my companion to say that i would have preferred the torture would be saying too much but that i loathed the creature to excess was certain however i said nothing but allowed her to take me by the hand and lead me to her wigwam as soon as we were in she brought me some venison which i ate greedily for i had had nothing for thirtysix hours she then offered me the leggings as they call them which the indians wear and the other portions of the indian dress which probably belonged to her late husband i put them on as i was glad to cover my nakedness and worn out with walking and exertion i first thanked god for my miraculous preservation and then lay down and fell into a deep sleep it was not until the next day that i awoke and i then perceived the old woman rubbing oil upon the deep cuts made in my wrists and shoulders by the leather thongs she again set meat before me and i ate heartily but i looked upon her with abhorrence and when she attempted to fondle me i turned away and spit with disgust at which she retired grumbling i now had leisure to reflect i passed over with a shudder the scenes that had passed and again returned thanks to god for my deliverance i called to mind how often i had been preserved and delivered from my bondage in africa from my imprisonment in the tower from my hopeless slavery in the mines from our wreck on the island and now after passing through such dangers from an almost certain cruel death by torture truly did i feel how grateful i ought to be for that providence which had so often preserved me and that my only reliance in future must be in its gracious protection but here i was married to a woman i detested and living with barbarians and i said to myself that kind heaven which has already done so much for me will in its own good time also release me from this thraldom in the meanwhile let me not murmur but be thankful my squaw as they call their wives among the indians now came up to me and offered to paint me and i thought it advisable that she should as i felt that the sooner i conformed myself to their customs the more chance i had of making my escape which i was resolved to do the first opportunity as soon as she had completed my toilet i walked out of the wigwam that i might look about me and be seen the indians who were sauntering about met me with a friendly ugh which appeared a favourite monosyllable with them at last i met with the interpreter and began to converse with him i asked what nation i was now belonging to and he said the massowomicks i asked how large their country was and he told me much which i could not understand except that it appeared to me a very powerful nation i was very careful of mentioning the english or any thing about their settlement although i was anxious to know where it was but i asked him whether they were at war with any other nation he said no they had been at war with other tribes but that they had all made peace that they might join against the white man who had taken their land i am an indian now said i yes and you will forget the white man said he you have now red blood in your veins you marry indian wife you all the same as one indian i said war indian beat his wife suppose she talk too much plenty talk plenty beat said he suppose my wife talk too much and i beat her what indian people say say good suppose wife too old you take two wife one more young i was very much pleased with this conversation not that i had the slightest idea of profiting by his information by taking another wife but i felt such a disgust at my present one and had already seen what a fury she could be that i was resolved if necessary to show her that i was master for i felt certain that if i did not she would soon attempt to master me and so it turned out on the third day she took down a bow and arrows and made a sign to me to go out and i presumed bring back food and as there was nothing in the house i thought the request reasonable i therefore went out of the wigwam and found that many of the young men were going out on a huntingparty and that i was to join them we set off and travelled for six hours before we came to the huntingground and as the deer passed me i thought of whyna and my hunting excursions with her i was however fortunate and killed two deer much to the surprise of the indians who thought a white man could not use a bow and arrows and i rose very much in their estimation in consequence the deer was cut up and we hung upon branches what we could not carry we did not go home that night but feasted over a large fire the next morning we all carried home our loads and mine was as large as any of the others if not larger neither did i flag on the way for i was naturally very strong and active and had lately been inured to fatigue when we arrived the squaws and men among the others were despatched for the remainder of the venison i now went out every day by myself and practised with my bow till i had become more expert for i wanted practice i had no musket but i had a tomahawk and a long knife i began to pick up a few words of the language and by means of the interpreter i gained them very fast before i had been three months with the indians i had acquired their confidence and respect they found that i was expert and able to gain my own livelihood and i may add that before i had been three months i had also mastered my wife when she found that i would not submit to her caresses she was very indignant and very violent but i immediately knocked her down and beat her unmercifully this brought her to her senses and after that i treated her as my slave with great rigour and as she was a notorious scold the indians liked me all the better for it you may think that this was not fair treatment towards a woman who had saved my life but she only saved it for her own purposes and would have worn my ears as well as my companions if i had not killed her husband the fact is i had no alternative i must have either treated her kindly and submitted to her nauseous endearments or have kept her at a respectful distance by severity and i hardly need say that i preferred the latter so far as her choice of a husband was concerned she made a bad one for she received nothing but blows and bad usage i had one day driven my wife out of the wigwam in consequence of her presuming to talk too much as the indian said when the interpreter told me that one of the chiefs was willing that i should marry his daughter polygamy being one of their customs i was very much annoyed at this for i knew the young girl very well she was very graceful and very pretty and i felt that my fidelity to amy would be in great danger if the marriage was to take place and if proposed i dared not refuse so great a distinction i replied that i was fortunate but that i feared my present wife would make her very unhappy as she wanted to be the chief woman of the wigwam and when i was away i could not tell what the old woman might do to her and the conversation was dropped this little indian had before this shown me as much favour as an indian girl ever ventures to show sufficient at all events to satisfy me that i was not disagreeable to her and what the interpreter had said made me very uncomfortable however i consoled myself with the recollection that if i were compelled to marry this girl it would be an involuntary infidelity on my part and on that account might well be excused for the hope of again rejoining amy never left me at any time one day i went out in search of deer and was led away from my companions after a buck which i had wounded and attempted to overtake they saw me in chase of my quarry and left me in pursuit i followed for several hours continually coming up with it and as continually losing it again at last i heard the report of a musket close to where the deer was last seen by me and i thought that some indian had shot it i walked forward however very cautiously and perceived a white man standing by the animal which lay at his feet i started back for i did not know whether i had fallen in with a friend or a foe but as i knew that he had not had time to reload his musket i hallooed to him concealing myself at the same time behind a tree is that you evans said the man in reply no said i it is an englishman well show yourself then said he i am dressed as an indian replied i i was taken by the indians well come along said the man who was attired as a seafaring man i came from behind the tree and when he saw me he snatched up his musket dont be afraid said i afraid said he i should like to see what i am afraid of but ill be on my guard thats right i replied i then told him that i had been taken by the indians and they saved my life because one of their women chose me as her husband and that i was anxious to escape from them well said he i am on board of a schooner at anchor down below in the river there are a few of us come on shore to get some venison and i have lost my comrades but i had no idea that the indians were down here so close to the english settlements how close are we then said i for i know not where i am this is certainly not our usual huntingground for i have been led many miles from it in pursuit of the animal you have just shot well i thought so for i have been on shore here more than once and i have never met with an indian you ask how far you are from the settlement that i can hardly tell you because the settlers have spread out so far but you are about forty or fifty miles from james town and what river then is your schooner at anchor in i dont know the name replied the man im not sure that it has a name we come here for wood and water because it is quiet not inhabited and no questions asked what are you then inquired i why to tell you the truth we are what are called jolly rovers and if you have a mind to come on board we can find a berth for you i dare say many thanks replied i but i am not sufficiently fond of the sea and i should be of no use for by his term of jolly rover i knew that they were pirates thats as you please replied he no harms done no replied i and i thank you for your kind offer but i cannot live long on board of a vessel will you now tell me which is the right track to the english plantations why said he they bear right out in that direction and i dare say if you travel five or six leagues you will fall aboard of some plantation or anotherright in that quarter follow your nose old fellow and you cant go wrong many thanks i replied am i likely to meet your companionsthey may take me for an indian not in that direction replied he they were astern of me a long way farewell then and many thanks i replied goodbye old fellow and the sooner you rub off that paint the sooner youll look like a christian said the careless rover as i walked away no bad advice i thought for i was now determined to make for the english settlements as fast as i could and i will do so when i once see an english habitation but not before i may fall in with indians yet i then set off as fast as i could and being now inured to running for a long time without stopping i left the rover a long way behind me in a very short time i continued my speed till it was dark when i heard the barking of a dog which i knew was english for the indian dogs do not bark i then proceeded cautiously and in the direction where i heard the dog bark and arrived in a quarter of an hour to a cleared ground with a rail fence round it thank god i cried that i am at last among my own countrymen i considered however that it would not be prudent to show myself especially in my indian paint at such a time of night and i therefore sat down under the leeside of a large tree and remained there till morning i then looked about for water and having found a running stream i washed off my paint and appeared what i really was a white man in an indian dress i then went up again to the clearing and looked for the habitation which i discovered on the top of a hill about four hundred yards off the trees were cleared away for about three hundred yards all round it it was built of heavy logs let into one another with one window only and that very small the door was still shut i walked up to it and tapped at the door whos there replied a hoarse voice an englishman and a stranger i replied i have just escaped from the indians well well see what you are in a very short time replied the voice james get me my gun in a minute the door opened and i beheld a woman more than six feet high of gaunt appearance and large dimensions i thought that i had never seen such a masculine creature before it was her voice which i had heard two men were seated by the fireplace who are you said she with the musket ready for the present i told her in a few words show me the palm of your handturn it up at once i did so without the least idea of the reason for the demand but i afterwards discovered that it was to ascertain whether i was one of those who had been transported to the settlement as they all had the letter r branded on them oh youre not a gaolbird then i see you may come in but youll give me that bow and arrows if you please certainly replied i if you wish it why theres nothing like making sure in this world and although you look a very peaceable goodlooking sort of personage notwithstanding your indian setout still ive known just as amiable people as you in appearance very mischievous at times now come in and let us hear what you have to say for yourself jeykell get some more wood one man went out to obey her orders the other sat by the fire with his musket between his knees i sat down by the fire at the request of the woman who had seated herself by the side of the man and then on her repeating her question i gave her a narrative of my adventures from the time that i left rio well says she we seldom hear stories like them its all the world like a book and pray whats that thing pointing to the diamond in its case you have hanging to your neck there you have left that out in your history thats a charm given me by my indian wife to preserve me from disasters from wild animals no panther wolf or bear will ever attack me well said she if so be it has that power all i can say is its not a bad charm to wear in these parts for there are animals enough in the woods in summer and round the house all night in winter but i dont believe a bit in the charm and thats the truth however if it does no good it cant do no harm so you may keep it on and welcome may i ask how far it is to james town said i what going to james town already i suppose you expect to be there tonight not exactly my good woman replied i i must trespass upon your kindness to give me something to eat for i am hungry good woman bah and pray how dare you call me good woman call me mistress if you want any thing i beg your pardon said i well then mistress will you give me something to eat yes i will james fetch the mealcake and a bit of salt pork and give him to eat while i call the cows from the bush the mistress as i shall in future call her then put down her musket and left the cabin during her absence i entered into conversation with the man called james for the other had gone out to my inquiry how far it was to james town he replied that he really did not know that he was sent out a convict and sold for ten years to the husband of the mistress who had died two years ago that this man had a small vessel in which he went to james town by water and that he had returned with him in his vessel that the distance by water he considered about one hundred and fifty miles but by land it was not half that distance that he did not know the way nor did he believe that there was any road as yet made to james town as this plantation was quite by itself and a long way from any other he understood that the nearest plantation was twenty miles off and he knew there was no road to it as no one ever went or came except by water but said i are not the settlers at war with the indian tribes that surround them yes and have been now for three or four years and the indians have done great mischief to the plantations and killed a great many people but the settlers have punished them severely then how is it that this plantation which is so solitary has not been attacked because the mistresss husband was a great friend of the indians and it is said used to bring them cargoes of muskets and ammunition from james town contrary to all law and regulation but if he was friendly with them the mistress is not for she has quarrelled with the principal chief and i should not be surprised if we were attacked some day and all scalped and what does the mistress say to that oh she dont care shed fight a hundred indians or white men either i never saw such a creatureshes afraid of nothing who is the other man i saw here oh hes another like myself there were three of us but one was drowned by falling overboard from the sloop well but my good fellow how shall i get to james town im sure i cant tell but my idea is that you will never get there unless mistress chooses why surely she wont detain me by force wont sheyou dont know her why shed stop an army replied the man i dont think that she will let you goi dont know but thats my opinion she wants another hand what do you mean to say that shell make me work i mean to say that according to the laws of the settlement she has a right to detain you any person found roving here who cannot give a satisfactory account of himself may be detained till something is heard about him for he may be a runaway convict or a runaway apprentice which is much the same after all now she may say that your account of yourself is not satisfactory and therefore she detained you and if you wont work she wont give you to eat so there you are well we will see if she is able able if you mean strong enough why shed take you up with one hand and she is as resolute and severe as she is strong i had rather have to deal with three men and thats the truth whats the truth james cried the mistress coming in at the door lets hear the truth from your lips it will be something new i said that i was sent here for finding a pocketbook mistress thats all yes but you did not tell him where you found itat the bottom of a gentlemans coatpocket you know you can only tell the truth by halves yet i see wishing to ascertain how far the mans suspicions were correct i said to her i have good friends in james town if i were once there i could procure money and any thing else to any amount that i required well says she you may have but im afraid that the post dont go out today one would think after all your wanderings and difficulties that youd be glad to be quiet a little and remain here so well talk about james town some time about next spring indeed mistress i hope you will not detain me here i can pay you handsomely on my arrival at james town for your kind treatment and any trouble you may take for me pay me what do i want with moneytheres no shops here with ribbons and calicoes and muslins and if there were im not a fine madam money why ive no child to leave what i have tono husband to spend it for me i have bags and bags of dollars young man which my husband heaped up and they are of as much use to me as they are now to him i am glad that you are so rich mistress and more glad that your money is so little cared for and so little wanted but if you do not want money i do very much want to get back to my friends who think i am dead and mourn for me well if they have mourned their sorrow is over by this time and therefore your staying here will not distress them more i may as well tell you at once that you shall not go so make up your mind to be contented and youll fare none the worse for it this was said in so decided a tone that bearing in mind what i had heard from the convict servant i thought it advisable to push the question no further for the present making up my mind that i would wait a short time and then make my escape if she still persisted in detaining me by force but this i could not venture upon until i was in possession of firearms and i could not obtain them while she had any suspicion i therefore replied well since you are determined i shall not go i have nothing more to say except that i will wait your pleasure and in the mean time let me make myself as useful as i can for i dont want to eat the bread of idleness youre a very sensible young man replied she and now you shall have a shirt to put on which will improve your appearance a great deal she then went into the inner room which i presumed was her bedroom as there were but two rooms in the cabin as she went out i could not help wondering at her on examination i felt assured that she was more than six feet high and her shoulders as broad and her arms as nervous as a mans of that stature her chest was very expanded but bosom she had none in fact she was a man in womans clothing and i began to doubt her sex her features were not bad had they been of smaller dimensions but her nose was too large although it was straight her eyes were grand but they were surmounted with such coarse eyebrows her mouth was well shaped and her teeth were good and regular but it was the mouth of an ogress her walk was commanding and firm every action denoted energy and muscle and certainly from the conversation i have already made known her mind was quite as masculine as her bodyshe was a splendid monster in a minute she returned bringing me a good check shirt and a pair of duck trowsers which i thankfully accepted ive plenty more for those who please me said she carelessly when youve put them on come out to me and ill show you the plantation in a minute or two i joined her and she led me round the tobaccofields then to the maize or indian corn grounds pointing out and explaining every thing she also showed me the cows store pigs and poultry wishing to please her i asked many questions and pretended to take an interest in all i saw this pleased her much and once or twice she smiledbut such a smile after an hours ramble we returned and found the two servants very busy one husking maize and the other in the shed where the tobacco was dried i asked some questions of her about the tobaccohow many casks or bales she made a year she replied that she made it in bales and sold it by weight it must be heavy carriage from here to james town said i yes indeed if it went that way it never would arrive i imagine replied she but i have a sloop in the river below which carries it round when is the time it is harvested and fit to be carried round inquired i it is now turning fast said she all that you see hanging in the dryingsheds has been already drawn in three or four weeks it will all be housed and then we begin to pack in about two months from this the sloop will take it round but is it not very expensive keeping a sloop on purpose with men to have her in charge inquired i to hear what she would say the sloop lies at anchor without a soul on board said she no one ever comes up this river i believe captain smith who made the settlement did do so once there is another river about twenty miles farther down which is occasionally frequented by buccaneers i am toldindeed i know it for my husband had more to do with them than perhaps was good for his soul but this little river is never visited then your servants take her round yes i leave one in charge and take two with me but you have but two not till you cameone died but now i have three and she smiled at me again if i had not been so afraid of affronting her i certainly would have said to her do any thing i beg but smile i said no more on that point she called jeykell who was in the tobaccoshed and desired him to kill a couple of chickens and bring them in we then entered the cabin and she observed i dont doubt but you are tired with so much fatigue you look so go and sleep on one of their beds you shall have one for yourself by night i was not sorry to do as she proposed for i was tired out i lay down and did not wake till she called me and told me that dinner was ready i was quite ready for that also and i sat down with her but the two convict servants did not she ate in proportion to her size and that is saying enough after dinner she left me and went with her two men on her farming avocations and i was for a long while cogitating on what had passed i perceived that i was completely in her power and that it was only by obtaining her goodwill that i had any chance of getting away and i made up my mind to act accordingly i found a comfortable bed of the husks of indian corn prepared for me at night in an anteroom where the two servantmen slept it was a luxury that i had not enjoyed for a long while for several days i remained very quiet and apparently very contented my mistress gave me no hard work chiefly sending me on messages or taking me out with her she made the distinction between me and the convicts that i always took my meals with her and they did not in short i was treated as a friend and visitor more than any thing else and had i not been so anxious about going to england i certainly had no reason to complain except of my detention and this it was evident it was not in her power to prevent as until the sloop went away with the tobacco she had no means of sending me away one day however as i was walking past the tobaccoshed i heard my name mentioned by the two convicts and stopping i heard james say depend upon it thats what shes after jeykell and he is to be our master whether he likes it or not well i shouldnt wonder replied the other she does make pure love to him thats certain very true every things fierce with hereven loveand so hell find it if he dont fancy her yes indeedwell id rather serve another ten years than she should fall in love with me and if i had my choice whether to be her husband or to swing i should take the cord in preference well i pity him from my heart for he is a good youth and a fairspoken and a handsome too and im sure that he has no idea of his unfortunate situation no idea indeed said i to myself as i walked away merciful heaven is it possible and when i thought over her conduct and what had passed between us i perceived not only that the convicts were right in their supposition but that i had by wishing to make myself agreeable to her even assisted in bringing affairs to this crisis that very day she had said to me i was very young when i married only fourteen and i lived with my husband nine years he is dead more than a year now when she said that which she did at dinner while she was clawing the flesh off the bone of a wild turkey there was something so ridiculous in that feminine confession coming from such a masculine mouth that i felt very much inclined to laugh but i replied you are a young widow and ought to think of another husband again when she said if ever i marry again it shall not be a man who has been burnt on the hand no no my husband shall be able to open both hands and show them i replied you are right there i would never disgrace myself by marrying a convict when i thought of these and many other conversations which had passed between us i had no doubt in my own mind but that the convicts were correct in their suppositions and i was disgusted at my own blindness at all events said i to myself after a long cogitation if she wants to marry me she must go to james town for a parson and if i once get there i will contrive as soon as extra constables are sworn in to break off the match but seriously i was in an awkward plight there was something in that woman that was awful and i could imagine her revenge to be most deadly i thought the old indian squaw to be bad enough but this new mistress was a thousand times worse what a hard fate i thought was mine that i should be thus forced to marry against my will and be separated from her whom i adored i was a long while turning over the matter in my mind and at last i resolved that i would make no alteration in my behaviour but behave to her as before and that if the affair was precipitated by my mistress that i would be off to the woods and take my chance of wild beasts and wild indians rather than consent to her wishes i then went into the cabin where i found her alone alexander said she she would know my christian name and called me by it they say widows court the men and that they are privileged to do so i turned pale for i little thought that there was to be an explanation so soon at all events whether they are or not i know that a woman in my position cannot well expect a young man in yours to venture without encouragement now alexander i have long perceived your feelings and your wishes and i have only to say that mine are such as yours oh i wish they were thought i and therefore you have but to ask and to have i was mute with fear and despair and could not find a reply to make to her why do you not answer alexander do you think me too forward no stammered i you are very kind but this is so unexpectedso unlooked forso unhoped fori am so overcome observe madam how strangely the sexes were changed i was the woman in this instance i should like to consult my friends consult your fiddlesticks replied she quickly who have you got to consult i hope alexander said she setting her broad teeth together that you are not trifling with me indeed i never should think of trifling with you mistress replied i i feel much obliged to you for showing such a preference for me i think alexander that you ought so now then if you please give me your answer replied she had i been prepared for your kindness i would have done so at once but i have many serious questions to put to myself and if you please we will renew the subject tomorrow morning i will then tell you candidly how i am situated and if after that you do not withdraw your proposal i shall be most happy to be yours as soon as we can go to james town to be married if replied she you mean to insinuate alexander that you have a wife in england that is of no consequence in this settlement for those who live here are free from all english marriages and as for going to james town that is quite unnecessary if the people in the settlement were to wait for a parson when they married they would never be married at all all that is necessary is that we shall draw up an agreement of marriage on paper sign it and have it witnessed however as i perceive that you are flurried i will wait till tomorrow morning for your decision my mistress then rose from her stool and went into her chamber shutting to the door with more emphasis than was at all agreeable to my nerves i walked out into the open air to recover myself and to reflect upon what course i should take in this awkward and dangerous dilemma marrying was out of the questionbut how to avoid it it was almost like being stopped by a highwayman he says your money or your life my mistresss demand was marriage or your life there was but one hope which was to escape that very night and take my chance in the woods and so i resolved to do i did not go in till dark my mistress was in her own room the two convicts were sitting by the fire i took my seat by them but did not speak except in a whisper telling them that their mistress was not well and that we had better go to bed and not talk they stared at me at the idea of the mistress being ill they had never known her to complain of any thing since they resided with her but the hint was sufficient they went to bed and so did i with my clothes on watching the crevices of the door of her room to see if her lamp was out in about half an hour the little thin beams through the chinks of her door disappeared and then i knew that she had gone to bed i watched two hours more before i ventured to stir the convicts were both snoring loud and effectually drowned any slight noise i might make in moving about i went to the locker secured all the cold meat for provision took down one of the muskets and ammunitionbelts and having put the latter over my shoulders i then took the musket in my hand and crept softly to the door of the cabin here was the only difficulty once out but five yards off and i was clear i removed the heavy wooden bar without noise and had now only to draw the bolt i put my finger to it and was sliding it gently and successfully back when my throat was seized and i was hurled back on the floor of the cabin i was so stunned by the violence of the fall that for a short time i was insensible when i recovered i felt a great weight upon my chest and opening my eyes found my mistress sitting upon me and giving orders to the convicts one of whom had already lighted the lamp for mercys sake get off my chest said i in a faint voice yes i will but not yet replied my mistress now james hand them to me james handed some chains to his mistress who turning round as she sat on my body made the manacle at the end of the chain fast round my ankle this went with a snapspring which could not be opened without a key belonging to it at last she rose off my body and i could breathe free she then called to the convicts saying go both of you into the tobaccoshed and wait there till i call you out if i find you one foot nearer to us ill flay you alive the servants ran off as fast at they could when they were gone my mistress said so you were about to escape were you you would avoid the chances of matrimony and now you have other chances which you little dreamt of i thought it was the wisest thing that i could do replied i since i must be plain i am sacredly betrothed to another person and i could not even for you break my faith i meant to have told you so tomorrow morning but i was afraid it would annoy you and therefore i wished to go away without giving you any answer well sir i offered to be your wife which would have made you my lord and master you refuse it and now i make you my slave i give you your option you shall either consent to be my husband or you shall remain as you are and toil hard but any time that you think better of it and are willing to embrace my offer you will be free and i will be as a wife in subjection so you say replied i but suppose i was to make you angry after i married you you would do to me as you have done now i may perhaps one day get free from this chain but once married to you i am a slave for ever you may think otherwise before long replied she in the mean time you may walk out and cool yourself she then returned to her room and i rose having determined to walk out and cool myself as she proposed but when i was on my legs i found that to the other end of the chain which was very heavy and about two yards long was riveted an iron ball of about thirty pounds weight so that i could not walk without carrying this heavy weight in my hands for it could not be dragged i lifted up the iron ball and went out of the house i was no longer afraid of her i was in too great a rage to fear any thing as i calmed i considered my case and found it to be hopeless as i thought of amy and the many months of hope deferred i wept bitterly and i had no consolation for the reader may recollect that i lost my bible when i was sent on shore naked almost by the rascally captain of the transcendant i had now been twenty months away from liverpool and i felt as if my chance of seeing her that i loved was indeed hopeless i might remain chained in such a solitude for years or i might expire under her barbarous treatment for i fully knew what i had to expect however i was resolved i prayed fervently for support and succour in my time of trouble and became more composed i remained out the whole of the night and watched the rising sun the two convicts came out to their work and shrugged their shoulders as they passed me but they dared not speak to me my mistress at last came out she commenced with abuse but i gave no answer she tried soothing but i was mute at last she became frantic in her passion hurled me away from her and after being dreadfully beaten i fell to the ground she put her foot upon my neck and she stood there looking like a fury she loaded me with epithets and then of a sudden went down on her knees by me and begged my pardon calling me her dear alexanderher lifeentreating me to accede to her wishes never was there such a tigress in love before i really believe hear me replied i as long as i am chained i never will give any answer upon the present subject that i swear she rose from my side and walked away it is impossible my dear madam for me to describe what i suffered from this woman for more than six weeks during which she kept me chained in this wayat one time entreating me the next moment kicking me and throwing me down i had no peacemy life became a burden to me and i often entreated her in mercy to put an end to my sufferings i also had my paroxysms of rage and would then spurn her spit at her and do every thing i could and say all that i could imagine to show my hatred and contempt at other times i was sullen and that always annoyed her she would bear my reproaches patientlybear any thing so long as i would talk but if i remained obstinately silent then in a short time her fury would break forth i pitied her notwithstanding her illtreatment for the woman did love me after her own fashion most intensely it was on the seventh week of my confinement on the chain that one morning very early as i was lying in the tobaccoshed for she had turned me out of the cabin i perceived among the trees which were about three hundred yards from the cabin two indians in what is called their warpaint which is a sign that they were on a hostile excursion i remained perfectly quiet and well concealed that i might watch them the convicts had more than once told me that the indians would attack us in consequence of an insult which my mistress had offered to their chief with whom her husband had been so friendly and when they stated what had passed i agreed with them that they would not fail to resent the insult as soon as they could i had therefore always been on the lookout but had never seen any indians before my mistress to whom i had in our days of sweet converse spoken about them always laughed at the idea of their attacking her and said that they might come if they liked she had made every preparation for them as she had loopholes stuffed up with moss just below the roof of the cabin from which you could fire down upon them till they were within four yards of the cabin and other loopholes from which you might shoot them when close to the window and door were impregnable and provided that we were once in the cabin there was no doubt but that a serious if not effectual resistance might be made that the indians were reconnoitring the cabin was evident and that they did not do so for nothing was equally certain after a while during which i made out six of them they fell back in the wood and disappeared the dog at that moment came out to me and it was probably the sight of the dog which made them retreat as they feared that he would have given notice of their being so close to us i waited till the convicts came out and then i went into the cabin and said you drove me out of the house last night and i come to return good for evil as i lay in the tobaccoshed i saw six indians in the wood to the east of the cabin reconnoitring and i have no doubt but that you will be attacked this night so i give you notice and you hope that by this fear of their attack you will be set free is it not it is perfectly indifferent to me whether i am or not i have often asked you to put an end to my misery and as you have not done it i shall bless those indians for the friendly act a blow of a tomahawk will release me if you will not well then let them come with their tomahawks replied she and i will protect you from them for no one shall release you but myself as you please replied i i have done my duty in telling you what i have seen and you may take precautions or not for myself i care nothing so saying i lifted up my ball of iron and went away out of the door i remained out of doors the whole of the day and therefore did not know whether my mistress took any precautions or not but i told the two convicts what i had seen and advised them not to go far from the cabin as they would run great danger they inquired of me where i had seen the indians and i pointed out the spot in the wood after which they went away i was certain that the attack would be on this night as there was no moon till three hours before daybreak and as it was very dark it would probably take place in the early part of the night i had made up my mind what i would do which was not in any way to defend the cabin while chained but when i was freed i would fight to the last so that i might be killed where i stood and not be taken alive and tortured i did not go out from home all that day and to my surprise i was not molested by my mistress at dark she called the convicts but they did not answer she came out to look for them and asked me whether i had seen them i told her that i had not seen them for two hours and i had thought that they were in the house did you tell them about the indians yes i did i replied and stated my opinion that they would attack us this night and i advised them not to go far from the cabin or they might be cut off then the cowardly sneaks have run off to the woods and left us to defend ourselves how we can i shall not defend myself replied i i shall stay here where i am i wait for death and will not avoid it come into the house said she abruptly no replied i i will not you will not said she and catching up the chain and ball in one hand with her other arm she caught me round the waist and carried me into the house well replied i it is only deferring it a little longer they will force their way in it at last and i will die here wait until they arrive replied my mistress but do you mean to say that you will not help to defend the house certainly not as long as i am chained as a slave replied i my mistress made no reply but busied herself with barring the door and window she then placed the table and stools so that she might stand upon them and fire out of the upper loopholes pulled the moss out of the loopholes took down the musketsof which there were sixfrom their rests examined the priming of those which were loaded and loaded those which were not she then got out a supply of powder and ball which she put ready on the table brought the axes out that they might be at hand examined the waterjars to ascertain whether the convicts had filled them as she had ordered and then when all was prepared for defence she removed the lamp into the inner room leaving the one we were in so dark that the indians could not by looking through the chinks or loopholes discover where the occupants of the cabin might be all these arrangements she made with the greatest coolness and i could not help admiring her courage and selfpossession is there any more to be done alexander said she in a mild voice where is the dog replied i tied up in the tobaccoshed said she then there is no more to be done replied i the dog will give you notice of their coming as they will first occupy the tobaccoshed as an advanced post alexander will you promise not to escape if i set you free certainly not replied i you set me free for your own purposes because you wish me to help to defend your property and then forsooth when the indians are beat off you will chain me again no no that was not my feeling as i sit here alive replied she but i was thinking that if forced to retreat from the cabin you would never be able to escape and i never could save you but they should hack me to pieces first answer me one question said i in a time of peril like this would you as a conscientious person think that you were justified in retaining in such fetters even a convict who had robbed you and if you feel that you would not on what grounds do you act in this way to a man whom you profess to lovei leave it to your conscience she remained silent for some time when the dog barked and she started up i believe i am mad or a fool said she sweeping back her hair from her forehead she then took the key of the manacle out of her dress and released me alexander silence said i putting my hand to her mouth this is no time to be heard speaking silence repeated i in a whisper i hear them they are round the house i stood upon one of the stools and looked through a loophole it was very dark but as the indians stood on the hill there was clear sky behind them as low down as their waists and i could perceive their motions as they appeared to be receiving orders from their chief and they advanced to the door of the cabin with axes and tomahawks my mistress had mounted on the table at the same time that i had got on the stool we now got down again without speaking and each taking a musket we kneeled down at the lower loopholes which i have described on second thoughts i mounted the stool whispering to her dont fire till i do the indians came to the door and tapped one asking in english to be let in no reply was given and they commenced their attack upon the door with their axes as soon as this aggression took place i took good aim at their chief as i presumed him to be who was now standing alone on the hill i fired he fell immediately as i leaped from the stool my mistress discharged her musket and we both caught up others and returned to the loopholes below by this time the blows of the axes were incessant and made the cabindoor tremble and the dust to fly down in showers from the roof but the door was of double oak with iron braces and not easily to be cut through and the bars which held it were of great size and strength it was some time before we could get another shot at an indian but at last i succeeded and as his comrades were taking the body away my mistress shot another after this the blows of the axes ceased and they evidently had retreated i then went into the inner room and extinguished the lamp that they might not be able to see usfor the lamp gave a faint light we returned to the table and loaded the muskets in the dark as i put my musket on the table my mistress said will they come again yes replied i i think they will but if you wish to talk we had better retreat to the fireplace there we shall be safe from any shot we retreated to the fireplace and sat down on the ashes it just held us both and my mistress took this opportunity of embracing me saying dear alexander if i had a thousand lives i would sacrifice them for you we have but one replied i and that one i will devote for your defence i can do no more who did you fire at said she the chief as i believe who was on the hill giving orders he fell and i think that he fell dead then depend upon it they will retreat said she i think not they will be revenged if they possibly can and we must expect a hard fight for it why what can they do they never can break through the door and when daylight comes we can shoot them by dozens depend upon it said i they will try to burn us out the wind is high which is all in their favour and i suspect they are now gone to collect firewood and if they do fire the cabin what shall we do i never thought of that we must remain in it as long as we can and then sally out and fight to the last but every thing depends on circumstances be guided by me and i will save you if i can be guided by you yes recollect i am not in chains now and that although you have all the courage of a man still you have not been so accustomed to warfare as i have been i have long been accustomed to command to plan and to execute in times of peril like this you have great strength and courage i little thought what a lion i had chained up replied she well i love you all the better for it and i will be guided by you for i perceive already that you have the best head of the two hark what is that it is what i said replied i they are laying firewood against the logs of the cabin on the windward sidethis was on the side opposite to the door now we must try if we cannot pick off some more of them said i rising and taking a musket bring the stools over to this side for we must fire from the upper loopholes we remained at our posts for some time without seeing an indian they had gone back to the wood for more combustibles at last we perceived them coming back with the wood i should imagine there were at least twenty of them now take good aim said i we both fired almost at the same moment and three indians fell get down and give me another musket said i to my mistress she handed me one and taking another for herself resumed her station we fired several times sometimes with and sometimes without success for the indians went away twice for firewood before they had collected what they considered sufficient by this time it was piled up to the eaves of the cabin and our loopholes were shut up we therefore went over to the other side where the door was to see if there were any indians there but could not see one we had been on the lookout for about five minutes when the crackling of the wood and the smoke forcing itself through the crevices between the logs told us that the fire had been applied and the wind soon fanned it up so that the flame poured through every chink and loophole and lighted up the cabin we must retreat to the fireplace said i come quickly or we shall be shot why so said she as she did as i requested they will peep through the loopholes on the side of the cabin where the door is and see us plainly until the cabin is filled with smoke which it soon will be but tell me what we are to do now for i feel if this smoke increases we shall not be able to speak to one another this she said about five minutes after we had remained standing in the fireplace with our heads up the chimney perhaps it will be as well replied i that i do speak so this fierce wind drives the smoke to leeward in volumes but the great burst of smoke will be when the roof is well on fire it is now burning fiercely on the windward side but we must wait till the leeside has caught and then the volume of smoke will be greater the great point is to hit the precise time of opening the door and escaping shrouded in a volume of smoke if too soon they will perceive us and we shall be shot down if too late the roof will fall upon us and we shall be smothered or burnt we had better now i think leave this and be all ready our best weapon if we have to fight our way will be an axe let us each take one and by now going near to the door and putting our mouths to one of the loopholes we shall breathe freer and unbar the door at the right time do you agree with me you are right said she you are a man and i am a woman we left the fireplace and having felt for and found the axes we went near the door and put our mouths to the loopholes below and the smoke passing above them enabled us to breathe freer i looked out and perceived that with the exception of about six yards to leeward of the cabin there was a dense volume of smoke rolling along the ground for a long distance and that if we could only once gain it without being perceived we should probably be saved i therefore unbarred the door drew the bolt and held it in my hand all ready for a start the cabin was now in flames in every part as well as the roof i touched my mistress and then took her hand in mine watching at the loophole at last when the heat was almost unbearable an eddy of the wind drove back the smoke close to the leeside of the cabin and all was dark i jumped up opened the door and dragged my mistress after me we walked out into the black mass completely hid from our enemies and then running handinhand as fast as we could to leeward in the centre of the smoke we found ourselves at least one hundred yards from the cabin without the indians having any idea that we were not still inside as we retreated the density of the smoke became less and i then told her to run for her life as the indians would discover that the door of the cabin was open and that we had escapedand so it proved we were still a hundred yards from the wood when a yell was given which proved that they had discovered our escape and were in pursuit we gained the wood i turned round a moment to look behind me and perceived at least forty or fifty indians in full pursuit of usthe foremost about two hundred yards distant now we must run for it mistress said i and we must no longer take hands we shall have to thread the wood away we have no time to lose so saying i snatched my hand from her and sprang forward she following me as fast as she could more fearful evidently of my making my escape from her than of her own escape from the indians as soon as i was a hundred yards in the wood i turned short to the right and fled with all my speed in that direction because i hoped by this means to deceive the indians and it was easier to run where the wood was not so thick my mistress followed me close she would have hallooed to me but she had not breath after the first halfmile i found out that i was more fleet than she was whether encumbered with her clothes or perhaps not so much used to exercise i heard her panting after me i could easily have left her but my fear was that she would have called to me and if she had the indians would have heard her and have known the direction i had taken and when once on my trail they would as soon as daylight came have followed me by it to any distance i therefore slackened my speed so as just to enable my mistress to keep up with me at about ten yards distance when we had run about three miles i felt certain that she could not proceed much further speak she could not and as i ran without once looking behind me she could make no sign i continued at a less rapid pace for about a mile further i did this to enable her to keep up with me and to recover my own breath as much as possible previous to a start the voices of the indians had long been out of hearing and it was clear that they had not discovered the direction which we had taken i knew therefore that they could not hear her now if she did cry out as loud as she could and i gradually increased my speed till i could no longer hear her panting behind me i then went off at my full speed and after a few minutes i heard her voice at some distance faintly calling out my name yes thought i but i have not forgotten the ball and chain and if you thought that you had let loose a lion while we were in the cabin you shall find that you have loosed a deer in the woods i then stopped for a few moments to recover my breath i did not however wait long i was afraid that my mistress might recover her breath as well as myself and i again set off as fast as i could the idea of torture from the indians or again being kept confined by my mistress gave me endurance which i thought myself incapable of before morning i calculated that i had run at least twenty miles if not more with the perspiration running down me in streams and hardly able to drag one leg before the other i at last just about daybreak gave it up when i threw myself on the ground and dropped out of my hand my axe which i had carried the whole way i lay there for more than half an hour tormented with thirst but quite unable to move at last i recovered and as i well knew that the indians would divide in parties of three or four and hunt every part of the woods and by daylight probably discover my track i rose and prepared to resume my toil when looking round me i perceived that i was exactly on the spot where i had followed the deer and had fallen in with the jolly rover as he termed himself who had pointed out the way to the plantations i turned and saw the river below and as he had told me that the indians never came there i resolved to go to the river where at least i should find shellfish and water i did so and in half an hour arrived at the skirts of the wood and found that the river was about four hundred yards from me and clear of trees at the mouth for some distance i went down to the river which ran swiftly out and i drank till i was ready to burst i then rose on my feet and walked along its banks towards the mouth thinking what i should do to get to james town appeared to me to be an impossibility unless by water and i was not likely to meet with any other vessel here but a pirate should i then go aboard of a pirate it appeared to me to be my only resource and that i should be happy if i could find one by this time i had arrived at the mouth of the river and looking out to seaward i saw a schooner at anchor she was about three miles off that she was a pirate vessel i presumed should i go on board of her or not and if so how was i to get on board all her boats were up and i surmised that she had just left the river with the intention of sailing as soon as there was any wind for now it was calm the river ran out swiftly and i thought i should be able to swim the distance with the assistance i should obtain from the current which swept down right for her and she was riding to its strength i was demurring i had been perhaps two hours on the beach waiting to see if she might send a boat on shore when as i stood at the riverside still hesitating i happened to turn round and perceived three indians coming down upon me as fast as they could i hesitated no longer but plunged into the stream and was swept out two hundred yards before they arrived at the beach i made for the schooner and the current ran out so fast that in half an hour i was close to her i swam for her cable which i clung to and then shouted loudly this induced some of the crew to look over the bows and they handed me a bowling knot into which i fixed myself and was hauled on board i was dragged aft to give an account of myself and i stated in few words that i had been pursued by the indians and swam off to save my life havnt we met before said a rough voice i looked and saw the jolly rover whom i had fallen in with on shore i said yes i was escaping from the indians when i met you and you showed me the direction of the plantations alls right said he its a true bill and were those indians after you that we saw on the beach just now yes i replied and then i stated how it was that they had attacked our cabin and how we had escaped that was well done and so you swam off three miles fire and water wont hurt you thats clear youre just the man for us what thingumbob is this that you have hung round your neck said he taking up the leathern bag with the diamond in it that replied ia sudden thought having struck meis my caul i was born with a caul and i have always worn it as it saves a man from drowning no wonder that you swam three miles then replied the man you must know madam that some people are born with a membrane over the face which is termed a caul and there has been a vulgar error that such people can never be drowned especially if they wear this caul about their person in afterlife sailors are superstitious in many things but particularly in this and my caul was therefore as much respected by them as it hung round my neck as it was by the indians when they thought it was what they call magic or medicine well said the jolly rover as you had so much fire so much water and so much running i think you wont be sorry to have a biscuit and glass of grog and then turn in tomorrow we will talk to you i went down below very glad to accept the offer and as i was regaling myself who should come up to me but two of the portuguese who had been wrecked in the xebeque and put on shore with me in the little boat by the captain of the transcendant i was very glad to see them they told me that after great hardship and suffering they had arrived famished at the banks of this river and had been taken on board by the pirates and had remained with them ever since that they were very anxious to get away but never had an opportunity i begged them not to say who i was but merely that i was once a shipmate of theirs they promised and being very tired i then lay down and fell asleep i was so worn out that i did not wake till the next morning when i found that we were under all sail running down to the southward i saw the jolly rover as i had termed him on deck his real or assumed name i dont know which i found out to be toplift sitting on a gun abaft he called me to him i said are you the captain yes he replied for want of a better i told you months ago what we were so its no use repeating it do you intend to join us then replied i i will be very candid with you i have been driven as it were on board of your vessel but certainly without knowing exactly what she was now captain i have to ask you one questionwould you if you could go on shore in england with plenty of money at your command and plenty of good friendswould you be here no certainly not replied he well i am in that position if once in england i have money enough to live upon and plenty of friends i therefore naturally want to get back to england and not to run the risk of my neck on board of this vessel thats very true replied he but there are other considerations my men wont have a man on board who will not swear fidelity and if you will not i cannot protect youthey will throw you overboard we dont carry passengers thats very true also and i will swear fidelity so far as this that you never shall be betrayed by me and i never will appear as a witness against one of you it were most ungrateful if i did while i am on board i will do any duty you please to put me to for i cannot expect to eat my bread for nothing and suppose we come to action theres the difficulty replied i against an english ship i never will fight but if we are opposed to any other nation and there is a chance of our being overpowered why then if you are overpowered as i shall be hung along with the rest i think i must do all i can to save my own life but overpowered or not i will not fire a shot or draw a cutlass against my own countrymen well i cannot deny but thats all very fair i think replied i it is as much as you can expect especially as i never will share any prizemoney well i will talk to the men and hear what they say but now answer me one questionare you not a seaman i will answer the truth to every thing i am a seaman and i have commanded a privateer i have served many years in privateers and have seen a great deal of hard fighting so i thought replied he and now answer me another questionwas it not you that played that trick to that french privateer captain at bordeaux yes it was replied i but how came you to know that because i was the mate of a merchant vessel that had been captured and i saw you three or four times as you passed the vessel i was on board of for being put in quarantine we were not sent to prison till the pratique was given i thought that i knew you again well i have no concealment to make no but i will tell you candidly my men if they knew all this would not allow you to leave the vessel indeed you might be captain if you pleased for i do not suit them our captainfor i was his officerwas killed about six months ago and i really am not fit for the officei am too tenderhearted well you dont look so replied i laughing cant judge of outsides replied he but its a fact they say that they will be all condemned if taken from my not destroying the crews of the vessels we take that they will be so many witnesses against them and i cannot make up my mind to coldblooded murder i am bad enough i rob on the high seas i kill on the high seasfor we must kill when we fight but i cannot commit deliberate murder either at sea or on shore and so i tell them if any one else could navigate the vessel i should be superseded immediately i am glad to hear you say what you have captain it makes me less dissatisfied at finding myself here well i have said all i can and i must trust to you to manage with your ships company it will be a difficult job said he musing tell them replied i that i was once a captain of a vessel like this after all there is not so much difference between a pirate and privateer as you may thinkand that i will not be under the command of any one if they hear that they will give you the command of this vessel i will refuse to take it and give my reasons well ill tell them that i leave you to settle with them how you can but added he in a low tone there are some desperate villains among them that i take for granted replied i so now i leave you to speak to them toplift did so he told them that i was a pirate captain who had lost his vessel and been thrown on shore but i refused to join any ship except as captain of her that i would not serve as first officer and would obey no one he told them that he knew me before and he narrated the business at bordeaux when i commanded a privateer extolling me as i afterwards found beyond all measure the crew having heard what he had to say went forward and after consultation came to toplift and said that i must take the oath toplift replied that he had desired me so to do and that i had answered that i would not but said he you had better speak to him yourselves call all hands aft and hear what he has to say this was done and i was sent for i have told them what you said sir i dont know your name i have no name replied i proudly except captainthats my name the fact is madam i was determined to carry it out bravely knowing that it is the best way to deal with such people as i now had in hand well then captain i have told the men that you will not take the oath take the oath replied i with scorn no i administer the oath to others i make them take it i make them swear fidelity to me such has been my conduct and i shall not depart from it well but captain toplift you dont mean to say that he is to remain on board with us and not take the oath said a surlylooking ruffian in spite of you he shall take the oath captain toplift captain toplift said i calmly do you allow one of your crew to use such language as this had i been captain of this ship i would have blown his brains out as he stood you dont know to deal with these rascals i do captain toplift who appeared much pleased at being supported in this way by mestrange that a single individual whom they might have thrown overboard in a minute should have gained such an ascendency but so it wasand who perceived that the men fell back as if taken by surprise then said captain you have taught me a good lesson which i will take advantage of seize that fellow and put him in irons hah cried the man seeing that no one touched him who is to bell the cat hah and he drew his cutlass i will then said i to captain toplift if you desire it and stepping forward i went up to the man saying come come my good fellow this wont do here im used to deal with such chaps as you and i can manage worse than you a good deal i advanced till i was within the stroke of his cutlass before he was aware of it and seizing him by the waist i threw him flat on his back and put my foot on his neck now cried i in an authoritative voice put this man in irons immediatelyrefuse who dares here you sirs lay hold of this fellow continued i looking to the portuguese who accordingly came forward and led him away assisted by others who now joined them are there any more mutineers here inquired i if so let them step forward no one stirred my lads said i it is very true that i have refused to take the oath for the oath is not given to those who command but to those who obey but at the same time i am not one to betray you you know who i am and is it likely no no replied the men sir asked one of them who had been most forward and insolent will you be our captainsay but the wordyou are the sort of man we want you have a captain already replied i and in a few weeks i shall command a vessel of my own i cannot therefore accept your offer but while i am on board i will do all in my power to assist captain toplift in any way and you can desire no more and now my men as an old hand i have but this advice to give you which isto return to your duty for every thing in a vessel of this description depends upon obedience and to you captain toplift i have also advice to give which isto shoot the first man who behaves as that scoundrel did who is now in irons boatswain pipe down i hardly knew whether this latter order would be obeyed by the boatswain or if obeyed by the boatswain whether it would be obeyed by the men but to my great satisfaction it was and the men retired peaceably well captain toplift said i i have done you no harm and myself some good you have indeed replied he come down into the cabin when we were in the cabin he said you have unarmed and subdued the most mutinous rascal in the vessel and you have strengthened my authority they fully believe you are what you assert from your behaviour and i feel with you at my side i shall get on better with these fellows than i have done but now to keep up the idea you must of course mess in the cabin with me and i can offer you clothes not my own but those of the former captain which will suit your shape and make i readily agreed with him and having equipped myself in the clothes he offered me which were handsome i soon afterwards went on deck with him and received the greatest respect from the men as i passed them a cot was slung for me in the cabin and i lived altogether with captain toplift who was a goodhearted rough sort of a man certainly wholly unfit for the command of a vessel manned by such a set of miscreants and employed on such a service he told me that he had been taken three years before by a pirate vessel and finding that he could navigate they had detained him by force and that at last he had become accustomed to his position we all must live said he and i had no other means of livelihood left me but its sorely against my conscience and thats the truth however i am used to it now and that reconciles you to any thing except murder in cold blood and that i never will consent to on my inquiring where they were about to cruise he said on the spanish main but said i it is peace with the spaniards just now i hardly knew said he it was peace not that peace makes any difference to us for we take every thing but you refer to myself i know and i tell you frankly that i have preferred this cruise merely that we may not fall in with english vessels which we are not likely to do there i wish i was out of her with all my heart and soul no doubt of it captain toplift i think you are sincere suppose you put into one of the inlets of jamaica they wont know where we are let us take a boat on shore and leave her i will provide for you and you shall gain your living in an honest way god bless you sir said he i will try what i can do we must talk the matter over for they may suspect something and then it would be all over with us we continued to run down till we were in the latitude of the virgin isles and then we altered her course for jamaica the first and second mates generally received information of captain toplift as to his movements and intentions which they communicated to the crew if the crew disapproved of them they said so and they were considered to have some voice in the matter now although no navigators these men knew enough of a chart and a course to find that there must be some reason for its being altered as it was instead of running down by the spanish main and they inquired why the cruise was altered captain toplift replied that he had taken my advice and that i had assured him that at the back of the island of jamaica we should certainly fall in with some rich spanish vessels if we lay there quiet in some nook or another for a short time as this was their time for coming up from the south to the havannah where they rendezvoused for a convoy this reply appeared very satisfactory to the crew for they were all cheerful and obedient and we ran down to jamaica and when we were close in shore we shortened sail and hove to we remained three or four days in the offing that we might not cause any suspicion by our leaving too soon captain toplift then told the mates that i proposed anchoring in some secret bay or inlet as we were certain to see the spanish ships if we could send any one ashore on the hills to look out for them this was agreed to and we made sail and ran along the coast looking out for some convenient anchorage as we were so doing a vessel hove in sight and we immediately made all sail in chase as she did not attempt to avoid us we hauled off as she came near to see what she might be she then hoisted a yellow flag at her peak for she was an hermaphrodite brig this puzzled us not a little and we edged down towards her for she was very rakishlooking except in her sails as we neared finding i suppose that we did not answer her signals and we were not the vessel she expected us to be she suddenly altered her course before the wind setting all the sail that she possibly could we immediately crowded canvas in chase and came up with her fast as we ran the mate and i looked at her through the glass and i made her out to be the transcendant the captain of which had treated us so cruelly when we were in the boat and who had robbed us of our money and clothes i called the portuguese and desired them to look at the vessel through the glass and give me their opinion they directly said that it was the vessel i supposed let us only catch the rascal said i and we will pay him in his own coin and i immediately gave directions for the better trimming of the sails so anxious was i to come up with him the men of the schooner were much pleased at the anxiety i displayed to come up with the chase and by the alacrity with which they obeyed me i saw how anxious they were that i should be their captain in two hours we were within gunshot and sent one of our bowchasers after him perceiving that it was useless to run the fellow hove to and as we came alongside he was all ready with his boat to come on board he did so and at first i kept out of sight to hear what he would say he was followed up the side by his amiable son captain toplift received him on deck and he looked around him saying i believe i am right i was afraid i had made more mistakes than one i believe you are in the free trade yes replied toplift we are yes i thought so captain but i expected to meet another schooner which is very like to yours and is also in the trade i made my signal to her as when she has any thing to get rid of why i take it off her hands perhaps you may have something of the kind which is not exactly safe to showchurchplate and the like i pay ready moneythats my plan as it afterwards appeared madam this scoundrel had been in the free trade or pirating himself for many years but he had taken an opportunity of walking off with a large sum of money belonging to the pirate crew and with this money he had purchased his property in virginia and the brig which he now commanded although he did not follow up the free trade any more he had made arrangements with a pirate captain whom he met at port royal to meet them at the back of the island and receive such articles as the pirate might want to turn into cash by which he of course took care to secure large profits this he had done several times and as he sold his cargo at port royal for dollars he had always cash to pay for what the pirate wished to get rid of but he had now run into the lions jaws for not only were i and the portuguese on board to denounce him as a robber but what was still more unfortunate for him three of the pirates crew whom he had swindled out of their property were also on board of us and recognized him immediately as captain toplift knew how i had been treated by him he thought it was time he should be confronted with me and to his question as to whether there was any thing to dispose of he replied to him you must put that question to the captain there he is the fellow turned to me he looked at me stared and was mute when his cub of a boy cried out as sure as a gun its he father and no mistake oh you imp of satan you know me do you replied i yes it is he send all the men aft the men came fast enough they were only waiting till i had spoken to them to come and give information against him now my lads said i this is a scoundrel who fell in with some of us when we were in distress after we had lost our vessel instead of behaving as one seaman does to another he robbed us of all we had and turned us adrift naked to be killed by the indians of all i and the two portuguese you took on board about four months back are the only three left the others perished the one who was with me was burnt to death by the indians and i narrowly escaped i leave you to decide what this scoundrel merits but there is more against him captain said the men and then four of them stepped out and declared that he had run away with the money belonging to the crew of which they were a part and that the sum he had stolen amounted to dollars what have you to say for yourself said i to him that i have been a cursed fool to be caught as i have been what will they do father hang us i suppose replied he captain toplift said i i do not command this vessel and i shall therefore leave you to decide upon the fate of this miscreant and having said that i was going below to the cabin when the captain of the transcendants son ran to me and said i want to speak to you sir when you are alone what are you after peleg cried his father im going to save your life father if i can replied he youll be clever if you do that boy said the man sneeringly i allowed the boy to follow me down into the cabin and then asked him what he had to say i have that to tell you which is of more value than the lives of a hundred boys like me boys like you why i thought it was to save your fathers life that you came down sir pooh said he let him hang he was born for a halter i am come to save my own life i only said that to gammon him youre a hopeful youth said i and pray what is that you can tell me that will save your own neck from the halter that which will save your own most likely replied the boy and titfortats all fair well lets hear it then replied i no not unless you promise i can swing if need be as well as father but id rather not cause i know where all his money is hidden i cant make any promise replied i then i cant tell replied he so i may een go on deck and tell father that i cannot manage it and as he said the latter part of this speech the undaunted little villain actually laughed at the idea of gammoning his father as he termed it train up a child in the way he should go and he will not depart from it is mostly true but it is more certain that if you train a child up in the way that he should not go he will be a more true disciple could there be a more decided proof of the above than the behaviour of this young villain but his father had made him so and thus was he rewarded stop said i for i had reflected whether after all there were any grounds for hanging the boy and come to a conclusion that a jury would have probably acquitted him stop said i you say that what you can tell is of the greatest consequence and becomes of more consequence every minute that passes replied he i will tell you every thing and let you into fathers secrets i peach upon father altogether well then replied i if what you have to disclose proves important i will do all i can to save your life and i have no doubt that i shall be able so to do no more have i replied he or i would not have come to you now then father came to the back of the island to do a little business with a pirate schooner as he said just now and he has very often done it before as he said just now but father did not tell you all when we were in port royal father went to the captain of a kings vessel who is there having been sent to put down the pirates if possible and he offered this captain of the kings ship for a certain sum to put our friends that we exchange with into his hands what betray his friend the pirate yes father agreed that he would come round as he has done this day and would contrive to chaffer and bargain with him and keep him so late in the bay that the kings ship should come upon him all of a sudden and take him and this was fathers intention only you have pinned him the kings ship will be round that point in two hours or thereabouts so if you are found here you will be taken and hanged as sure as i aint hanged yet now aint this important news and worth all i asked for it it certainly is if it is true boy oh ill prove it for i always goes with father and he trusts me with every thing i saw the paper signed the kings ship is called the vestal and the captain who signed the paper signed it philip musgrave indeed said i turning away for i did not wish the boy to perceive my emotion at this announcement i recovered myself as soon as i could and said to him boy i will keep my promise do you stay below and i will go on deck and plead for your life maynt i go on deck for a bit said he what to wish your father goodbye no no you had better spare yourself and him that painful meeting no i dont want to wish him goodbye ill wait till its over only i never did see a man hanged and i have a curiosity to have just a peep out you little monster cried i running up on deck for the information i had received was too important not to be immediately taken advantage of well captain has the boy saved his fathers life no replied i in a loud voice then up he goes said the men for the halter had been round his neck and run out to the yardarm for some time and the men had manned the rope only awaiting my return on deck in a second the captain of the transcendant was swinging in the air and certainly if ever a scoundrel merited his fate it was that man shortly afterwards i turned round and there was the young hopeful looking at his fathers body swinging to and fro with the motion of the vessel i looked in vain for a tear in his eye there was not a symptom of emotion seeing me look sternly at him he hastened down below again my lads said i to the men who were all on deck i have received intelligence of that importance that i recommend that we should cut that vessel adrift and make sail without a moments loss of time what not plunder cried the men looking at the transcendant no not think of it if you are wise at this reply all of the men exclaimed that that would not dothat plunder they wouldthat i was not the captain of the vessel and many more expressions showing how soon a man may lose popularity on board of a pirate vessel i gave my opinion my men and if you will hear why i said so no no out boats cried they all and simultaneously ran to lower down the boats for it was now calm that they might tow the schooner alongside of the transcendant you might as well talk to the wind as talk to them when there is plunder to be obtained said toplift to me in a low tone come down with me said i and i will tell you what i have heard aint they going to plunder the brig said master peleg when we came down i know where fathers dollars are and up he ran on deck i made a short remark upon the depravity of the boy and then informed captain toplift of what he had told me if you had told them they would not have paid attention to you the boats crew who came with the captain have told them that there is money on board and all authority is now at an end well replied i i believe that the boy has told the truth and what do you mean to do remain below quietly if i am allowed replied i but i cannot said he they would throw me overboard make as bad a fight of it as you can replied i that i will said captain toplift and with so superior a force opposed we cannot stand long but i must tell you where you must be where replied i at the entrance of the magazine for as sure as we stand here they will blow up the vessel rather than be taken not all of them but two or three i know are determined so to do and resolute enough to do it my pistols are there you have only to open this door and you are in the magazine passage see said he opening the door there is the scuttle where they hand the powder up i will be on the watch depend upon it and captain toplift if the schooner is taken and i am alive you may have no fear for yourself now let us go on deck again i will follow you replied i i am alone at last thank heaven said i to myself what a position am i in and how much will be in suspense before twentyfour hours are over my own brother here not ten miles perhaps from me commanding the vessel which will attack this on which i am on board that they will take us i have no doubt but what risk do i runof death by shot or by their blowing up the vessel in spite of me or of no quarter being given well i wish it were decided at all events i am long supposed dead and i shall not be recognized among the heaps of bodies i then went to the locker and took out my duck frock and trowsers determining that i would if i were killed be killed in those clothes and be thrown overboard as a common seaman i then went on deck for i had heard the grating of the sides of the two vessels and knew that they were in contact all was uproar and confusion on board of the transcendant but there was nobody on board the schooner except toplift and myself i cannot say that i never saw such a scene for i had seen quite as bad on board of a privateer the common seamen as well as the soldiers when let loose to plunder are like maniacs in half an hour they had broken open every thing cut the crew to pieces found out the hoard of dollars which was shown them by young peleg who tried for his share but for so doing received a chop with a cutlass which cut off his right ear and wounded him severely on the shoulder but his right arm was not disabled and while the man that cut him down was bending over a heap of dollars which took both hands to lift them the boy ran his knife deep into the mans side who fell mortally wounded the rush for the dollars thus at the mercy of the rest was so great that peleg was not minded and he crept away and came on board the schooner we saw that he was bleeding profusely but we asked no questions and he went down the ladder forward what has that young villain been after said toplift i presume he has been quarrelling for plunder and considered that he had a greater right to his fathers money than anybody else among other plunder the people had not forgotten to look for liquor and an hour had not passed before threefourths of the men were more or less intoxicated they had found plenty of good clothes and were strutting about with goldlaced waistcoats and embroidered coats over their dirty frocks the uproar increased every minute when toplift who had been looking out with the glass exclaimed there she is by all thats sacred i caught the glass out of his hand and found it was the kings ship she was a large flush vessel apparently of eighteen or twenty guns just opening from the point and not seven miles from us we were still becalmed and she was bringing the wind down with her so that to escape appeared impossible now what shall we do said captain toplift shall we allow her to come down upon us and say nothing to the men or shall we point out the danger and persuade them to come on board and prepare you must do as you please replied i i am indifferent which it will be dark in another hour and she will not be down by that time i would rather avoid fighting and get away from the schooner quietly if i could but that i fear is impossible now well i must go on board of the brig and let them know for if they find it out themselves they will throw us overboard captain toplift then went on board of the brig and calling to the men who were still sober told them that there was a kings ship coming down upon them not seven miles off this had the effect of putting an end to the confusion and noise of a great portion of the men who hastened on board of the schooner but others who were intoxicated were with difficulty persuaded to return at last they were all got on board and the schooner clear from the brig was made ready for action but toplift was obliged to make some alteration in the stationing of the men as those who were to hand up the powder were all of them tipsy by the time that the schooner was ready and the breeze had come down to her the corvette was not more than three miles from us but it was quite dark for there is no twilight in those parts we consulted what course we should take to avoid her if possible and agreed that we would stand in shore and pass her if we possibly could we knew that if seen we were then certain to be obliged to fight but if not seen we might escape we then shifted the helm and bore up across her bows but we had not steered in this direction more than a quarter of an hour when the transcendant was perceived to be on fire having been fired by the drunken men before they left her and soon afterwards she burst out into flames that threw a strong light to a great distance discovering the corvette to us at two miles distance and of course exposing us to the corvette who immediately altered her course for us we had therefore only to fight and the crew being most of them in liquor declared that they would fight till the schooner sunk under them in a quarter of an hour the corvette being close to us and standing stem on we opened our fire raking her masts and yards and then i went down below i had changed my clothes for the duck trowsers and shirt which i had swum on board in and i now remained quietly in the cabin a few minutes afterwards the corvette opened her fire and the shot did great execution the cries of the wounded and the shouts of the tipsy men were mingled together but the crew of the schooner tired with great rapidity and sustained the unequal conflict most gallantly after a time some men darted down into the cabin i was then at the door which led to the magazine passage and busied myself handing up the powder as it secured me from observation and it was supposed that i was one of the crew sent down for that duty the men roared out where is the captain we want him to fight the ship toplift is an old fool and dont know what he is about i made no reply but with my back towards them continued to hand up the powder and having changed my dress they did not recognize me so they rushed upon deck again the corvette was now alongside of the schooner pouring in her broadsides with fatal execution the shot passing in every direction through her so that there was as much danger below as on deck and it was evident that the schooner could not oppose them much longer still they continued to fire with great resolution being now sobered into more steadiness than at first but by this time more than half the men were killed and wounded and our guns were encumbered with the wreck and bodies i heard them at the very time that a crashing broadside was poured in by the corvette cry out avast firing for a moment and clear the decks they did so and having thrown the bodies overboard and cut away the spars and rigging which had fallen so as to enable them to work their guns during which time three broadsides were poured in they remanned their guns and fought with as much spirit as before i could not help admiring the courage of the scoundrels for nothing could exceed it but resistance was useless further than they preferred dying at their guns to being hanged on the gibbet but the shouts of the pirates and the reports of the guns gradually decreased the men were swept away by the enemys fire and the guns were one by one disabled the schooners sides were torn out and the water poured in below so fast that it was rising to the magazine i heard a cry of boarders and the striking of the two vessels together and then there was a rush down below when a man came aft to the magazine passage it was the fellow whom i had struck down on the quarterdeck and had put into irons come along said he to the others well send the corvette and ourselves all to the devil together out of the way there stand back said i stand back replied he pointing his pistol down to the magazine i threw up his arm and the pistol went off striking the beams above blast you cried he whoever you are but ive another and he attempted to draw it out of his belt but before he could effect it i blew out his brains with the pistol which i had ready cocked in my hand his companions started back and i pointed my second pistol at them saying the man who comes forward this way dies as i said this the crew of the corvette who had cleared the decks charged down below and the pirates ran away and secreted themselves perceiving them coming forward i said to them put a guard over the magazine they have attempted to blow up the vessel already who are you said an officer a prisoner replied i well then lead him on deck and stay here two of you shut down the magazine scuttle and keep guard thank heaven thought i that this affair is over as a seaman led me by the collar on deck and handed me to others who took me on board of the corvette we were all put down below that remained out of the schooners crew about eighteen or nineteen not more and i was glad to find captain toplift although badly wounded with a splinter was among the number we remained there huddled together with a guard of ten men over us for more than an hour when we heard from the conversation on deck that the schooner had sunk after that the guns of the corvette were secured and the men had an allowance of liquor served out to them the watch was called and all was quiet during the remainder of that night for some time i was in a state of excitement from the events of the last twentyfour hours crowding so rapidly but by degrees i became calm i asked one of the guard who was the captain of the corvette whats that to you you gallowsbird replied he a civil question might receive a civil reply answered i so it might with any one else but if you dont want the hilt of my cutlass down your throat you will hold your tongue but i did not require to repeat the question as i heard one of the officers on deck say its captain musgraves orders this satisfied me and i lay down with the rest of the prisoners waiting for daybreak when i trusted my troubles would soon be over they were all sound asleep strange that men who knew that they would be hanged in a few days if not the next morning should sleep so soundbut so it waswhile i who had every reason to believe that my sufferings were over could not sleep one wink i was however fully satisfied with my own castlebuildings during the night and more satisfied when it was again broad daylight after the men had had their breakfast an order came down for all the prisoners to be brought on deck we were led up under guard and made to stand all in a row i looked round for my brother but he was not on deck it was the first lieutenant who was there with several other officers and the clerk with pen and ink to take down the names of the prisoners who was the captain of this vessel said the first lieutenant i was sir replied toplift but much against my will oh of course every man was on board of her against his will what is your name put him down mr pearson any other officers alive no sir replied toplift the name of every man was then asked and put down and it so happened that i was the last for anxious to see my brother i had walked up the foremost and they had commenced their interrogation at the other end of the line what is your name i do not belong to the schooner replied i of course not you dropped on board her from the clouds no sir i did not i swam on board of her to save my life then you went out of the fryingpan into the fire i reckon my good fellow for your life is forfeited now i rather think not sir replied i on the contrary i feel it is quite safe give us none of your jaw my good fellow but give us your name certainly sir if you require it my name is alexander musgrave sir replied i i am the elder brother of your captain philip musgrave and i will thank you to go into his cabin and inform him that i am here the first lieutenant and officers started back in astonishment and so did captain toplift and the pirates the first lieutenant hardly knew whether to consider it as a pretence on my part or not and was undecided how to act when captain toplift said i do not know whether the gentleman is as he says but this is certain and all the men can prove it as well as myself that he did swim on board as he said to escape from the indians and that he has never joined the crew they offered to make him captain in my stead and he positively refused it yes said all the pirates thats true enough well sir replied the first lieutenant i will certainly carry your message to make all certain replied i i will write my name on a slip of paper for you to take in to the captain he knows my signature i did so and the first lieutenant took the paper and went into the cabin in a minute he returned and requested me to follow him i did so and in another minute i was in the arms of my brother for some time we neither of us could speak at last philip said that you are alive and well let me thank heaven i have considered you as dead and so have others and to find you on board of a pirateon board of a vessel which i have been riddling with shot any one of which might have caused your death thank god i was ignorant that you were on board or i never could have done my duty i will not ask how you came on board of this vessel for that must be the end of your narrative which i must have from the time that you first left rio and afterwards in detail the whole from the time that you left the coast then they received my letters from rio yes after imagining you were dead they were rejoiced by those letters but i will not anticipate my story nor will i now ask for yours it is sufficient at present that you are alive my dear alexander and once more in my arms let me ask one question replied i i know what it will be she was in good health but suffering much in mind from having no account of you her father and others have reasoned with her and painted the impossibility of your being in existence as the xebeque you sailed in had never been heard of she still adheres in the opinion that you are alive and will not abandon the hope of seeing you again but hope deferred has paled her cheek even more pale than it usually is and she evidently suffers much for her life is wrapped in yours now having told you this you must come into my stateroom and allow me to enable you to appear as my brother ought to do i do not think that there is any difference in our size now although there was when we last parted many thanks philip but before i adonize my outward man i should wish to satisfy my inward cravings and to tell you the truth im so hungry from not having broken my fast for nearly twentyfour hours that if you could order something to eat while you are looking out the clothes i should feel in no small degree grateful philip rang the bell and ordered the steward in bring something to eat and drink and after eating i occupied a quarter of an hour more in getting rid of the pirate smoke and dirt and putting on one of his uniforms for he had no other clothes on board when i came out looking not at all like a pirate now then said philip before we have our teteatete come out with me and let me introduce you to the officers as my brother i went out with him and was formally introduced the first lieutenant apologized for his rough speech but i told him that there was no occasion for any apology as i had no doubt that i looked very much like a pirate at the time more than you do now sir at all events replied he by the bye brother said i there is one man among the prisoners who although compelled to act as captain by the men is no pirate his conduct i will explain to you may i request him to be kindly treated his name is topliftand also two portuguese my former companions certainly replied philip your word is sufficient let those persons be released and taken care of said he to the first lieutenant we will wait for the particulars byandby i remained on deck about ten minutes and then returned to the cabin with my brother what is this which you have left on my dressingtable said philip surveying the leather bag which contained the diamond that philip said i is a portion of my narrative and eventually may prove a very important one i dont think that i can afford to make you a present of it but i shall see it does not look very valuable replied he at all events do me the favour to lock it up carefully replied i well if you are in earnest i will he said and having put it in a drawer and locked it up he said now alexander let me have your history i commenced and told him all that the reader is now acquainted with dinner broke off my narrative and as soon as it was over i resumed it when i had finished he expressed his astonishment and asked many questions among others he said and that little wretch peleg the captain of the transcendants son is he on board i have not seen him replied i and therefore presume that he was not able to move and went down in the schooner which was the case you have indeed told me a strange tale said philip and you have had some extraordinary escapes you must have a charmed life and you appear to have been preserved to prove that amys persuasion of your being still alive was just and wellfounded and now it is my turn to talk and yours to listen when i left you as lieutenant of captain levees schooner we very shortly afterwards had an action with a spanish vessel of very superior force for she mounted thirty guns having no chance with her from her superior weight of metal we threw ourselves on her bow and boarded the spaniards did not relish this kind of close fighting and gave us immediate possession of their deck captain levee when he brought in his prize was appointed to a frigate of thirtysix guns and i followed him as his first lieutenant we had another combat with a vessel of equal force in which we were the victors and i was sent in the prize captain levee wrote very kindly in my behalf and i was made a captain and given the command of a small brig but let me first finish with captain levee he captured a galleon which gave him a large fortune and he then gave up the command of his ship and went on shore telling me in a letter that he had hitherto squandered away all his money but now that he had got so much he intended to keep it he has done so for he has purchased a large landed property is married and i believe is very happy he deserves it replied i and long may he be so well to continue i was sent out on this station and having information that the vessel which you are now on board of was at anchor in a bay close to the havannah i ran in and reconnoitred she hoisted spanish colours and i did the same it fell calm and i lay about four miles outside i was mistaken for another spanish vessel and the captain of this vessel or to speak correctly the spanish captain of the spanish brig came out to see me and did not discover his mistake till he was on board i detained him and his boats crew it continued calm till the evening when the breeze sprung up and i put the head of the brig right for the bay as if i were going in to anchor the breeze being light it was dark before i got in and alongside this vessel they were completely surprised for they imagined that their captain was dining with his old friend and having no idea that we were any thing but spanish had not the least preparation for resistance we had possession of her decks before they could seize their arms and i brought her out without any one knowing that she had been captured on my arrival the admiral gave me the command of her which i have held for nine months but she is very defective and i was ordered home and should have sailed had it not been that that scoundrel the captain of the transcendant gave me the information which induced me to come round to the back of the island little did i think what happiness awaited me so much for myself do not think me an egotist for speaking of myself i am only clearing away the less important information to arrive at that which most interests you the amy arrived safe with her valuable cargo the captain reported that he had remained at the rendezvous until blown off by a sort of hurricane and that finding himself a long way off he considered when the gale had ceased that he was not justified in remaining with so valuable a cargo but was bound to make the best of his way to liverpool he was right and his conduct was approved of by mr trevannion who looked for your arrival every hour at last a week passed away and you did not make your appearance and great alarm was entertained for your safety the weeks grew into months and it was supposed that you had been upset in the same hurricane which had driven the amy so far off from her rendezvous the poor girl whyna was as you may suppose kindly received by mr trevannion and his daughter and soon gained their affection but she pined for your return and when she was told that you were dead she never recovered it the climate certainly did not agree with her and she contracted a very bad cough during the winter but i believe from my heart that it was your loss which affected her the most severely after she had been about eighteen months in england she fell into a consumption and died poor whyna said i with a sigh alexander said philip perhaps it was all for the best for that poor girl loved you sincerely and supposing that she was now still alive and living with miss trevannion and on your return your marriage should which of course unless heaven decrees otherwise it will take place that poor creature would have been very unhappy and although the idea of her being a rival to miss trevannion is something which may appear absurd to us yet she had the same feelings and must have endured the same pangs as any other woman let her colour be what it may i think therefore that her removal was a blessing and a happy dispensation i saw mr trevannion and his daughter but once previous to their receiving your letters from rio acquainting them with your misfortunes and happy deliverance from slavery they were both very dejected and mr trevannion talked of retiring from business and living upon his property near liverpool as i corresponded regularly with amy i learnt that he had done so and had just wound up his affairs when your letters arrived from rio with an order on the portuguese exchequer for a considerable sum i hardly need say that the joy occasioned by this intelligence was great amy recovered her good looks and her father bitterly lamented his having retired from business as he had wished to have made the whole over to you the money you remitted from rio he considered as your own and he also set apart your share of the business from the time that you were admitted as a partner he was not aware that you could carry a diamond of such immense value about your person exposed to the view of every one among indians settlers and pirates that my delight was equal to theirs you will i am sure give me credit to believe and although i was obliged to sail for the west indies every day i anticipated receiving a letter informing me of your arrival in england judge then my distress at first receiving letters stating that you had not been heard of for three months after your leaving rio and expressions of fear that some accident had happened and then month after month many more and more desponding letters in which mr trevannion plainly stated that the xebeque must have foundered and only amy clinging to the hope that you were still alive i acknowledge that i considered you dead and you may therefore imagine my surprise and delight when your signature on the slip of paper proved that you were not only in existence but on board of the same vessel with me such was the narrative of my brother philip in return for mine and it was late at night when we parted oh how sincerely did i pray that night thanking heaven for all its mercies and entreating that the cup might not be again dashed from my lips when i arose the next morning i found that philip was on deck and i followed him we shall soon be in port royal with this wind said he and i hope to find the admiral still there i had some conversation with the officers and then went below to see toplift he was in his hammock for he had much fever and suffered from his wound but the surgeon said that he would do well toplift said i you must keep your mind at ease for my brother has promised me that you shall not be tried with the others and has no doubt that when he explains the whole to the admiral you will be thanked for your service thanked said toplift if i am not hanged i shall be fortunate enough no fear of that replied i so keep your mind easy and get well as fast as you can well then sir you have saved my life at all events for had you not come on board no one would have ever spoken for me or believed that i was not a pirate in heart like all the others except the two portuguese if necessary they will be evidence in your favour but i do not think any evidence will be required except mine and that will be sufficient with the admiral i promised you that you should never want the means of getting your livelihood and i repeat that promise now thank you sir replied he and i then left him and went up to the cabin to breakfast the following day we were at anchor at port royal my brother reported what had occurred and the admiral sent for all the pirate prisoners except toplift whose case was so fully represented by me and my brother that he was permitted to go at large and to take a passage home to england free of expense if he wished it it is hardly necessary to say that toplift accepted this offer and remained in the vessel with me the two portuguese were also liberated three days after our arrival we sailed for england and after a quick run of between five and six weeks we anchored at spithead my brother could not leave his ship and i therefore requested him to write to liverpool stating that he had intelligence of me and that i was alive that i had been wrecked and had fallen into the hands of the indians near the english settlements in virginia and that i had escaped and was he believed at james town i considered it wise to make a communication like this at first as too sudden an announcement might be dangerous to one in so weak a state of health as philip stated my amy to be from the letter he had received from her father i remained with him at portsmouth until the reply came mr trevannion wrote and told philip that his communication had as it were raised his daughter from the graveas she had fallen into a state of profound melancholy which nothing could removethat he had very cautiously introduced the subject and by degrees told her what was reported and eventually when he found that she was more composed that he had put philips letter into her hand he concluded that he trusted that i would arrive and soon for if any accident was now to happen to me it would be the death of his daughter who had not strength enough left to bear another reverse at my request philip then wrote that he had received a letter from a brother officer stating that i was well and safe on board and that they would be in england a few days after the receipt of the letter leaving directions to philip how to proceed i now went off to london and having fitted myself out with every requisite of dress and toilet i called upon a celebrated jew diamond merchant and showed him my diamond requesting that he would weigh it and then estimate its value he was much astonished at the sight of such a stone as well he might be and after weighing it and examining it he pronounced it worth l provided a purchaser could be found for an article of such value i told him that i was not a merchant and could not be travelling about to show the diamond to crowned heads but if he would give me a liberal price for it i would abate a great deal that he might dispose of it to his own advantage he requested that he might call upon me with two of his friends that they might see the diamond and consult with him and then he would give me an answer we fixed the time for twelve oclock on the following day and i took my leave the next day he called at the time appointed accompanied by two gentlemen of his own persuasion they weighed the stone again very carefully examined it by the light of a powerful lamp to ascertain its water and to see if there were any flaws in it calculated the reduction of weight which would take place in cutting it and after a consultation i was offered l i considered this an offer that i ought not to refuse and i closed with them the next day the affair was settled i received money and bills on government to the amount and wrote to philip telling him what had taken place strange that from two slaves in the mines i should have received such valuable legacies from poor ingram a diamond worth so much money and from the other englishman a tattered bible which made me a sincere christiana legacy in comparison of which the diamond was as dross philip replied to my letter congratulating me on the sale of the diamond and informing me that to his letter he had received a reply containing so satisfactory an account of amys restored health that he had written to tell them that i had arrived safe in england and would be very soon with them he recommended my going immediately as the anxiety and suspense would be very injurious to amys health i therefore made every arrangement for my departure purchased horses and procured four stout serving men well armed to accompany me and wrote a letter which i sent by an express courier stating the exact day which i expected to arrive at mr trevannions country seat i waited in london two days to wind up all my affairs and to give time for the express to arrive before me as i intended to travel very fast my stay in london was the occasion of an important discovery i was at the coffeehouse at st pauls and was talking with one of captain levees officers with whom i had picked up an acquaintance when on his calling me by the name of musgrave a pinchedup sort of looking personage in a black suit who was standing at the baywindow turned round and coming up to me said sir as a stranger i must apologize but hearing your friend call you by the name of musgrave may i venture to ask if you are any relative to sir richard musgrave baronet who lived in cumberland lived did you say sir is he then dead yes sir he has been dead these last seven months and we are looking out for his heir and cannot find him i knew the family very well replied i for i am connected with it his eldest son richard of course must be his heir as all the estates are entailed his eldest son richard sir is dead we have authenticated documents to prove that and moreover his second son charles is also dead he came home very ill and died not at his fathers house but at the house of one of his tenants on the estate it is his third son alexander musgrave whom we seek and seek in vain he is now the heir to the baronetcy and estates but we have lost all clue to him we understand that a captain philip musgrave is just arrived from the west indies he is we presume the fourth son but until we can find out what has become of alexander musgrave and whether he is dead or alive we cannot act i have written this day to captain musgrave requesting any information he can give but have received no answer i presume sir it is useless to inquire of you not exactly sir for i am the alexander musgrave you seek indeed sir but what proof have you of your identity to offer to us the evidence of my brother captain philip musgrave in whose ship i have just arrived from the west indies that his answer to your letter will be satisfactory enough i have no doubt here is a letter from him to me in which you see he addresses me my dear alexander and concludes with your affectionate brother philip musgrave this is indeed satisfactory sir replied the gentleman and i have only to receive an answer from your brother to make all right and clear allow me sir to congratulate you upon your accession to the title and property i presume you will have no objection as soon as the necessary proofs are obtained to accompany me down to cumberland where i doubt not you will be recognized by many of that sir i have not the slightest doubt replied i but i cannot go down with you to cumberland at present i leave london for liverpool the day after tomorrow on important business and cannot disappoint the parties well sir it must indeed be an important business which will prevent you from taking possession of a title and l per annum replied he but here is my address and i hope i shall hear from you as soon as possible as i shall remain in town till i can bring the heir down with me the man now looked as if he doubted me he could not imagine that i could neglect the taking possession of the estate for any other business and it did appear singular so i said to him sir i have been long out of england and am affianced to a young lady who lives near liverpool she has been waiting to hear from me for some time and i have sent an express to say that i will be with her on such a day i cannot disappoint her and i tell you more that without i possess her the possession of the title and estates will give me very little pleasure sir replied he making a bow i honour your sentiments and she must be a worthy lady who can inspire such feelings i only hope that you will not remain too long at liverpool as london is expensive and i am anxious to return to cumberland i then wished the gentleman farewell and went home to my lodgings i had given him my address in case he wanted to see me before my departure the next day i received a letter from philip inclosing the one written to him by this gentleman whose name was campbell and who was a lawyer philip told me what reply he had made to him and congratulated me on my accession to the title and estates almost an hour afterwards mr campbell called upon me with philips letter which he declared to be highly satisfactory and sufficient in any court of justice but said he i would wish to ask you a few particulars and i also would wish to make a few inquiries mr campbell i have heard your name in my youth although i cannot recollect ever having seen you i was the confidential adviser of your father at one time sir replied he but latterly all intercourse had ceased it was not until he was on his deathbed and fully repented the foolish step which he had taken and the injustice he had been guilty of that he sent for me much to the annoyance of lady musgrave who would have prevented me from coming into the house even when i arrived had it not been for the servants who disobeyed her and my sisters sir janet and mabel are both well and have grown up very fine girls your father destroyed the deed by which lady musgrave was to have had a large jointure upon the estate and she is now entirely dependent upon you for what she may receive when do you expect to be able to come up from liverpool i can hardly say but of course as soon as i can well sir my own affairs will require my presence in the metropolis for a month in the meantime although i should have preferred to have gone down with you to faristone hall and have at once put you in possession yet affairs may remain as they are for every thing is under seal and lady musgrave has been compelled to remove till it suits your convenience i shall however write to let them know that you have been found and will soon come down and take possession mr campbell then asked me a few questions to which i replied satisfactorily and then for the first time he saluted me with my title saying sir alexander i will now take my leave the next morning i set off on my journey and travelled with as much speed as the horses would permit i arrived on the fifth day at mr trevannions seat about nine miles from liverpool as i rode up the avenue of chestnut trees i perceived a female form looking out from an upper window which soon afterwards made a precipitate retreat i alighted and was received at the door in the embrace of mr trevannion who welcomed me with tears and taking me by the hand he led me into an apartment where i found my adored amy who threw herself into my arms and wept as if her heart would break but her sobs were the sobs of joy and when she did raise her head and look at me it was with eyes beaming with pleasure and with smiles upon her beautiful lips i clasped her to my bosom and felt that i was more than repaid for all i had suffered and my heart was throbbing with gratitude and love it was some time before we could sufficiently compose ourselves to enter into lengthened conversation and then amy inquired what had occurred to me to occasion such a lengthened absence we sat down on a sofa and with amy on one side of me and her father on the other i entered into my narrative and so you have been married since we last heard from you said amy smiling when i had finished my history yes replied i i have been but i hope i shall treat my second wife a little better than i did my first i hope so too replied amy but i have great fear that your virginian mistress may come over and claim you i do not think that likely from the indians having followed me to the beach they must have fallen in with her and what do you think became of her of course i cannot exactly say but i presume she died gallantly and fought with her axe to the last that evening i had a long conversation with mr trevannion he told me what he had done with the money which he considered as mine and i put into his care the sum i had received for the diamond i then spoke to him about our marriage and requested that it might not be postponed my dear musgrave said he my daughters happiness so depends upon her union with you that i can only say i am willing that it should take place tomorrow for yourself you know that i have the highest esteem and that you must be convinced of when i have consented to the match without even making inquiry as to your family and connections now however is the time that i should wish to have some information about them my dear sir if you will only make inquiries you will find that the family of musgrave is one of the most highly connected in the north and that the head of it is a or was sir richard musgrave baronet of faristone hall in cumberland i am a near relative of his as i can satisfactorily prove that is sufficient replied mr trevannion i shall leave you to plead your cause with amy tomorrow so now good night the following day i told amy that since my arrival in england i had heard of the death of my father and that it was necessary that i should go to the north as family affairs required my presence are you serious replied she never more so in my life my presence is absolutely necessary and i made arrangements with the legal adviser of our family that i would be there in less than a month it is a long journey said mr trevannion and how long to you stay that i cannot possibly say replied i but not longer than i can help i do not think that i shall let you go said amy you are not to be trusted out of sight you are so born for adventure that you will not be heard of again for another two years such is my misfortune i grant replied i but amy you look pale and thin change of air would do you much service suppose you and your father were to come with me indeed mr trevannion i am in earnest at this delightful time of the year nothing would prove so beneficial to her health and amy then you know that i shall not be out of your sight i should like the tour very much replied she but i know what you would say you do not like the idea of travelling with me as amy trevannion you are right then let me propose that you travel with me as amy musgrave i second that proposal said mr trevannion consent amy let our marriage be quite private i know you will prefer that it should be so and so will your father you will then travel with me as my wife and we never shall part again amy did not reply till her father said amy it is my wish that it should be so recollect it will be the last time that you have to obey your father so do not annoy me by a refusal i will not my dear father replied amy kissing him your last command i obey with pleasure and oh if i have sometimes been a wilful girl forgive me every thing at this moment my dear child i have nothing to forgive may god bless you and mr musgrave said he putting her hand in mine if she proves as good a wife as she has been a daughter you now receive a treasure and i felt that the old man stated what was true it was arranged that the marriage should take place on that day week and that it should be quite private there was no parade of bridal clothes in fact no one was invited and it was at my request quite a secret marriage a clergyman had been engaged to perform the ceremony and on the day appointed i received the hand of my amy in the drawingroom and in the presence only of humphrey and two other confidential servants after the ceremony was over the clergyman requested me to come with him into the adjoining room and said it was necessary that he should give a certificate of the marriage which must be inserted in the parish register he had called me aside for that purpose that i might give him my exact name profession c my name is alexander musgrave as you have heard when you married us yes i know that but i must be particular have you no other name is that the name that you have been and will be in future known by not exactly replied i i have been known by that name but in future shall not be then what am i to say you must say sir alexander musgrave baronet of faristone hall cumberland good said he that is what i required and the lady your wife has she any other name but amy none i believe the clergyman then wrote out the marriage certificate and signed it taking a copy for registry and we returned into the drawingroom here is the certificate of marriage madam said he it ought to be in the care of the lady and therefore my lady i hand it over to you my lady is much obliged to you for your kindness replied amy for she thought that the clergyman was only facetious she held the certificate in her hand folded as it had been given her for some time at last curiosity or perhaps having nothing else to do induced her to open it and read it i was at this time talking with the clergyman and presenting him with a handsome douceur for his trouble but perceiving her to open the certificate i watched her countenance she read and started i turned away as if not observing her she then went up to her father and desired him to read it the old gentleman took out his glasses and it was amusing to see the way in which he looked at his daughter with his spectacles falling off his nose he then came up and pointing to the certificate said pray how am i in future to address my daughter as amy i trust sir unless you wish to scold her and then you must call her lady musgrave i am my dear sir as the certificate states sir alexander musgrave of faristone with a handsome property descended to me i did not know it till i arrived in london and if i concealed it from you till now it was only that my amy should have the satisfaction of proving to me that she wedded me in pure disinterestedness of affection it was very very kind of you alexander to do as you have done and i thank you sincerely for it and now my dear amy you understand why i wished you to come with me to cumberland that you may take possession of your future abode and assume that position in society which you will so much grace i trust sir continued i that you will not part from us and that one roof will always cover us as long as heaven thinks fit to spare our lives may god bless you both replied mr trevannion i cannot part with you and must follow about half an hour after this i requested amy and mr trevannion to sit by me as i had now another narrative to give them which was an explanation why and how it was that they found me in the position that they had done in short what were the causes that induced me and afterwards my brother philip to quit our parental roof and to come to the resolution of fighting our own way in the world it was as follows sir richard musgrave my father married a young lady of high connection a miss arabella johnson and with her lived i have every reason to believe a very happy life for nearly twentyfive years when it pleased god to summon her away i have a good recollection of my mother for although i lived with my brother at a private tutors about six miles off i was continually at home and she did not die till i was nearly sixteen and i can only say that a more elegant amiable and truly virtuous woman as i believe never existed by this marriage my father had four sons and two daughters richard the eldest charles the second myself the third and philip the fourth and my sisters who came last were named janet and mabel at the time of my mothers death my eldest brother was serving with the army which he had entered from a love of the profession although as heir to the baronetcy and estates which are a clear l per annum he of course had no occasion for a profession my second brother charles being of an adventurous turn had gone out to the east indies in a high position as servant to the company i was still at home as well as philip who is four years my junior and my sisters were of course at home i pass over my regrets at my mothers death and will now speak more of my father he was a goodtempered weak man easily led and although during my mothers lifetime he was so well led that it was of little consequence the case proved very different at her death for a year my father remained quiet in the house content with superintending his improvements on his property and he had lately become infirm and had given up the hounds and rural sports in general the dairy was one of his principal hobbies and it so happened that a young girl the daughter of a labourer was one of the females employed in that part of the establishment she was certainly remarkably goodlooking her features were very small and she did not show that robust frame which people in her class of life generally do she was about seventeen years old slight in figure and certainly a person that you would not pass without making some commendatory remark upon her good looks and modest appearance she was not however what she appeared she was beyond measure cunning and astute and as it proved inordinately ambitious my father who was naturally of an amorous disposition was attracted by her and very soon was constantly in the dairy and his attentions were so marked that the other servants used to call her my lady a few months after my father had shown a preference for this girl he was seized with his first attack of gout it did not last him long and in six weeks he was about again and resumed his attentions to her philip and i who were at our tutors when we came home heard from others what was going on and very foolishly played the girl many tricks and annoyed her as much as we could after we returned my father had another fit of the gout and when he was confined to his room he desired this girl to be sent for to attend upon him i cannot say what took place but this is certain that my fathers unfortunate passion became so great and i presume the girls ambition rose in proportion that about six months afterwards this daughter of a menial was raised to the dignity of lady musgraveshe being at that time about eighteen and my father verging on seventy when this illassorted and disgraceful connection was known the gentry and aristocracy of the county refused any longer to visit my father and all communication was broken off in a short time the ascendency which this artful girl gained over the old man was most wonderful he lived but in her sight and knew no will but hers her father and family were removed to a good house in the neighbourhood and gave themselves all the airs of gentlepeople the good old steward was dismissed and her father established in his room although the man could not read or write and was wholly unfit for the office the expense which she launched out into by his permission was excessive new liveries new coaches diamonds and dresses fit for the courtindeed every kind of luxury that could be conceived and much greater than my father could afford she now showed herself in her true colours vindictive and tyrannical to excess she dismissed all the old servants and oppressed all those to whom she owed a grudge yet my poor father could see nothing but perfection in her it was not till four months after the marriage that philip and i came home and our new stepmother had not forgotten our treatment of her she treated us with great harshness refused our taking meals at my fathers table and ordered us the coarsest fare and when we complained to my father denied every thing that we said as we found that we could not induce our father to listen to us or to believe us we tried all we could and retaliated and annoyed her as much if not more than she annoyed us by talking of her mean origin and her former occupation we defied her and in so doing we ruined ourselves for after a useless struggle on my fathers part he gave way to her imperious commands and sending for me told me that i had become such a reprobate that i was no longer a son of his he threw me a purse telling me that it was all i might expect from him and that i was instantly to leave the house and never show my face in it any more i replied with more spirit than respect that it was high time that the son of a gentleman and lady should leave the house when such lowborn creatures were installed in it as the mistress my father in a rage flung his crutch at my head and i left the room as i went out i met her in the passage she had evidently been listening to what had passed and she was full of exultation it is your turn now you shedevil said i in my rage but wait till my father dies you shall go amilking again i do not mean to defend my conduct but i was then no seventeen and that must be my excuse i little thought when i said so that it would be from my hands that she would have to receive bounty but so it is as mr campbell informs me that my father destroyed previous to his death the papers which he had signed to secure her a large jointure on the estate i set off with my wardrobe and the purse of twenty guineas which my father had given me and having a desire to see the world i went on board of a merchant vessel six months afterwards when we were at liverpool i went on board of a privateer the remainder of my history you are already acquainted with as soon as she had wreaked her vengeance upon me my brother philip was the next but he was too young at that time to be turned adrift so she put it off till the time should come irritating and weaning my father from him by every means in her power three years afterwards she succeeded in having him dismissed also and you know how i found him out all these circumstances were very well known in the neighbourhood and to our own relations and one only my aunt called upon my father and after a long conversation my father consented that my sisters should go away and remain under her charge my stepmothers violent temper her exactions her imperious conduct which was now shown even towards him with what my aunt had advanced had to a certain extent opened my fathers eyes he perceived that she had no other view but her own aggrandisement and that she cared little for him her repeated attempts however to make him sign in her favour in case of his death were successful and it was not till after her conduct had alienated him from her and he deplored the loss of his children that he committed the deed to the flames about three years after i had quitted the house my eldest brother who had information of all that had passed and who remained in the army because he declared that he never would go home till after his fathers death was killed by a cannonball and my second brother died of a fever about a year ago when resident at the court of a native prince i had heard nothing of these deaths or of my fathers until my arrival in london of course i was most anxious to go down to cumberland if it were only to undo the wickedness which this woman had done and to make amends to those whom she had so cruelly treated i do not feel any spirit of revenge but i feel that justice demands it of me and i shall go with you with pleasure to help you in your good work said amy and also because i want to see how she will now behave to one whom she has so persecuted and who has become the arbiter of her fate well amy i will not trust myself on this question you shall be the arbitress of her fate and what you decide shall be irrevocable i fully appreciate the compliment you pay me said she but i prefer that it should be decided in council and we will call in my father to our assistance a fortnight after our marriage we set off for london in a coach with six handsome black horses and eight armed servants in liveries on horseback we arrived safely on the seventh day and there we reposed for a time previous to setting out for cumberland my aunt was in london and attending the court which i was not aware of and with her were my two sisters janet and mabel whom i had not seen for years and who warmly embraced me promising that they would soon come down and take up their abode at the hall they expressed their admiration of amy but in so doing they only followed the general opinion for it was impossible to see and not admire her elegance and beauty my aunt showed us every attention and we were presented to his majesty who was pleased to compliment lady musgrave in very flattering terms we were joined in london by my brother philip who had paid off his ship and the day after he joined us i said philip there are only you and i left do you recollect when you inquired about the diamond the day we met on board of your ship what reply i made to you yes you said that you were afraid that you could not afford to make me a present of it at that time i did not think so philip but now i know that i can and i have desired mr trevannion to put out to good security the l that the diamond was sold for in your name and for your use youll not hesitate to accept it philip for you know that i can afford it i do not hesitate my dear alexander because i would do the same to you and you would not refuse me at the same time that is no reason that i should not thank you kindly for your generous behaviour philip accompanied us on our journey to cumberland it was tedious for the roads were any thing but good but the beauty of the scenery compensated for the ruggedness of the way in six days we arrived at the hall where mr campbell who had called upon me on my arrival in london had preceded me to make preparations for our reception which was enthusiastic to the highest degree we were called upon and congratulated by all the county who were delighted to find that such a personage as amy was to be the future mistress as soon as all this bustle and excitement were over i sat down with mr campbell to look over the state of affairs and to set things to rights after having done justice to many claimants engaged again the old servants that had been discharged promised farms to the tenants who had been unfairly turned out c we then proceeded to decide upon what was to be done to the dowager lady musgrave it appears that at my fathers death when she found that the deed had been destroyed by his own hands in presence of others she became frantic with rage and immediately hastened to secure the family jewels and every article of value that she could lay her hands upon but mr campbell having due notice of what she was about came in time to prevent her taking them away and putting seals upon every thing and leaving careful guards in the hall my lady had gone to her fathers house where she still remained she had on my arrival sent me a message imploring my mercy and reminding me that whatever might be her errors she was still the lawful wife of my father and she trusted that respect to his memory would induce me to allow her sufficient to maintain her as lady musgrave should be we had the consultation that amy proposed and called in mr campbell as a fourth and it was at last decided that on consideration that she removed with her family to a distance of fifty miles from faristone she should have an income of l per annum as long as she conducted herself with propriety and did not marry again the last clause was the only one which she complained of mr campbell had at the request of my father discharged lady musgraves parent from the office of steward and called in the old steward to resume his situation and before dismissal he had to refund certain sums of money not accounted for i have now told my eventful tale i have only to add that after all that i have passed through i have been rewarded by many years of unalloyed happiness my two sisters are well married and my three children are all that a father could wish such my dear madam have been the vicissitudes of a privateersman and i now subscribe myself your most obedient alexander musgrave the end printed by bernh tauchnitz jun transcribers note this book uses some archaic and alternative spellingfor example befal

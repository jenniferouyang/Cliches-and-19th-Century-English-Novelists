scanned by john edward heaton in guatemala note another different print edition of this book has been posted as etext mr midshipman easy by frederick marryat chapter i which the reader will find very easy to read mr nicodemus easy was a gentleman who lived down in hampshire he was a married man and in very easy circumstances most couples find it very easy to have a family but not always quite so easy to maintain them mr easy was not at all uneasy on the latter score as he had no children but he was anxious to have them as most people covet what they cannot obtain after ten years mr easy gave it up as a bad job philosophy is said to console a man under disappointment although shakespeare asserts that it is no remedy for toothache so mr easy turned philosopher the very best profession a man can take up when he is fit for nothing else he must be a very incapable person indeed who cannot talk nonsense for some time mr easy could not decide upon what description his nonsense should consist of at last he fixed upon the rights of man equality and all that how every person was born to inherit his share of the earth a right at present only admitted to a certain length that is about six feet for we all inherit our graves and are allowed to take possession without dispute but no one would listen to mr easys philosophy the women would not acknowledge the rights of men whom they declared always to be in the wrong and as the gentlemen who visited mr easy were all men of property they could not perceive the advantages of sharing with those who had none however they allowed him to discuss the question while they discussed his port wine the wine was good if the arguments were not and we must take things as we find them in this world while mr easy talked philosophy mrs easy played patience and they were a very happy couple riding side by side on their hobbies and never interfering with each other mr easy knew his wife could not understand him and therefore did not expect her to listen very attentively and mrs easy did not care how much her husband talked provided she was not put out in her game mutual forbearance will always ensure domestic felicity there was another cause for their agreeing so well upon any disputed question mr easy invariably gave it up to mrs easy telling her that she should have her own way and this pleased his wife but as mr easy always took care when it came to the point to have his way he was pleased as well it is true that mrs easy had long found out that she did not have her own way long but she was of an easy disposition and as in nine cases out of ten it was of very little consequence how things were done she was quite satisfied with his submission during the heat of the argument mr easy had admitted that she was right and if like all men he would do wrong why what could a poor woman do with a lady of such a quiet disposition it is easy to imagine that the domestic felicity of mr easy was not easily disturbed but as people have observed before there is a mutability in human affairs it was at the finale of the eleventh year of their marriage that mrs easy at first complained that she could not enjoy her breakfast mrs easy had her own suspicions everybody else considered it past doubt all except mr easy he little thought good easy man that his greatness was ripening he had decided that to have an heir was no easy task and it never came into his calculations that there could be a change in his wifes figure you might have added to it subtracted from it divided it or multiplied it but as it was a zero the result would be always the same mrs easy also was not quite sureshe believed it might be the case there was no saying it might be a mistake like that of mrs trunnions in the novel and therefore she said nothing to her husband about the matter at last mr easy opened his eyes and when upon interrogating his wife he found out the astounding truth he opened his eyes still wider and then he snapped his fingers and danced like a bear upon hot plates with delight thereby proving that different causes may produce similar effects in two instances at one and the same time the bear dances from pain mr easy from pleasure and again when we are indifferent or do not care for anything we snap our fingers at it and when we are overjoyed and obtain what we most care for we also snap our fingers two months after mr easy snapped his fingers mrs easy felt no inclination to snap hers either from indifference or pleasure the fact was that mrs easys time was come to undergo what shakespeare pronounces the pleasing punishment that women bears but mrs easy like the rest of her sex declared that all men were liars and most particularly poets but while mrs easy was suffering mr easy was in ecstasies he laughed at pain as all philosophers do when it is suffered by other people and not by themselves in due course of time mrs easy presented her husband with a fine boy whom we present to the public as our hero chapter ii in which mrs easy as usual has her own way it was the fourth day after mrs easys confinement that mr easy who was sitting by her bedside in an easy chair commenced as follows i have been thinking my dear mrs easy about the name i shall give this child name mr easy why what name should you give it but your own not so my dear replied mr easy they call all names proper names but i think that mine is not it is the very worst name in the calendar why whats the matter with it mr easy the matter affects me as well as the boy nicodemus is a long name to write at full length and nick is vulgar besides as there will be two nicks they will naturally call my boy young nick and of course i shall be styled old nick which will be diabolical well mr easy at all events then let me choose the name that you shall my dear and it was with this view that i have mentioned the subject so early i think mr easy i will call the boy after my poor fatherhis name shall be robert very well my dear if you wish it it shall be robert you shall have your own way but i think my dear upon a little consideration you will acknowledge that there is a decided objection an objection mr easy yes my dear robert may be very well but you must reflect upon the consequences he is certain to be called bob well my dear and suppose they do call him bob i cannot bear even the supposition my dear you forget the county in which we are residing the downs covered with sheep why mr easy what can sheep have to do with a christian name there it is women never look to consequences my dear they have a great deal to do with the name of bob i will appeal to any farmer in the county if ninetynine shepherds dogs out of one hundred are not called bob now observe your child is out of doors somewhere in the fields or plantations you want and you call him instead of your child what do you find why a dozen curs at least who come running up to you all answering to the name of bob and wagging their stumps of tails you see mrs easy it is a dilemma not to be got over you level your only son to the brute creation by giving him a christian name which from its peculiar brevity has been monopolised by all the dogs in the county any other name you please my dear but in this one instance you must allow me to lay my positive veto well then let me seebut ill think of it mr easy my head aches very much just now i will think for you my dear what do you say to john o no mr easy such a common name a proof of its popularity my dear it is scripturalwe have the apostle and the baptistwe have a dozen popes who were all johns it is royalwe have plenty of kings who were johnsand moreover it is short and sounds honest and manly yes very true my dear but they will call him jack well we have had several celebrated characters who were jacks there waslet me seejack the giant killer and jack of the bean stockand jack jack jack spratt replied mrs easy and jack cade mrs easy the great rebeland threefingered jack mrs easy the celebrated negroand above all jack falstaff maam jack falstaffhonest jack falstaff witty jack falstaff i thought mr easy that i was to be permitted to choose the name well so you shall my dear i give it up to you do just as you please but depend upon it that john is the right name is it not now my dear its the way you always treat me mr easy you say that you give it up and that i shall have my own way but i never do have it i am sure that the child will be christened john nay my dear it shall be just what you please now i recollect it there were several greek emperors who were johns but decide for yourself my dear no no replied mrs easy who was ill and unable to contend any longer i give it up mr easy i know how it will be as it always is you give me my own way as people give pieces of gold to children its their own money but they must not spend it pray call him john there my dear did not i tell you you would be of my opinion upon reflection i knew you would i have given you your own way and you tell me to call him john so now were both of the same mind and that point is settled i should like to go to sleep mr easy i feel far from well you shall always do just as you like my dear replied the husband and have your own way in everything it is the greatest pleasure i have when i yield to your wishes i will walk in the garden goodbye my dear mrs easy made no reply and the philosopher quitted the room as may easily be imagined on the following day the boy was christened john chapter iii in which our hero has to wait the issue of an argument the reader may observe that in general all my first chapters are very short and increase in length as the work advances i mention this as a proof of my modesty and diffidence at first i am like a young bird just out of its mothers nest pluming my little feathers and taking short flights by degrees i obtain more confidence and wing my course over hill and dale it is very difficult to throw any interest into a chapter on childhood there is the same uniformity in all children until they develop we cannot therefore say much relative to jack easys earliest days he sucked and threw up his milk while the nurse blessed it for a pretty dear slept and sucked again he crowed in the morning like a cock screamed when he was washed stared at the candle and made wry faces with the wind six months passed in these innocent amusements and then he was put into shorts but i ought here to have remarked that mrs easy did not find herself equal to nursing her own infant and it was necessary to look out for a substitute now a commonplace person would have been satisfied with the recommendation of the medical man who looks but to the one thing needful which is a sufficient and wholesome supply of nourishment for the child but mr easy was a philosopher and had latterly taken to craniology and he descanted very learnedly with the doctor upon the effect of his only son obtaining his nutriment from an unknown source who knows observed mr easy but that my son may not imbibe with his milk the very worst passions of human nature i have examined her replied the doctor and can safely recommend her that examination is only preliminary to one more important replied mr easy i must examine her examine who mr easy exclaimed his wife who had lain down again on the bed the nurse my dear examine what mr easy continued the lady her head my dear replied the husband i must ascertain what her propensities are i think you had better leave her alone mr easy she comes this evening and i shall question her pretty severely doctor middleton what do you know of this young person i know madam that she is very healthy and strong or i should not have selected her but is her character good really madam i know little about her character but you can make any inquiries you please but at the same time i ought to observe that if you are too particular in that point you will have some difficulty in providing yourself well i shall see replied mrs easy and i shall feel rejoined the husband this parleying was interrupted by the arrival of the very person in question who was announced by the housemaid and was ushered in she was a handsome florid healthylooking girl awkward and naive in her manner and apparently not over wise there was more of the dove than of the serpent in her composition mr easy who was very anxious to make his own discoveries was the first who spoke young woman come this way i wish to examine your head oh dear me sir its quite clean i assure you cried the girl dropping a curtsey doctor middleton who sat between the bed and mr easys chair rubbed his hands and laughed in the meantime mr easy had untied the string and taken off the cap of the young woman and was very busy putting his fingers through her hair during which the face of the young woman expressed fear and astonishment i am glad to perceive that you have a large portion of benevolence yes replied the young woman dropping a curtsey and veneration also thanky sir and the organ of modesty is strongly developed yes sir replied the girl with a smile thats quite a new organ thought dr middleton philoprogenitiveness very powerful if you please sir i dont know what that is answered sarah with a curtsey nevertheless you have given us a practical illustration mrs easy i am satisfied have you any questions to ask but it is quite unnecessary to be sure i have mr easy pray young woman what is your name sarah if you please maam how long have you been married married maam yes married if you please maam i had a misfortune maam replied the girl casting down her eyes what have you not been married no maam not yet good heavens dr middleton what can you mean by bringing this person here exclaimed mrs easy not a married woman and she has a child if you please maam interrupted the young woman dropping a curtsey it was a very little one a very little one exclaimed mrs easy yes maam very small indeed and died soon after it was born oh dr middletonwhat could you mean dr middleton my dear madam exclaimed the doctor rising from his chair this is the only person that i could find suited to the wants of your child and if you do not take her i cannot answer for its life it is true that a married woman might be procured but married women who have a proper feeling will not desert their own children and as mr easy asserts and you appear to imagine the temper and disposition of your child may be affected by the nourishment it receives i think it more likely to be injured by the milk of a married woman who will desert her own child for the sake of gain the misfortune which has happened to this young woman is not always a proof of a bad heart but of strong attachment and the overweening confidence of simplicity you are correct doctor replied mr easy and her head proves that she is a modest young woman with strong religious feeling kindness of disposition and every other requisite the head may prove it all for what i know mr easy but her conduct tells another tale she is well fitted for the situation maam continued the doctor and if you please maam rejoined sarah it was such a little one shall i try the baby maam said the monthly nurse who had listened in silence it is fretting so poor thing and has its dear little fist right down its throat dr middleton gave the signal of assent and in a few seconds master john easy was fixed to sarah as tight as a leech lord love it how hungry it isthere there stop it a moment its choking poor thing mrs easy who was lying on her bed rose up and went to the child her first feeling was that of envy that another should have such a pleasure which was denied to herself the next that of delight at the satisfaction expressed by the infant in a few minutes the child fell back in a deep sleep mrs easy was satisfied maternal feelings conquered all others and sarah was duly installed to make short work of it we have said that jack easy in six months was in shorts he soon afterwards began to crawl and show his legs indeed so indecorously that it was evident that he had imbibed no modesty with sarahs milk neither did he appear to have gained veneration or benevolence for he snatched at everything squeezed the kitten to death scratched his mother and pulled his father by the hair notwithstanding all which both his father and mother and the whole household declared him to be the finest and sweetest child in the universe but if we were to narrate all the wonderful events of jacks childhood from the time of his birth up to the age of seven years as chronicled by sarah who continued his dry nurse after he had been weaned it would take at least three volumes folio jack was brought up in the way that every only child usually isthat is he was allowed to have his own way chapter iv in which the doctor prescribes going to school as a remedy for a cut finger have you no idea of putting the boy to school mr easy said dr middleton who had been summoned by a groom with his horse in a foam to attend immediately at forest hill the name of mr easys mansion and who upon his arrival had found that master easy had cut his thumb one would have thought that he had cut his head off by the agitation pervading the whole householdmr easy walking up and down very uneasy mrs easy with great difficulty prevented from syncope and all the maids bustling and passing round mrs easys chair everybody appeared excited except master jack easy himself who with a rag round his finger and his pinafore spotted with blood was playing at bobcherry and cared nothing about the matter well whats the matter my little man said dr middleton on entering addressing himself to jack as the most sensible of the whole party oh dr middleton interrupted mrs easy he has cut his hand im sure that a nerve is divided and then the lockjaw the doctor made no reply but examined the finger jack easy continued to play bobcherry with his right hand have you such a thing as a piece of stickingplaster in the house madam observed the doctor after examination o yes run mary run sarah in a few seconds the maids appeared sarah bringing the stickingplaster and mary following with the scissors make yourself quite easy madam said dr middleton after he put on the plaster i will answer for no evil consequences had i not better take him upstairs and let him lie down a little replied mrs easy slipping a guinea into the doctors hand it is not absolutely requisite madam said the doctor but at all events he will be kept out of more mischief come my dear you hear what dr middleton says yes i heard replied jack but i shant go my dear johnnycome lovenow do my dear johnny johnny played bobcherry and made no answer come master johnny said sarah go away sarah said johnny with a backhander oh fie master johnny said mary johnny my love said mrs easy in a coaxing tone come nowwill you go ill go in the garden and get some more cherries replied master johnny come then love we will go into the garden master johnny jumped off his chair and took his mamma by the hand what a dear good obedient child it is exclaimed mrs easy you may lead him with a thread yes to pick cherries thought dr middleton mrs easy and johnny and sarah and mary went into the garden leaving dr middleton alone with mr easy who had been silent during this scene now dr middleton was a clever sensible man who had no wish to impose upon anyone as for his taking a guinea for putting on a piece of stickingplaster his conscience was very easy on that score his time was equally valuable whether he were employed for something or nothing and moreover he attended the poor gratis constantly in the house he had seen much of mr john easy and perceived that he was a courageous decided boy of a naturally good disposition but from the idiosyncrasy of the father and the doting folly of the mother in a sure way of being spoiled as soon therefore as the lady was out of hearing he took a chair and made the query at the commencement of the chapter which we shall now repeat have you no idea of putting the boy to school mr easy mr easy crossed his legs and clasped his hands together over his knees as he always did when he was about to commence an argument the great objection that i have to sending a boy to school dr middleton is that i conceive that the discipline enforced is not only contrary to the rights of man but also in opposition to all sound sense and common judgment not content with punishment which is in itself erroneous and an infringement of social justice they even degrade the minds of the boys still more by applying punishment to the most degraded part adding contumely to tyranny of course it is intended that a boy who is sent to school should gain by precept and example but is he to learn benevolence by the angry look and the flourish of the vindictive birchor forbearance by the cruelty of the ushersor patience when the masters over him are out of all patience or modesty when his nether parts are exposed to general examination is he not daily reading a lesson at variance with that equality which we all possess but of which we are unjustly deprived why should there be a distinction between the flogger and the floggee are they not both fashioned alike after gods image endowed with the same reason having an equal right to what the world offers and which was intended by providence to be equally distributed is it not that the sacred inheritance of all which has tyrannously and impiously been ravished from the many for the benefit of the few and which ravishment from long custom of iniquity and inculcation of false precepts has too long been basely submitted to is it not the duty of a father to preserve his only son from imbibing these dangerous and debasing errors which will render him only one of a vile herd who are content to suffer provided that they live and yet are not these very errors inculcated at school and impressed upon their mind inversely by the birch do not they there receive their first lesson in slavery with the first lesson in a b c and are not their minds thereby prostrated so as never to rise again but ever to bow to despotism to cringe to rank to think and act by the precepts of others and to tacitly disavow that sacred equality which is our birthright no sir without they can teach without resorting to such a fundamental error as flogging my boy shall never go to school and mr easy threw himself back in his chair imagining like all philosophers that he had said something very clever dr middleton knew his man and therefore patiently waited until he had exhausted his oratory i will grant said the doctor at last that all you say may have great truth in it but mr easy do you not think that by not permitting a boy to be educated you allow him to remain more open to that very error of which you speak it is only education which will conquer prejudice and enable a man to break through the trammels of custom now allowing that the birch is used yet it is at a period when the young mind is so elastic as to soon become indifferent and after he has attained the usual rudiments of education you will then find him prepared to receive those lessons which you can yourself instil i will teach him everything myself replied mr easy folding his arms consequentially and determinedly i do not doubt your capability mr easy but unfortunately you will always have a difficulty which you never can get over excuse me i know what you are capable of and the boy would indeed be happy with such a preceptor butif i must speak plainyou must be aware as well as i am that the maternal fondness of mrs easy will always be a bar to your intention he is already so spoiled by her that he will not obey and without obedience you cannot inculcate i grant my dear sir that there is a difficulty on that point but maternal weakness must then be overcome by paternal severity may i ask how mr easy for it appears to me impossible impossible by heavens ill make him obey or illhere mr easy stopped before the word flog was fairly out of his mouthill know the reason why dr middleton dr middleton checked his inclination to laugh and replied that you would hit upon some scheme by which you would obtain the necessary power over him i have no doubt but what will be the consequence the boy will consider his mother as a protector and you as a tyrant he will have an aversion to you and with that aversion he will never pay respect and attention to your valuable precepts when he arrives at an age to understand them now it appears to me that this difficulty which you have raised may be got over i know a very worthy clergyman who does not use the birch but i will write and put the direct question to him and then if your boy is removed from the danger arising from mrs easys overindulgence in a short time he will be ready for your more important tuition i think replied mr easy after a pause that what you say merits consideration i acknowledge that in consequence of mrs easys nonsensical indulgence the boy is unruly and will not obey me at present and if your friend does not apply the rod i will think seriously of sending my son john to him to learn the elements the doctor had gained his point by flattering the philosopher in a day he returned with a letter from the pedagogue in answer to one supposed to be sent to him in which the use of the birch was indignantly disclaimed and mr easy announced to his wife when they met that day at teatime his intentions with regard to his son john to school mr easy what send johnny to school a mere infant to school surely my dear you must be aware that at nine years it is high time that he learnt to read why he almost reads already mr easy surely i can teach him that does he not sarah lord bless him yes maam he was saying his letters yesterday oh mr easy what can have put this in your head johnny dear come heretell me now whats the letter a you were singing it in the garden this morning i want some sugar replied johnny stretching his arm over the table to the sugarbasin which was out of his reach well my love you shall have a great lump if you will tell me whats the letter a a was an archer and shot at a frog replied johnny in a surly tone there now mr easy and he can go through the whole alphabetcant he sarah that he can the dearcant you johnny dear no replied johnny yes you can my love you know whats the letter b now dont you yes replied johnny there mr easy you see what the boy knows and how obedient he is too come johnny dear tell us what was b no i wont replied johnny i want some more sugar and johnny who had climbed on a chair spread himself over the table to reach it mercy sarah pull him offhell upset the urn screamed mrs easy sarah caught hold of johnny by the loins to pull him back but johnny resisting the interference turned round on his back as he lay on the table and kicked sarah in the face just as she made another desperate grasp at him the rebound from the kick given as he lay on a smooth mahogany table brought johnnys head in contact with the urn which was upset in the opposite direction and notwithstanding a rapid movement on the part of mr easy he received a sufficient portion of boiling liquid on his legs to scald him severely and induce him to stamp and swear in a very unphilosophical way in the meantime sarah and mrs easy had caught up johnny and were both holding him at the same time exclaiming and lamenting the pain of the scald and the indifference shown towards him were too much for mr easys temper to put up with he snatched johnny out of their arms and quite forgetting his equality and rights of man belaboured him without mercy sarah flew into interfere and received a blow which not only made her see a thousand stars but sent her reeling on the floor mrs easy went off into hysterics and johnny howled so as to be heard at a quarter of a mile how long mr easy would have continued it is impossible to say but the door opened and mr easy looked up while still administering the punishment and perceived dr middleton in mute astonishment he had promised to come in to tea and enforce mr easys arguments if it were necessary but it certainly appeared to him that in the argument which mr easy was then enforcing he required no assistance however at the entrance of dr middleton johnny was dropped and lay roaring on the floor sarah too remained where she had been floored mrs easy had rolled on the floor the urn was also on the floor and mr easy although not floored had not a leg to stand upon never did a medical man look in more opportunely mr easy at first was not certainly of that opinion but his legs became so painful that he soon became a convert dr middleton as in duty bound first picked up mrs easy and laid her on the sofa sarah rose picked up johnny and carried him kicking and roaring out of the room in return for which attention she received sundry bites the footman who had announced the doctor picked up the urn that being all that was in his department mr easy threw himself panting in agony on the other sofa and dr middleton was excessively embarrassed how to act he perceived that mr easy required his assistance and that mrs easy could do without it but how to leave a lady who was half really and half pretendedly in hysterics was difficult for if he attempted to leave her she kicked and flounced and burst out the more at last dr middleton rang the bell which brought the footman who summoned all the maids who carried mrs easy upstairs and then the doctor was able to attend to the only patient who really required his assistance mr easy explained the affair in few words broken into ejaculations from pain as the doctor removed his stockings from the applications of dr middleton mr easy soon obtained bodily relief but what annoyed him still more than his scalded legs was the doctor having been a witness to his infringement of the equality and rights of man dr middleton perceived this and he knew also how to pour balm into that wound my dear mr easy i am very sorry that you have had this accident for which you are indebted to mrs easys foolish indulgence of the boy but i am glad to perceive that you have taken up those parental duties which are inculcated by the scriptures solomon says that he who spares the rod spoils the child thereby implying that it is the duty of a father to correct his children and in a father the so doing does not interfere with the rights of man or any natural equality for the son being a part or portion of the father he is only correcting his own self and the proof of it is that a father in punishing his own son feels as much pain in so doing as if he were himself punished it is therefore nothing but selfdiscipline which is strictly enjoined us by the scriptures that is exactly my opinion replied mr easy comforted at the doctor having so logically got him out of the scrape buthe shall go to school tomorrow that im determined on he will have to thank mrs easy for that replied the doctor exactly replied mr easy doctor my legs are getting very hot again continue to bathe them with the vinegar and water mr easy until i send you an embrocation which will give you immediate relief i will call tomorrow bythebye i am to see a little patient at mr bonnycastles if it is any accommodation i will take your son with me it will be a great accommodation doctor replied mr easy then my dear sir i will just go up and see how mrs easy is and tomorrow i will call at ten i can wait an hour goodnight goodnight doctor the doctor had his game to play with mrs easy he magnified her husbands accidenthe magnified his wrath and advised her by no means to say one word until he was well and more pacified the next day he repeated this dose and in spite of the ejaculations of sarah and the tears of mrs easy who dared not venture to plead her cause and the violent resistance of master johnny who appeared to have a presentiment of what was to come our hero was put into dr middletons chariot and with the exception of one plate of glass which he kicked out of the window with his feet and for which feat the doctor now that he had him all to himself boxed his ears till he was nearly blind he was without any further eventful occurrence carried by the doctors footman into the parlour of mr bonnycastle chapter v jack easy is sent to a school at which there is no flogging master jack had been plumped down in a chair by the doctors servant who as he quitted him first looked at his own hands from which the blood was drawn in several parts and then at master jack with his teeth closed and lips compressed as much as to say if i only dared would not i thats all and then walked out of the room repaired to the carriage at the front door when he showed his hands to the coachman who looked down from his box in great commiseration at the same time fully sharing his fellowservants indignation but we must repair to the parlour dr middleton ran over a newspaper while johnny sat on the chair all of a heap looking like a lump of sulks with his feet on the upper front bar and his knees almost up to his nose he was a promising pupil jack mr bonnycastle made his appearancea tall wellbuilt handsome fair man with a fine powdered head dressed in solemn black and knee buckles his linen beautifully clean and with a peculiar bland expression of countenance when he smiled he showed a row of teeth white as ivory and his mild blue eye was the ne plus ultra of beneficence he was the beauideal of a preceptor and it was impossible to see him and hear his mild pleasing voice without wishing that all your sons were under his protection he was a ripe scholar and a good one and at the time we speak of had the care of upwards of one hundred boys he was celebrated for turning them out well and many of his pupils were rising fast in the senate as well as distinguishing themselves in the higher professions dr middleton who was on intimate terms with bonnycastle rose as he entered the room and they shook hands middleton then turned to where jack sat and pointing to him said look there bonnycastle smiled i cannot say that i have had worse but i have almost as bad i will apply the promethean torch and soon vivify that rude mass come sit down middleton but said the doctor as he resumed his chair tell me bonnycastle how you will possibly manage to lick such a cub into shape when you do not resort to flogging i have no opinion of flogging and therefore i do not resort to it the fact is i was at harrow myself and was rather a pickle i was called up as often as most boys in the school and i perfectly recollect that eventually i cared nothing for a flogging i had become casehardened it is the least effective part that you can touch a boy upon it leaves nothing behind to refresh their memories i should have thought otherwise my dear middleton i can produce more effect by one caning than twenty floggings observe you flog upon a part the most quiescent but you cane upon all parts from the head to the heels now when once the first sting of the birch is over then a dull sensation comes over the part and the pain after that is nothing whereas a good sound caning leaves sores and bruises in every part and on all the parts which are required for muscular action after a flogging a boy may run out in the hours of recreation and join his playmates as well as ever but a good caning tells a very different tale he cannot move one part of his body without being reminded for days by the pain of the punishment he has undergone and he is very careful how he is called up again my dear sir i really had an idea that you were excessively lenient replied middleton laughing i am glad that i am under a mistake look at that cub doctor sitting there more like a brute than a reasonable being do you imagine that i could ever lick it into shape without strong measures at the same time allow me to say that i consider my system by far the best at the public schools punishment is no check it is so trifling that it is derided with me punishment is punishment in the true sense of the word and the consequence is that it is much more seldom resorted to you are a terrorist bonnycastle the two strongest impulses in our nature are fear and love in theory acting upon the latter is very beautiful but in practice i never found it to answerand for the best of reasons our selflove is stronger than our love for others now i never yet found fear to fail for the very same reason that the other does because with fear we act upon selflove and nothing else and yet we have many now who would introduce a system of schooling without correction and who maintain that the present system is degrading there are a great many fools in this world doctor that reminds me of this boys father replied dr middleton who then detailed to the pedagogue the idiosyncrasy of mr easy and all the circumstances attending jack being sent to his school there is no time to be lost then doctor i must conquer this young gentleman before his parents call to see him depend upon it in a week i will have him obedient and well broke in dr middleton wished jack goodbye and told him to be a good boy jack did not vouchsafe to answer never mind doctor he will be more polished next time you call here depend upon it and the doctor departed although mr bonnycastle was severe he was very judicious mischief of all kinds was visited but by slender punishment such as being kept in at play hours etc and he seldom interfered with the boys for fighting although he checked decided oppression the great sine qua non with him was attention to their studies he soon discovered the capabilities of his pupils and he forced them accordingly but the idle boy the bird who could sing and wouldnt sing received no mercy the consequence was that he turned out the cleverest boys and his conduct was so uniform and unvarying in its tenor that if he was feared when they were under his control he was invariably liked by those whom he had instructed and they continued his friends in afterlife mr bonnycastle at once perceived that it was no use coaxing our hero and that fear was the only attribute by which he could be controlled so as soon as dr middleton had quitted the room he addressed him in a commanding tone now boy what is your name jack started he looked up at his master perceived his eye fixed upon him and a countenance not to be played with jack was no fool and somehow or another the discipline he had received from his father had given him some intimation of what was to come all this put together induced jack to condescend to answer with his forefinger between his teeth johnny and what is your other name sir jack who appeared to repent his condescension did not at first answer but he looked again in mr bonnycastles face and then round the room there was no one to help him and he could not help himself so he replied easy do you know why you are sent to school scalding father no you are sent to learn to read and write but i wont read and write replied jack sulkily yes you will and you are going to read your letters now directly jack made no answer mr bonnycastle opened a sort of bookcase and displayed to johns astonished view a series of canes ranged up and down like billiard cues and continued do you know what those are for jack eyed them wistfully he had some faint idea that he was sure to be better acquainted with them but he made no answer they are to teach little boys to read and write and now i am going to teach you youll soon learn look now here continued mr bonnycastle opening a book with large type and taking a capital at the head of a chapter about half an inch long do you see that letter yes replied johnny turning his eyes away and picking his fingers well that is the letter b do you see it look at it so that you may know it again thats the letter b now tell me what letter that is jack now determined to resist so he made no answer so you cannot tell well then we will try what one of these little fellows will do said mr bonnycastle taking down a cane observe johnny thats the letter b now what letter is that answer me directly i wont learn to read and write whack came the cane on johnnys shoulders who burst out into a roar as he writhed with pain mr bonnycastle waited a few seconds thats the letter b now tell me sir directly what that letter is ill tell my mar whack o law o law what letter is that johnny with his mouth open panting and the tears on his cheeks answered indignantly stop till i tell sarah whack came the cane again and a fresh burst from johnny what letters that i wont tell roared johnny i wont tellthat i wont whack whack whack and a pause i told you before thats the letter b what letter is that tell me directly johnny by way of reply made a snatch at the cane whack he caught it certainly but not exactly as he would have wished johnny then snatched up the book and dashed it to the corner of the room whack whack johnny attempted to seize mr bonnycastle with his teeth whack whack whack whack and johnny fell on the carpet and roared with pain mr bonnycastle then left him for a little while to recover himself and sat down at last johnnys exclamations settled down in deep sobs and then mr bonnycastle said to him now johnny you perceive that you must do as you are bid or else you will have more beating get up immediately do you hear sir somehow or another johnny without intending it stood upon his feet thats a good boy now you see by getting up as you were bid you have not been beaten now johnny you must go and bring the book from where you threw it down do you hear sir bring it directly johnny looked at mr bonnycastle and the cane with every intention to refuse johnny picked up the book and laid it on the table thats a good boy now we will find the letter b here it is now johnny tell me what that letter is johnny made no answer tell me directly sir said mr bonnycastle raising his cane up in the air the appeal was too powerful johnny eyed the cane it moved it was coming breathlessly he shrieked out b very well indeed johnnyvery well now your first lesson is over and you shall go to bed you have learned more than you think for tomorrow we will begin again now well put the cane by mr bonnycastle rang the bell and desired master johnny to be put to bed in a room by himself and not to give him any supper as hunger would the next morning much facilitate his studies pain and hunger alone will tame brutes and the same remedy must be applied to conquer those passions in man which assimilate him with brutes johnny was conducted to bed although it was but six oclock he was not only in pain but his ideas were confused and no wonder after all his life having been humoured and indulged never punished until the day before after all the caresses of his mother and sarah which he never knew the value ofafter stuffing himself all day long and being tempted to eat till he turned away in satiety to find himself without his mother without sarah without supper covered with wheals and what was worse than all without his own way no wonder johnny was confused at the same time that he was subdued and as mr bonnycastle had truly told him he had learnt more than he had any idea of and what would mrs easy have said had she known all thisand sarah too and mr easy with his rights of man at the very time that johnny was having the devil driven out of him they were consoling themselves with the idea that at all events there was no birch used at mr bonnycastles quite losing sight of the fact that as there are more ways of killing a dog besides hanging him so are there more ways of teaching than a posteriors happy in their ignorance they all went fast asleep little dreaming that johnny was already so far advanced in knowledge as to have a tolerable comprehension of the mystery of cane as for johnny he had cried himself to sleep at least six hours before them chapter vi in which jack makes essay of his fathers sublime philosophy and arrives very near to truth at last the next morning master jack easy was not only very sore but very hungry and as mr bonnycastle informed him that he would not only have plenty of cane but also no breakfast if he did not learn his letters johnny had wisdom enough to say the whole alphabet for which he received a great deal of praise the which if he did not duly appreciate he at all events infinitely preferred to beating mr bonnycastle perceived that he had conquered the boy by one hours welltimed severity he therefore handed him over to the ushers in the school and as they were equally empowered to administer the needful impulse johnny very soon became a very tractable boy it may be imagined that the absence of johnny was severely felt at home but such was not the case in the first place dr middleton had pointed out to mrs easy that there was no flogging at the school and that the punishment received by johnny from his father would very likely be repeatedand in the next although mrs easy thought that she never could have survived the parting with her own son she soon found out that she was much happier without him a spoilt child is always a source of anxiety and worry and after johnnys departure mrs easy found a quiet and repose much more suited to her disposition gradually she weaned herself from him and satisfied with seeing him occasionally and hearing the reports of dr middleton she at last was quite reconciled to his being at school and not coming back except during the holidays john easy made great progress he had good natural abilities and mr easy rubbed his hands when he saw the doctor saying yes let them have him for a year or two longer and then ill finish him myself each vacation he had attempted to instil into johnnys mind the equal rights of man johnny appeared to pay but little attention to his fathers discourses but evidently showed that they were not altogether thrown away as he helped himself to everything he wanted without asking leave and thus was our hero educated until he arrived at the age of sixteen when he was a stout goodlooking boy with plenty to say for himselfindeed when it suited his purpose he could outtalk his father nothing pleased mr easy so much as jacks loquacity thats right argue the point jackargue the point boy would he say as jack disputed with his mother and then he would turn to the doctor rubbing his hands and observe depend upon it jack will be a great a very great man and then he would call jack and give him a guinea for his cleverness and at last jack thought it a very clever thing to argue he never would attempt to argue with mr bonnycastle because he was aware that mr bonnycastles arguments were too strong for him but he argued with all the boys until it ended in a fight which decided the point and he sometimes argued with the ushers in short at the time we now speak of which was at the breaking up of the midsummer holidays jack was as full of argument as he was fond of it he would argue the point to the point of a needle and he would divide that point into as many as there were days of the year and argue upon each in short there was no end to jacks arguing the point although there seldom was point to his argument jack had been fishing in the river without any success for a whole morning and observed a large pond which had the appearance of being well stockedhe cleared the park palings and threw in his line he had pulled up several fine fish when he was accosted by the proprietor accompanied by a couple of keepers may i request the pleasure of your name young gentleman said the proprietor to jack now jack was always urbane and polite certainly sir my name is easy very much at your service and you appear to me to be taking it very easy replied the gentleman pray sir may i enquire whether you are aware that you are trespassing the word trespass my dear sir replied jack will admit of much argument and i will divide it into three heads it implies according to the conventional meaning coming without permission upon the land or property of another now sir the question may all be resolved in the following was not the world made for all and has any one or any portion of its inhabitants an exclusive right to claim any part of it as his property if you please i have laid down the proposition and we will now argue the point the gentleman who accosted jack had heard of mr easy and his arguments he was a humorist and more inclined to laugh than to be angry at the same time that he considered it necessary to show jack that under existing circumstances they were not tenable but mr easy allowing the trespass on the property to be venial surely you do not mean to say that you are justified in taking my fish i bought the fish and stocked the pond and have fed them ever since you cannot deny but that they are private property and that to take them is a theft that will again admit of much ratiocination my dear sir replied jack buti beg your pardon i have a fish jack pulled up a large carp much to the indignation of the keepers and to the amusement of their master unhooked it placed it in his basket renewed his bait with the greatest sang and then throwing in his line resumed his discourse as i was observing my dear sir continued jack that will admit of much ratiocination all the creatures of the earth were given to man for his useman means mankindthey were never intended to be made a monopoly of water is also the gift of heaven and meant for the use of all we now come to the question how far the fish are your property if the fish only bred on purpose to please you and make you a present of their stock it might then require a different line of argument but as in breeding they only acted in obedience to an instinct with which they are endowed on purpose that they may supply man i submit to you that you cannot prove these fish to be yours more than mine as for feeding with the idea that they were your own that is not an unusual case in this world even when a man is giving bread and butter to his children furtherbut i have another bitei beg your pardon my dear sirah hes off again then mr easy you mean to say that the world and its contents are made for all exactly sir that is my fathers opinion who is a very great philosopher how then does your father account for some possessing property and others being without it because those who are the strongest have deprived those who are weaker but would not that be always the case even if we were in that state of general inheritance which you have supposed for instance allowing two men to chase the same animal and both to come up to it at the same time would not the strongest bear it off i grant that sir well then where is your equality that does not disprove that men were not intended to be equal it only proves that they are not so neither does it disprove that everything was not made for the benefit of all it only proves that the strong will take advantage of the weak which is very natural oh you grant that to be very natural well mr easy i am glad to perceive that we are of one mind and i trust we shall continue so youll observe that i and my keepers being three we are the strong party in this instance and admitting your argument that the fish are as much yours as mine still i take advantage of my strength to repossess myself of them which is as you say very naturaljames take those fish if you please interrupted jack we will argue that point not at all i will act according to your own argumentsi have the fish but i now mean to have morethat fishingrod is as much mine as yours and being the stronger party i will take possession of it james william take that fishingrodit is ours i presume you will first allow me to observe replied jack that although i have expressed my opinion that the earth and the animals on it were made for us all that i never yet have asserted that what a man creates by himself or has created for him for a consideration is not his own property i beg your pardon the trees that that rod was made from were made for us all and if you or any one for you have thought proper to make it into a rod it is no more my fault than it is that i have been feeding the fish with the supposition that they were my own everything being common and it being but natural that the strong should take advantage of the weak i must take that rod as my property until i am dispossessed by one more powerful moreover being the stronger party and having possession of this land which you say does not belong to me more than to youi also shall direct my keepers to see you off this property james take the rodsee mr easy over the park palings mr easy i wish you a good morning sir i beg your pardon you have not yet heard all my arguments replied jack who did not approve of the conclusions drawn i have no time to hear more mr easy i wish you a good morning and the proprietor departed leaving jack in company with the keepers ill trouble you for that rod master said william james was very busy stringing the fish through the gills upon a piece of osier at all events you will hear reason said jack i have arguments i never heard no good arguments in favour of poaching interrupted the keeper youre an insolent fellow replied jack it is by paying such vagabonds as you that people are able to be guilty of injustice its by paying us that the land ant poachedand if there be some excuse for a poor devil who is out of work there be none for you who call yourself a gentleman according to his account as we be all equal he be no more a gentleman than we be silence you blackguard i shall not condescend to argue with such as you if i did i could prove that you are a set of base slaves who have just as much right to this property as your master or i have as you have i dare say master as i have you scoundrel this pond is as much my property and so are the fish in it as they are of your master who has usurped the right i say james what do you say shall we put the young gentleman in possession of his property said william winking to the other james took the hint they seized jack by the arms and legs and soused him into the pond jack arose after a deep submersion and floundered on shore blowing and spluttering but in the meantime the keepers had walked away carrying with them the rod and line fish and tin can of bait laughing loudly at the practical joke which they had played our hero well thought jack either there must be some mistake in my fathers philosophy or else this is a very wicked world i shall submit this case to my father and jack received this replyi have told you before jack that these important truths will not at present be admittedbut it does not the less follow that they are true this is the age of iron in which might has become rightbut the time will come when these truths will be admitted and your fathers name will be more celebrated than that of any philosopher of ancient days recollect jack that although in preaching against wrong and advocating the rights of man you will be treated as a martyr it is still your duty to persevere and if you are dragged through all the horseponds in the kingdom never give up your argument that i never will sir replied jack but the next time i argue it shall be if possible with power on my side and at all events not quite so near a pond i think said mrs easy who had been a silent listener that jack had better fish in the river and then if he catches no fish at all events he will not be soused in the water and spoil his clothes but mrs easy was no philosopher a few days afterwards jack discovered one fine morning on the other side of a hedge a summer appletree bearing tempting fruit and he immediately broke through the hedge and climbing the tree as our first mother did before him he culled the fairest and did eat i say you sir what are you doing there cried a rough voice jack looked down and perceived a stout thickset personage in grey coat and red waistcoat standing underneath him dont you see what im about replied jack im eating apples shall i throw you down a few thank you kindlythe fewer that are pulled the better perhaps as you are so free to give them to others as well as to help yourself you may think that they are your own property not a bit more my property than they are yours my good man i guess thats something like the truth but you are not quite at the truth yet my lad those apples are mine and ill trouble you to come down as fast as you please when youre down we can then settle our accounts and continued the man shaking his cudgel depend upon it you shall have your receipt in full jack did not much like the appearance of things my good man said he it is quite a prejudice on your part to imagine that apples were not given as well as all other fruit for the benefit of us allthey are common property believe me thats a matter of opinion my lad and i may be allowed to have own youll find it in the bible says jack i never did yet and ive read it through and through all bating the pocryfar then said jack go home and fetch the bible and ill prove it to you i suspect youll not wait till i come back again no no i have lost plenty of apples and have long wanted to find the robbers out now ive caught one ill take care that he dont scape without apple sauce at all eventsso come down you young thief come down directlyor it will be all the worse for you thank you said jack but i am very well here i will if you please argue the point from where i am ive no time to argue the point my lad ive plenty to do but do not think ill let you off if you dont choose to come down why then you may stay there and ill answer for it as soon as work is done i shall find you safe enough what can be done thought jack with a man who will not listen to argument what a world is thishowever hell not find me here when he comes back ive a notion but in this jack was mistaken the farmer walked to the hedge and called to a boy who took his orders and ran to the farmhouse in a minute or two a large bulldog was seen bounding along the orchard to his master mark him caesar said the farmer to the dog mark him the dog crouched down on the grass with his head up and eyes glaring at jack showing a range of teeth that drove all our heros philosophy out of his head i cant wait here but caesar can and i will tell you as a friend that if he gets hold of you hell not leave a limb of you together when works done ill come back so saying the farmer walked off leaving jack and the dog to argue the point if so inclined what a sad jade must philosophy be to put her votaries in such predicaments after a while the dog laid his head down and closed his eyes as if asleep but jack observed that at the least movement on his part one eye was seen partially to unclose so jack like a prudent man resolved to remain where he was he picked a few more apples for it was his dinnertime and as he chewed he ruminated jack had been but a few minutes ruminating before he was interrupted by another ruminating animal no less a personage than a bull who had been turned out with full possession of the orchard and who now advanced bellowing occasionally and tossing his head at the sight of caesar whom he considered as much a trespasser as his master had our hero caesar started on his legs and faced the bull who advanced pawing with his tail up in the air when within a few yards the bull made a rush at the dog who evaded him and attacked him in return and thus did the warfare continue until the opponents were already at some distance from the appletree jack prepared for immediate flight but unfortunately the combat was carried on by the side of the hedge at which jack had gained admission never mind thought jack there are two sides to every field and although the other hedge joined on to the garden near to the farmhouse there was no option at all events said jack ill try it jack was slipping down the trunk when he heard a tremendous roar the bulldog had been tossed by the bull he was then high in the air and jack saw him fall on the other side of the hedge and the bull was thus celebrating his victory with a flourish of trumpets upon which jack perceiving that he was relieved from his sentry slipped down the rest of the tree and took to his heels unfortunately for jack the bull saw him and flushed with victory he immediately set up another roar and bounded after jack jack perceived his danger and fear gave him wings he not only flew over the orchard but he flew over the hedge which was about five feet high just as the bull drove his head into it look before you leap is an old proverb had jack done so he would have done better but as there were cogent reasons to be offered in extenuation of our philosopher we shall say no more but merely state that jack when he got to the other side of the hedge found that he had pitched into a small apiary and had upset two hives of bees who resented the intrusion and jack had hardly time to get upon his legs before he found them very busy stinging him in all quarters all that jack could do was to run for it but the bees flew faster than he could run and jack was mad with pain when he stumbled halfblinded over the brickwork of a well jack could not stop his pitching into the well but he seized the iron chain as it struck him across the face down went jack and round went the windlass and after a rapid descent of forty feet our hero found himself under water and no longer troubled with the bees who whether they had lost scent of their prey from his rapid descent or being notoriously clever insects acknowledged the truth of the adage leave well alone had certainly left jack with no other companion than truth jack rose from his immersion and seized the rope to which the chain of the bucket was made fastit had all of it been unwound from the windlass and therefore it enabled jack to keep his head above water after a few seconds jack felt something against his legs it was the bucket about two feet under the water jack put his feet into it and found himself pretty comfortable for the water after the sting of the bees and the heat he had been put into by the race with the bull was quite cool and refreshing at all events thought jack if it had not been for the bull i should have been watched by the dog and then thrashed by the farmer but then again if it had not been for the bull i should not have tumbled among the bees and if it had not been for the bees i should not have tumbled into the well and if it had not been for the chain i should have been drowned such has been the chain of events all because i wanted to eat an apple however i have got rid of the farmer and the dog and the bull and the beesalls well that ends well but how the devil am i to get out of the wellall creation appears to have conspired against the rights of man as my father said this is an iron age and here i am swinging to an iron chain we have given the whole of jacks soliloquy as it will prove that jack was no fool although he was a bit of a philosopher and a man who could reason so well upon cause ant effect at the bottom of a well up to his neck in water showed a good deal of presence of mind but if jacks mind had been a little twisted by his fathers philosophy it had still sufficient strength and elasticity to recover itself in due time had jack been a common personage we should never have selected him for our hero chapter vii in which jack makes some very sage reflections and comes to a very unwise decision after all it must be acknowledged that although there are cases of distress in which a well may become a place of refuge a well is not at all calculated for a prolonged residenceso thought jack after he had been there some fifteen minutes his teeth chattered and his limbs trembled he felt a numbness all over and he thought it high time to call for assistance which at first he would not as he was afraid he should be pulled up to encounter the indignation of the farmer and his family jack was arranging his jaws for a halloo when he felt the chain pulled up and he slowly emerged from the water at first he heard complaints of the weight of the bucket at which jack was not surprised then he heard a tittering and laughing between two parties and soon afterwards he mounted up gaily at last his head appeared above the low wall and he was about to extend his arms so as to secure a position on it when those who were working at the windlass beheld him it was a heavy farming man and a maidservant thank you said jack one never should be too quick in returning thanks the girl screamed and let go the winch the man frightened did not hold it fast it slipped from his grasp whirled round struck him under the chin and threw him over it headlong and before the thank you was fairly out of jacks lips down he went again like lightning to the bottom fortunately for jack he had not yet let go the chain or he might have struck the sides and have been killed as it was he was merely soused a second time and in a minute or two regained his former position this is mighty pleasant thought jack as he clapped his wet hat once more on his head at all events they cant now plead ignorance they must know that im here in the meantime the girl ran into the kitchen threw herself down on a stool from which she reeled off in a fit upon sundry heaps of dough waiting to be baked in the oven which were laid to rise on the floor before the fire mercy on me what is the matter with susan exclaimed the farmers wife herewheres marywheres johndeary me if the bread wont all be turned to pancakes john soon followed holding his underjaw in his hand looking very dismal and very frightened for two reasons one because he thought that his jaw was broken and the other because he thought he had seen the devil mercy on us what is the matter exclaimed the farmers wife again mary mary mary screamed she beginning to be frightened herself for with all her efforts she could not remove susan from the bed of dough where she lay senseless and heavy as lead mary answered to her mistresss loud appeal and with her assistance they raised up susan but as for the bread there was no hopes of it ever rising again why dont you come here and help susan john cried mary awyawaw was all the reply of john who had had enough quite of helping susan and who continued to hold his head as it were in his hand whats the matter here missus exclaimed the farmer coming in hightytighty what ails susan and what ails you continued the farmer turning to john dang it but everything seems to go wrong this blessed day first there be all the apples stolenthen there be all the hives turned topsyturvy in the gardenthen there be caesar with his flank opened by the bullthen there be the bull broken through the hedge and tumbled into the sawpitand now i come to get more help to drag him out i find one woman dead like and john looks as if he had seen the devil awyawaw replied john nodding his head very significantly one would think that the devil had broke loose today what is it john have you seen him and has susan seen him awyaw hes stopped your jaw then at all events and i thought the devil himself wouldnt have done thatwe shall get nothing of you is that wench coming to her senses yes yes shes better nowsusan whats the matter oh oh maam the well the well the well something wrong there i suppose well i will go and see the farmer trotted off to the well he perceived the bucket was at the bottom and all the rope out he looked about him and then he looked into the well jack who had become very impatient had been looking up some time for the assistance which he expected would have come sooner the round face of the farmer occasioned a partial eclipse of the round disk which bounded his view just as one of the satellites of jupiter sometimes obscures the face of the planet round which he revolves here i am cried jack get me up quick or i shall be dead and what jack said was true for he was quite done up by having been so long down although his courage had not failed him dang it but there be somebody fallen into the well cried the farmer no end to mishaps this day well we must get a christian out of a well afore we get a bull out of a sawpit so ill go and call the men in a very short time the men who were assembled round the sawpit were brought to the well down below there hold on now never fear cried jack away went the winch and once more jack had an extended horizon to survey as soon as he was at the top the men hauled him over the bricks and laid him down upon the ground for jacks strength had failed him dang it if it beant that chap who was on my appletree cried the farmerhowsoever he must not die for stealing a few apples lift him up lads and take him inhe is dead with coldno wonder the farmer led the way and the men carried jack into the house when the farmer gave him a glass of brandy this restored jacks circulation and in a short time he was all right again after some previous conversation in which jack narrated all that had happened what may be your name inquired the farmer my name is easy replied jack what be you the son of mr easy of forest hill yes dang it he be my landlord and a right good landlord toowhy didnt you say so when you were up in the appletree you might have picked the whole orchard and welcome my dear sir replied jack who had taken a second glass of brandy and was quite talkative again let this be a warning to you and when a man proposes to argue the point always in future listen had you waited i would have proved to you most incontestably that you had no more right to the apples than i had but you would not listen to argument and without discussion we can never arrive at truth you send for your dog who is ripped up by the bullthe bull breaks his leg in a sawpitthe beehives are overturned and you lose all your honeyyour man john breaks his jawyour maid susan spoils all the breadand why because you would not allow me to argue the point well mr easy it be all true that all these mishaps have happened because i would not allow you to argue the point perhaps although as i rent the orchard from your father i cannot imagine how you could prove to me that the apples were not mine but now lets take your side of the question and i dont see how you be much better off you get up in a tree for a few apples with plenty of money to buy them if you likeyou are kept there by a dogyou are nearly gored by a bullyou are stung by the bees and you tumble souse into a well and are nearly killed a dozen times and all for a few apples not worth twopence all very true my good man replied jack but you forget that i as a philosopher was defending the rights of man well i never knew before that a lad who stole apples was called a philosopherwe calls it petty larceny in the indictments and as for your rights of man i cannot see how they can be defended by doing whats wrong you do not comprehend the matter farmer no i dontand i be too old to learn master easy all i have to say is this you are welcome to all the apples in the orchard if you please and if you prefers as it seems you do to steal them instead of asking for them which i only can account for by the reason that they say that stolen fruit be sweetest ive only to say that i shall give orders that you be not interfered with my chaise be at the door master easy and the man will drive you to your fathers make my compliments to him and say that im very sorry that you tumbled into our well as jack was much more inclined for bed than argument he wished the farmer goodnight and allowed himself to be driven home the pain from the sting of the bees now that his circulation had fully returned was so great that he was not sorry to find dr middleton taking his tea with his father and mother jack merely said that he had been so unfortunate as to upset a hive and had been severely stung he deferred the whole story till another opportunity dr middleton prescribed for jack but on taking his hand found that he was in a high fever which after the events of the day was not to be wondered at jack was bled and kept his bed for a week by which time he was restored but during that time jack had been thinking very seriously and had made up his mind but we must explain a circumstance which had occurred which was probably the cause of jacks decision when jack returned on the evening in question he found seated with his father and dr middleton a captain wilson a sort of cousin to the family who but occasionally paid them a visit for he lived at some distance and having a wife and large family with nothing but his halfpay for their support he could not afford to expend even shoeleather in compliments the object of this visit on the part of captain wilson was to request the aid of mr easy he had succeeded in obtaining his appointment to a sloop of war for he was in the kings service but was without the means of fitting himself out without leaving his wife and family penniless he therefore came to request mr easy to lend him a few hundred pounds until he should be able by his prizemoney to repay them mr easy was not a man to refuse such a request and always having plenty of spare cash at his bankers he drew a cheque for a thousand pounds which he gave to captain wilson requesting that he would only repay it at his convenience captain wilson wrote an acknowledgment of the debt promising to pay upon his first prizemoney which receipt however binding it may be to a man of honour was in point of law about as valuable as if he had agreed to pay as soon as the cows came home the affair had been just concluded and captain wilson had returned into the parlour with mr easy when jack returned from his expedition jack greeted captain wilson whom he had long known but as we before observed he suffered so much pain that he soon retired with dr middleton and went to bed during a week there is room for much reflection even in a lad of fourteen although at that age we are not much inclined to think but jack was in bed his eyes were so swollen with the stings of the bees that he could neither read nor otherwise amuse himself and he preferred his own thoughts to the gabble of sarah who attended him so jack thought and the result of his cogitations we shall soon bring forward it was on the eighth day that jack left his bed and came down into the drawingroom he then detailed to his father the adventures which had taken place which had obliged him to take to his bed you see jack replied his father its just what i told you the world is so utterly demoralised by what is called social compact and the phalanx supporting it by contributing a portion of their unjust possessions for the security of the remainder is so powerful that any one who opposes it must expect to pass the life of a martyr but martyrs are always required previous to any truth however sublime being received and like abraham whom i have always considered as a great philosopher i am willing to sacrifice my only son in so noble a cause thats all very good on your part father but we must argue the point a little if you are as great a philosopher as abraham i am not quite so dutiful a son as isaac whose blind obedience in my opinion is very contrary to your rights of man but the fact in few words is simply this in promulgating your philosophy in the short space of two days i have been robbed of the fish i caught and my rod and linei have been soused into a fishpondi have been frightened out of my wits by a bulldogbeen nearly killed by a bullbeen stung to death by bees and twice tumbled into a well now if all that happens in two days what must i expect to suffer in a whole year it appears to be very unwise to attempt making further converts for people on shore seem determined not to listen to reason or argument but it has occurred to me that although the whole earth has been so nefariously divided among the few that the waters at least are the property of all no man claims his share of the seaevery one may there plough as he pleases without being taken up for a trespasser even war makes no difference every one may go on as he pleases and if they meet it is nothing but a neutral ground on which the parties contend it is then only upon the ocean that i am likely to find that equality and rights of man which we are so anxious to establish on shore and therefore i have resolved not to go to school again which i detest but to go to sea and propagate our opinions as much as i can i cannot listen to that jack in the first place you must return to school in the next place you shall not go to sea then father all i have to say is that i swear by the rights of man i will not go back to school and that i will go to sea who and what is to prevent me was not i born my own masterhas any one a right to dictate to me as if i were not his equal have i not as much right to my share of the sea as any other mortal i stand upon perfect equality continued jack stamping his right foot on the floor what had mr easy to offer in reply he must either as a philosopher have sacrificed his hypothesis or as a father have sacrificed his son like all philosophers he preferred what he considered as the less important of the two he sacrificed his son butwe will do him justicehe did it with a sigh jack you shall if you wish it go to sea that of course replied jack with the air of a conqueror but the question is with whom now it has occurred to me that captain wilson has just been appointed to a ship and i should like to sail with him i will write to him said mr easy mournfully but i should have liked to have felt his head first and thus was the matter arranged the answer from captain wilson was of course in the affirmative and he promised that he would treat jack as his own son our hero mounted his fathers horse and rode off to mr bonnycastle i am going to sea mr bonnycastle the very best thing for you replied mr bonnycastle our hero met dr middleton i am going to sea dr middleton the very best thing for you replied the doctor i am going to sea mother said john to sea john to sea no no dear john you are not going to sea replied mrs easy with horror yes i am father has agreed and says he will obtain your consent my consent oh my dear dear boyand mrs easy wept bitterly as rachel mourning for her children chapter viii in which mr easy has his first lesson as to zeal in his majestys service as there was no time to lose our hero very soon bade adieu to his paternal roof as the phrase is and found his way down to portsmouth as jack had plenty of money and was very much pleased at finding himself his own master he was in no hurry to join his ship and five or six companions not very creditable whom either jack had picked up or had picked up jack and who lived upon him strongly advised him to put it off until the very last moment as this advice happened to coincide with jacks opinion our hero was three weeks at portsmouth before any one knew of his arrival but at last captain wilson received a letter from mr easy by which he found that jack had left home at the period we have mentioned and he desired the first lieutenant to make inquiries as he was afraid that some accident might have happened to him as mr sawbridge the first lieutenant happened to be going on shore on the same evening for the last time previous to the ships sailing he looked into the blue posts george and fountain inns to inquire if there was such a person arrived as mr easy o yes replied the waiter at the fountainmr easy has been here these three weeks the devil he has roared mr sawbridge with all the indignation of a first lieutenant defrauded three weeks of a midshipman where is he in the coffeeroom oh dear no sir replied the waiter mr easy has the front apartments on the first floor well then show me up to the first floor may i request the pleasure of your name sir said the waiter first lieutenants dont send up their names to midshipmen replied mr sawbridge he shall soon know who i am at this reply the waiter walked upstairs followed by mr sawbridge and threw open the door a gentleman wishes to see you sir said the waiter desire him to walk in said jack and waiter mind that the punch is a little better than it was yesterday i have asked two more gentlemen to dine here in the meantime mr sawbridge who was not in his uniform had entered and perceived jack alone with the dinner table laid out in the best style for eight a considerable show of plate for even the fountain inn and everything as well as the apartment itself according to mr sawbridges opinion much more fit for a commanderinchief than a midshipman of a sloop of war now mr sawbridge was a good officer one who had really worked his way up to the present rank that is to say that he had served sevenandtwenty years and had nothing but his pay he was a little soured in the service and certainly had an aversion to the young men of family who were now fast crowding into itand with some grounds as he perceived his own chance of promotion decrease in the same ratio as the numbers increased he considered that in proportion as midshipmen assumed a cleaner and more gentlemanly appearance so did they become more useless and it may therefore be easily imagined that his bile was raised by this parade and display in a lad who was very shortly to be and ought three weeks before to have been shrinking from his frown nevertheless sawbridge was a goodhearted man although a little envious of luxury which he could not pretend to indulge in himself may i beg to ask said jack who was always remarkably polite and gentlemanly in his address in what manner i may be of service to you yes sir you mayby joining your ship immediately and may i beg to ask in return sir what is the reason you have stayed on shore three weeks without joining her hereupon jack who did not much admire the peremptory tone of mr sawbridge and who during the answer had taken a seat crossed his legs and played with the gold chain to which his watch was secured after a pause very coolly replied and pray who are you who am i sir replied sawbridge jumping out of his chair my name is sawbridge sir and i am the first lieutenant of the harpy now sir you have your answer mr sawbridge who imagined that the name of the first lieutenant would strike terror to a culprit midshipman threw himself back in the chair and assumed an air of importance really sir replied jack what may be your exact situation on board my ignorance of the service will not allow me to guess but if i may judge from your behaviour you have no small opinion of yourself look ye young man you may not know what a first lieutenant is and i take it for granted that you do not by your behaviour but depend upon it ill let you know very soon in the meantime sir i insist upon it that you go immediately on board im sorry that i cannot comply with your very moderate request replied jack coolly i shall go on board when it suits my convenience and i beg that you will give yourself no further trouble on my account jack then rang the bell the waiter who had been listening outside immediately entered and before mr sawbridge who was dumb with astonishment at jacks impertinence could have time to reply waiter said jack show this gentleman downstairs by the god of war exclaimed the first lieutenant but ill soon show you down to the boat my young bantam and when once i get you safe on board ill make you know the difference between a midshipman and a first lieutenant i can only admit of equality sir replied jack we are all born equali trust youll allow that equalitydamn it i suppose youll take the command of the ship however sir your ignorance will be a little enlightened byandbye i shall now go and report your conduct to captain wilson and i tell you plainly that if you are not on board this evening tomorrow morning at daylight i shall send a sergeant and a file of marines to fetch you you may depend upon it sir replied jack that i also shall not fail to mention to captain wilson that i consider you a very quarrelsome impertinent fellow and recommend him not to allow you to remain on board it will be quite uncomfortable to be in the same ship with such an ungentlemanly bear he must be madquite mad exclaimed sawbridge whose astonishment even mastered his indignation mad as a march hareby god no sir replied jack i am not mad but i am a philosopher a what exclaimed sawbridge damme what nextwell my joker all the better for you i shall put your philosophy to the proof it is for that very reason sir replied jack that i have decided upon going to sea and if you do remain on board i hope to argue the point with you and make you a convert to the truth of equality and the rights of man by the lord that made us both ill soon make you a convert to the thirtysix articles of warthat is if you remain on board but i shall now go to the captain and report your conduct sir and leave you to your dinner with what appetite you may sir i am infinitely obliged to you but you need not be afraid of my appetite i am only sorry as you happen to belong to the same ship that i cannot in justice to the gentlemanly young men whom i expect ask you to join them i wish you a very good morning sir twenty years have i been in the service roared sawbridge and dammebut hes maddownright stark staring mad and the first lieutenant bounced out of the room jack was a little astonished himself had mr sawbridge made his appearance in uniform it might have been different but that a plainlooking man with black whiskers shaggy hair and old blue frock coat and yellow cassimere waistcoat should venture to address him in such a manner was quite incomprehensiblehe calls me mad thought jack i shall tell captain wilson what is my opinion about his lieutenant shortly afterwards the company arrived and jack soon forgot all about it in the meantime sawbridge called at the captains lodgings and found him at home he made a very faithful report of all that had happened and concluded his report by demanding in great wrath either an instant dismissal or a courtmartial on our hero jack stop sawbridge replied captain wilson take a chair as mr easy says we must argue the point and then i will leave it to your better feelings as for the courtmartial it will not hold good for mr easy in the first place has not yet joined the ship and in the next place could not be supposed to know that you were the first lieutenant or even an officer for you went to him out of uniform very true sir replied sawbridge i had forgotten that then as for his dismissal or rather not allowing him to join mr easy has been brought up in the country and has never seen anything aquatic larger than a fishpond perhaps in his life and as for the service or the nature of it i believe he is as ignorant of it as a child not a year oldi doubt whether he knows the rank of a lieutenant certainly he can have no idea of the power of a first lieutenant by his treatment of you i should think not replied sawbridge dryly i do not think therefore that conduct which must have proceeded from sheer ignorance should be so severely punishedi appeal to you sawbridge well sir perhaps you are rightbut still he told me he was a philosopher and talked about equality and rights of man told me that he could only admit of equality between us and begged to argue the point now sir if a midshipman is to argue the point every time that an order is given the service will come to a pretty pass that is all very true sawbridge and now you remind me of what never occurred to me at the time that i promised to take mr easy in the ship i now recollect that his father who is a distant relation of mine has some very wild notions in his head just like what have been repeated by his son on your interview with him i have occasionally dined there and mr easy has always been upholding the principles of natural equality and of the rights of man much to the amusement of his guests and i confess at the time of mine also i recollect telling him that i trusted he would never be able to disseminate his opinions in the service to which i belonged as we should have an end of all discipline i little thought at the time that his only son who has no more occasion to go to sea than the archbishop of canterbury for his father has a very handsome property i believe seven or eight thousand a yearwould ever have sailed with me and have brought these opinions with him into any ship that i commanded it is a pity a great pity he never could have brought his pigs to a worse market observed sawbridge i agree with you and as a father myself i cannot but help feeling how careful we should be how we inculcate anything like abstract and philosophical ideas to youth allowing them to be in themselves correct still they are dangerous as sharp instruments are in the hands of a childallowing them to be erroneous they are seized upon with an avidity by young and ardent minds and are not to be eradicated without the greatest difficulty and very often not until they have accomplished their ruin then you think sir that these ideas have taken deep root in this young man and we shall not easily rid him of them i do not say so but still recollect they have been instilled perhaps from the earliest period by one from whom they must have been received with all confidencefrom a father to a son and that son has never yet been sufficiently in the world to have proved their fallacy well sir replied sawbridge if i may venture to offer an opinion on the subjectand in so doing i assure you that i only shall from a feeling for the serviceif as you say these opinions will not easily be eradicated as the young man is independent would it not be both better for himself as well as for the service that he is sent home again as an officer he will never do any good for himself and he may do much harm to others i submit this to you captain wilson with all respect but as your first lieutenant i feel very jealous at any chance of the discipline of the ship being interfered with by the introduction of this young man to whom it appears that a profession is no object my dear sawbridge replied captain wilson after taking one or two turns up and down the room we entered the service together we were messmates for many years and you must be aware that it is not only long friendship but an intimate knowledge of your unrewarded merit which has induced me to request you to come with me as my first lieutenant now i will put a case to you and you shall then decide the questionand moreover i will abide by your decision suppose that you were a commander like myself with a wife and seven children and that struggling for many years to support them you found yourself notwithstanding the utmost parsimony gradually running into debt that after many long applications you had at last succeeded in obtaining employment by an appointment to a fine sloop and there was every prospect by prizemoney and increased pay of recovering yourself from your difficulties if not realising a sufficient provision for your family then suppose that all this prospect and all these hopes were likely to be dashed to the ground by the fact of having no means of fitting yourself out no credit no means of paying debts you have contracted for which you would have been arrested or anything sufficient to leave for the support of your family during your absence your agent only consenting to advance onehalf of what you require now suppose in this awkward dilemma without anyone in this world upon whom you have any legitimate claim as a last resource you were to apply to one with whom you have but a distant connection and but an occasional acquaintanceand that when you had made your request for the loan of two or three hundred pounds fully anticipating a refusal from the feeling that he who goes aborrowing goes asorrowingi say suppose to your astonishment that this generous person was to present you with a cheque on his banker for one thousand pounds demanding no interest no legal security and requests you only to pay it at your conveniencei ask you sawbridge what would be your feelings towards such a man i would die for him replied sawbridge with emotion and suppose that by the merest chance or from a whim of the moment the son of that man was to be placed under your protection i would be a father to him replied sawbridge but we must proceed a little further suppose that you were to find the lad was not all that you could wishthat he had imbibed erroneous doctrines which would probably if not eradicated be attended with consequences fatal to his welfare and happiness would you therefore on that account withdraw your protection and leave him to the mercy of others who had no claims of gratitude to sway them in his favour most certainly not sir replied sawbridge on the contrary i would never part with the son until by precept or otherwise i had set him right again and thus had as far as it was possible paid the debt of gratitude due to the generous father i hardly need say to you sawbridge after what has passed that this lad you have just come from is the son and that mr easy of forest hill is the father then sir i can only say that not only to please you but also from respect to a man who has shown such goodwill towards one of our cloth i shall most cheerfully forgive all that has passed between the lad and me and all that may probably take place before we make him what he ought to be thank you sawbridge i expected as much and am not disappointed in my opinion of you and now captain wilson pray what is to be done we must get him on board but not with a file of marinesthat will do more harm than good i will send a note requesting him to breakfast with me tomorrow morning and have a little conversation with him i do not wish to frighten him he would not scruple to run back to forest hillnow i wish to keep him if i possibly can you are right sir his father appears his greatest enemy what a pity that a man with so good a heart should be so weak in the head then sir i shall take no notice of this at present but leave the whole affair in your hands do sawbridge you have obliged me very much by your kindness in this business mr sawbridge then took his leave and captain wilson despatched a note to our hero requesting the pleasure of his company to breakfast at nine oclock the ensuing morning the answer was in the affirmative but verbal for jack had drunk too much champagne to trust his pen to paper chapter ix in which mr easy finds himself on the other side of the bay of biscay the next morning jack easy would have forgotten all about his engagement with the captain had it not been for the waiter who thought that after the reception which our hero had given the first lieutenant it would be just as well that he should not be disrespectful to the captain now jack had not hitherto put on his uniform and he thought this a fitting occasion particularly as the waiter suggested the propriety of his appearance in it whether it was from a presentiment of what he was to suffer jack was not at all pleased as most lads are with the change in his dress it appeared to him that he was sacrificing his independence however he did not follow his first impulse which was to take it off again but took his hat which the waiter had brushed and handed to him and then set off for the captains lodgings captain wilson received him as if he had not been aware of his delay in joining his ship or his interview with his first lieutenant but before breakfast was over jack himself narrated the affair in a few words captain wilson then entered into a detail of the duties and rank of every person on board of the ship pointing out to jack that where discipline was required it was impossible when duty was carried on that more than one could command and that that one was the captain who represented the king in person who represented the country and that as the orders were transmitted from the captain through the lieutenant and from the lieutenant to the midshipmen who in their turn communicated them to the whole ships company in fact it was the captain alone who gave the orders and that everyone was equally obliged to obey indeed as the captain himself had to obey the orders of his superiors the admiral and the admiralty all on board might be said to be equally obliged to obey captain wilson laid a strong emphasis on the word equally as he cautiously administered his first dose indeed in the whole of his address he made use of special pleading which would have done credit to the bar for at the same time that he was explaining to jack that he was entering a service in which equality could never for a moment exist if the service was to exist he contrived to show that all the grades were levelled by all being equally bound to do their duty to their country and that in fact whether a seaman obeyed his orders or he obeyed the orders of his superior officer they were in reality only obeying the orders of the country which were administered through their channels jack did not altogether dislike this view of the subject and the captain took care not to dwell too long upon it he then entered upon other details which he was aware would be more agreeable to jack he pointed out that the articles of war were the rules by which the service was to be guided and that everybody from the captain to the least boy in the ship was equally bound to adhere to them that a certain allowance of provisions and wine were allowed to each person on board and that this allowance was the same to all the same to the captain as to the boy the same in quantity as in quality everyone equally entitled to his allowancethat although there were of necessity various grades necessary in the service and the captains orders were obliged to be passed and obeyed by all yet still whatever was the grade of the officer they were equally considered as gentlemen in short captain wilson who told the truth and nothing but the truth without telling the whole truth actually made jack fancy that he had at last found out that equality he had been seeking for in vain on shore when at last he recollected the language used by mr sawbridge the evening before and asked the captain why that personage had so conducted himself now as the language of mr sawbridge was very much at variance with equality captain wilson was not a little puzzled however he first pointed out that the first lieutenant was at the time being the captain as he was the senior officer on board as would jack himself be if he were the senior officer on board and that as he before observed the captain or senior officer represented the country that in the articles of war everybody who absented himself from the ship committed an error or breach of those articles and if any error or breach of those articles was committed by anyone belonging to the ship if the senior officer did not take notice of it he then himself committed a breach of those articles and was liable himself to be punished if he could not prove that he had noticed it it was therefore to save himself that he was obliged to point out the error and if he did it in strong language it only proved his zeal for his country upon my honour then replied jack there can be no doubt of his zeal for if the whole country had been at stake he could not have put himself in a greater passion then he did his duty but depend upon it it was not a pleasant one to him and ill answer for it when you meet him on board he will be as friendly with you as if nothing had happened he told me that hed soon make me know what a first lieutenant was what did he mean by that inquired jack all zeal yes but he said that as soon as he got on board hed show me the difference between a first lieutenant and a midshipman all zeal he said my ignorance should be a little enlightened byandbye all zeal and that hed send a sergeant and marines to fetch me all zeal that he would put my philosophy to the proof all zeal mr easy zeal will break out in this way but we should do nothing in the service without it recollect that i hope and trust one day to see you also a zealous officer here jack cogitated considerably and gave no answer you will i am sure continued captain wilson find mr sawbridge one of your best friends perhaps so replied jack but i did not much admire our first acquaintance it will perhaps be your unpleasant duty to find as much fault yourself we are all equally bound to do our duty to our country but mr easy i sent for you to say that we shall sail tomorrow and as i shall send my things off this afternoon by the launch you had better send yours off also at eight oclock i shall go on board and we can both go in the same boat to this jack made no sort of objection and having paid his bill at the fountain he sent his chest down to the boat by some of the crew who came up for it and attended the summons of the captain to embark by nine oclock that evening mr jack easy was safe on board his majestys sloop harpy when jack arrived on board it was dark and he did not know what to do with himself the captain was received by the officers on deck who took off their hats to salute him the captain returned the salute and so did jack very politely after which the captain entered into conversation with the first lieutenant and for a while jack was left to himself it was too dark to distinguish faces and to one who had never been on board of a ship too dark to move so jack stood where he was which was not far from the main bitts but he did not stay long the boat had been hooked on to the quarter davits and the boatswain had called outset taut my lads and then with the shrill whistle and away with her forward came galloping and bounding along the men with the tackles and in the dark jack was upset and half a dozen marines fell upon him the men who had no idea that an officer was floored among the others were pleased at the joke and continued to dance over those who were down until they rolled themselves out of the way jack who did not understand this fared badly and it was not till the calls piped belay that he could recover his legs after having been trampled upon by half the starboard watch and the breath completely jammed out of his body jack reeled to a carronade slide when the officers who had been laughing at the lark as well as the men perceived his situationamong others mr sawbridge the first lieutenant are you hurt mr easy said he kindly a little replied jack catching his breath youve had but a rough welcome replied the first lieutenant but at certain times on board ship it is every man for himself and god for us all harpur continued the first lieutenant to the doctor take mr easy down in the gunroom with you and i will be down myself as soon as i can where is mr jolliffe here sir replied mr jolliffe a masters mate coming aft from the booms there is a youngster come on board with the captain order one of the quartermasters to get a hammock slung in the meantime jack went down into the gunroom where a glass of wine somewhat recovered him he did not stay there long nor did he venture to talk much as soon as his hammock was ready jack was glad to go to bedand as he was much bruised he was not disturbed the next morning till past nine oclock he then dressed himself went on deck found that the sloop was just clear of the needles that he felt very queer then very sick and was conducted by a marine down below put into his hammock where he remained during a gale of wind of three days bewildered confused puzzled and every minute knocking his head against the beams with the pitching and tossing of the sloop and this is going to sea thought jack no wonder that no one interferes with another here or talks about a trespass for im sure anyone is welcome to my share of the ocean and if i once get on shore again the devil may have my portion if he chooses captain wilson and mr sawbridge had both allowed jack more leisure than most midshipmen during his illness by the time that the gale was over the sloop was off cape finisterre the next morning the sea was nearly down and there was but a slight breeze on the waters the comparative quiet of the night before had very much recovered our hero and when the hammocks were piped up he was accosted by mr jolliffe the masters mate who asked whether he intended to rouse and bit or whether he intended to sail to gibraltar between his blankets jack who felt himself quite another person turned out of his hammock and dressed himself a marine had by the captains orders attended jack during his illness and this man came to his assistance opened his chest and brought him all he required or jack would have been in a sad dilemma jack then inquired where he was to go for he had not been in the midshipmens berth although five days on board the marine pointed it out to him and jack who felt excessively hungry crawled over and between chests until he found himself fairly in a hole infinitely inferior to the dogkennels which received his fathers pointers id not only give up the ocean thought jack and my share of it but also my share of the harpy unto anyone who fancies it equality enough here for everyone appears equally miserably off as he thus gave vent to his thoughts he perceived that there was another person in the berthmr jolliffe the masters mate who had fixed his eye upon jack and to whom jack returned the compliment the first thing that jack observed was that mr jolliffe was very deeply pockmarked and that he had but one eye and that was a piercer it appeared like a little ball of fire and as if it reflected more light from the solitary candle than the candle gave i dont like your looks thought jackwe shall never be friends but here jack fell into the common error of judging by appearances as will be proved hereafter im glad to see you up again youngster said jolliffe youve been on your beam ends longer than usual but those who are strongest suffer mostyou made your mind up but late to come to sea however they say better late than never i feel very much inclined to argue the truth of that saying replied jack but its no use just now im terribly hungrywhen shall i get some breakfast tomorrow morning at halfpast eight replied mr jolliffe breakfast for today has been over these two hours but must i then go without no i do not say that as we must make allowances for your illness but it will not be breakfast call it what you please replied jack only pray desire the servants to give me something to eat dry toast or muffinsanything will do but i should prefer coffee you forget that you are off finisterre in a midshipmans berth coffee we have nonemuffins we never see dry toast cannot be made as we have no soft bread but a cup of tea and ships biscuit and butter i can desire the steward to get ready for you well then replied jack i will thank you to procure me that marine cried jolliffe call mesty pass the word for mesty cried the marineand the two syllables were handed forward until lost in the forepart of the vessel the person so named must be introduced to the reader he was a curious anomalya black man who had been brought to america as a slave and there sold he was a very tall sparebuilt yet muscular form and had a face by no means common with his race his head was long and narrow high cheekbones from whence his face descended down to almost a point at the chin his nose was very small but it was straight and almost roman his mouth also was unusually small and his lips thin for an african his teeth very white and filed to sharp points he claimed the rank of prince in his own country with what truth could not of course be substantiated his master had settled at new york and there mesty had learned english if it could be socalled the fact is that all the emigrant labourers at new york being irishmen he had learned english with the strong brogue and peculiar phraseology of the sister kingdom dashed with a little yankeeism having been told that there was no slavery in england mesty had concealed himself on board an english merchant vessel and escaped on his arrival in england he had entered on board of a manofwar having no name it was necessary to christen him on the ships books and the first lieutenant who had entered him struck with his remarkable expression of countenance and being a german scholar had named him mephistopheles faust from whence his christian name had been razed to mesty mesty in other points was an eccentric character at one moment when he remembered his lineage he was proud to excess at others he was grave and almost sullenbut when nothing either in daily occurrences or in his mind ran contrary he exhibited the drollery so often found in his nation with a spice of irish humour as if he had caught up the latter with his irish brogue mesty was soon seen coming aft but almost double as he couched under the beams and taking large strides with his naked feet by the powers massa yolliffe but it is not seasonable at all to send for me just now anyhow seeing how the praters are in the copper and so many blackguard palpeens all ready to change net for net and better themselves by the same mistake dam um mesty you know i never send for you myself or allow others to do so unless it is necessary replied jolliffe but this poor lad has eaten nothing since he has been on board and is very hungryyou must get him a little tea is it tay you mane siri guess to make tay in the first place i must ab water and in the next must ab room in the galley to put the kettle onand pose you wanted to burn the tip of your little finger just now its not in the galley that you find a berth for itand den the water before seven bells ive a notion its just impossible but he must have something mesty never mind the tea then replied jack ill take some milk is it milk massa manes and the bumboat woman on the oder side of the bay we have no milk mr easy you forget that we are on blue water replied jolliffe and i really am afraid that youll have to wait till dinnertime mesty tells the truth i tell you what massa yolliffe it just seven bells and if the young gentleman would instead of tay try a little out of the copper it might keep him asy it but a little difference tay soup and pay soup now a bowl of that with some nuts and a flourish of pepper will do him good anyhow perhaps the best thing he can take mesty get it as fast as you can in a few minutes the black brought down a bowl of soup and whole peas swimming in it put before our hero a tin breadbasket full of small biscuit called midshipmens nuts and the peppercaster jacks visions of tea coffee muffins dry toast and milk vanished as he perceived the mess but he was very hungry and he found it much better than he expected and he moreover found himself much the better after he had swallowed it it struck seven bells and he accompanied mr jolliffe on deck chapter x showing how jack transgresses against his own philosophy when jack easy had gained the deck he found the sun shining gaily a soft air blowing from the shore and the whole of the rigging and every part of the ship loaded with the shirts trousers and jackets of the seamen which had been wetted during the heavy gale and were now hanging up to dry all the wet sails were also spread on the booms or triced up in the rigging and the ship was slowly forging through the blue water the captain and first lieutenant were standing on the gangway in converse and the majority of the officers were with their quadrants and sextants ascertaining the latitude at noon the decks were white and clean the sweepers had just laid by their brooms and the men were busy coiling down the ropes it was a scene of cheerfulness activity and order which tightened his heart after the four days of suffering close air and confinement from which he had just emerged the captain who perceived him beckoned to him asked him kindly how he felt the first lieutenant also smiled upon him and many of the officers as well as his messmates congratulated him upon his recovery the captains steward came up to him touched his hat and requested the pleasure of his company to dinner in the cabin jack was the essence of politeness took off his hat and accepted the invitation jack was standing on a rope which a seaman was coiling down the man touched his hat and requested he would be so kind as to take his foot off jack took his hat off his head in return and his foot off the rope the master touched his hat and reported twelve oclock to the first lieutenantthe first lieutenant touched his hat and reported twelve oclock to the captainthe captain touched his hat and told the first lieutenant to make it so the officer of the watch touched his hat and asked the captain whether they should pipe to dinner the captain touched his hat and saidif you please the midshipman received his orders and touched his hat which he gave to the head boatswains mate who touched his hat and then the calls whistled cheerily well thought jack politeness seems to be the order of the day and everyone has an equal respect for the other jack stayed on deck he peeped through the ports which were open and looked down into the deep blue wave he cast his eyes aloft and watched the tall spars sweeping and tracing with their points as it were a small portion of the clear sky as they acted in obedience to the motion of the vessel he looked forward at the range of carronades which lined the sides of the deck and then he proceeded to climb one of the carronades and lean over the hammocks to gaze on the distant land young gentleman get off those hammocks cried the master who was officer of the watch in a surly tone jack looked round do you hear me sir im speaking to you said the master again jack felt very indignant and he thought that politeness was not quite so general as he supposed it happened that captain wilson was upon deck come here mr easy said the captain it is a rule in the service that no one gets on the hammocks unless in case of emergencyi never donor the first lieutenantnor any of the officers or mentherefore upon the principle of equality you must not do it either certainly not sir replied jack but still i do not see why that officer in the shining hat should be so angry and not speak to me as if i were a gentleman as well as himself i have already explained that to you mr easy o yes i recollect now its zeal but this zeal appears to me to be the only unpleasant thing in the service its a pity as you said that the service cannot do without it captain wilson laughed and walked away and shortly afterwards as he turned up and down the deck with the master he hinted to him that he should not speak so sharply to a lad who had committed such a trifling error through ignorance now mr smallsole the master who was a surly sort of a personage and did not like even a hint of disapprobation of his conduct although very regardless of the feeling of others determined to pay this off on jack the very first convenient opportunity jack dined in the cabin and was very much pleased to find that everyone drank wine with him and that everybody at the captains table appeared to be on an equality before the dessert had been on the table five minutes jack became loquacious on his favourite topic all the company stared with surprise at such an unheardof doctrine being broached on board of a manofwar the captain argued the point so as to controvert without too much offending jacks notions laughing the whole time that the conversation was carried on it will be observed that this day may be considered as the first in which jack really made his appearance on board and it also was on this first day that jack made known at the captains table his very peculiar notions if the company at the captains table which consisted of the second lieutenant purser mr jolliffe and one of the midshipmen were astonished at such heterodox opinions being stated in the presence of the captain they were equally astonished at the cool goodhumoured ridicule with which they were received by captain wilson the report of jacks boldness and every word and opinion that he had uttered of course much magnified was circulated that evening through the whole ship it was canvassed in the gunroom by the officers it was descanted upon by the midshipmen as they walked the deck the captains steward held a levee abreast of the ships funnel in which he narrated this new doctrine the sergeant of marines gave his opinion in his berth that it was damnable the boatswain talked over the matter with the other warrant officers till the grog was all gone and then dismissed it as too dry a subject and it was the general opinion of the ships company that as soon as they arrived at gibraltar bay our hero would bid adieu to the service either by being sentenced to death by a courtmartial or by being dismissed and towed on shore on a grating others who had more of the wisdom of the serpent and who had been informed by mr sawbridge that our hero was a lad who would inherit a large property argued differently and considered that captain wilson had very good reason for being so lenientand among them was the second lieutenant there were but four who were well inclined towards jackto wit the captain the first lieutenant mr jolliffe the oneeyed masters mate and mephistopheles the black who having heard that jack had uttered such sentiments loved him with all his heart and soul we have referred to the second lieutenant mr asper this young man had a very high respect for birth and particularly for money of which he had very little he was the son of an eminent merchant who during the time that he was a midshipman had allowed him a much larger sum for his expenses than was necessary or proper and during his career he found that his full pocket procured him consequence not only among his own messmates but also with many of the officers of the ships that he sailed in a man who is able and willing to pay a large tavern bill will always find followersthat is to the tavern and lieutenants did not disdain to dine walk arminarm and be hail fellow well met with a midshipman at whose expense they lived during the time they were on shore mr asper had just received his commission and appointment when his father became a bankrupt and the fountain was dried up from which he had drawn such liberal supplies since that mr asper had felt that his consequence was gone he could no longer talk about the service being a bore or that he should give it up he could no longer obtain that deference paid to his purse and not to himself and he had contracted very expensive habits without having any longer the means of gratifying them it was therefore no wonder that he imbibed a great respect for money and as he could no longer find the means himself he was glad to pick up anybody else at whose cost he could indulge in that extravagance and expense to which he had been so long accustomed and still sighed for now mr asper knew that our hero was well supplied with money as he had obtained from the waiter the amount of the bill paid at the fountain and he had been waiting for jacks appearance on deck to become his very dearest and most intimate friend the conversation in the cabin made him feel assured that jack would require and be grateful for support and he had taken the opportunity of a walk with mr sawbridge to offer to take jack in his watch whether it was that mr sawbridge saw through the design of mr asper or whether he imagined that our hero would be better pleased with him than with the master considering his harshness of deportment or with himself who could not as first lieutenant overlook any remission of duty the offer was accepted and jack easy was ordered as he now entered upon his duties to keep watch under lieutenant asper but not only was this the first day that jack may be said to have appeared in the service but it was the first day in which he had entered the midshipmans berth and was made acquainted with his messmates we have already mentioned mr jolliffe the masters mate but we must introduce him more particularly nature is sometimes extremely arbitrary and never did she show herself more so than in insisting that mr jolliffe should have the most sinister expression of countenance that ever had been looked upon he had suffered martyrdom with the smallpox which probably had contracted his lineaments his face was not only deeply pitted but scarred with this cruel disorder one eye had been lost and all eyebrows had disappearedand the contrast between the dull sightless opaque orb on one side of his face and the brilliant piercing little ball on the other was almost terrifying his nose had been eaten away by the disease till it formed a sharp but irregular point part of the muscles of the chin were contracted and it was drawn in with unnatural seams and puckers he was tall gaunt and thin seldom smiled and when he did the smile produced a still further distortion mr jolliffe was the son of a warrant officer he did not contract this disease until he had been sent out to the west indies where it swept away hundreds he had now been long in the service with little or no chance of promotion he had suffered from indigence from reflections upon his humble birth from sarcasms on his appearance every contumely had been heaped upon him at one time or another in the ships in which he served among a crowd he had found himself desolateand now although no one dared treat him to his face with disrespect he was only respected in the service from a knowledge of his utility and exemplary performance of his dutieshe had no friends or even companions for many years he had retired within himself he had improved by reading and study had felt all the philanthropy of a christian and extended it towards others silent and reserved he seldom spoke in the berth unless his authority as caterer was called for all respected mr jolliffe but no one liked as a companion one at whose appearance the very dogs would bark at the same time every one acknowledged his correct behaviour in every point his sense of justice his forbearance his kindness and his good sense with him life was indeed a pilgrimage and he wended his way in all christian charity and all christian zeal in all societies however small they may be provided that they do but amount to halfadozen you will invariably meet with a bully and it is also generally the case that you will find one of that society who is more or less the butt you will discover this even in occasional meetings such as a dinnerparty the major part of which have never met before previous to the removal of the cloth the bully will have shown himself by his dictatorial manner and will also have selected the one upon whom he imagines that he can best practise in a midshipmans berth this fact has become almost proverbial although now perhaps it is not attended with that disagreeable despotism which was permitted at the time that our hero entered the service the bully of the midshipmans berth of hm sloop harpy was a young man about seventeen with light curly hair and florid countenance the son of the clerk in the dockyard at plymouth and his name was vigors the butt was a puddingfaced tartarphysiognomied boy of fifteen whose intellects with fostering if not great might at least have been respectable had he not lost all confidence in his own powers from the constant jeers and mockeries of those who had a greater fluency of speech without perhaps so much real power of mind although slow what he learnt he invariably retained this lads name was gossett his father was a wealthy yeoman of lynn in norfolk there were at the time but three other midshipmen in the ship of whom it can only be said that they were like midshipmen in general with little appetite for learning but good appetites for dinner hating everything like work fond of everything like fun fighting a loutrance one minute and sworn friends the nextwith general principles of honour and justice but which were occasionally warped according to circumstances with all the virtues and vices so heterogeneously jumbled and heaped together that it was almost impossible to ascribe any action to its true motive and to ascertain to what point their vice was softened down into almost a virtue and their virtues from mere excess degenerated into vice their names were oconnor mills and gascoigne the other shipmates of our hero it will be better to introduce as they appear on the stage after jack had dined in the cabin he followed his messmates jolliffe and gascoigne down into the midshipmens berth i say easy observed gascoigne you are a devilish free and easy sort of a fellow to tell the captain that you considered yourself as great a man as he was i beg your pardon replied jack i did not argue individually but generally upon the principles of the rights of man well replied gascoigne its the first time i ever heard a middy do such a bold thing take care your rights of man dont get you in the wrong boxtheres no arguing on board of a manofwar the captain took it amazingly easy but youd better not broach that subject too often gascoigne gives you very good advice mr easy observed jolliffe allowing that your ideas are correct which it appears to me they are not or at least impossible to be acted upon there is such a thing as prudence and however much this question may be canvassed on shore in his majestys service it is not only dangerous in itself but will be very prejudicial to you man is a free agent replied easy ill be shot if a midshipman is replied gascoigne laughing aloud that youll soon find and yet it was in the expectation of finding that equality that i was induced to come to sea on the first of april i presume replied gascoigne but are you really serious hereupon jack entered into a long argument to which jolliffe and gascoigne listened without interruption and mesty with admiration at the end of it gascoigne laughed heartily and jolliffe sighed from whence did you learn all this inquired jolliffe from my father who is a great philosopher and has constantly upheld these opinions and did your father wish you to go to sea no he was opposed to it replied jack but of course he could not combat my right and freewill mr easy as a friend replied jolliffe i request that you would as much as possible keep your opinions to yourself i shall have an opportunity of talking to you on the subject and will then explain to you my reasons as soon as mr jolliffe had ceased down came mr vigors and oconnor who had heard the news of jacks heresy you do not know mr vigors and mr oconnor said jolliffe to easy jack who was the essence of politeness rose and bowed at which the others took their seats without returning the salutation vigors had from what he had heard and now seen of easy thought he had somebody else to play upon and without ceremony he commenced so my chap you are come on board to raise a mutiny here with your equalityyou came off scot free at the captains table but it wont do i can tell you even in the midshipmans berth some must knock under and you are one of them if sir replied easy you mean by knock under that i must submit i can assure you that you are mistaken upon the same principle that i would never play the tyrant to those weaker than myself so will i resent oppression if attempted damme but hes a regular sea lawyer already however my boy well soon put your mettle to the proof am i then to infer that i am not on an equality with my messmates replied jack looking at jolliffe the latter was about to answer him but vigors interrupted yes you are on an equality as far as this that you have an equal right to the berth if you are not knocked out of it for insolence to your masters that you have an equal share to pay for the things purchased for the mess and an equal right to have your share provided you can get it you have an equal right to talk provided you are not told to hold your tongue the fact is you have an equal right with everyone else to do as you can get what you can and say what you can always provided that you can do it for here the weakest goes to the wall and that is midshipmans berth equality now do you understand all that or will you wait for a practical illustration i am then to infer that the equality here is as much destroyed as it even will be among savages where the strong oppress the weak and the only law is club lawin fact much the same as it is at a public or large school on shore i suspect you are right for once you were at a public school how did they treat you there as you propose treating people herethe weakest went to the wall well then a nods as good as a wink to a blind horse thats all my hearty said vigors but the hands being turned up shorten sail put an end to the altercation for the present as our hero had not yet received orders to go to his duty he remained below with mesty by de powers massa easy but i lub you with my hole soul said mesty by jasus you really tark fine massa easy dat mr vigor nebber care for him wouldnt you help himand sure you would continued the black feeling the muscle of jacks arm by the soul of my fader id bet my weeks allowance on you anyhow nebber be fraid massa easy i am not afraid replied jack ive thrashed bigger fellows than he and jacks assertion was true mr bonnycastle never interfered in a fair fight and took no notice of black eyes provided the lessons there well said jack had fought and fought again until he was a very good bruiser and although not so tall as vigors he was much better built for fighting a knowing westminster boy would have bet his halfcrown upon jack had he seen him and his anticipated adversary the constant battles which jack was obliged to fight at school had been brought forward by jack against his fathers arguments in favour of equality but they had been overruled by mr easys pointing out that the combats of boys had nothing to do with the rights of man as soon as the watch was called vigors oconnor gossett and gascoigne came down into the berth vigors who was the strongest in the berth except jolliffe had successively had his superiority acknowledged and when on deck he had talked of easys impertinence and his intention of bringing him to his senses the others therefore came down to see the fun well mr easy observed vigors as he came into the berth you take after your name at all events i suppose you intend to eat the kings provision and do nothing jacks mettle was already up you will oblige me sir by minding your own business replied jack you impudent blackguard if you say another word ill give you a good thrashing and knock some of your equality out of you indeed replied jack who almost fancied himself back at mr bonnycastles well try that whereupon jack very coolly divested himself of his upper garments neckerchief and shirt much to the surprise of mr vigors who little contemplated such a proof of decision and confidence and still more to the delight of the other midshipmen who would have forfeited a weeks allowance to see vigors well thrashed vigors however knew that he had gone too far to retreat he therefore prepared for action and when ready the whole party went out into the steerage to settle the business vigors had gained his assumed authority more by bullying than fighting others had submitted to him without a sufficient trial jack on the contrary had won his way up in school by hard and scientific combat the result therefore may easily be imagined in less than a quarter of an hour vigors beaten dead with his eyes closed and three teeth out gave in while jack after a basin of water looked as fresh as ever with the exception of a few trifling scratches the news of this victory was soon through the ship and before jack had resumed his clothes it had been told confidentially by sawbridge to the captain so soon said captain wilson laughing i expected that a midshipmans berth would do wonders but i did not expect this yet awhile this victory is the first severe blow to mr easys equality and will be more valuable than twenty defeats let him now go to his duty he will soon find his level chapter xi in which our hero proves that all on board should equally sacrifice decency to duty the success of any young man in a profession very much depends upon the occurrences at the commencement of his career as from those is his character judged and he is treated accordingly jack had chosen to enter the service at a much later period than most lads he was tall and manly for his age and his countenance if not strictly handsome wore that expression of honesty and boldness which is sure to please his spirit in not submitting to and meeting vigors when he had hardly recovered from his severe prostration of seasickness had gained him with the many respect and with all except his antagonist and mr smallsole goodwill instead of being laughed at by his messmates he was played with for jolliffe smiled at his absurdities and attempted to reason him out of them and the others liked jack for himself and his generosity and moreover because they looked up to him as a protector against vigors who had persecuted them all for jack had declared that as might was right in a midshipmans berth he would so far restore equality that if he could not put down those who were the strongest at all events he would protect the weak and let who would come into the berth they must be his master before they should tyrannise over those weaker than he thus did jack easy make the best use that he could of his strength and become as it were the champion and security of those who although much longer at sea and more experienced than he was were glad to shelter themselves under his courage and skill the latter of which had excited the admiration of the butcher of the ship who had been a pugilist by profession thus did jack at once take the rank of an oldster and soon became the leader of all the mischief we particularly observe this because had it so happened that our hero had succumbed to vigors the case would have been the very reverse he then would have had to go through the ordeal to which most who enter the naval service are exposed which cannot be better explained than by comparing it to the fagging carried to such an iniquitous extent in public schools mr asper for his own reasons made him his companion they walked the night watch together and he listened to all jacks nonsense about the rights of man and here mr asper did good without intending it for at the same time that he appeared to agree with jack to secure his favour he cautioned him and pointed out why this equality could not exist altogether on board of a manofwar as for himself he said he saw no difference between a lieutenant or even a captain and a midshipman provided they were gentlemen he should choose his friends where he liked and despised that power of annoyance which the service permitted of course jack and mr asper were good friends especially as when half the watch was over to conciliate his goodwill and to get rid of his eternal arguing mr asper would send jack down to bed they were now entering the straits and expected to anchor the next day at gibraltar and jack was forward on the forecastle talking with mesty with whom he had contracted a great friendship for there was nothing that mesty would not have done for jack although he had not been three weeks in the ship but a little reflection will show that it was natural mesty had been a great man in his own country he had suffered all the horrors of a passage in a slave ship he had been sold as a slave twice he had escapedbut he found that the universal feeling was strong against his colour and that on board of a manofwar he was condemned although free to the humblest of offices he had never heard anyone utter the sentiments which now beat in his own heart of liberty and equalitywe say now for when he was in his own country before his captivity he had no ideas of equality no one has who is in power but he had been schooled and although people talked of liberty and equality at new york he found that what they preached for themselves they did not practise towards others and that in the midst of liberty and equality he and thousands more were enslaved and degraded beings escaping to england he had regained his liberty but not his equality his colour had prevented the latter and in that feeling all the world appeared to conspire together against him until to his astonishment he heard those sentiments boldly expressed from the lips of jack and that in a service where it was almost tantamount to mutiny mesty whose character is not yet developed immediately took a fondness for our hero and in a hundred ways showed his attachment jack also liked mesty and was fond of talking with him and every evening since the combat with vigors they had generally met in the forecastle to discuss the principles of equality and the rights of man the boatswain whose name was biggs was a slight dapper active little man who as captain of the foretop had shown an uncommon degree of courage in a hurricane so much so as to recommend him to the admiral for promotion it was given to him and after the ship to which he had been appointed was paid off he had been ordered to join hm sloop harpy jacks conversation with mesty was interrupted by the voice of the boatswain who was haranguing his boy its now ten minutes sir by my repeater said the boatswain that i have sent for you and mr biggs pulled out a huge silver watch almost as big as a norfolk turnip a jew had sold him the watch the boatswain had heard of repeaters and wished to have one moses had only shown him watches with the hour and minute hands he now produced one with a second hand telling him it was a repeater what makes it a repeater inquired the boatswain common watches said the cunning jew only tell the minutes and hours but all repeaters tell the seconds the boatswain was satisfiedbought the watch and although many had told him it was no repeater he insisted that it was and would call it so i swear continued the boatswain its ten minutes and twenty seconds by my repeater if you please sir said the boy i was changing my trousers when you sent for me and then i had to stow away my bag again silence sir id have you to know that when you are sent for by your officer trousers or no trousers it is your duty to come up directly without trousers sir replied the boy yes sir without trousers if the captain required me i should come without my shirt duty before decency so saying the boatswain lays hold of the boy surely mr biggs said jack you are not going to punish that boy for not coming up without his trousers yes mr easy i ami must teach him a lesson we are bound now that newfangled ideas are brought into the ship to uphold the dignity of the service and the orders of an officer are not to be delayed ten minutes and twenty seconds because a boy has no trousers on whereupon the boatswain administered several smart cuts with his rattan upon the boy proving that it was quite as well that he had put on his trousers before he came on deck there said mr biggs is a lesson for you you scampand mr easy it is a lesson for you also continued the boatswain walking away with a most consequential air murder irish said mestyhow him cut caper de oder day he haul out de weather earring and touch him hat to a midshipman sure enough make um cat laugh the next day the harpy was at anchor in gibraltar bay the captain went on shore directing the gig to be sent for him before nine oclock after which hour the sallyport is only opened by special permission there happened to be a ball given by the officers of the garrison on that evening and a polite invitation was sent to the officers of hm sloop harpy as those who accepted the invitation would be detained late it was not possible for them to come off that night and as their services were required for the next day captain wilson allowed them to remain on shore until seven oclock the next morning at which hour as there was a large party there would be two boats sent for them mr asper obtained leave and asked permission to take our hero with him to which mr sawbridge consented many other officers obtained leave and among others the boatswain who aware that his services would be in request as soon as the equipment commenced asked permission for this evening and mr sawbridge feeling that he could be better spared at this than at any other time consented asper and jack went to an inn dined bespoke beds and then dressed themselves for the ball which was very brilliant and from the company of the officers very pleasant captain wilson looked on at the commencement and then returned on board jack behaved with his usual politeness danced till two oclock and then as the ball thinned asper proposed that they should retires having once more applied to the refreshmentroom they had procured their hats and were about to depart when one of the officers of the garrison asked jack if he would like to see a baboon which had just been brought down from the rock and taking some of the cakes they repaired to the court where the animal was chained down to a small tank jack fed the brute till all the cakes were gone and then because he had no more to give him the baboon flew at jack who in making his retreat fell back into the tank which was about two feet deep this was a joke and having laughed heartily they wished the officer goodnight and went to the inn now what with the number of officers of the harpy on shore who had all put up at the same inn and other occupants the landlord was obliged to put his company into double and treblebedded rooms but this was of little consequence jack was shown into a doublebedded room and proceeded to undress the other was evidently occupied by the heavy breathing which saluted jacks ear as jack undressed he recollected that his trousers were wet through and to dry them he opened the window hung them out and then jammed down the window again upon them to hold them in their position after which he turned in and fell fast asleep at six oclock he was called as he had requested and proceeded to dress but to his astonishment found the window thrown open and his trousers missing it was evident that his partner in the room had thrown the window open during the night and that his trousers having fallen down into the street had been walked off with by somebody or another jack looked out of the window once more and perceived that whoever had thrown open the window had been unwell during the night a nice drunken companion i have had thought jack but whats to be done and in saying this he walked up to the other bed and perceived that it was tenanted by the boatswain well thought jack as mr biggs has thought proper to lose my trousers i think i have a right to take his or at least the wear of them to go on board it was but last night he declared that decency must give way to duty and that the orders of a superior officer were to be obeyed with or without garments i know he is obliged to be on board and now he shall try how he likes to obey orders in his shirt tails so cogitating jack took the trousers of the boatswain who still snored although he had been called and putting them on completed the rest of his dress and quitted the room he went to that of mr asper where he found him just ready and having paid the billfor asper had forgotten his pursethey proceeded down to the sallyport where they found other officers waiting sufficient to load the first boat which shoved off and they went on board as soon as he was down below jack hastened to change his trousers and unobserved by anyone threw those belonging to mr biggs on a chair in his cabin and having made a confidant of mesty who was delighted he went on deck and waited the issue of the affair before jack left the hotel he had told the waiter that there was the boatswain still fast asleep and that he must be roused up immediately and this injunction was obeyed the boatswain who had drunk too much the night before and as jack had truly imagined had opened the window because he was unwell was wakened up and hearing how late it was hastened to dress himself not finding his trousers he rang the bell supposing that they had been taken down to be brushed and in the meantime put on everything else that he might lose no time the waiter who answered the bell denied having taken the trousers out of the room and poor mr biggs was in a sad quandary what had become of them he could not tell he had no recollection of having gone to bed the night before he inquired of the waiter who said that he knew nothing about themthat he was very tipsy when he came home and that when he called him he had found the window open and it appeared that he had been unwellhe supposed that he had thrown his trousers out of the window time flew and the boatswain was in despair could they lend him a pair he would call his master the master of the inn knew very well the difference of rank between officers and those whom he could trust and those whom he could not he sent up the bill by the waiter and stated that for a deposit the gentleman might have a pair of trousers the boatswain felt in his pockets and remembered that all his money was in his trousers pocket he could not only not leave a deposit but could not pay his bill the landlord was inexorable it was bad enough to lose his money but he could not lose more i shall be tried by a courtmartial by heavens exclaimed the boatswainits not far from the sallyport ill make a run for it and i can slip into one of the boats and get another pair of trousers before i report myself as having come on board so making up his mind the boatswain took to his heels and with his check shirt tails streaming in the wind ran as hard as he could to where the boat was waiting to receive him he was encountered by many but he only ran the faster the more they jeered and at last arrived breathless at his goal flew down the steps jumped into the boat and squatted on the stern sheets much to the surprise of the officers and men who thought him mad he stated in a few words that somebody had stolen his trousers during the night and as it was already late the boat shoved off the men as well as officers convulsed with laughter have any of you a peajacket inquired the boatswain of the menbut the weather was so warm that none of them had brought a peajacket the boatswain looked round he perceived that the officers were sitting on a boatcloak whose boatcloak is that inquired the boatswain mine replied gascoigne i trust mr gascoigne you will have the kindness to lend it to me to go up the side with indeed i will not replied gascoigne who would sooner have thrown it overboard and have lost it than not beheld the anticipated fun recollect i asked you for a fishingline when we were becalmed off cape st vincent and you sent word that youd see me dead first now ill just see you the same before you have my boatcloak oh mr gascoigne ill give you three lines directly i get on board i dare say you will but that wont do now tit for tat mr boatswain and hang all favours replied gascoigne who was steering the boat having been sent on shore for the others in borrowed of all the boat was laid alongsidethe relentless gascoigne caught up his boatcloak as the other officers rose to go on board and rolling it up in spite of the earnest entreaties of mr biggs tossed it into the main chains to the man who had thrown the stem fast and to make the situation of mr biggs still more deplorable the first lieutenant was standing looking into the boat and captain wilson walking the quarterdeck come mr biggs i expected you off in the first boat cried mr sawbridge be as smart as you please for the yards are not yet squared shall i go ahead in this boat and square them sir that boat no let her drop astern jump up here and lower down the dinghy what the devil do you sit there for mr biggsyoull oblige me by showing a little more activity or by jove you may save yourself the trouble of asking to go on shore again are you sober sir the last observation decided mr biggs he sprung up from the boat just as he was and touched his hat as he passed the first lieutenant perfectly sober sir but ive lost my trousers so it appears sir replied mr sawbridge as mr biggs stood on the plane shear of the sloop where the hammock netting divides for an entrance with his shirt tails fluttering in the sea breeze but mr sawbridge could not contain himself any longer he ran down the ship ladder which led on the quarterdeck choked with laughter mr biggs could not descend until after mr sawbridge and the conversation had attracted the notice of all and every eye in the ship was on him whats all this said captain wilson coming to the gangway duty before decency replied jack who stood by enjoying the joke mr biggs recollected the day beforehe cast a furious look at jack as he touched his hat to the captain and then dived down to the lower deck if anything could add to the indignation of the boatswain it was to find that his trousers had come on board before him he now felt that a trick had been played him and also that our hero must have been the party but he could prove nothing he could not say who slept in the same room for he was fast asleep when jack went to bed and fast asleep when jack quitted the room the truth of the story soon became known to all the ship and duty before decency became a byeword all that the boatswain could do he did which was to revenge himself upon the poor boyand gascoigne and jack never got any fishingtackle the boatswain was as obnoxious to the men as vigors and in consequence of jacks known opinions upon the rights of man and his having floored their two greatest enemies he became a great favourite with the seamen and as all favourites are honoured by them with a soubriquet our hero obtained that of equality jack chapter xii in which our hero prefers going down to going up a choice it is to be hoped he will reverse upon a more important occasion the next day being sunday the hands were turned up to divisions and the weather not being favourable instead of the service the articles of war were read with all due respect shown to the same the captain officers and crew with their hats off in a mizzling rain jack who had been told by the captain that these articles of war were the rules and regulations of the service by which the captain officers and men were equally bound listened to them as they were read by the clerk with the greatest attention he little thought that there were about five hundred orders from the admiralty tacked on to them which like the numerous codicils of some wills contained the most important matter and to a certain degree make the will nugatory jack listened very attentively and as each article was propounded felt that he was not likely to commit himself in that point and although he was rather astonished to find such a positive injunction against swearing considered quite a dead letter in the ship he thought that altogether he saw his way very clear but to make certain of it as soon as the hands had been piped down he begged the clerk to let him have a copy of the articles now the clerk had three being the allowance of the ship or at least all that he had in his possession and made some demur at parting with one but at last he proposedsome rascal as he said having stolen his toothbrushthat if jack would give him one he would give him one of the copies of the articles of war jack replied that the one he had in use was very much worn and that unfortunately he had but one new one which he could not spare thereupon the clerk who was a very clean personage and could not bear that his teeth should be dirty agreed to accept the one in use as jack could not part with the other the exchange was made and jack read the articles of war over and over again till he thought he was fully master of them now says jack i know what i am to do and what i am to expect and these articles of war i will carry in my pocket as long as im in the service that is to say if they last so long and provided they do not i am able to replace them with another old toothbrush which appears to be the value attached to them the harpy remained a fortnight in gibraltar bay and jack had occasionally a run on shore and mr asper invariably went with him to keep him out of mischief that is to say he allowed him to throw his money away on no one more worthless than himself one morning jack went down in the berth and found young gossett blubbering whats the matter my dear mr gossett inquired jack who was just as polite to the youngster as he was to anybody else vigors has been thrashing me with a ropes end replied gossett rubbing his arm and shoulders what for inquired jack because he says the service is going to hellim sure its no fault of mineand that now all subordination is destroyed and that upstarts join the ship who because they have a fivepound note in their pocket are allowed to do just as they please he said he was determined to uphold the service and then he knocked me downand when i got up again he told me that i could stand a little moreand then he took out his colt and said he was determined to ride the high horseand that there should be no equality jack in future well replied jack and then he colted me for half an hour and thats all by de soul of my fader but it all for true massa easyhe larrup um sure enoughall for noting bad luck to himi tink continued mesty he hab debelish bad memoryand he want a little more of equality jack and he shall have it too replied our hero why its against the articles of war all quarrelling fighting c i say mr gossett have you got the spirit of a louse yes replied gossett well then will you do what i tell you next time and trust to me for protection i dont care what i do replied the boy if you will back me against the cowardly tyrant do you refer to me cried vigors who had stopped at the door of the berth say yes said jack yes i do cried gossett you do do youwell then my chick i must trouble you with a little more of this said vigors drawing out his colt i think that you had better not mr vigors observed jack mind your own business if you please returned vigors not much liking the interference i am not addressing my conversation to you and i will thank you never to interfere with me i presume i have a right to choose my own acquaintance and depend upon it it will not be that of a leveller all that is at your pleasure mr vigors replied jack you have a right to choose your own acquaintance and so have i a right to choose my own friends and further to support them that lad is my friend mr vigors then replied vigors who could not help bullying even at the risk of another combat which he probably intended to stand i shall take the liberty of giving your friend a thrashing and he suited the action to the word then i shall take the liberty to defend my friend replied jack and as you call me a leveller ill try if i may not deserve the name whereupon jack placed a blow so well under the ear that mr vigors dropped on the deck and was not in a condition to come to the scratch even if he had been inclined and now youngster said jack wresting the colt out of vigors hand do as i bid yougive him a good colting if you dont ill thrash you gossett required no second threatthe pleasure of thrashing his enemy if only for once was quite enoughand he laid well on jack with his fists doubled ready to protect him if there was a show of resistance but vigors was half stupefied with the blow under the ear and quite cowed he took his thrashing in the most pensive manner that will do said jack and now do not be afraid gossett the very first time he offers to strike you when i am not present i will pay him off for it as soon as you tell me i wont be called equality jack for nothing when jolliffe who heard of this met our hero alone he said to him take my advice boy and do not in future fight the battles of others youll find very soon that you will have enough to do to fight your own whereupon jack argued the point for half an hour and then they separated but mr jolliffe was right jack began to find himself constantly in hot water and the captain and first lieutenant although they did not really withdraw their protection thought it high time that jack should find out that on board a manofwar everybody and everything must find its level there was on board of his majestys sloop harpy a man of the name of easthupp who did the duty of pursers steward this was the second ship that he had served in in the former he had been sent with a draft of men from the tender lying off the tower how he had come into the service was not known in the present ship but the fact was that he had been one of the swell moband had been sent on board the tender with a letter of recommendation from the magistrates to captain crouch he was a cockney by birth for he had been left at the workhouse of st mary axe where he had been taught to read and write and had afterwards made his escape he joined the juvenile thieves of the metropolis had been sent to bridewell obtained his liberty and by degrees had risen from petty thieving of goods exposed outside of the shops and marketstalls to the higher class of gentleman pickpockets his appearance was somewhat genteel with a bullying sort of an impudent air which is mistaken for fashion by those who know no better a remarkable neat dresser for that was part of his profession a very plausible manner and address a great fluency of language although he clipped the kings english and as he had suffered more than once by the law it is not to be wondered at that he was as he called himself a houtandhout radical during the latter part of his service in his last ship he had been employed under the pursers steward and having offered himself in this capacity to the purser of hm sloop harpy with one or two forged certificates he had been accepted now when mr easthupp heard of jacks opinion he wished to cultivate his acquaintance and with a bow and a flourish introduced himself before they arrived at gibraltar but our hero took an immediate dislike to this fellow from his excessive and impertinent familiarity jack knew a gentleman when he met one and did not choose to be a companion to a man beneath him in every way but who upon the strength of jacks liberal opinions presumed to be his equal jacks equality did not go so far as that in theory it was all very well but in practice it was only when it suited his own purpose but the pursers steward was not to be checkeda man who has belonged to the swell mob is not easily repulsed and although jack would plainly show him that his company was not agreeable easthupp would constantly accost him familiarly on the forecastle and lower deck with his arms folded and with an air almost amounting to familiarity at last jack told him to go about his business and not presume to talk to him whereupon easthupp rejoined and after an exchange of hard words it ended by jack kicking mr easthupp as he called himself down the afterlowerdeck hatchway this was but a sorry specimen of jacks equalityand mr easthupp who considered that his honour had been compromised went up to the captain on the quarterdeck and lodged his complaintwhereupon captain wilson desired that mr easy might be summoned as soon as jack made his appearance captain wilson called to easthupp now pursers steward what is this you have to say if you please captain vilson i am wery sorry to be obliged to make hany complaint of hany hofficer but this mr heasy thought proper to make use of language quite hunbecoming of a gentleman and then to kick me as i vent down the atchvay well mr easy is this true yes sir replied jack i have several times told the fellow not to address himself to me and he will i did tell him he was a radical blackguard and i did kick him down the hatchway you told him he was a radical blackguard mr easy yes sir he comes bothering me about his republic and asserting that we have no want of a king and aristocracy captain wilson looked significantly at mr sawbridge i certainly did hoffer my political opinions captain vilson but you must be avare that ve hall ave an hequal stake in the countryand its a hinglishmans birthright im not aware what your stake in the country may be mr easthupp observed captain wilson but i think that if you used such expressions mr easy was fully warranted in telling you his opinion i ham villing captain vilson to make hany hallowance for the eat of political discussionbut that is not hall that i ave to complain hof mr heasy thought proper to say that i was a swindler and a liar did you make use of those expressions mr easy yes sir he did continued the steward and moreover told me not to cheat the men and not to cheat my master the purser now captain vilson is it not true that i am in a wery hostensible sitevation but i flatter myself that i ave been vell edecated and vos wonce moving in a wery different societymisfortains vill appin to us hall and i feel my character has been severely injured by such importations whereupon mr easthupp took out his handkerchief flourished and blew his nose i told mr heasy that i considered myself quite as much of a gentleman as himself and at hall hewents did not keep company with a black feller mr heasy will hunderstand the insinevation vereupon mr heasy as i before said your vorship i mean you captain vilson thought proper to kick me down the atchvay very well steward i have heard your complaint and now you may go mr easthupp took his hat off with an air made his bow and went down the main ladder mr easy said captain wilson you must be aware that by the regulations of the service by which we are all equally bound it is not permitted that any officer shall take the law into his own hands now although i do not consider it necessary to make any remark as to your calling the man a radical blackguard for i consider his impertinent intrusion of his opinions deserved it still you have no right to attack any mans character without groundsand as that man is in an office of trust you were not at all warranted in asserting that he was a cheat will you explain to me why you made use of such language now our hero had no proofs against the man he had nothing to offer in extenuation until he recollected all at once the reason assigned by the captain for the language used by mr sawbridge jack had the wit to perceive that it would hit home so he replied very quietly and respectfully if you please captain wilson that was all zeal zeal mr easy i think it but a bad excuse but pray then why did you kick the man down the hatchwayyou must have known that that was contrary to the rules of the service yes sir replied jack demurely but that was all zeal too then allow me to say replied captain wilson biting his lips that i think that your zeal has in this instance been very much misplaced and i trust you will not show so much again and yet sir replied jack aware that he was giving the captain a hard hit and therefore looked proportionally humble we should do nothing in the service without itand i trust one day as you told me to become a very zealous officer i trust so too mr easy replied the captain there you may go now and let me hear no more of kicking people down the hatchway that sort of zeal is misplaced more than my foot was at all events muttered jack as he walked off captain wilson as soon as our hero disappeared laughed heartily and told mr sawbridge he had ascribed his language to our hero as all zeal he has very cleverly given me it all back again and really sawbridge as it proves how weak was my defence of you you may gain from this lesson sawbridge thought so toobut both agreed that jacks rights of man were in considerable danger the day before the ship sailed the captain and mr asper dined with the governor and as there was little more to do mr sawbridge who had not quitted the ship since she had been in port and had some few purchases to make left her in the afternoon in the charge of mr smallsole the master now as we have observed he was jacks inveterate enemyindeed jack had already made three mr smallsole mr biggs the boatswain and easthupp the pursers steward mr smallsole was glad to be left in command as he hoped to have an opportunity of punishing our hero who certainly laid himself not a little open to it like all those who are seldom in command the master was proportionally tyrannical and abusivehe swore at the men made them do the duty twice and thrice over on the pretence that it was not smartly done and found fault with every officer remaining on board mr biggsby god sir you seem to be all asleep forward i suppose you think that you are to do nothing now the first lieutenant is out of the ship how long will it be sir before you are ready to sway away by de holy poker i tink he sway away finely massy easy observed mesty who was in converse with our hero on the forecastle mr smallsoles violence made mr biggs violent which made the boatswains mate violentand the captain of the forecastle violent also all which is practically exemplified by philosophy in the laws of motion communicated from one body to another and as mr smallsole swore so did the boatswain swear also the boatswains mate the captain of the forecastle and all the menshowing the force of example mr smallsole came forward damnation mr biggs what the devil are you about cant you move here as much as we can sir replied the boatswain lumbered as the forecastle is with idlers and here mr biggs looked at our hero and mesty who were standing against the bulwark what are you doing here sir cried mr smallsole to our hero nothing at all sir replied jack then ill give you something to do sir go up to the masthead and wait there till i call you down come sir ill show you the way continued the master walking aft jack followed till they were on the quarterdeck now sir up to the maintop gallant masthead perch yourself upon the crosstreesup with you what am i to go up there for sir inquired jack for punishment sir replied the master what have i done sir no reply sirup with you if you please sir replied jack i should wish to argue this point a little argue the point roared mr smallsoleby jove ill teach you to argue the pointaway with you sir if you please sir continued jack the captain told me that the articles of war were the rules and regulations by which everyone in the service was to be guided now sir said jack i have read them over till i know them by heart and there is not one word of mastheading in the whole of them here jack took the articles out of his pocket and unfolded them will you go to the masthead sir or will you not said mr smallsole will you show me the masthead in the articles of war sir replied jack here they are i tell you sir to go to the masthead if not ill be dd if i dont hoist you up in a breadbag theres nothing about breadbags in the articles of war sir replied jack but ill tell you what there is sir and jack commenced reading all flagofficers and all persons in or belonging to his majestys ships or vessels of war being guilty of profane oaths execrations drunkenness uncleanness or other scandalous actions in derogation of gods honour and corruption of good manners shall incur such punishment as damnation cried the master who was mad with rage hearing that the whole ships company were laughing no sir not damnation replied jack thats when hes tried above but according to the nature and degree of the offence will you go to the masthead sir or will you not if you please replied jack id rather not then sir consider yourself under an arrestill try you by a courtmartial by god go down below sir with the greatest pleasure sir replied jack thats all right and according to the articles of war which are to guide us all jack folded up his articles of war put them into his pocket and went down into the berth soon after jack had gone down jolliffe who had heard the whole of the altercation followed him my lad said jolliffe im sorry for all this you should have gone to the masthead i should like to argue that point a little replied jack yes so would everybody but if that were permitted the service would be at a standstillthat would not doyou must obey an order first and then complain afterwards if the order is unjust it is not so in the articles of war but it is so in the service the captain told me that the articles of war were the guides of the service and we were all equally bound to obey them well but allowing that i do not think your articles of war will bear you out you observe they say any officer mariner etc guilty of disobedience to any lawful command now are you not guilty under that article that remains to be argued still replied jack a lawful command means an order established by law now where is that lawbesides the captain told me when i kicked that blackguard down the hatchway that there was only the captain who could punish and that officers could not take the law into their own hands why then has the master his doing wrong as superior officer is no reason why you as an inferior should disobey him if that were permittedif every order were to be cavilled at and argued upon as just or unjust there would be an end of all discipline besides recollect that in the service there is custom which is the same as law that admits of a little argument replied jack the service will admit of none my dear boy recollect that even on shore we have two laws that which is written and the lex non scripta which is custom of course we have it in the service for the articles of war cannot provide for everything they provide a courtmartial for everything though replied jack yes with death or dismissal from the serviceneither of which would be very agreeable you have got yourself into a scrape and although the captain is evidently your friend he cannot overlook it fortunately it is with the master which is of less consequence than with the other officers but still you will have to submit for the captain cannot overlook it ill tell you what jolliffe replied jack my eyes now begin to be opened to a great many things the captain tells me when i am astonished at bad language that it is all zeal and then i found out that what is all zeal in a superior to an inferior is insolence when reversed he tells me that the articles of war are made to equally guide us allthe master breaks what is positively mentioned in the second article twenty times over and goes scot free while i am to be punished because i do not comply with what the articles do not mention how was i to know that i ought to go to the masthead for punishment particularly when the captain tells me that he alone is to punish in the ship if i obey an order in opposition to the captains order is not that as bad as disobeying the captain i think that i have made out a very strong case and my arguments are not to be confuted i am afraid that the master will make out a very strong case and that your arguments will never be heard that will be contrary to all the rules of justice but according to all the rules of service i do believe that i am a great fool observed jack after a pause what do you imagine made me come to sea jolliffe because you did not know when you were well off replied the mate drily thats true enough but my reason was because i thought i should find that equality here that i could not find on shore jolliffe stared my dear boy i heard you say that you obtained those opinions from your father i mean no disrespect to him but he must be either mad or foolish if at his age he has not discovered that there is no such thing in existence i begin to think so replied jack but that does not prove that there ought not to be i beg your pardon the very nonexistence proves that it ought not to bewhatever is is right you might as well expect to find perfect happiness or perfection in the individual your father must be a visionary the best thing that i can do is to go home again no my dear easy the best thing that you can do is to stay in the service for it will soon put an end to all such nonsensical ideas and it will make you a clever sensible fellow the service is a rough but a good school where everybody finds his levelnot the level of equality but the level which his natural talent and acquirements will rise or sink him to in proportion as they are plus or minus it is a noble service but has its imperfections as everything in this world must have i have little reason to speak in its favour as far as i am concerned for it has been hard bread to me but there must be exceptions in every rule do not think of quitting the service until you have given it a fair trial i am aware that you are an only son and your father is a man of property and therefore in the common parlance of the world you are independent but believe me no man however rich is independent unless he has a profession and you will find no better than this notwithstanding what that you will be most certainly sent to the masthead tomorrow well argue that point replied jack at all events i will go and turn in tonight chapter xiii in which our hero begins to act and think for himself whatever may have been jacks thoughts at all events they did not spoil his rest he possessed in himself all the materials of a true philosopher but there was a great deal of weeding still required joliffes arguments sensible as they were had very little effect upon him for strange to say it is much more easy to shake a mans opinions when he is wrong than when he is right proving that we are all of a very perverse nature well thought jack if i am to go to the masthead i am thats all but it does not prove that my arguments are not good only that they will not be listened to and then jack shut his eyes and in a few minutes was fast asleep the master had reported to the first lieutenant and the first lieutenant to the captain when he came on board the next morning the conduct of mr easy who was sent for in the cabin to hear if he had anything to offer in extenuation of his offence jack made an oration which lasted more than half an hour in which all the arguments he had brought forward to jolliffe in the preceding chapter were entered fully into mr jolliffe was then examined and also mr smallsole was interrogated after which the captain and the first lieutenant were left alone sawbridge said captain wilson how true it is that any deviation from what is right invariably leads us into a scrape i have done wrong wishing to get this boy out of his fathers hands and fearful that he would not join the ship and imagining him to be by no means the shrewd fellow that he is in reality i represented the service in a much more favourable light than i should have done all that he says i told him i did tell him and it is i who really led the boy into error mr smallsole has behaved tyrannically and unjustly he punished the lad for no crime so that between the master and me i am now on the horns of a dilemma if i punish the boy i feel that i am punishing him more for my own fault and the fault of others than his own if i do not punish him i allow a flagrant and open violation of discipline to pass uncensured which will be injurious to the service he must be punished sir replied sawbridge send for him said the captain jack made his appearance with a very polite bow mr easy as you suppose that the articles of war contained all the rules and regulations of the service i take it for granted that you have erred through ignorance but recollect that although you have erred through ignorance such a violation of discipline if passed unnoticed will have a very injurious effect with the men whose obedience is enforced by the example shown to them by the officers i feel so convinced of your zeal which you showed the other day in the case of easthupp that i am sure you will see the propriety of my proving to the men by punishing you that discipline must be enforced and i shall therefore send for you on the quarterdeck and order you to go to the masthead in presence of the ships company as it was in presence of the ships company that you refused with the greatest pleasure captain wilson replied jack and in future mr easy although i shall ever set my face against it recollect that if any officer punishes you and you imagine that you are unfairly treated you will submit to the punishment and then apply to me for redress certainly sir replied jack now that i am aware of your wishes you will oblige me mr easy by going on the quarterdeck and wait there till i come up jack made his best bow and exit old jolliffe told me that i should have to go said jack to himself and he was right so far but hang me if i hadnt the best of the argument and thats all i care about captain wilson sent for the master and reprimanded him for his oppression as it was evident that there was no ground for punishment and he forbade him ever to masthead another midshipman but to report his conduct to the first lieutenant or himself he then proceeded to the quarterdeck and calling for mr easy gave him what appeared to be a very severe reprimand which jack looked upon very quietly because it was all zeal on the captains part to give it and all zeal on his own to take it our hero was then ordered up to the masthead jack took off his hat and took three or four steps in obedience to the orderand then returned and made his best bowinquired of captain wilson whether he wished him to go to the fore or to the mainmast head to the main mr easy replied the captain biting his lips jack ascended three spokes of the jacobs ladder when he again stopped and took off his hat i beg your pardon captain wilsonyou have not informed me whether it was your wish that i should go to the topmast or the topgallant crosstrees to the topgallant crosstrees mr easy replied the captain jack ascended taking it very easy he stopped at the maintop for breath at the maintopmast head to look about him and at last gained the spot agreed upon where he seated himself and taking out the articles of war commenced them again to ascertain whether he could not have strengthened his arguments he had not however read through the seventh article before the hands were turned upup anchor and mr sawbridge called all hands down from aloft jack took the hint folded up his documents and came down as leisurely as he went up jack was a much better philosopher than his father the harpy was soon under way and made all sail steering for cape de catte where captain wilson hoped to pick up a spanish vessel or two on his way to toulon to receive orders of the admiral a succession of light breezes and calms rendered the passage very tedious but the boats were constantly out chasing the vessels along shore and jack usually asked to be employed on this service indeed although so short a time afloat he was from his age and strength one of the most effective midshipmen and to be trusted provided a whim did not come into his head but hitherto jack had always been under orders and had always acquitted himself very well when the harpy was at tarragona it so happened that there were several cases of dysentery in the ship and mr asper and mr jolliffe were two of those who were suffering this reduced the number of officers and at the same time they had received information from the men of a fishingboat who to obtain their own release had given the intelligence that a small convoy was coming down from rosas as soon as the wind was fair under the protection of two gunboats captain wilson kept well offshore until the wind changed and then allowing for the time that the vessels would take to run down the distance between tarragona and rosas steered in the night to intercept them but it again fell calm and the boats were therefore hoisted out with directions to proceed along the shore as it was supposed that the vessels could not now be far distant mr sawbridge had the command of the expedition in the pinnace the first cutter was in charge of the gunner mr linus and as the other officers were sick mr sawbridge who liked jack more and more every day at his particular request gave him the command of the second cutter as soon as he heard of it mesty declared to our hero that he would go with him but without permission that was not possible jack obtained leave for mesty to go in lieu of a marine there were many men sick of the dysentery and mr sawbridge was not sorry to take an idler out of the ship instead of a working man especially as mesty was known to be a good hand it was ten oclock at night when the boats quitted the ship and as it was possible that they might not return till late the next day one days biscuit and rum were put on board each that the crews might not suffer from exhaustion the boats pulled inshore and then coasted for three hours without seeing anything the night was fine overhead but there was no moon it still continued calm and the men began to feel fatigued when just as they were within a mile of a low point they perceived the convoy over the land coming down with their sails squared before a light breeze mr sawbridge immediately ordered the boats to lie upon their oars awaiting their coming and arranging for the attack the white lateen sails of the gunboat in advance were now plainly distinguishable from the rest which were all huddled together in her wake down she came like a beautiful swan in the water her sails just filled with the wind and running about three knots an hour mr sawbridge kept her three masts in one that they might not be perceived and winded the boats with their heads the same way so that they might dash on board of her with a few strokes of the oars so favourable was the course of the gunboat that she stood right between the launch on one bow and the two cutters on the other and they were not perceived until they were actually alongside the resistance was trifling but some muskets and pistols had been fired and the alarm was given mr sawbridge took possession with the crew of the launch and brought the vessel to the wind as he perceived that at the alarm all the convoy had done the same directing the cutters to board the largest vessels and secure as many as they could while he would do the same with the launch as he brought them to but the other gunboat which had not yet been seen and had been forgotten now made her appearance and came down in a gallant manner to the support of her comrade mr sawbridge threw half his men into the launch as she carried a heavy carronade and sent her to assist the cutters which had made right for the gunboat a smart firing of round and grape was opened upon the boats which continued to advance upon her but the officer commanding that gunboat finding that he had no support from his consort and concluding that she had been captured hauled his wind again and stood out in the offing our hero pulled after her although he could not see the other boats but the breeze had freshened and all pursuit was useless he therefore directed his course to the convoy and after a hard pull contrived to get on board of a onemasted xebeque of about fifty tons mesty who had eyes as sharp as a needle had observed that when the alarm was given several of the convoy had not rounded the point and he therefore proposed as this vessel was very light that they should make short tacks with her to weather the point as if they were escaping and by that means be able particularly if it fell calm again to capture some others jack thought this advice good the convoy who had rounded the point had all stood out to seaward with the gunboat and had now a fresh breeze to chase them was therefore useless and the only chance was to do as mesty had proposed he therefore stood out into the breeze and after half an hour tacked inshore and fetched well to windward of the low point but finding no vessels he stood out again thus had he made three or four tacks and had gained perhaps six or seven miles when he perceived signals of recall made to leeward enforced with guns mr sawbridge wants us to come back mesty mr sawbridge mind him own business replied mesty we nebber take all dis trubble to ply to windward for noting but mesty we must obey orders yes sar when he have him thumb upon you but now must do what tink most proper by de powers he catch me fore i go back but we shall lose the ship find her again byandbye massa easy but they will think that we are lost so much the better nebba look after us massa easy i guess we have a fine cruise anyhow morrow we take large vesselmake sail take more den we go to toulon but i dont know my way to toulon i know it lies up this way and thats all dat enough what you want more massa easy pose you not find fleet fleet soon find you by god nobody nebba lost here now massa easy let um go bout gain somebody else burn biscuit and boil kettle tomorrow for de gentlemen murder irish only tink massa easyi boil kettle and prince in my own country easy was very much of a mind with mesty for argued jack if i go back now i only bring a small vessel halffull of beans and i shall be ashamed to show my face now it is true that they may suppose that we have been sunk by the fire of the gunboat well what then they have a gunboat to show for their nights work and it will appear that there was harder fighting than there has been and mr sawbridge may benefit by it jack was a very knowing fellow to have leant so much about the service already well and when they discover that we are not lost how glad they will be to find us especially if we bring some prizeswhich i will do or ill not go back again its not often that one gets a command before being two months at sea and hang me now ive got it if i wont keep it and mr smallsole may masthead whom he pleases im sorry for poor gossett though if vigors supposes me dead how he will murder the poor little fellowhowever it is all for the good of the service and ill revenge him when i come back hang me if i wont take a cruise i talk to the men they say they all tick to you like leech now dat job settled i tink we better go bout again a short time after this decision on the part of our hero the day broke jack first looked to leeward and perceived the gunboat and convoy standing in for the shore about ten miles distant followed by the harpy under all sail he could also perceive the captured gunboat lyingto inshore to prevent their escape harpy hab um all by gosh cried mesty i ab notion dat she soon settle um hash they were so busy looking at the harpy and the convoy that for some time they quite forgot to look to windward at last mesty turned his eyes that way dam um i see right last night look massa easyone ship one brig tree lateendem for us by de power but we make bot prize tonight the vessels found out by mesty were not above three miles to windward they were under all sail beating up for the protection of a battery not far distant now massa suppose they see our boat dey tink something keep boat alongside and shift her when we go bout every time better not sail so fast nowkeep further off till they drop anchor for de night and den when it dark we take em all mestys advice was good with the exception perhaps of advising our hero how to disobey orders and take a cruise to prevent the vessel from approaching too near the others and at the same time to let her have the appearance of doing her best a sail was towed overboard under the bows and after that they watched the motions of the harpy the distance was too great to distinguish very clearly but mesty shinned up the mast of the vessel and reported progress by jesus dare one guntwo gungo it harpy wont she ab um sure enough now gunboat firedat our gunboatno dat not ours now our gunboat firedat prettyfire away ah now de harpy cum up allmungem bung bung bungrattle de grape by gosh i ab notion de spaniard is very pretty considerable trouble just now anyhow all hoveto so help me goshnot more firing harpy take um alldare gunboat hoveto she strike um colours by all powers but suppose dey link we no share prizemoneythey find it not little mistake now my lads it all over and continued mesty sliding down the mast i tink you better not show yourself too much only two men stay on deck and dem two take off um jackets mestys report was correct the harpy had captured the other gunboat and the whole convoy the only drawback to their good fortune was the disappearance of mr easy and the cutter it was supposed that a shot from the gunboat must have sunk her and that the whole crew were drowned captain wilson and mr sawbridge seriously regretted the loss of our hero as they thought that he would have turned out a shining character as soon as he had sown his wild oats so did mr asper because our heros purse went with him so did jolliffe because he had taken an affection for him so did little gossett because he anticipated no mercy from vigors on the other hand there were some who were glad that he was gone and as for the ships company in general they lamented the loss of the poor cutters crew for twentyfour hours which in a manofwar is a very long while and then they thought no more about them we must leave the harpy to make the best of her way to toulon and now follow our hero the cutters crew knew very well that jack was acting contrary to orders but anything was to them a change from the monotony of a manofwar and they as well as mesty highly approved of a holiday it was however necessary that they should soon proceed to business for they had but their allowance of bread and grog for one day and in the vessel they found nothing except a few heads of garlic for the spaniards coasting down shore had purchased their provisions as they required them there were only three prisoners on board and they had been put down in the hold among the beans a bag of which had been roused on deck and a part put into the kettle to make soup jack did not much admire the fare of the first dayit was beansoup for breakfast beansoup for dinner and if you felt hungry during the intervals it was still beansoup and nothing else one of the men could speak a little lingua franca and the prisoners were interrogated as to the vessels to windward the ship was stated to be valuable and also one of the brigs the ship carried guns and that was all that they knew about them as the sun went down the vessels dropped their anchors off the battery the breeze continued light and the vessel which contained jack and his fortunes was about four miles to leeward as for the harpy they had long lost sight of her and it was now time to proceed to some arrangement as soon as it was dark jack turned his hands up and made a very long speech he pointed out to the men that his zeal had induced him not to return to the ship until he had brought something with him worth havingthat they had had nothing but beans to eat during the whole day which was anything but agreeable and that therefore it was absolutely necessary that they should better their condition that there was a large ship not four miles off and that he intended to take her and as soon as he had taken her he intended to take some more that he trusted to their zeal to support him on this occasion and that he expected to do a great deal during the cruise he pointed out to them that they must consider themselves as on board of a manofwar and be guided by the articles of war which were written for them alland that in case they forgot them he had a copy in his pocket which he would read to them tomorrow morning as soon as they were comfortably settled on board of the ship he then appointed mesty as first lieutenant the marine as sergeant the coxswain as boatswain two men as midshipmen to keep watch two others as boatswains mates leaving two more for the ships company who were divided into the larboard and starboard watch the cutters crew were perfectly content with jacks speech and their brevet rank and after that they commenced a more important topic which was how they were to take the ship after some discussion mestys advice was approved of which was that they should anchor not far ahead of the ship and wait till about two oclock in the morning when they would drop silently down upon her in the cutter and take possession about nine oclock the vessel was anchored as they proposed and jack was a little astonished to find that the ship was much larger than he had any idea of for although polaccarigged she was nearly the same tonnage as the harpy the spanish prisoners were first tied hand and foot and laid upon the beans that they might give no alarm the sails were furled and all was kept quiet on board of the ship on the contrary there was noise and revelry and about halfpast ten a boat was seen to leave her and pull for the shore after which the noise gradually ceased the lights one by one disappeared and then all was silent what do you think mesty said jack do you think we shall take her it is take her you mane sure enough well take her stop a bitwait till um all fast asleep about twelve oclock there came on a mizzling heavy rain which was very favourable for our heros operations but as it promised soon to clear up by mestys advice they did not delay any longer they crept softly into the boat and with two oars to steer her dropped under the bows of the vessel climbed up the fore chains and found the deck empty take care not fire pistol said mesty to the men as they came up putting his finger to their lips to impress them with the necessity of silence for mesty had been an african warrior and knew the advantage of surprise all the men being on deck and the boat made fast jack and mesty led the way aft not a soul was to be seen indeed it was too dark to see anybody unless they were walking the deck the companionhatch was secured and the gratings laid on the afterhatchways and then they went aft to the binnacle again where there was a light burning mesty ordered two of the men to go forward to secure the hatches and then to remain there on guardand then the rest of the men and our hero consulted at the wheel by the power we ab the ship said mesty but must manage plenty yet i tink der some dn lazy rascal sleep tween the guns a lilly while it no rain and den we see better now keep all quiet there must be a great many men in this ship replied our hero she is very large and has twelve or fourteen gunshow shall we manage to secure them all right replied mesty manage all dat byandbye dont care how soon daylight come it has left off raining already observed easy there is a candle in the binnaclesuppose we light it and look round the decks yes replied mesty one man sentry over cabinhatch and another over afterhatch now den we light candle and all the rest go round the deck mind you leave all your pistols on capstern jack lighted the candle and they proceeded round the decks they had not walked far when between two of the guns they discovered a heap covered with gregos there de watch whispered mesty all fastnot ready for dem yet mesty blew out the candle and they all retreated to the binnacle where mesty took out a coil of the ropes about the mizzenmast and cutting it into lengths gave them to the other men to unlay in a few minutes they had prepared a great many seizings to tie the men with now den we light candle again and make sure of them lazy hounds said mesty very much oblige to dem all de same they let us take de shipmind now wake one at a time and shut him mouth but suppose they get their mouths free and cry out replied jack den mr easy replied mesty changing his countenance to an expression almost demoniacalthere no help for itand mesty showed his knife which he held in his right hand oh no do not let us murder them no massasuppose can help it but suppose they get upper handwhat become of us spaniards hab knives and use dem too by de power the observation of mesty was correct and the expression of his countenance when he showed his knife proved what a relentless enemy he could be if his blood was once rousedbut mesty had figured in the ashantee wars in former days and after that the reader need not be surprised they proceeded cautiously to where the spaniards lay the arrangements of mesty were very good there were two men to gag them while the others were to tie their limbs mesty and easy were to kneel by them with the candle with raised knives to awe them into silence or to strike home if their own safety required it the gregos were removed off the first man who opened his eyes at the sight of the candle but the coxswains hand was on his mouthhe was secured in silence the other two men were awaked and threw off their coverings but they were also secured without there being occasion to resort to bloodshed what shall we do now mesty now sar said mesty open the afterhatch and watchsuppose more men come up we make them fast suppose no more come up we wait till daylightand see what take place mesty then went forward to see if the men were watchful on the forecastle and having again gone round the whole of the deck to see if there were any more men on it he blew out the candle and took his station with the others at the afterhatchway it was just at break of day that the spaniards who had to keep the morning watch having woke up as people generally do at that hour at which they expect to be called dressed themselves and came on deck imagining and very truly that those of the middle watch had fallen asleep but little imagining that the deck was in possession of englishmen mesty and the others retreated to allow them all to come up before they could perceive them and fortunately this was accomplished four men came on the deck looked round them and tried to make out in the dark where their shipmates might be the grating was slapped on again by jack and before they could well gain their eyesight they were seized and secured not however without a scuffle and some noise by the time that these men were secured and laid between the guns it was daylight and they now perceived what a fine vessel they had fairly taken possession ofbut there was much to be done yet there was of course a number of men in the ship and moreover they were not a mile from a battery of ten guns mesty who was foremost in everything left four men abaft and went forward on the forecastle examined the cable which was coir rope and therefore easily divided and then directed the two men forward to coil a hawser upon the foregrating the weight of which would make all safe in that quarter and afterwards to join them on the quarterdeck now mr easy the great ting will be to get hold of captain we must get him on deck open cabinhatch now and keep the afterhatch fast two men stay there the others all come aft yes replied jack it will be a great point to secure the captain but how are we to get him up you no know how to get captain up by de holy i know very well and mesty took up the coils of rope about the mizzenmast and threw them upon deck one after another making all the noise possible in a short time there was a violent pull of a bell at the cabindoor and in a minute afterwards a man in his shirt came up the cabinhatchway who was immediately secured dis de captains servant said mesty he come say no make such dd noise stop a littlecaptain get in passion and come up himself and mesty renewed the noise with the ropes over the cabin mesty was right in a few minutes the captain himself came up boiling with indignation at the sound of the cabindoor opening the seamen and our hero concealed themselves behind the companionhatch which was very high so as to give the captain time to get fairly on deck the men already secured had been covered over with the gregos the captain was a most powerful man and it was with difficulty that he was pinioned and then not without his giving the alarm had there been anyone to assist him but as yet no one had turned out of his hammock now we all right said mesty and soon ab de ship but i must make him fraid the captain was seated down on the deck against one of the guns and mesty putting on the look of a demon extended above him his long nervous arm with the sharp knife clutched as if ready every instant to strike it into his heart the spanish captain felt his situation anything but pleasant he was then interrogated as to the number of men in the ship officers etc to all which questions he answered truly he cast his eyes at the firm and relentless countenance of mesty who appeared but to wait the signal i tink all pretty safe now said mesty mr easy we now go down below and beat all men into the hold our hero approved of this suggestion taking their pistols from the capstern they rushed down with their cutlasses and leaving two men to guard the cabindoor they were soon among the crew who were all naked in their hammocks the resistance although the numbers were more than double of the english was of course trifling in a few minutes the spaniards were all thrown down into the hold of the vessel and the hatches placed over them every part of the ship was now in their possession except the cabin and to that they all repaired our hero tried the door and found it fast they beat it open and were received with loud screams from one side of the cabin and the discharge of two pistols from the other fortunately without injury those who had fired the pistols were an elderly man and a lad about the age of our hero they were thrown down and secured the cabin was searched and nobody else found in it but three women one old and shrivelled the other two although with their countenances distorted with terror were lovely as houris so thought jack as he took off his hat and made them a very low bow with his usual politeness as they crouched halfdressed in a corner he told them in english that they had nothing to fear and begged that they would attend to their toilets the ladies made no reply because in the first place they did not know what jack said and in the next they could not speak english mesty interrupted jack in his attentions by pointing out that they must all go upon deckso jack again took off his hat and bowed and then followed his men who led away the two prisoners taken in the cabin it was now five oclock in the morning and there was movement on board of the other vessels which laid not far from the ship now then said jack what shall we do with the prisonerscould we not send the boat and bring our own vessel alongside and put them all in tied as they are we should then get rid of them massa easy you be one very fine officer one of these days dat dn good idea anyhowbut suppose we send our own boat what they tink on board of de oder vessel lower down lilly boat from stem put in four men and drop vessel longsidedat it this was done the cutter was on the seaward side of the ship and as the ship was the outermost vessel was concealed from the view of the spaniards on board of the other vessels and in the battery on shore as soon as the lateen vessel was alongside the men who had already been secured on deck amounting to seven were lowered into her and laid upon the beans in the hold all except the captain the two cabinprisoners and the captains servant they then went down below took off one part of the hatches and ordered the spaniards up from the hold as they came on deck they were made fast and treated in the same manner mesty and the men went down to examine if there were any left concealed and finding that they were all out returned on deck the men who had been beaten down in the hold were twentytwo in number making the whole complement of thirty as soon as they had all been put into the xebeque she was again hauled off and anchored outside and jack found himself in possession of a fine ship of fourteen guns with three prisoners male and three prisoners female when the men returned in the boat from the vessel in which the prisoners had been confined the hatches having been secured over them by way of further precaution by the advice of mesty they put on the jackets and caps of the spanish seamen of which there was a plentiful supply below now whats to be done mesty inquired jack now sar we send some of the men aloft to get sails all ready and while they do that i cast loose this fellow pointing to the captains servant and make him get some breakfast for he know where to find it capital idea of yours mesty for im tired of beansoup already and i will go down and pay my respects to the ladies mesty looked over the counter yes and be quick too massa easy dn the women they toss their handkerchief in the air to people in the batteryquick massa easy mesty was rightthe spanish girls were waving their handkerchiefs for assistance it was all that they could do poor things jack hastened into the cabin laid hold of the two young ladies very politely pulled them out of the quarter gallery and begged that they would not give themselves so much trouble the young ladies looked very much confused and as they could no longer wave their handkerchiefs they put them up to their eyes and began to weep while the elderly lady went on her knees and held her hands up for mercy jack raised her up and very politely handed her to one of the cabin lockers in the meantime mesty with his gleaming knife and expressive look had done wonders with the captains steward for such the man was and a breakfast of chocolate salt meat hams and sausages white biscuit and red wine had been spread on the quarterdeck the men had come from aloft and jack was summoned on deck jack offered his hand to the two young ladies and beckoned the old one to follow the old lady did not think it advisable to refuse his courtesy so they accompanied him as soon as the females came on deck and found the two cabin prisoners bound they ran to them and embraced them with tears jacks heart melted and as there was now no fear he asked mesty for his knife and cut loose the two spaniards pointing to the breakfast and requesting that they would join them the spaniards made a bow and the ladies thanked jack with a sweet smile and the captain of the vessel who still lay pinioned against the gun looked as much as to say why the devil dont you ask me but the fact was they had had such trouble to secure him that jack did not much like the idea of letting him loose again jack and the seamen commenced their breakfast and as the ladies and prisoners did not appear inclined to eat they ate their share and their own too during which the elderly man inquired of jack if he could speak french jack with his mouth full of sausage replied that he could and then commenced a conversation from which jack learnt as follows the elderly gentleman was a passenger with the young man who was his son and the ladies who were his wife and his two daughters and they were proceeding to tarragona whereupon jack made a bow and thanked him and then the gentleman whose name was don cordova de rimarosa wished to know what jack intended to do with them hoping as a gentleman he would put them on shore with their effects as they were noncombatants jack explained all this to mesty and the men and then finished his sausage the men who were a little elevated with the wine which they had been drinking proposed that they should take the ladies a cruise and jack at first did not dislike the idea but he said nothing mesty however opposed this saying that ladies only made a row in a ship and the coxswain sided with him saying that they should all be at daggers drawn whereupon jack pulled out the articles of war and informed the men that there was no provision in them for women and therefore the thing was impossible the next question was as to the propriety of allowing them to take their effects and it was agreed at last that they might take them jack desired the steward to feed his master the captain and then told the spanish don the result of the consultation further informing him that as soon as it was dark he intended to put them all on board the small vessel when they would cast loose the men and do as they pleased the don and the ladies returned thanks and went down to pack up their baggage mesty ordering two men to help them but with a caution that they were not to encumber themselves with any of the money if there should happen to be any on board the crew were busy during the day making preparations for sailing the coxswain had examined the provender in the ship and found that there was enough for at least three months of water wine and provisions independent of luxuries for the cabin all thoughts of taking any more of the vessels were abandoned for their crew was but weak to manage the one which they had possession of a fine breeze sprang up and they dropped their foretopsails just as a boat was shoving off from the shore but seeing the foretopsails loosed it put back again this was fortunate or all would have been discovered the other vessels also loosed their sails and the crews were heard weighing the anchors but the nostra senora del carmen which was jacks prize did not move at last the sun went down the baggage was placed in the cutter the ladies and passengers went into the boat thanking jack for his kindness who put his hand to his heart and bowed to the deck and the captain was lowered down after them four men well armed pulled them alongside of the xebeque put them and their trunks on deck and returned to the ship the cutter was then hoisted up and as the anchor was too heavy to weigh they cut the cable and made sail the other vessels followed their example mesty and the seamen cast longing eyes upon them but it was of no use so they sailed in company for about an hour and then jack hauled his wind for a cruise chapter xiv in which our hero finds that disagreeable occurrences will take place on a cruise as soon as the ship had been hauled to the wind jacks ships company seemed to think that there was nothing to do except to make merry so they brought up some earthen jars full of wine and emptied them so fast that they were soon fast asleep on the deck with the exception of the man at the helm who instead of thirtytwo could clearly make out sixtyfour points in the compass and of course was able to steer to a much greater nicety fortunately the weather was fine for when the man at the helm had steered till he could see no more and requested to be released he found that his shipmates were so overpowered with fatigue that it was impossible to wake them he kicked them one by one most unmercifully in the ribs but it was of no use under these circumstances he did as they did that is lay down with them and in ten minutes it would have taken as much kicking to awake him as he gave his shipmates in the meantime the ship had it all her own way and not knowing where she was to go she went round and round the compass during the best part of the night mesty had arranged the watches jack had made a speech and the men had promised everything but the wine had got into their heads and memory had taken that opportunity to take a stroll mesty had been down with jack examining the cabin and in the captains stateroom they had found fourteen thousand dollars in bags of this they determined not to tell the men but locked up the money and everything else of value and took out the key they then sat down at the cabin table and after some conversation it was no matter of surprise after having been up all the night before that jack laid his head on the table and fell fast asleep mesty kept his eyes open for some time but at last his head sank down upon his chest and he also slumbered thus about one oclock in the morning there was not a very good watch kept on board of the nostra senora del carmen about four oclock in the morning mesty tumbled forward and he hit his head against the table which roused him up by de mass i tink i almost fall asleep cried he and he went to the cabin window which had been left open and found that there was a strong breeze blowing in by de lord de wind ab come more aft said mesty why they not tell me so saying he went on deck where he found no one at the helm everyone drunk and the ship with her yards braced up running before the wind just by way of a change mesty growled but there was no time to lose the topsails only were setthese he lowered down and then put the helm alee and lashed it while he went down to call our hero to his assistance jack roused up and went on deck this nebber do massa easy we all go to devil togethertogether dam drunken dogsi freshen um up anyhow so mesty drew some buckets of water with which he soused the ships company who then appeared to be recovering their senses by heavens says jack but this is contrary to the articles of war i shall read them to them tomorrow morning i tell what better ting massa easy we go lock up all de wine and sarve out so much and no more i go do it at once fore they wake up mesty went down leaving jack on deck to his meditations i am not sure thought jack that i have done a very wise thing here i am with a parcel of fellows who have no respect for the articles of war and who get as drunk as davids sow i have a large ship but i have very few hands and if it comes on bad weather what shall i dofor i know very littlehardly how to take in a sail thenas for where to steer or how to steer i know notnor do any of my men but however as it was very narrow when we came into the mediterranean through the straits it is hardly possible to get out of them without perceiving it besides i should know the rock of gibraltar again if i saw it i must talk to mesty mesty soon returned with the keys of the provisionroom tied to his bandana now says he they not get drunk again in a hurry a few more buckets of water soon brought the men to their senses they again stood on their legs and gradually recovered themselves daylight broke and they found that the vessel had made an attempt for the spanish coast being within a mile of the beach and facing a large battery a fleur deau fortunately they had time to square the yards and steer the ship along shore under the topsails before they were perceived had they been seen at daylight in the position that they were in during the night the suspicions of the spaniards would have been awakened and had a boat been sent off while they were all drunk they must have been recaptured the men who perceived what danger they had been in listened very penitently to jacks remonstrances and our hero to impress them more strongly on their minds took out the articles of war read that on drunkenness from beginning to end but the men had heard it read so often at the gangway that it did not make a due impression as mesty said his plan was better and so it proved for as soon as jack had done the men went down to get another jug of wine and found to their disappointment that it was all under lock and key in the meantime jack called mesty aft and asked him if he knew the way to toulon mesty declared that he knew nothing about it then mesty it appears to me that we have a better chance of finding our way back to gibraltar for you know the land was on our left side all the way coming up the mediterranean and if we keep it as it is now on our right we shall get back again along the coast mesty agreed with jack that this was the ne plus ultra of navigation and that old smallsole could not do better with his pigyoke and compasses so they shook a reef out of the topsails set topgallant sails and ran directly down the coast from point to point keeping about five miles distant the men prepared a good dinner mesty gave them their allowance of wine which was just double what they had on board the harpyso they soon appeared to be content one man indeed talked very big and very mutinously swearing that if the others would join him they would soon have liquor enough but mesty gave him his look opened his knife and swore that he would settle him and jack knocked him down with a handspike so that what with the punishment received and that which was promised the fellow thought he might as well say no more about it the fact is that had it not been from fear of mesty the whole of the men would in all probability have behaved equally as bad nevertheless they were a little staggered it must be owned at seeing jack play so good a stick with the handspike after this night jack and mesty kept watch and watch and everything went on very well until they were nearly abreast of carthagena when a gale came on from the northward and drove them out of sight of land sail after sail was reduced with difficulty from their having so few hands and the gale blew for three days with great fury the men were tired out and discontented it was jacks misfortune that he had but one good man with him even the coxswain of the boat although a finelooking man was worth nothing mesty was jacks sheetanchor the fourth day the gale moderated but they had no idea where they were they knew that they had been blown off but how far they could not tell and jack now began to discover that a cruise at sea without knowledge of navigation was a more nervous thing than he had contemplated however there was no help for it at night they wore the ships and stood on the other tack and at daylight they perceived that they were close to some small islands and much closer to some large rocks against which the sea beat high although the wind had subsided again was the helm put up and they narrowly escaped as soon as the sails were trimmed the men came aft and proposed that if they could find anchorage they should run into it for they were quite tired out this was true and jack consulted with mesty who thought it advisable to agree to the proposal that the islands were not inhabited was very evident the only point to ascertain was if there were good anchorage the coxswain offered to go in the boat and examine and with four men he set off and in about an hour returned stating that there was plenty of water and that it was as smooth as a millpond being landlocked on every side as they could not weigh the boweranchor they bent the kedge and running in without accident came to in a small bay between the islands in seven fathoms water the sails were furled and everything put in order by the seamen who then took the boat and pulled on shore they might as well have asked leave thought jack in an hour they returned and after a short discussion came aft to our hero in a body the coxswain was spokesman he said that they had had hard work and required now to have some restthat there were provisions on board for three months so that there could not be any hurry and that they had found they could pitch a tent very well on shore and live there for a short time and that as there was no harm in getting drunk on shore they expected that they might be allowed to take provisions and plenty of wine with them and that the men had desired him to ask leave because they were determined to go whether or no jack was about to answer with the handspike but perceiving that the men had all put on their cutlasses and had their pistols at their belts he thought proper to consult mesty who perceiving that resistance was useless advised jack to submit observing that the sooner all the wine was gone the better as there would be nothing done while it lasted jack therefore very graciously told them that they should have their own way and he would stay there as long as they pleased mesty gave them the keys of the provisionhatch and told them with a grin to help themselves the men then informed jack that he and mesty should stay on board and take care of the ship for them and that they would take the spaniard on shore to cook their victuals but to this jack observed that if he had not two hands he could not obey their orders in case they wished him to come on shore for them the men thought there was good argument in that observation and therefore allowed jack to retain the spaniard that he might be more prompt to their call from the beach they then wished him good day and begged that he would amuse himself with the articles of war as soon as they had thrown a spare sail into the boat with some spars to make a tent and some bedding they went down below hoisted up two pipes of wine out of the three a bag or two of biscuit arms and ammunition and as much of the salt provisions as they thought they might require the boat being full they shoved off with three cheers of derision jack was sensible to the compliment he stood at the gangway took off his hat and made them a polite bow as soon as they were gone mesty grinned with his sharpfiled teeth and looking at our hero said i tink i make um pay for all disstop a little by de piper as played before moses but our turn come byandbye as for jack he said nothing but he thought the more in about an hour the men returned in the boat they had forgotten many things they wantedwood to make a fire and several utensils they helped themselves freely and having now everything that they could think of they again went on shore how dn lucky we nebber tell dem about the dollars said mesty as jack and he were watching the motions of the men it is indeed replied jack not that they could spend them here no massa easy but suppose they find all that money they take boat and go away with it now i hab them in my clutchstop a little a narrow piece of salt pork had been left at the gangway jack without knowing why tossed it overboard being almost all fat it sank very gradually jack watched it as it disappeared so did mesty both full of thought when they perceived a dark object rising under it it was a ground shark who took it into his maw sank down and disappeared what was that said jack that ground shark massa easyworst shark of all you nebber see him till you feel him and mestys eyes sparkled with pleasure by de powers they soon stop de mutiny now i hab em jack shuddered and walked away during the day the men on shore were seen to work hard and make all the preparations before they abandoned themselves to the sensual gratification of intemperance the tent was pitched the fire was lighted and all the articles taken on shore rolled up and stowed away in their places they were seen to sit down and dine for they were within hail of the ship and then one of the casks of wine was spiled in the meantime the spaniard who was a quiet lad had prepared the dinner for easy and his now only companion the evening closed and all was noise and revelry on shore and as they danced and sung and tossed off the cans of wine by the light of the fire as they hallooed and screamed and became more and more intoxicated mesty turned to jack with his bitter smile and only said stop a little at last the noise grew fainter the fire died away and gradually all was silent jack was still hanging over the gangway when mesty came up to him the new moon had just risen and jacks eyes were fixed upon it now massa easy please you come aft and lower down little boat take your pistols and then we go on shore and bring off the cutter they all asleep now but why should we leave them without a boat mesty for jack thought of the sharks and the probability of the men attempting to swim off i tell you sar this night they get drunk tomorrow they get drunk again but drunken men never keep quietsuppose one man say to others lets go board and kill officer and then we do as we please they all say yes and they all come and do it no sarmust have boatif not for your sake i must hab it save my own life anyhow for they hate me and kill me first by de powers stop a little jack felt the truth of mestys observation he went aft with him lowered down the small boat and they hauled it alongside jack went down with mesty into the cabin and fetched his pistols and the spaniard mesty can we leave him on board alone yes sar he no got arms and he see dat me havebut suppose he find arms he never dare do anythingi know de man our hero and mesty went into the boat and shoved off pulling gently on shore the men were in a state of intoxication so as not to be able to move much less hear they cast off the cutter towed her on board and made her fast with the other boat astern now sar we may go to bed tomorrow morning you will see they have everything they require on shore replied easy all they could want with the cutter would be to molest us stop a little replied mesty jack and mesty went to bed and as a precaution against the spaniard which was hardly necessary mesty locked the cabin door but mesty never forgot anything jack slept little that nighthad melancholy forebodings which he could not shake off indeed jack had reflected so much since he had left the ship he had had his eyes so much opened and had felt what a responsibility he had taken by indulging himself in a whim of the moment that it might be almost said that in the course of one fortnight he had at once from a boy sprung up into a man he was mortified and angry but he was chiefly so with himself mesty was up at daylight and jack soon followed him they watched the party on shore who had not yet left the tent at last just as jack had finished his breakfast one or two made their appearance the men looked about them as if they were searching for something and then walked down to the beach to where the boat had been made fast jack looked at mesty who grinned and answered with the words so often repeated stop a little the men then walked along the rocks until they were abreast of the ship ship ahoy halloo replied mesty bring the boat ashore directly with a beaker of water i knew dat cried mesty rubbing his hands with delight massa easy you must tell them no but why should i not give them water mesty because sar den they take boat very true replied easy do you hear on board cried the coxswain who was the man who hailedsend the boat immediately or well cut the throats of every mothers son of you by god i shall not send the boat replied jack who now thought mesty was right you wontwont youthen your dooms sealed replied the man walking up to the tent with the other in a short time all the seamen turned out of the tent bringing with them four muskets which they had taken on shore with them good heavens they are not surely going to fire at us mesty stop a little the men then came down abreast of the ship and the coxswain again hailed and asked if they would bring the boat on shore you must say no sar replied mesty i feel i must replied jack and then he answered the coxswain no the plan of the mutineers had been foreseen by the wily negroit was to swim off to the boats which were riding astern and to fire at him or jack if they attempted to haul them up alongside and defend them to get into the boats especially the smaller one from out of the water was easy enough some of the men examined their priming and held the muskets at their hips all ready with the muzzles towards the ship while the coxswain and two men were throwing off their clothes stop for gods sake stop cried jack the harbour is full of ground sharksit is upon my soul do you think to frighten us with ground sharks replied the coxswain keep under cover my lads jack give him a shot to prove we are in earnest and every time he or that nigger show their heads give them another my lads for gods sake dont attempt to swim said jack in an agony i will try some means to give you water too late nowyoure doomed and the coxswain sprang off the rock into the sea and was followed by two other men at the same moment a musket was discharged and the bullet whistled close to our heros ear mesty dragged jack from the gangway who was nearly fainting from agonising feelings he sank on the deck for a moment and then sprang up and ran to the port to look at the men in the water he was just in time to see the coxswain raise himself with a loud yell out of the sea and then disappear in a vortex which was crimsoned with his blood mesty threw down his musket in his hand of which he had several already loaded in case the men should have gained the boats by the powers dat no use now jack had covered his face with his hands but the tragedy was not complete the other men who were in the water had immediately turned and made for the shore but before they could reach it two more of these voracious monsters attracted by the blood of the coxswain had flown to the spot and there was a contention for the fragments of their bodies mesty who had seen this catastrophe turned towards our hero who still hid his face im glad he no see dat anyhow muttered mesty see what exclaimed jack shark eat em all oh horrid horrid groaned our hero yes sar very horrid replied mesty and dat bullet at your head very horrid suppose the sharks no take them what then they kill us and the sharks have our body i think that more horrid still mesty replied jack seizing the negro convulsively by the arm it was not the sharksit was ii who have murdered these men mesty looked at jack with surprise how dat possible if i had not disobeyed orders replied our hero panting for breath if i had not shown them the example of disobedience this would not have happened how could i expect submission from them its all my faulti see it nowand o god when will the sight be blotted from my memory massa easy i not understand that replied mesty i think you talk foolishmight as well say suppose ashantee men not make war this not happen for suppose ashantee not make war i not slave i not run awayi not come board harpyi not go in boat with youi not hinder men from getting drunkand dat why they make mutinyand the mutiny why the shark take um jack made no reply but he felt some consolation from the counter argument of the negro the dreadful death of the three mutineers appeared to have had a sensible effect upon their companions who walked away from the beach with their heads down and with measured steps they were now seen to be perambulating the island probably in search of that water which they required at noon they returned to their tent and soon afterwards were in a state of intoxication hallooing and shouting as the day before towards the evening they came down to the beach abreast of the ship each with a vessel in their hands and perceiving that they had attracted the notice of our hero and mesty tossed the contents of the vessels up in the air to show that they had found water and hooting and deriding went back dancing leaping and kicking up their heels to renew their orgies which continued till after midnight when they were all stupefied as before the next day jack had recovered from the first shock which the catastrophe had given him and he called mesty into the cabin to hold a consultation mesty how is this to end how you mean sarend here or end on board of the harpy the harpythere appears little chance of our seeing her againwe are on a desolate island or what is the same thing but we will hope that it will be so but how is this mutiny to end massa easy suppose i please i make it end very soon but i not in a hurry how do you mean mesty not in a hurry look massa easy you wish take a cruise and i wish the same ting now because mutiny you want to go backbut by all de powers you tink that i a prince in my own country feel wish to go back and boil kettle for de young gentlemen no massa easy gib me mutiny gib me anytingbutonce i was prince replied mesty lowering his voice at the last few emphatic words you must one of these days tell me your history replied jack but just now let us argue the point in question how could you put an end to this mutiny by putting an end to all wine suppose i go shore after they all drunk i spile the casks in three or four places and in the morning all wine goneden dey ab get sober and beg pardonwe take dem on board put away all arms cept yours and mine and i like to see the mutiny after dat blood and oundsbut i settle um anyhow the idea is very good mestywhy should we not do so because i not like run de risk to go ashoreall for what to go back boil de kettle for all gentlemansi very happy here massa replied mesty carelessly and i am very miserable replied jack but however i am completely in your power mesty and i must i suppose submit what you say massa easysubmit to meno sar when you are on board harpy as officer you talk with me as friend and not treat me as negro servant massa easy i feeli feel what i am continued mesty striking his bosom i feel it herefor all first time since i leave my country i feel that i am someting but massa easy i love my friend as much as i hate my enemyand you nebber submit to mei too proud to allow dat cause massa easyi am a manand once i was a prince although mesty did not perhaps explain by words half so well as he did by his countenance the full tide of feeling which was overflowing in his heart jack fully understood and felt it he extended his hand to mesty and said mestythat you have been a prince i care little about although i doubt it not because you are incapable of a lie but you are a man and i respect you nay i love you as a friendand with my will we never part again mesty took the hand offered by jack it was the first peace offering ever extended to him since he had been torn away from his native landthe first compliment the first tribute the first acknowledgment perhaps that he was not an inferior being he pressed it in silence for he could not speak but could the feelings which were suffocating the negro but have been laid before sceptics they must have acknowledged that at that moment they were all and only such as could do honour not only to the prince but even to the christian so much was mesty affected with what had happened that when he dropped the hand of our hero he went down into the cabin finding it impossible to continue the conversation which was not renewed until the next morning what is your opinion mesty tell me and i will be governed by it den sar i tell you i tink it right that they first come and ask to come on board before you take themand sar i tink it also right as we are but two and they are five dat dey first eat all their provisions let em starve plenty and den dey come on board tame enough at all events replied jack the first overtures of some kind or another must come from them i wish i had something to doi do not much like this cooping up on board ship massa why you no talk with pedro because i cannot speak spanish i know dat and dat why i ask de question you very sorry when you meet the two pretty women in the ship you not able to talk with them i guess that i was very sorry i grant replied jack well massa easy by and bye we see more spanish girl why not talk all day with pedro and den you able to talk with dem upon my word mesty i never had an idea of your value i will learn all the spanish that i can replied jack who was glad to have employment found for him and was quite disgusted with the articles of war as for the men on shore they continued the same course as before one day succeeded another and without variety it was however to be observed that the fire was now seldomer lighted which proved their fuel scarce and the weather was not so warm as it had been for it was now october jack learnt spanish from pedro for a month during which there was no appearance of submission on the part of the mutineers who for the first fortnight when intoxicated used to come down and fire at jack or mesty when they made their appearance fortunately drunken men are not good marksmen but latterly this had been discontinued because they had expended their ammunition and they appeared to have almost forgotten that the ship was there for they took no notice of her whatever on the other hand jack had decided that if he waited there a year the overtures should come from them who had mutinied and now having an occupation he passed his time very quietly and the days flew so fast that two months had actually been run off the calendar before he had an idea of it one evening as they were down in the cabin for the evenings had now become very cold jack asked mesty whether he had any objection to give him a history of his life mesty replied that if he wished he was ready to talk and at a nod from our hero mesty commenced as follows chapter xv in which mutiny like fire is quenched for want of fuel and no want of water although we have made the african negro hitherto talk in his own mixed jargon yet as we consider that in a long narration it will be tedious to the reader we shall now translate the narrative part into good english merely leaving the conversation with which it may be broken in its peculiar dialect the first thing i recollect said mesty is that i was carried on the shoulders of a man with my legs hanging down before and holding on by his head everyone used to look at me and get out of the way as i rode through the town and marketplace so loaded with heavy gold ornaments that i could not bear them and was glad when the women took them off but as i grew older i became proud of them because i knew that i was the son of a king i lived happy i did nothing but shoot my arrows and i had a little sword which i was taught to handle and the great captains who were about my father showed me how to kill my enemies sometimes i laid under the shady trees sometimes i was with the women belonging to my father sometimes i was with him and played with the skulls and repeated the names of those to whom they had belonged for in our country when we kill our enemies we keep their skulls as trophies as i grew older i did as i pleased i beat the women and the slaves i think i killed some of the latteri know i did one to try whether i could strike well with my twohanded sword made of hard and heavy woodbut that is nothing in our country i longed to be a great captain and i thought of nothing else but war and fighting and how many skulls i should have in my possession when i had a house and wives of my own and i was no longer a boy i went out in the woods to hunt and i stayed for weeks and one day i saw a panther basking in the sun waving his graceful tail i crept up softly till i was behind a rock within three yards of it and drawing my arrow to the head i pierced him through the body the animal bounded up in the air saw me roared and made a spring but i dropped behind the rock and he passed over me he turned again to me but i had my knife ready and as he fixed his talons into my shoulder and breast i pierced him to the heart this was the happiest day of my life i had killed a panther without assistance and i had the wounds to show although i was severely hurt i thought nothing of it i took off the skin as my blood dropped down and mixed with that of the beastbut i rejoiced in it proudly did i go into the town dripping with gore and smarting with pain everyone extolled the feat called me a hero and a great captain i filed my teeth and i became a man from that day i ranked among the warriors and as soon as my wounds were healed i went out to battle in three fights i had gained five skulls and when i returned they weighed me out gold i then had a house and wives and my father appointed me a caboceer i wore the plume of eagle and ostrich feathers my dress was covered with fetishes i pulled on the boots with bells and with my bow and arrows slung on my back my spear and blunderbuss my knives and my doublehanded sword i led the men to battle and brought back skulls and slaves everyone trembled at my name and if my father threatened to send me out golddust covered the floor of his hall of councilnow i boil the kettle for the young gentlemen there was one man i liked he was not a warrior or i should have hated him but he was brought up with me in my fathers house and was a near relative i was grave and full of pride he was gay and fond of music and although there was no music to me equal to the tomtom yet i did not always wish for excitement i often was melancholy and then i liked to lay my head in the lap of one of my wives under the shady forest behind my house and listen to his soft music at last he went to a town near us where his father lived and as he departed i gave him golddust he had been sent to my father to be formed into a warrior but he had no strength of body and he had no soul still i loved him because he was not like myself there was a girl in the town who was beautiful many asked for her as their wife but her father had long promised her to my friend he refused even the greatest warrior of the place who went away in wrath to the fetishman and throwing him his gold armlets asked for a fetish against his rival it was given and two days before he was to be married my friend died his mother came to me and it was enough i put on my war dress i seized my weapons sat for a whole day with my skulls before me working up my revenge called out my men and that night set off for the town where the warrior resided killed two of his relatives and carried off ten of his slaves when he heard what i had done he trembled and sent gold but i knew that he had taken the girl home as his wife and i would not listen to the old man who sought to pacify me again i collected a larger force and attacked him in the night we fought for he was prepared with his men but after a struggle he was beaten back i fired his house wasted his provision ground and taking away more slaves i returned home with my men intending soon to assault him again the next day there came more messengers who knelt in vain so they went to my father and many warriors begged him to interfere my father sent for me but i would not listen the warriors spoke and i turned my back my father was wroth and threatened the warriors brandished their twohanded swordsthey dared to do it i looked over my shoulder with contempt and i returned to my house i took down my skulls and i planned it was evening and i was alone when a woman covered up to the eyes approached she fell down before me as she exposed her face i am the girl who was promised to your relation and i am now the wife of your enemy i shall be a mother i could not love your relation for he was no warrior it is not true that my husband asked for a fetishit was i who bought it for i would not wed him kill me and be satisfied she was very beautiful and i wondered not that my enemy loved her and she was with childit was his child and she had fetished my friend to death i raised my sword to strike and she did not shrink it saved her life thou art fit to be the mother of warriors said i as i dropped my sword and thou shalt be my wife but first his child shall be born and i will have thy husbands skull no no replied she i will be the mother of no warriors but by my present husband whom i love if you keep me as your slave i will die i told her she said foolish things and sent her to the womens apartment with orders to be watchedbut she hardly had been locked up before she drew her knife plunged it into her heart and died when the king my father heard this he sent me a messagebe satisfied with the blood that has been shed it is enough but i turned away for i wished for mine enemys skull that night i attacked him again and met him hand to hand i killed him and carried home his skull and i was appeased but all the great warriors were wroth and my father could not restrain them they called out their men and i called out my men and i had a large body for my name was terrible but the force raised against me was twice that of mine and i retreated to the bushafter awhile we met and fought and i killed many but my men were too few and were overpoweredthe fetish had been sent out against me and their hearts melted at last i sank down with my wounds for i bled at every pore and i told my men who were about me to take off my feathers and my dress and boots that my enemies might not have my skull they did so and i crawled into the bush to die but i was not to die i was recovering when i was discovered by those who steal men to sell them i was bound and fastened to a chain with many more i a prince and a warrior who could show the white skulls of his enemiesi offered to procure gold but they derided me they dragged me down to the coast and sold me to the whites little did i think in my pride that i should be a slave i knew that i was to die and hoped to die in battle my skull would have been more prized than all the gold in the earth and my skin would have been stuffed and hung up in a fetishhouseinstead of which i now boil the kettle for the young gentlemen well replied jack thats better than being killed and stuffed mayhap it is replied mesty i tink very different now dan i tink denbut still it womens work and not suit me they put me with others into a cave until the ship came and then we were sent on board put in irons and down in the hold where you could not sit uprighti wanted to die but could not others died every day but i livedi was landed in america all bone and i fetched very little moneythey laughed at me as they bid their dollars at last a man took me away and i was on a plantation with hundreds more but too ill to work and not intending to work the other slaves asked me if i was a fetish man i said yes and i would fetish any man that i did not like one man laughed and i held up my finger i was too weak to get up for my blood had long boiled with fever and i said to him you shall die for i meant to have killed him as soon as i was well he went away and in three days he was dead i dont know how but all the slaves feared me and my master feared me for he had seen the man die and he although he was a white man believed in fetish and he wished to sell me again but no one would buy a fetish man so he made friends with me for i told him if i was beat he should die and he believed me he took me into his house and i was his chief man and i would not let the other slaves steal and he was content he took me with him to new york and there after two years when i had learnt english i ran away and got on board of an english shipand they told me to cook i left the ship as soon as i came to england and offered myself to another and they said they did not want a cook and i went to another and they asked me if i was a good cook everybody seemed to think that a black man must be a cook and nothing else at last i starve and i go on board a manofwar and here i am after having been a warrior and a prince cook steward and everything else boiling kettle for de young gentlemen well replied jack at all events that is better than being a slave mesty made no reply anyone who knows the life of a midshipmans servant will not be surprised at his silence now tell me do you think you were right in being so revengeful when you were in your own country inquired jack i tink so den massa easy sometimes when my blood boil i tink so nowoder time i no know what to tinkbut when a man love very much he hate very much but you are now a christian mesty i hear all that your people say replied the negro and it make me tinki no longer believe in fetish anyhow our religion tells us to love our enemies yes i heard parson say datbut den what we do with our friends massa easy love them too i no understand dat massa easyi love you because you good and treat me wellmr vigors he bully and treat me illhow possible to love him by de power i hate him and wish i had him skull you tink little massa gossett love him no replied jack laughing im afraid that he would like to have his skull as well as you mestybut at all events we must try and forgive those who injure us then massa easy i tink so tootoo much revenge very badit very easy to hate but not very easy to forgiveso i tink that if a man forgive he hab more soul in him he more of a man after all thought jack mesty is about as good a christian as most people what that cried mesty looking out of the cabin windowah dn drunken dogsthey set fire to tent jack looked and perceived that the tent on shore was in flames i tink these cold nights cool their courage anyhow observedmassa easy you see they soon ask permission to come on board jack thought so too and was most anxious to be off for on looking into the lockers in the stateroom he had found a chart of the mediterranean which he had studied very attentivelyhe had found out the rock of gibraltar and had traced the harpys course up to cape de catte and thence to tarragonaand after a while had summoned mesty to a cabinet council see mesty said jack i begin to make it out here is gibraltar and cape de catte and tarragonait was hereabout we were when we took the ship and if you recollect we had passed cape de gatte two days before we were blown off from the land so that we had gone about twelve inches and had only four more to go yes massa easy i see all dat well then we were blown off shore by the wind and must of course have come down this way and here you see are three little islands called zaffarine islands and with no names of towns upon them and therefore uninhabited and you see they lie just like the islands we are anchored among nowwe must be at the zaffarine islandsand only six inches from gibraltar i see massa easy dat all rightbut six debbelish long inches now mesty you know the compass on deck has a flourishing thing for the north pointand here is a compass with a north point also now the north point from the zaffarine islands leads out to the spanish coast again and gibraltar lies five or six points of the compass to this side of itif we steer that way we shall get to gibraltar all right massa easy replied mesty and jack was right with the exception of the variation which he knew nothing about to make sure jack brought one of the compasses down from deck and compared them he then lifted off the glass counted the points of the compass to the westward and marked the corresponding one on the binnacle compass with his pen there said he that is the way to gibraltar and as soon as the mutiny is quelled and the wind is fair ill be off chapter xvi in which jacks cruise is ended and he regains the harpy a few more days passed and as was expected the mutineers could hold out no longer in the first place they had put in the spile of the second cask of wine so loosely when they were tipsy that it dropped out and all the wine ran out so that there had been none left for three or four days in the next their fuel had long been expended and they had latterly eaten their meat raw the loss of their tent which had been fired by their carelessness had been followed by four days and nights of continual rain everything they had had been soaked through and through and they were worn out shivering with cold and starving hanging they thought better than dying by inches from starvation and yielding to the imperious demands of hunger they came down to the beach abreast of the ship and dropped down on their knees i tell you so massa easy said mesty dn rascals they forget they come down fire musket at us every day by all de powers mesty not forget it ship ahoy cried one of the men on shore what do you want replied jack have pity on us sirmercy exclaimed the other men we will return to our duty debble doubt em what shall i say mesty tell em no first massa easytell em to starve and be dd i cannot take mutineers on board replied jack well then our blood be on your hands mr easy replied the first man who had spoken if we are to die it must not be by inchesif you will not take us the sharks shallit is but a crunch and all is over what do you say my lads lets all rush in together goodbye mr easy i hope youll forgive us when were dead it was all that rascal johnson the coxswain who persuaded us come my lads its no use thinking of it the sooner done the betterlet us shake hands and then make one run of it it appeared that the poor fellows had already made up their minds to do this if our hero persuaded by mesty had refused to take them on board they shook hands all round and then walking a few yards from the beach stood in a line while the man gave the signalonetwo stop cried jack who had not forgotten the dreadful scene which had already taken placestop the men paused what will you promise if i take you on board to do our duty cheerfully till we join the ship and then be hung as an example to all mutineers replied the men dat very fair replied mesty take dem at their word massa easy very well replied jack i accept your conditions and we will come for you jack and mesty hauled up the boat stuck their pistols in their belts and pulled to the shore the men as they stepped in touched their hats respectfully to our hero but said nothing on their arrival on board jack read that part of the articles of war relative to mutiny by which the men were reminded of the very satisfactory fact that they were to suffer death and then made a speech which to men who were starving appeared to be interminable however there is an end to everything in this world and so there was to jacks harangue after which mesty gave them some biscuit which they devoured in thankfulness until they could get something better the next morning the wind was fair they weighed their kedge with some difficulty and ran out of the harbour the men appeared very contrite worked well but in silence for they had no very pleasant anticipations but hope always remains with us and each of the men although he had no doubt but that the others would be hung hoped that he would escape with a sound flogging the wind however did not allow them to steer their course long before night it was contrary and they fell off three points to the northward however as jack observed at all events we shall make the spanish coast and then we must run down it to gibraltar i dont carei understand navigation much better than i did the next morning they found themselves with a very light breeze under a high cape and as the sun rose they observed a large vessel inshore about two miles to the westward of them and another outside about four miles off mesty took the glass and examined the one outside which on a sudden had let fall all her canvas and was now running for the shore steering for the cape under which jacks vessel lay mesty put down the glass massa easyi tink dat de harpy one of the seamen took the glass and examined her while the others who stood by showed great agitation yes it is the harpy said the seaman oh mr easy will you forgive us continued the man and he and the others fell on their knees do not tell all for gods sake mr easy jacks heart melted he looked at mesty i tink said mesty apart to our hero dat with what them hab suffer already suppose they get seven dozen apiece dat quite enough jack thought that even half that punishment would suffice so he told the men that although he must state what had occurred he would not tell all and would contrive to get them off as well as he could he was about to make a long speech but a gun from the harpy which had now come up within range made him defer it till a more convenient opportunity at the same time the vessel inshore hoisted spanish colours and fired a gun by de powers but we got in the middle of it cried mesty harpy tink us spaniard now my lads get all gun ready bring up powder and shot massa now us fire at spaniardharpy not fire at usno ab english colours on boarddat all we must do the men set to with a will the guns were all loaded and were soon cast loose and primed during which operations it fell calm and the sails of all three vessels flapped against their masts the harpy was then about two miles from jacks vessel and the spaniard about a mile from him with all her boats ahead of her towing towards him mesty examined the spanish vessel dat manofwar massa easywhat de debbel we do for colour must hoist something mesty ran down below he recollected that there was a very gay petticoat which had been left by the old lady who was in the vessel when they captured her it was of green silk with yellow and blue flowers but very faded having probably been in the dons family for a century mesty had found it under the mattress of one of the beds and had put it into his bag intending probably to cut it up into waistcoats he soon appeared with this under his arm made it fast to the peak halyards and hoisted it up dere massa dat do very welldat what you call all nation colour everybody strike him flag to datmen nebber pull it down said mesty anyhow now den ab hoist colour we fire awaymind you only fire one gun at a time and point um well den ab time to load again shes hoisted her colours sir said sawbridge on board of the harpy but they do not show out clear and its impossible to distinguish them but theres a gun its not at us sir said gascoigne the midshipman its at the spanish vesseli saw the shot fall ahead of her it must be a privateer said captain wilson at all events it is very fortunate for the corvettes would otherwise have towed into carthagena another gun round and grape and well pointed too she carries heavy metal that craft she must be a maltese privateer thats as much as to say that shes a pirate replied sawbridge i can make nothing of her coloursthey appear to me to be greenshe must be a turk another gunand devilish well aimed it has hit the boats yes they are all in confusion we will have her now if we can only get a trifle of wind that is a breeze coming up in the offing trim the sails mr sawbridge the yards were squared and the harpy soon had steerageway in the meantime jack and his few men had kept up a steady welldirected although slow fire with their larboard guns upon the spanish corvette and two of her boats had been disabled the harpy brought the breeze up with her and was soon within range she steered to cut off the corvette firing only on her bowchasers we ab her now cried mesty fire away men take good aim breeze come now one man go to helm by de power what dat the exclamation of mesty was occasioned by a shot hulling the ship on the starboard side jack and he ran over and perceived that three spanish gunboats had just made their appearance round the point and had attacked them the fact was that on the other side of the cape was the port and town of carthagena and these gunboats had been sent out to the assistance of the corvette the ship had now caught the breeze fortunately for jack or he would probably have been taken into carthagena and the corvette finding herself cut off by both the harpy and jacks vessel as soon as the breeze came up to her put her head the other way and tried to escape by running westward along the coast close inshore another shot and then another pierced the hull of the ship and wounded two of jacks men but as the corvette had turned and the harpy followed her of course jack did the same and in ten minutes he was clear of the gunboats who did not venture to make sail and stand after him the wind now freshened fast and blew out the green petticoat but the harpy was exchanging broadsides with the corvette and too busy to look after jacks ensign the spaniard defended himself well and had the assistance of the batteries as he passed but there was no anchorage until he had run many miles further about noon the wind died away and at one oclock it again fell nearly calm but the harpy had neared her distance and was now within three cables length of her antagonist engaging her and a battery of four guns jack came up again for he had the last of the breeze and was about half a mile from the corvette when it fell calm by the advice of mesty he did not fire anymore as otherwise the harpy would not obtain so much credit and it was evident that the fire of the spaniard slackened fast at three oclock the spanish colours were hauled down and the harpy sending a boat on board and taking possession directed her whole fire upon the battery which was soon silenced the calm continued and the harpy was busy enough with the prize shifting the prisoners and refitting both vessels which had very much suffered in the sails and rigging there was an occasional wonder on board the harpy what that strange vessel might be who had turned the corvette and enabled them to capture her but when people are all very busy there is not much time for surmise jacks crew with himself consisted but of eight one of which was a spaniard and two were wounded it therefore left him but four and he had also something to do which was to assist his wounded men and secure his guns moreover mesty did not think it prudent to leave the vessel a mile from the harpy with only two on board besides as jack said he had had no dinner and was not quite sure that he should find anything to eat when he went into the midshipmens berth he would therefore have some dinner cooked and eat it before he went on board in the meantime they would try and close with her jack took things always very easy and he said he should report himself at sunset there were other reasons which made jack in no very great hurry to go on board he wanted to have time to consider a little what he should say to excuse himself and also how he should plead for the men his natural correctness of feeling decided him in the first place to tell the whole truth and in the next his kind feelings determined him to tell only part of it jack need not have given himself this trouble for as far as regarded himself he had fourteen thousand good excuses in the bags that lay in the stateroom and as for the men after an action with the enemy if they behave well even mutiny is forgiven at last jack who was tired with excitement and the hard work of the day thought and thought until he fell fast asleep and instead of waking at sunset did not wake till two hours afterwards and mesty did not call him because he was in no hurry himself to go on board and boil de kettle for de young gentlemen when jack woke up he was astonished to find that he had slept so long he went on deck it was dark and still calm but he could easily perceive that the harpy and corvette were still hoveto repairing damages he ordered the men to lower down the small boat and leaving mesty in charge with two oars he pulled to the harpy what with wounded men with prisoners and boats going and coming between the vessels everyone on board the harpy were well employed and in the dark jacks little boat came alongside without notice this should not have been the case but it was and there was some excuse for it jack ascended the side and pushed his way through the prisoners who were being mustered to be victualled he was wrapped up in one of the gregos and many of the prisoners wore the same jack was amused at not being recognised he slipped down the main ladder and had to stoop under the hammocks of the wounded men and was about to go aft to the captains cabin to report himself when he heard young gossett crying out and the sound of the rope hang me if that brute vigors aint thrashing young gossett thought jack i dare say the poor fellow has had plenty of it since i have been away ill save him this time at least jack wrapped up in his grego went to the window of the berth looked in and found it was as he expected he cried out in an angry voice mr vigors ill thank you to leave gossett alone at the sound of the voice vigors turned round with his colt in his hand saw jacks face at the window and impressed with the idea that the reappearance was supernatural uttered a wail and fell down in a fitlittle gossett also trembling in every limb stared with his mouth open jack was satisfied and immediately disappeared he then went aft to the cabin pushed by the servant who was giving some orders from the captain to the officer on deck and entering the cabin where the captain was seated with two spanish officers took off his hat and said come on board captain wilson captain wilson did not fall down in a fit but he jumped up and upset the glass before him merciful god mr easy where did you come from from that ship astern sir replied jack that ship astern what is shewhere have you been so long its a long story sir replied jack captain wilson extended his hand and shook jacks heartily at all events im delighted to see you boy now sit down and tell me your story in a few words we will have it in detail byandbye if you please sir said jack we captured that ship with the cutter the night after we went awayim not a firstrate navigator and i was blown to the zaffarine islands where i remained two months for want of hands as soon as i procured them i made sail againi have lost three men by sharks and i have two wounded in todays fightthe ship mounts twelve guns is half laden with lead and cotton prints has fourteen thousand dollars in the cabin and three shotholes right through herand the sooner you send some people on board of her the better this was not very intelligible but that there were fourteen thousand dollars and that she required hands sent on board was very satisfactorily explained captain wilson rang the bell sent for mr asper who started back at the sight of our herodesired him to order mr jolliffe to go on board with one of the cutters send the wounded men on board and take charge of the vessel and then told jack to accompany mr jolliffe and to give him every information telling him that he would hear his story tomorrow when they were not so very busy chapter xvii in which our hero finds out that trigonometry is not only necessary to navigation but may be required in settling affairs of honour as captain wilson truly said he was too busy even to hear jacks story that night for they were anxious to have both vessels ready to make sail as soon as a breeze should spring up for the spaniards had vessels of war at carthagena which was not ten miles off and had known the result of the action it was therefore necessary to change their position as soon as possible mr sawbridge was on board the prize which was a corvette mounting two guns more than the harpy and called the cacafuogo she had escaped from cadiz run through the straits in the night and was three miles from carthagena when she was captured which she certainly never would have been but for jacks fortunately blundering against the cape with his armed vessel so that captain wilson and mr sawbridge both of whom were promoted the first to the rank of postcaptain the second to that of commander may be said to be indebted to jack for their good fortune the harpy had lost nineteen men killed and wounded and the spanish corvette fortyseven altogether it was a very creditable affair at two oclock in the morning the vessels were ready everything had been done that could be done in so short a time and they stood under easy sail during the night for gibraltar the nostra signora del carmen under the charge of jolliffe keeping company jolliffe had the advantage over his shipmates of first hearing jacks adventures with which he was much astonished as well as amusedeven captain wilson was not more happy to see jack than was the worthy masters mate about nine oclock the harpy hoveto and sent a boat on board for our hero and the men who had been so long with him in the prize and then hoisted out the pinnace to fetch on board the dollars which were of more importance jack as he bade adieu to jolliffe took out of his pocket and presented him with the articles of war which as they had been so useful to him he thought jolliffe could not do without and then went down the side the men were already in the boat casting imploring looks upon jack to raise feelings of compassion and mesty took his seat by our hero in a very sulky humour probably because he did not like the idea of having again to boil de kettle for de young gentlemen even jack felt a little melancholy at resigning his command and he looked back at the green petticoat which blew out gracefully from the mast for jolliffe had determined that he would not haul down the colours under which jack had fought so gallant an action jacks narration as may be imagined occupied a large part of the forenoon and although jack did not attempt to deny that he had seen the recall signal of mr sawbridge yet as his account went on the captain became so interested that at the end of it he quite forgot to point out to jack the impropriety of not obeying orders he gave jack great credit for his conduct and was also much pleased with that of mesty jack took the opportunity of stating mestys aversion to his present employment and his recommendation was graciously received jack also succeeded in obtaining the pardon of the men in consideration of their subsequent good behaviour but notwithstanding this promise on the part of captain wilson they were ordered to be put in irons for the present however jack told mesty and mesty told the men that they would be released with a reprimand when they arrived at gibraltar so that all the men cared for was a fair wind captain wilson informed jack that after his joining the admiral he had been sent to malta with the prizes and that supposing the cutter to have been sunk he had written to his father acquainting him with his sons death at which our hero was much grieved for he knew what sorrow it would occasion particularly to his poor mother but thought jack if she is unhappy for three months she will be overjoyed for three more when she hears that i am alive so it will be all square at the end of the six and as soon as i arrive at gibraltar i will write and as the wind is fair that will be tomorrow or next day after a long conversation jack was graciously dismissed captain wilson being satisfied from what he had heard that jack would turn out a very good officer and had already forgotten all about equality and the rights of man but there captain wilson was mistaken tares sown in infancy are not so soon rooted out jack went on deck as soon as the captain had dismissed him and found the captain and officers of the spanish corvette standing aft looking very seriously at the nostra signora del carmen when they saw our hero whom captain wilson had told them was the young officer who had barred their entrance into carthagena they turned their eyes upon him not quite so graciously as they might have done jack with his usual politeness took off his hat to the spanish captain and glad to have an opportunity of sporting his spanish expressed the usual wish that he might live a thousand years the spanish captain who had reason to wish that jack had gone to the devil at least twentyfour hours before was equally complimentary and then begged to be informed what the colours were that jack had hoisted during the action jack replied that they were colours to which every spanish gentleman considered it no disgrace to surrender although always ready to engage and frequently attempting to board upon which the spanish captain was very much puzzled captain wilson who understood a little spanish then interrupted by observing bythebye mr easy what colours did you hoist up we could not make them out i see mr jolliffe still keeps them up at the peak yes sir replied jack rather puzzled what to call them but at last he replied that it was the banner of equality and the rights of man captain wilson frowned and jack perceiving that he was displeased then told him the whole story whereupon captain wilson laughed and jack then also explained in spanish to the officers of the corvette who replied that it was not the first time and would not be the last that men had got into a scrape through a petticoat the spanish captain complimented jack on his spanish which was really very good for in two months with nothing else in the world to do he had made great progress and asked him where he had learnt it jack replied at the zaffarine islands zaffarine isles replied the spanish captain they are not inhabited plenty of groundsharks replied jack the spanish captain thought our hero a very strange fellow to fight under a green silk petticoat and to take lessons in spanish from the groundsharks however being quite as polite as jack he did not contradict him but took a huge pinch of snuff wishing from the bottom of his heart that the groundsharks had taken jack before he had hoisted that confounded green petticoat however jack was in high favour with the captain and all the ships company with the exception of his four enemiesthe master vigors the boatswain and the pursers steward as for mr vigors he had come to his senses again and had put his colt in his chest until jack should take another cruise little gossett at any insulting remark made by vigors pointed to the window of the berth and grinned and the very recollection made vigors turn pale and awed him into silence in two days they arrived at gibraltarmr sawbridge rejoined the shipso did mr jolliffethey remained there a fortnight during which jack was permitted to be continually on shoremr asper accompanied him and jack drew a heavy bill to prove to his father that he was still alive mr sawbridge made our hero relate to him all his adventures and was so pleased with the conduct of mesty that he appointed him to a situation which was particularly suited to him that of ships corporal mr sawbridge knew that it was an office of trust and provided that he could find a man fit for it he was very indifferent about his colour mesty walked and strutted about at least three inches taller than he was before he was always clean did his duty conscientiously and seldom used his cane i think mr easy said the first lieutenant that as you are so particularly fond of taking a cruisefor jack had told the whole truthit might be as well that you improve your navigation i do think myself sir replied jack with great modesty that i am not yet quite perfect well then mr jolliffe will teach you he is the most competent in this ship the sooner you ask him the better and if you learn it as fast as you have spanish it will not give you much trouble jack thought the advice good the next day he was very busy with his friend jolliffe and made the important discovery that two parallel lines continued to infinity would never meet it must not be supposed that captain wilson and mr sawbridge received their promotion instanter promotion is always attended with delay as there is a certain routine in the service which must not be departed from captain wilson had orders to return to malta after his cruise he therefore carried his own despatches away from england from malta the despatches had to be forwarded to toulon to the admiral and then the admiral had to send to england to the admiralty whose reply had to come out again all this with the delays arising from vessels not sailing immediately occupied an interval of between five and six monthsduring which time there was no alteration in the officers and crew of his majestys sloop harpy there had however been one alteration the gunner mr linus who had charge of the first cutter in the night action in which our hero was separated from his ship carelessly loading his musket had found himself minus his right hand which upon the musket going off as he rammed down had gone off too he was invalided and sent home during jacks absence and another had been appointed whose name was tallboys mr tallboys was a stout dumpy man with red face and still redder hands he had red hair and red whiskers and he had read a great dealfor mr tallboys considered that the gunner was the most important personage in the ship he had once been a captains clerk and having distinguished himself very much in cuttingout service had applied for and received his warrant as a gunner he had studied the art of gunnery a part of which he understood but the remainder was above his comprehension he continued however to read it as before thinking that by constant reading he should understand it at last he had gone through the work from the titlepage to the finis at least forty times and had just commenced it over again he never came on deck without the gunners vade mecum in his pocket with his hand always upon it to refer to it in a moment but mr tallboys had as we observed before a great idea of the importance of a gunner and among other qualifications he considered it absolutely necessary that he should be a navigator he had at least ten instances to bring forward of bloody actions in which the captain and all the commissioned officers had been killed or wounded and the command of the ship had devolved upon the gunner now sir would he say if the gunner is no navigator he is not fit to take charge of his majestys ships the boatswain and carpenter are merely practical men but the gunner sir is or ought to be scientific gunnery sir is a sciencewe have our own disparts and our lines of sightour windage and our parabolas and projectile forcesand our point blank and our reduction of powder upon a graduated scale now sir theres no excuse for a gunner not being a navigator for knowing his duty as a gunner he has the same mathematical tools to work with upon this principle mr tallboys had added john hamilton moore to his library and had advanced about as far into navigation as he had in gunnery that is to the threshold where he stuck fast with all his mathematical tools which he did not know how to use to do him justice he studied for two or three hours every day and it was not his fault if he did not advancebut his head was confused with technical terms he mixed all up together and disparts sines and cosines parabolas tangents windage seconds lines of sight logarithms projectiles and traverse sailing quadrature and gunters scales were all crowded together in a brain which had not capacity to receive the rule of three too much learning said festus to the apostle hath made thee mad mr tallboys had not wit enough to go mad but his learning lay like lead upon his brain the more he read the less he understood at the same time that he became more satisfied with his supposed acquirements and could not speak but in mathematical parables i understand mr easy said the gunner to him one day after they had sailed for malta that you have entered into the science of navigationat your age it was high time yes replied jack i can raise a perpendicular at all events and box the compass yes but you have not yet arrived at the dispart of the compass not come to that yet replied jack are you aware that a ship sailing describes a parabola round the globe not come to that yet replied jack and that any propelled body striking against another flies off at a tangent very likely replied jack that is a sine that he dont like it you have not yet entered into acute trigonometry not come to that yet replied jack that will require very sharp attention i should think so replied jack you will then find out how your parallels of longitude and latitude meet two parallel lines if continued to infinity will never meet replied jack i beg your pardon said the gunner i beg yours said jack whereupon mr tallboys brought up a small map of the world and showed jack that all the parallels of latitude met at a point at the top and the bottom parallel lines never meet replied jack producing hamilton moore whereupon jack and the gunner argued the point until it was agreed to refer the case to mr jolliffe who asserted with a smile that those lines were parallels and not parallels as both were right both were satisfied it was fortunate that jack would argue in this instance had he believed all the confused assertions of the gunner he would have been as puzzled as the gunner himself they never met without an argument and a reference and as jack was put right in the end he only learnt the faster by the time that he did know something about navigation he discovered that his antagonist knew nothing before they arrived at malta jack could fudge a days work but at malta jack got into another scrape although mr smallsole could not injure him he was still jacks enemy the more so as jack had become very popular vigors also submitted planning revenge but the parties in this instance were the boatswain and pursers steward jack still continued his forecastle conversations with mesty and the boatswain and pursers steward probably from their respective illwill towards our hero had become great allies mr easthupp now put on his best jacket to walk the dogwatches with mr biggs and they took every opportunity to talk at our hero its my peculiar hopinion said mr easthupp one evening pulling at the frill of his shirt that a gentleman should behave as a gentleman and that if a gentleman professes opinions of inequality and such liberal sentiments that he is bound as a gentleman to hact up to them very true mr easthupp he is bound to act up to them and not because a person who was a gentleman as well as himself happens not to be on the quarterdeck to insult him because he only has perfessed opinions like his own hereupon mr biggs struck his rattan against the funnel and looked at our hero yes continued the pursers steward i should like to see the fellow who would have done so on shore however the time will come when i can hagain pull on my plain coat and then the insult shall be vashed out in blood mr biggs and ill be cursed if i dont some day teach a lesson to the blackguard who stole my trousers vas hall your money right mr biggs inquired the pursers steward i didnt count replied the boatswain magnificently nogentlemen are habove that replied easthupp but there are many lightfingered gentry about the quantity of vatches and harticles of value vich were lost ven i valked bond street in former times is incredible i can say this at all events replied the boatswain that i should be always ready to give satisfaction to any person beneath me in rank after i had insulted him i dont stand upon my rank although i dont talk about equality dammeno nor consort with niggers all this was too plain for our hero not to understand so jack walked up to the boatswain and taking his hat off with the utmost politeness said to him if i mistake not mr biggs your conversation refers to me very likely it does replied the boatswain listeners hear no good of themselves it appears that gentlemen cant converse without being vatched continued mr easthupp pulling up his shirt collar it is not the first time that you have thought proper to make very offensive remarks mr biggs and as you appear to consider yourself illtreated in the affair of the trousersfor i tell you at once that it was i who brought them on boardi can only say continued our hero with a very polite bow that i shall be most happy to give you satisfaction i am your superior officer mr easy replied the boatswain yes by the rules of the service but you just now asserted that you would waive your rankindeed i dispute it on this occasion i am on the quarterdeck and you are not this is the gentleman whom you have insulted mr easy replied the boatswain pointing to the pursers steward yes mr heasy quite as good a gentleman as yourself although i av ad misfortunesi ham of as old a family as hany in the country replied mr easthupp now backed by the boatswain many the year did i valk bond street and i ave as good blood in my weins as you mr heasy halthough i have been misfortunateive had admirals in my family you have grossly insulted this gentleman said mr biggs in continuation and notwithstanding all your talk of equality you are afraid to give him satisfactionyou shelter yourself under your quarterdeck mr biggs replied our hero who was now very wroth i shall go on shore directly we arrive at malta let you and this fellow put on plain clothes and i will meet you bothand then ill show you whether i am afraid to give satisfaction one at a time said the boatswain no sir not one at a time but both at the same timei will fight both or none if you are my superior officer you must descend replied jack with an ironical sneer to meet me or i will not descend to meet that fellow whom i believe to have been little better than a pickpocket this accidental hit of jacks made the pursers steward turn pale as a sheet and then equally red he raved and foamed amazingly although he could not meet jacks indignant look who then turned round again now mr biggs is this to be understood or do you shelter yourself under your forecastle im no dodger replied the boatswain and we will settle the affair at malta at which reply jack returned to mesty massa easy i look at um face dat fellow eastop he no like it i go shore wid you see fair play anyhowsuppose i can mr biggs having declared that he would fight of course had to look out for a second and he fixed upon mr tallboys the gunner and requested him to be his friend mr tallboys who had been latterly very much annoyed by jacks victories over him in the science of navigation and therefore felt illwill towards him consented but he was very much puzzled how to arrange that three were to fight at the same time for he had no idea of there being two duels so he went to his cabin and commenced reading jack on the other hand dared not say a word to jolliffe on the subject indeed there was no one in the ship to whom he could confide but gascoigne he therefore went to him and although gascoigne thought it was excessively infra dig of jack to meet even the boatswain as the challenge had been given there was no retracting he therefore consented like all midshipmen anticipating fun and quite thoughtless of the consequences the second day after they had been anchored in valette harbour the boatswain and gunner jack and gascoigne obtained permission to go on shore mr easthupp the pursers steward dressed in his best blue coat with brass buttons and velvet collar the very one in which he had been taken up when he had been vowing and protesting that he was a gentleman at the very time that his hand was abstracting a pocketbook went up on the quarterdeck and requested the same indulgence but mr sawbridge refused as he required him to return staves and hoops at the cooperage mesty also much to his mortification was not to be spared this was awkward but it was got over by proposing that the meeting should take place behind the cooperage at a certain hour on which mr easthupp might slip out and borrow a portion of the time appropriated to his duty to heal the breach in his wounded honour so the parties all went on shore and put up at one of the small inns to make the necessary arrangements mr tallboys then addressed mr gascoigne taking him apart while the boatswain amused himself with a glass of grog and our hero sat outside teasing a monkey mr gascoigne said the gunner i have been very much puzzled how this duel should be fought but i have at last found it out you see that there are three parties to fight had there been two or four there would have been no difficulty as the right line or square might guide us in that instance but we must arrange it upon the triangle in this gascoigne stared he could not imagine what was coming are you aware mr gascoigne of the properties of an equilateral triangle yes replied the midshipman that it has three equal sidesbut what the devil has that to do with the duel everything mr gascoigne replied the gunner it has resolved the great difficulty indeed the duel between three can only be fought upon that principle you observe said the gunner taking a piece of chalk out of his pocket and making a triangle on the table in this figure we have three points each equidistant from each other and we have three combatantsso that placing one at each point it is all fair play for the three mr easy for instance stands here the boatswain here and the pursers steward at the third corner now if the distance is fairly measured it will be all right but then replied gascoigne delighted at the idea how are they to fire it certainly is not of much consequence replied the gunner but still as sailors it appears to me that they should fire with the sun that is mr easy fires at mr biggs mr biggs fires at mr easthupp and mr easthupp fires at mr easy so that you perceive that each party has his shot at one and at the same time receives the fire of another gascoigne was in ecstasies at the novelty of the proceeding the more so as he perceived that easy obtained every advantage by the arrangement upon my word mr tallboys i give you great credit you have a profound mathematical head and i am delighted with your arrangement of course in these affairs the principals are bound to comply with the arrangements of the seconds and i shall insist upon mr easy consenting to your excellent and scientific proposal gascoigne went out and pulling jack away from the monkey told him what the gunner had proposed at which jack laughed heartily the gunner also explained it to the boatswain who did not very well comprehend but replied i dare say its all rightshot for shot and dn all favours the parties then repaired to the spot with two pairs of ships pistols which mr tallboys had smuggled on shore and as soon as they were on the ground the gunner called mr easthupp out of the cooperage in the meantime gascoigne had been measuring an equilateral triangle of twelve pacesand marked it out mr tallboys on his return with the pursers steward went over the ground and finding that it was equal angles subtended by equal sides declared that it was all right easy took his station the boatswain was put into his and mr easthupp who was quite in a mystery was led by the gunner to the third position but mr tallboys said the pursers steward i dont understand this mr easy will first fight mr biggs will he not no replied the gunner this is a duel of three you will fire at mr easy mr easy will fire at mr biggs and mr biggs will fire at you it is all arranged mr easthupp but said mr easthupp i do not understand it why is mr biggs to fire at me i have no quarrel with mr biggs because mr easy fires at mr biggs and mr biggs must have his shot as well if you have ever been in the company of gentlemen mr easthupp observed gascoigne you must know something about duelling yes yes ive kept the best company mr gascoigne and i can give a gentleman satisfaction but then sir if that is the case you must know that your honour is in the hands of your second and that no gentleman appeals yes yes i know that mr gascoigne but still ive no quarrel with mr biggs and therefore mr biggs of course you will not aim at me why you dont think that i am going to be fired at for nothing replied the boatswain no no ill have my shot anyhow but at your friend mr biggs all the same i shall fire at somebody shot for shot and hit the luckiest vel gentlemen i purtest against these proceedings replied mr easthupp i came here to have satisfaction from mr easy and not to be fired at by mr biggs dont you have satisfaction when you fire at mr easy replied the gunner what more would you have i purtest against mr biggs firing at me so you would have a shot without receiving one cried gascoigne the fact is that this fellows a confounded coward and ought to be kicked into the cooperage again at this affront mr easthupp rallied and accepted the pistol offered by the gunner you ear those words mr biggs pretty language to use to a gentleman you shall ear from me sir as soon as the ship is paid off i purtest no longer mr tallboys death before dishonour im a gentleman damme at all events the swell was not a very courageous gentleman for he trembled most exceedingly as he pointed his pistol the gunner gave the word as if he were exercising the great guns on board ship cock your lockstake good aim at the objectfirestop your vents the only one of the combatants who appeared to comply with the latter supplementary order was mr easthupp who clapped his hand to his trousers behind gave a loud yell and then dropped down the bullet having passed clean through his seat of honour from his having presented his broadside as a target to the boatswain as he faced towards our hero jacks shot had also taken effect having passed through both the boatswains cheeks without further mischief than extracting two of his best upper double teeth and forcing through the hole of the further cheek the boatswains own quid of tobacco as for mr easthupps ball as he was very unsettled and shut his eyes before he fired it had gone the lord knows where the pursers steward lay on the ground and screamedthe boatswain spit his double teeth and two or three mouthfuls of blood out and then threw down his pistols in a rage a pretty business by god sputtered he hes put my pipe out how the devil am i to pipe to dinner when im ordered all my wind escaping through the cheeks in the meantime the others had gone to the assistance of the pursers steward who continued his vociferations they examined him and considered a wound in that part not to be dangerous hold your confounded bawling cried the gunner or youll have the guard down here youre not hurt hant hi roared the steward oh let me die let me die dont move me nonsense cried the gunner you must get up and walk down to the boat if you dont well leave youhold your tongue confound you you wont then ill give you something to halloo for whereupon mr tallboys commenced cuffing the poor wretch right and left who received so many swinging boxes of the ear that he was soon reduced to merely pitiful plaints of oh dearsuch inhumanityi purtestoh dear must i get up i cant indeed i do not think he can move mr tallboys said gascoigne i should think the best plan would be to call up two of the men from the cooperage and let them take him at once to the hospital the gunner went down to the cooperage to call the men mr biggs who had bound up his face as if he had a toothache for the bleeding had been very slight came up to the pursers steward what the hell are you making such a howling about look at me with two shotholes through my figure head while you have only got one in your stem i wish i could change with you by heavens for i could use my whistle thennow if i attempt to pipe there will be such a wasteful expenditure of his majestys stores of wind that i never shall get out a note a wicked shot of yours mr easy i really am very sorry replied jack with a polite bow and i beg to offer my best apology during this conversation the pursers steward felt very faint and thought he was going to die oh dear oh dear what a fool i was i never was a gentlemanonly a swell i shall die i never will pick a pocket againnevernever god forgive me why confound the fellow cried gascoigne so you were a pickpocket were you i never will again replied the fellow in a faint voice hill hamend and lead a good lifea drop of wateroh lagged at last then the poor wretch fainted away and mr tallboys coming up with the men he was taken on their shoulders and walked off to the hospital attended by the gunner and also the boatswain who thought he might as well have a little medical advice before he went on board well easy said gascoigne collecting the pistols and tying them up in his handkerchief ill be shot but were in a pretty scrape theres no hushing this up ill be hanged if i care its the best piece of fun i ever met with and at the remembrance of it gascoigne laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks jacks mirth was not quite so excessive as he was afraid that the pursers steward was severely hurt and expressed his fears at all events you did not hit him replied gascoigne all you have to answer for is the boatswains mugi think youve stopped his jaw for the future im afraid that our leave will be stopped for the future replied jack that we may take our oaths of replied gascoigne then look you ned said easy ive lots of dollarswe may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb as the saying is i vote that we do not go on board sawbridge will send and fetch us replied ned but he must find us first that wont take long for the soldiers will soon have our description and rout us out we shall be pinned in a couple of days confound it and they say that the ship is to be hove down and that we shall be here six weeks at least cooped up on board in a broiling sun and nothing to do but to watch the pilot fish playing round the rudder and munch bad apricots i wont go on board lookye jack said gascoigne have you plenty of money i have twenty doubloons besides dollars replied jack well then we will pretend to be so much alarmed at the result of this duel that we dare not show ourselves lest we should be hung i will write a note and send it to jolliffe to say that we have hid ourselves until the affair is blown over and beg him to intercede with the captain and first lieutenant i will tell him all the particulars and refer to the gunner for the truth of it and then i know that although we should be punished they will only laugh but i will pretend that easthupp is killed and we are frightened out of our lives that will be it and then lets get on board one of the speronares which come with fruit from sicily sail in the night for palermo and then well have a cruise for a fortnight and when the money is all gone well come back thats a capital idea ned and the sooner we do it the better i will write to the captain begging him to get me off from being hung and telling him where we have fled to and that letter shall be given after we have sailed they were two very nice ladsour hero and gascoigne chapter xviii in which our hero sets off on another cruise in which he is not blown off shore gascoigne and our hero were neither of them in uniform and they hastened to nix mangare stairs where they soon picked up the padrone of a speronare they went with him into a wine shop and with the assistance of a little english from a maltese boy whose shirt hung out of his trousers they made a bargain by which it was agreed that for the consideration of two doubloons he would sail that evening and land them at gergentif or some other town in sicily providing them with something to eat and gregos to sleep upon our two midshipmen then went back to the tavern from which they had set off to fight the duel and ordering a good dinner to be served in a back room they amused themselves with killing flies as they talked over the events of the day and waited for their dinner as mr tallboys did not himself think proper to go on board till the evening and mr biggs also wished it to be dark before he went up the ships side the events of the duel did not transpire till the next morning even then it was not known from the boatswain or gunner but by a hospital mate coming on board to inform the surgeon that there was one of their men wounded under their charge but that he was doing very well mr biggs had ascended the side with his face bound up confound that jack easy said he i have only been on leave twice since i sailed from portsmouth once i was obliged to come up the side without my trousers and show my bare stem to the whole ships company and now i am coming up and dare not show my figure head he reported himself to the officer of the watch and hastening to his cabin went to bed and lay the whole night awake from pain thinking what excuse he could possibly make for not coming on deck next morning to his duty he was however saved this trouble for mr jolliffe brought the letter of gascoigne up to mr sawbridge and the captain had received that of our hero captain wilson came on board and found that mr sawbridge could communicate all the particulars of which he had not been acquainted by jack and after they had read over gascoignes letter in the cabin and interrogated mr tallboys who was sent down under an arrest they gave free vent to their mirth upon my soul theres no end to mr easys adventures said the captain i could laugh at the duel for after all it is nothingand he would have been let off with a severe reprimand but the foolish boys have set off in a speronare to sicily and how the devil are we to get them back again theyll come back sir replied sawbridge when all their moneys gone yes if they do not get into any more scrapes that young scamp gascoigne is as bad as easy and now they are together theres no saying what may happen i dine at the governors today how he will laugh when i tell him of this new way of fighting a duel yes sir it is just the thing that will tickle old tom we must find out if they have got off the island sawbridge which may not be the case but it was the case jack and gascoigne had eaten a ye good dinner sent for the monkey to amuse them till it was dark and there had waited till the padrone came to them what shall we do with the pistols easy take them with us and load them before we gowe may want them who knows but there may be a mutiny on board of the speronare i wish we had mesty with us they loaded the pistols took a pair each and put them in their waists concealed under their clothes divided the ammunition between them and soon afterwards the padrone came to tell them all was ready whereupon messrs gascoigne and easy paid there bill and rose to depart but the padrone informed them that he should like to see the colour of their money before they went on board jack very indignant at the insinuation that he had not sufficient cash pulled out a handful of doubloons and tossing two to the padrone and asked him if he was satisfied the padrone untied his sash put in the money and with many thanks and protestations of service begged our young gentlemen to accompany him they did so and in a few minutes were clear of nix mangare stairs and passing close to his majestys ship harpy were soon out of the harbour of valette of all the varieties of vessels which float upon the wave there is not perhaps one that bounds over the water so gracefully or so lightly as a speronare or any one so picturesque and beautiful to the eye of those who watch its progress the night was clear and the stars shone out brilliantly as the light craft skimmed over the water and a fragment of a desert and waning moon threw its soft beams upon the snowwhite sail the vessel which had no deck was full of baskets which had contained grapes and various fruits brought from the ancient granary of rome still as fertile and as luxuriant as ever the crew consisted of the padrone two men and a boy the three latter with their gregos or night greatcoats with hoods sitting forward before the sail with their eyes fixed on the land as they flew past point after point thinking perhaps of their wives or perhaps of their sweethearts or perhaps not thinking at all the padrone remained aft at the helm offering every politeness to our two young gentlemen who only wished to be left alone at last they requested the padrone to give them gregos to lie down upon as they wished to go to sleep he called the boy to take the helm procured them all they required and then went forward and our two midshipmen laid down looking at the stars above them for some minutes without exchanging a word at last jack commenced i have been thinking gascoigne that this is very delightful my heart bounds with the vessel and it almost appears to me as if the vessel herself was rejoicing in her liberty here she is capering over the waves instead of being tied by the nose with a cable and anchor thats a touch of the sentimental jack replied gascoigne but she is no more free than she was when at anchor for she now is forced to act in obedience to her steersman and go just where he pleases you may just as well say that a horse if taken out of the stable is free with the curb and his rider on his back thats a touch of the rational ned which destroys the illusion never mind we are free at all events what machines we are on board of a manofwar we walk talk eat drink sleep and get up just like clockwork we are wound up to go the twentyfour hours and then wound up again just like old smallsole does the chronometers very true jack but it does not appear to me that hitherto you have kept very good time you require a little more regulating said gascoigne how can you expect any piece of machinery to go well so damnably knocked about as a midshipman is replied our hero very true jack but sometimes you dont keep any time for you dont keep any watch mr asper dont wind you up you dont go at all no because he allows me to go down but still i do go ned yes to your hammockits no go with old smallsole if i want a bit of caulk but jack what do you sayshall we keep watch tonight why to tell you the truth i have been thinking the same thingi dont much like the looks of the padronehe squints thats no proof of anything jack except that his eyes are not straight but if you do not like the look of him i can tell you that he very much liked the look of your doubloonsi saw him start and his eyes twinkled and i thought at the time it was a pity you had not paid him in dollars it was very foolish in me but at all events he has not seen all he saw quite enough ned very true but you should have let him see the pistols and not have let him see the doubloons well if he wishes to take what he has seen he shall receive what he has not seenwhy there are only four of them oh i have no fear of them only it may be as well to sleep with one eye open when shall we make the land tomorrow evening with this wind and it appears to be steady suppose we keep watch and watch and have our pistols out ready with the greatcoats just turned over them to keep them out of sight agreedits about twelve oclock nowwho shall keep the middle watch i will jack if you like it well then mind you kick me hard for i sleep devilish sound goodnight and keep a sharp lookout jack was fast asleep in less than ten minutes and gascoigne with his pistols lying by him all ready for each hand sat up at the bottom of the boat there certainly is a peculiar providence in favour of midshipmen compared with the rest of mankind they have more lives than a cat always in the greatest danger but always escaping from it the padrone of the vessel had been captivated with the doubloons which jack had so foolishly exposed to his view and he had moreover resolved to obtain them at the very time that our two lads were conversing aft the padrone was talking the matter over with his two men forward and it was agreed that they should murder rifle and then throw them overboard about two oclock in the morning the padrone came aft to see if they were asleep but found gascoigne watching he returned aft again and again but found the young man still sitting up tired of waiting anxious to possess the money and not supposing that the lads were armed he went once more forward and spoke to the men gascoigne had watched his motions he thought it singular that with three men in the vessel the helm should be confided to the boyand at last he saw them draw their knives he pushed our hero who woke immediately gascoigne put his hand over jacks mouth that he might not speak and then whispered his suspicions jack seized his pistolsthey both cocked them without noise and then waited in silence jack still lying down while gascoigne continued to sit up at the bottom of the boat at last gascoigne saw the three men coming afthe dropped one of his pistols for a second to give jack a squeeze of the hand which was returned and as gascoigne watched them making their way through the piles of empty baskets he leaned back as if he was slumbering the padrone followed by the two men was at last aftthey paused a moment before they stepped over the strengthening plank which ran from side to side of the boat between them and the midshipmen and as neither of them stirred they imagined that both were asleepadvanced and raised their knives when gascoigne and jack almost at the same moment each discharged their pistols into the breast of the padrone and one of the men who was with him in advance who both fell with the send aft of the boat so as to encumber the midshipmen with the weight of their bodies the third man started back jack who could not rise from the padrone lying across his legs took a steady aim with his second pistol and the third man fell the boy at the helm who it appeared either was aware of what was to be done or seeing the men advance with their knives had acted upon what he saw also drew his knife and struck at gascoigne from behind the knife fortunately after slightly wounding gascoigne on the shoulder had shut on the boys handgascoigne sprang up with his other pistolthe boy started back at the sight of it lost his balance and fell overboard our two midshipmen took a few seconds to breathe i say jack said gascoigne at last did you ever no i never replied jack whats to be done now why as weve got possession ned we had better put a man at the helmfor the speronare is having it all her own way very true replied gascoigne and as i can steer better than you i suppose it must be me gascoigne went to the helm brought the boat up to the wind and then they resumed their conversation that rascal of a boy gave me a devil of a lick on the shoulder i dont know whether he has hurt meat all events its my left shoulder so i can steer just as well i wonder whether the fellows are dead the padrone is at all events replied jack it was as much as i could do to get my legs from under himbut well wait till daylight before we see to thatin the meantime ill load the pistols again the day is breaking nowit will be light in half an hour or less what a devil of a spree jack yes but how can one help it we ran away because two men are woundedand now we are obliged to kill four in selfdefence yes but that is not the end of it when we get to sicily what are we to do we shall be imprisoned by the authoritiesperhaps hung well argue that point with them replied jack we had better argue the point between ourselves jack and see what will be the best plan to get out of our scrape i think that we just have got out of itnever fear but well get out of the next do you know gascoigne it appears to me very odd but i can do nothing but theres a bobbery at the bottom of it you certainly have a great talent that way jack dont i hear one of those poor fellows groan i should think that not impossible what shall we do with them we will argue that point nedwe must either keep their bodies or we must throw them overboard either tell the whole story or say nothing about it thats very evident in short we must do something for your argument goes no further but now let us take up one of your propositions well then suppose we keep the bodies on board run into a seaport go to the authorities and state all the facts what then we shall prove beyond all doubt that we have killed three men if not four but we shall not prove that we were obliged so to do jack and then we are hereticswe shall be put in prison till they are satisfied of our innocence which we never can prove and there we shall remain until we have written to malta and a manofwar comes to redeem us if we are not stabbed or something else in the meantime that will not be a very pleasant cruise replied jack now lets argue the point on the other side there is some difficulty theresuppose we throw their bodies overboard toss the baskets after them wash the boat clean and make for the first port we may chance to hit upon the very spot from which they sailed and then there will be a pack of wives and children and a populace with knives asking us what has become of the men of the boat i dont much like the idea of that said jack and if we dont have such bad luck still we shall be interrogated as to who we are and how we were adrift by ourselves there will be a difficulty about that againwe must swear that it is a party of pleasure and that we are gentlemen yachting without a crew or provisionsyachts dont sail with a clean swept hold or gentlemen without a spare shirtwe have nothing but two gallons of water and two pairs of pistols i have it said jackwe are two young gentlemen in our own boat who went out to gozo with pistols to shoot seamews were caught in a gale and blown down to sicilythat will excite interest thats the best idea yet as it will account for our having nothing in the boat well then at all events we will get rid of the bodies but suppose they are not deadwe cannot throw them overboard alivethat will be murder very true replied jack then we must shoot them first and toss them overboard afterwards upon my soul easy you are an odd fellow however go and examine the men and well decide that point byandbye you had better keep your pistol ready cocked for they may be shamming devil a bit of sham here anyhow replied jack pulling at the body of the padrone and as for this fellow you shot you might put your fist into his chest now for the third continued jack stepping over the strengthening piecehes all among the baskets i say my cock are you dead and jack enforced his question with a kick in the ribs the man groaned thats unlucky gascoigne but however ill soon settle him said jack pointing his pistol stop jack cried gascoigne it really will be murder no such thing ned ill just blow his brains out and then ill come aft and argue the point with you now do oblige me by coming aft and arguing the point first do jack i beg of youi entreat you with all my heart replied jack resuming his seat by gascoigne i assert that in this instance killings no murder you will observe ned that by the laws of society any one who attempts the life of another has forfeited his own at the same time as it is necessary that the fact should be clearly proved and justice be duly administered the parties are tried convicted and then are sentenced to the punishment i grant all that in this instance the attempt has been clearly proved we are the witnesses and are the judges and jury and society in general for the best of all possible reasons because there is nobody else these mens lives being therefore forfeited to society belong to us and it does not follow because they were not all killed in the attempt that therefore they are not now to be brought out for punishment and as there is no common hangman here we of course must do this duty as well as every other i have now clearly proved that i am justified in what i am about to do but the argument does not stop there selfpreservation is the first law of nature and if we do not get rid of this man what is the consequencethat we shall have to account for his being wounded and then instead of judges we shall immediately be placed in the position of culprits and have to defend ourselves without witnesses we therefore risk our lives from a misplaced lenity towards a wretch unworthy to live your last argument is strong easy but i cannot consent to your doing what may occasion you uneasiness hereafter when you think of it pooh nonsensei am a philosopher of what school jack oh i presume you are a disciple of mestys i do not mean to say that you are wrong but still hear my proposition let us lower down the sail and then i can leave the to assist you we will clear the vessel of everything except the man who is still alive at all events we may wait a little and if at last there is no help for it i will then agree with you to launch him overboard even if he is not quite dead agreed even by your own making out it will be no great sin he is half dead alreadyi only do half the work of tossing him over so it will be only quarter murder on my part and he would have shown no quarter on his here jack left off arguing and punning and went forward and lowered down the sail ive half a mind to take my doubloons back said jack as they launched over the body of the padrone but he may have themi wonder whether theyll ever turn up again not in our time jack replied gascoigne the other body and all the basket lumber etc were then tossed over and the boat was cleared of all but the man who was not yet dead now lets examine the fellow and see if he has any chance of recovery said gascoigne the man lay on his side gascoigne turned him over and found that he was dead over with him quick said jack before he comes to life again the body disappeared under the wavethey again hoisted the sail gascoigne took the helm and our hero proceeded to draw water and wash away the stains of blood he then cleared the boat of vineleaves and rubbish with which it was strewed swept it clean fore and aft and resumed his seat by his comrade there said jack now weve swept the decks we may pipe to dinner i wonder whether there is anything to eat in the locker jack opened it and found some bread garlic sausages a bottle of aquadente and a jar of wine so the padrone did keep his promise after all yes and had you not tempted him with the sight of so much gold might now have been alive to which i reply that if you had not advised our going off in a speronare he would now have been alive and if you had not fought a duel i should not have given the advice and if the boatswain had not been obliged to come on board without his trousers at gibraltar i should not have fought a duel and if you had not joined the ship the boatswain would have had his trousers on and if my father had not been a philosopher i should not have gone to sea so that it is all my fathers fault and he has killed four men off the coast of sicily without knowing itcause and effect after all theres nothing like argument so having settled that point let us go to dinner having finished their meal jack went forward and observed the land ahead they steered the same course for three or four hours we must haul our wind more said gascoigne it will not do to put into any small town we have now to choose whether we shall land on the coast and sink the speronare or land at some large town we must argue that point replied jack in the meantime do you take the helm for my arm is quite tired replied gascoigne you can steer well enough bythebye i may as well look at my shoulder for it is quite stiff gascoigne pulled off his coat and found his shirt bloody and sticking to the wound which as we before observed was slight he again took the helm while jack washed it clean and then bathed it with aquadente now take the helm again said gascoigne im on the sick list and as surgeonim an idler replied jack but what shall we do continued he abandon the speronare at night and sink her or run in for a town we shall fall in with plenty of boats and vessels if we coast it up to palermo and they may overhaul us we shall fall in with plenty of people if we go on shore and they will overhaul us do you know jack that i wish we were back and alongside of the harpy ive had cruising enough my cruises are so unfortunate replied jack they are too full of adventure but then i have never yet had a cruise on shore now if we could only get to palermo we should be out of all our difficulties the breeze freshens jack replied gascoigne and it begins to look very dirty to windward i think we shall have a gale pleasanti know what it is to be shorthanded in a gale however theres one comfort we shall not be blown offshore this time no but we may be wrecked on a lee shore she cannot carry her whole sail easy we must lower it down and take in a reef the sooner the better for it will be dark in an hour go forward and lower it down and then ill help you jack did so but the sail went into the water and he could not drag it in avast heaving said gascoigne till i throw her up and take the wind out of it this was done they reefed the sail but could not hoist it up if gascoigne left the helm to help jack the sail filled if he went to the helm and took the wind out of the sail jack was not strong enough to hoist it the wind increased rapidly and the sea got up the sun went down and with the sail half hoisted they could not keep to the wind but were obliged to run right for the land the speronare flew rising on the crest of the waves with half her keel clear of the water the moon was already up and gave them light enough to perceive that they were not five miles from the coast which was lined with foam at all events they cant accuse us of running away with the boat observed jack for shes running away with us yes replied gascoigne dragging at the tiller with all his strength she has taken the bit between her teeth i wouldnt care if i had a bit between mine replied jack for i feel devilish hungry again what do you say ned with all my heart replied gascoigne but do you know easy it may be the last meal we ever make then i vote its a good onebut why so ned in half an hour or thereabouts we shall be on shore well thats where we want to go yes but the sea runs high and the boat may be dashed to pieces on the rocks then we shall be asked no questions about her or the men very true but a lee shore is no joke we may be knocked to pieces as well as the boateven swimming may not help us if we could find a cove or sandy beach we might perhaps manage to get on shore well replied jack i have not been long at sea and of course cannot know much about these things i have been blown off shore but i never have been blown on it may be as you say but i do not see the great dangerlets run her right up on the beach at once thats what i shall try to do replied gascoigne who had been four years at sea and knew very well what he was about jack handed him a huge piece of bread and sausage thank ye i cannot eat i can replied jack with his mouth full jack ate while gascoigne steered and the rapidity with which the speronare rushed to the beach was almost frightful she darted like an arrow from wave to wave and appeared as if mocking their attempts as they curled their summits almost over her narrow stern they were within a mile of the beach when jack who had finished his supper and was looking at the foam boiling on the coast exclaimed thats very finevery beautiful upon my soul he cares for nothing thought gascoigne he appears to have no idea of danger now my dear fellow said gascoigne in a few minutes we shall be on the rocks i must continue at the helm for the higher she is forced up the better chance for us but we may not meet again so if we do not goodbye and god bless you gascoigne said jack you are hurt and i am not your shoulder is stiff and you can hardly move your left arm now i can steer for the rocks as well as you do you go to the bow and there you will have a better chancebythebye continued he picking up his pistols and sticking them into his waist i wont leave them theyve served us too good a turn already gascoigne give me the helm no no easy i say yes replied jack in a loud authoritative tone and whats more i will be obeyed gascoigne i have nerve if i havent knowledge and at all events i can steer for the beach i tell you give me the helm well then if you wont i must take it easy wrested the tiller from gascoignes hand and gave him a shove forward now do you look out ahead and tell me how to steer whatever may have been gascoignes feelings at this behaviour of our heros it immediately occurred to him that he could not do better than to run the speronare to the safest point and that therefore he was probably more advantageously employed than if he were at the helm he went forward and looked at the rocks covered at one moment with the tumultuous waters and then pouring down cascades from their sides as the waves recoiled he perceived a chasm right ahead and he thought if the boat was steered for that she must be thrown up so as to enable them to get clear of her for at every other part escape appeared impossible starboard a littlethatll do steadyport it isportsteer small for your life easy steady nowmind the yard dont hit your headhold on the speronare was at this moment thrown into a large cleft in a rock the sides of which were nearly perpendicular nothing else could have saved them as had they struck the rock outside the boat would have been dashed to pieces and its fragments have disappeared in the undertow as it was the cleft was not four feet more than the width of the boat and as the waves hurled her up into it the yard of the speronare was thrown fore and aft with great violence and had not jack been warned he would have been struck overboard without a chance of being saved but he crouched down and it passed over him as the water receded the boat struck and was nearly dry between the rocks but another wave followed dashing the boat further up but at the same time filling it with water the bow of the boat was now several feet higher than the stem where jack held on and the weight of the water in her with the force of the returning waves separated her right across abaft the mast jack perceived that the after part of the boat was going out again with the wave he caught hold of the yard which had swung fore and aft and as he clung to it the part of the boat on which he had stood disappeared from under him and was swept away by the returning current jack required the utmost of his strength to maintain his position until another wave floated him and dashed him higher up but he knew his life depended on holding on to the yard which he did although under water and advanced several feet when the wave receded he found footing on the rock and still clinging he walked till he had gained the fore part of the boat which was wedged firmly into a narrow part of the cleft the next wave was not very large and he had gained so much that it did not throw him off his legs he reached the rock and as he climbed up the side of the chasm to gain the ledge above he perceived gascoigne standing above him and holding out his hand to his assistance well says jack shaking himself to get rid of the water here we are ashore at lasti had no idea of anything like this the rush back of the water was so strong that it has almost tom my arms out of their sockets how very lucky i sent you forward with your disabled shoulder bythebye now that its all over and you must see that i was right i beg to apologise for my rudeness there needs no apology for saving my life easy replied gascoigne trembling with the cold and no one but you would ever have thought of making one at such a moment i wonder whether the ammunitions dry said jack i put it all in my hat jack took off his hat and found the cartridges had not suffered now then gascoigne what shall we do i hardly know replied gascoigne suppose then we sit down and argue the point no i thank you there will be too much cold water thrown upon our argumentsim half dead let us walk on with all my heart said jack its devilish steep but i can argue up hill or down hill wet or dryim used to itfor as i told you before ned my father is a philosopher and so am i by the lord you are replied gascoigne as he walked on chapter xix in which our hero follows his destiny and forms a tableau our hero and his comrade climbed the precipice and after some minutes severe toil arrived at the summit when they sat down to recover themselves the sky was clear although the gale blew strong they had an extensive view of the coast lashed by the angry waves its my opinion ned said jack as he surveyed the expanse of troubled water that were just as well out of that i agree with you jack but its also my opinion that we should be just as well out of this for the wind blows through one suppose we go a little further inland where we may find some shelter till the morning its rather dark to find anything rejoined our hero but however a westerly gale on the top of a mountain with wet clothes in the middle of the night with nothing to eat or drink is not the most comfortable position in the world and we may change for the better they proceeded over a flat of a hundred yards and then descendedthe change in the atmosphere was immediate as they continued their march inland they came to a high road which appeared to run along the shore and they turned into it for as jack said very truly a road must lead to something after a quarter of an hours walk they again heard the rolling of the surf and perceived the white walls of houses here we are at last said jack i wonder if any one will turn out to take us in or shall we stow away for the night in one of those vessels hauled up on the beach recollect this time easy said gascoigne not to show your money that is show only a dollar and say you have no more or promise to pay when we arrive at palermo and if they will neither trust us nor give to us we must make it out as we can how the cursed dogs bark i think we shall do very well this time gascoigne we do not look as if we were worth robbing at all events and we have the pistols to defend ourselves with if we are attacked depend upon it i will show no more gold and now let us make our arrangements take you one pistol and take half the goldi have it all in my righthand pocketmy dollars and pistarenes in my left you shall take half of them too we have silver enough to go on with till we are in a safe place jack then divided the money in the dark and also gave gascoigne a pistol now then shall we knock for admittance lets first walk through the village and see if theres anything like an inn those yelping curs will soon be at our heels they come nearer and nearer every time theres a cart and its full of strawsuppose we go to bed till tomorrow morningwe shall be warm at all events yes replied gascoigne and sleep much better than in any of the cottages i have been in sicily before and you have no idea how the fleas bite our two midshipmen climbed up into the cart nestled themselves into the straw or rather indian corn leaves and were soon fast asleep as they had not slept for two nights it is not to be wondered at that they slept soundly so soundly indeed that about two hours after they had got into their comfortable bed the peasant who had brought to the village some casks of wine to be shipped and taken down the coast in a felucca yoked his bullocks and not being aware of his freight drove off without in any way disturbing their repose although the roads in sicily are not yet macadamised the jolting of the roads rather increased than disturbed the sleep of our adventurers and although there were some rude shocks it only had the effect of making them fancy in their dreams that they were again in the boat and that she was still dashing against the rocks in about two hours the cart arrived at its destinationthe peasant unyoked his bullocks and led them away the same cause will often produce contrary effects the stopping of the motion of the cart disturbed the rest of our two midshipmen they turned round in the straw yawned spread out their arms and then awoke gascoigne who felt considerable pain in his shoulder was the first to recall his scattered senses easy cried he as he sat up and shook off the corn leaves port it is said jack half dreaming come easy you are not on board now rouse and bit jack then sat up and looked at gascoigne the forage in the cart was so high round them that they could not see above it they rubbed their eyes yawned and looked at each other have you any faith in dreams said jack to gascoigne because i had a very queer one last night well so had i replied gascoigne i dreamt that the cart rolled by itself into the sea and went away with us right in the winds eye back to malta and considering that it never was built for such service she behaved uncommonly well now what was your dream mine was that we woke up and found ourselves in the very town from which the speronare had sailed and that they had found the fore part of the speronare among the rocks had recognised her and picked up one of our pistols that they had laid hold of us and had insisted that we had been thrown on shore in the boat and asked us what had become of the crewthey were just seizing us when i awoke your dream is more likely to come true than mine easy but still i think we need not fear that at the same time we had better not remain here any longer and it occurs to me that if we tore our clothes more it would be advisablewe shall in the first place look more wretched and in the next place can replace them with the dress of the country and so travel without exciting suspicion you know that i can speak italian pretty well i have no objection to tear my clothes if you wish replied jack at the same time give me your pistol i will draw the charges and load them again they must be wet having reloaded the pistols and rent their garments the two midshipmen stood up in the cart and looked about them halloowhy hows this gascoigne last night we were close to the beach and among houses and nowwhere the devil are we you dreamt nearer the mark than i did for the cart has certainly taken a cruise we must have slept like midshipmen then replied gascoigne surely it cannot have gone far here we are surrounded by hills on every side for at least a couple of miles surely some good genius has transported us into the interior that we might escape from the relatives of the crew whom i dreamt about said jack looking at gascoigne as it afterwards was known to them the speronare had sailed from the very seaport in which they had arrived that night and where they had got into the cart the wreck of the speronare had been found and had been recognised and it was considered by the inhabitants that the padrone and his crew had perished in the gale had they found our two midshipmen and questioned them it is not improbable that suspicion might have been excited and the results have been such as our hero had conjured up in his dream but as we said before there is a peculiar providence for midshipmen on a minute survey they found that they were in an open space which apparently had been used for thrashing and winnowing maize and that the cart was standing under a clump of trees in the shade there ought to be a house hereabouts said gascoigne i should think that behind the trees we shall find one come jack you are as hungry as i am ill answer for it we must look out for a breakfast somewhere if they wont give us something to eat or sell it replied jack who was ravenous clutching his pistol i shall take iti consider it no robbery the fruits of the earth were made for us all and it never was intended that one man should have a superfluity and another starve the laws of equality may appear very good arguments to a starving man i grant but still wont prevent his fellowcreatures from hanging him replied gascoigne none of your confounded nonsense jack no man starves with money in his pocket and as long as you have that leave those that have none to talk about equality and the rights of man i should like to argue that point with you gascoigne tell me do you prefer sitting down here to argue or to look out for some breakfast jack oh the argument may be put off but hunger cannot thats very good philosophy jack so lets go on they went through the copse of wood which was very thick and soon discovered the wall of a large house on the other side all right said jack but still let us reconnoitre its not a farmhouse it must belong to a person of some consequenceall the betterthey will see that we are gentlemen notwithstanding our tattered dress i suppose we are to stick to the story of the seamews at gozo yes replied gascoigne i can think of nothing better but the english are well received in this island we have troops at palermo have we i wish i was sitting down at the messtablebut whats that a woman screaming yes by heavenscome along ned and away dashed jack towards the house followed by gascoigne as they advanced the screams redoubled they entered the porch burst into the room from whence they proceeded and found an elderly gentleman defending himself against two young men who were held back by an elderly and a young lady our hero and his comrade had both drawn their pistols and just as they burst open the door the old gentleman who defended himself against such odds had fallen down the two others burst from the women and were about to pierce him with their swords when jack seized one by the collar of his coat and held him fast pointing the muzzle of the pistol to his ear gascoigne did the same to the other it was a very dramatic tableau the two women flew to the elderly gentleman and raised him up the two assailants being held just as dogs hold pigs by the ear trembling with fright with the points of their rapiers dropped looked at the midshipmen and the muzzles of their pistols with equal dismay at the same time the astonishment of the elderly gentleman and the women at such an unexpected deliverance was equally great there was a silence for a few seconds ned at last said jack tell these chaps to drop their swords or we fire gascoigne gave the order in italian and it was complied with the midshipmen then possessed themselves of the rapiers and gave the young men their liberty the elderly gentleman at last broke the silence it would appear signors that there was a special interference of providence to prevent you from committing a foul and unjust murder who these are who have so opportunely come to my rescue i know not but thanking them as i do now i think that you will yourselves when you are calm also thank them for having prevented you from committing an act which would have loaded you with remorse and embittered your future existence gentleman you are free to depart you don silvio have indeed disappointed me your gratitude should have rendered you incapable of such conduct as for you don scipio you have been misled but you both have in one point disgraced yourselves ten days back my sons were both herewhy did you not come then if you sought revenge on me you could not have inflicted it deeper than through my children and at least you would not have acted the part of assassins in attacking an old man take your swords gentlemen and use them better henceforth against future attacks i shall be well prepared gascoigne who perfectly understood what was said presented the sword to the young gentleman from whom he had taken itour hero did the same the two young men returned them to their sheaths and quitted the room without saying a word whoever you are i owe to you and thank you for my life said the elderly gentleman scanning the outward appearance of our two midshipmen we are replied gascoigne officers in the english navy and gentlemen we were wrecked in our boat last night and have wandered here in the dark seeking for assistance and food and some conveyance to palermo where we shall find friends and the means of appearing like gentlemen was your ship wrecked gentlemen inquired the sicilian and many lives lost no our ship is at malta we were in a boat on a party of pleasure were caught by a gale and driven on the coast to satisfy you of the truth observe that our pistols have the kings mark and that we are not paupers we show you gold gascoigne pulled out his doubloonsand jack did the same coolly observing i thought we were only to show silver ned it needed not that replied the gentleman your conduct in this affair your manners and address fully convince me that you are what you represent but were you common peasants i am equally indebted to you for my life and you may command me tell me in what way i can be of service in giving us something to eat for we have had nothing for many many hours after that we may perhaps trespass a little more upon your kind offices you must of course be surprised at what has passed and curious to know the occasion said the gentleman you have a right to be informed of it and shall be as soon as you are more comfortable in the meantime allow me to introduce myself as don rebiera de silva i wish said jack who from his knowledge of spanish could understand the whole of the last part of the dons speech that he would introduce us to his breakfast so do i said gascoigne but we must wait a littlehe ordered the ladies to prepare something instantly your friend does not speak italian said don rebiera no don rebiera he speaks french and spanish if he speaks spanish my daughter can converse with him she has but shortly arrived from spain we are closely united with a noble house in that country don rebiera then led the way to another room and in a short time there was a repast brought in to which our midshipmen did great justice i will now said the don relate to you sir for the information of yourself and friend the causes which produced this scene of violence which you so opportunely defeated but first as it must be very tedious to your friend i will send for donna clara and my daughter agnes to talk to him my wife understands a little spanish and my daughter as i said before has but just left the country where from circumstances she remained some years as soon as donna clara and donna agnes made their appearance and were introduced jack who had not before paid attention to them said to himself i have seen a face like that girls before if so he had never seen many like it for it was the quintessence of brunette beauty and her figure was equally perfect although not having yet completed her fifteenth year it required still a little more development donna clara was extremely gracious and as perhaps she was aware that her voice would drown that of her husband she proposed to our hero to walk in the garden and in a few minutes they took their seats in a pavilion at the end of it the old lady did not talk much spanish but when at a loss for a word she put in an italian one and jack understood her perfectly well she told him her sister had married a spanish nobleman many years since and that before the war broke out between the spanish and the english they had gone over with all their children to see her that when they wished to return her daughter agnes then a child was suffering under a lingering complaint and it was thought advisable as she was very weak to leave her under the charge of her aunt who had a little girl of nearly the same age that they were educated together at a convent near tarragona and that she had only returned two months ago that she had a very narrow escape as the ship in which her uncle and aunt and cousins as well as herself were on board returning from genoa where her brotherinlaw had been obliged to go to secure a succession to some property bequeathed to him had been captured in the night by the english but the officer who was very polite had allowed them to go away next day and very handsomely permitted them to take all their effects oh oh thought jack i thought i had seen her face before this then was one of the girls in the corner of the cabinnow ill have some fun during the conversation with the mother donna agnes had remained some paces behind picking now and then a flower and not attending to what passed when our hero and her mother sat down in the pavilion she joined then when jack addressed her with his usual politeness i am almost ashamed to be sitting by you donna agnes in this ragged dressbut the rocks of your coast have no respect for persons we are under great obligations signor and do not regard such trifles you are all kindness signora replied jack i little thought this morning of my good fortunei can tell the fortunes of others but not my own you can tell fortunes replied the old lady yes madame i am famous for itshall i tell your daughter hers donna agnes looked at our hero and smiled i perceive that the young lady does not believe me i must prove my art by telling her of what has already happened to her the signora will then give me credit certainly if you do that replied agnes oblige me by showing me the palm of your hand agnes extended her little hand and jack felt so very polite that he was nearly kissing it however he restrained himself and examining the lines that you were educated in spainthat you arrived here but two months agothat you were captured and released by the english your mother has already told me but to prove to you that i knew all that i must now be more particular you were in a ship mounting fourteen guns was it not so donna agnes nodded her head i never told the signor that cried donna clara she was taken by surprise in the night and there was no fighting the next morning the english burst open the cabindoor your uncle and your cousin fired their pistols holy virgin cried agnes with surprise the english officer was a young man not very goodlooking there you are wrong signorhe was very handsome there is no accounting for taste signora you were frightened out of your wits and with your cousin you crouched down in the corner of the cabin let me examine that little line closer you hadyes its no mistakeyou had very little clothes on agnes tore away her hand and covered her face e vero e vero holy jesus how could you know that of a sudden agnes looked at our hero and after a minute appeared to recognise him oh mother tis hei recollect now tis he who my child replied donna clara who had been struck dumb with jacks astonishing power of fortunetelling the officer who captured us and was so kind jack burst out into a laughter not to be controlled for some minutes and then acknowledged that she had discovered him at all events donna agnes said he at last acknowledge that ragged as i am i have seen you in a much greater dishabille agnes sprang up and took to her heels that she might hide her confusion and at the same time go to her father and tell him who he had as his guest although don rebiera had not yet finished his narrative this announcement of agnes who ran in breathless to communicate it immediately brought all the parties together and jack received their thanks i little thought said the don that i should have been so doubly indebted to you sir command my services as you please both of you my sons are at palermo and i trust you will allow them the pleasure of your friendship when you are tired of remaining with us jack made his politest bow and then with a shrug of his shoulders looked down upon his habiliments which to please gascoigne he had torn into ribands as much as to say we are not provided for a lengthened stay my brothers clothes will fit them i think said agnes to her father they have left plenty in their wardrobes if the signors will condescend to wear them till they can replace their own midshipmen are very condescending they followed don rebiera and condescended to put on clean shirts belonging to don philip and don martin also to put on their trousers to select their best waistcoats and coats in short they condescended to have a regular fitoutand it so happened that the fitout was not far from a regular fit having condescended they then descended and the intimacy between all parties became so great that it appeared as if they not only wore the young mens clothes but also stood in their shoes having thus made themselves presentable jack presented his hand to both ladies and led them into the garden that don rebiera might finish his long story to gascoigne without further interruption and resuming their seats in the pavilion he entertained the ladies with a history of his cruise in the ship after her capture agnes soon recovered from her reserve and jack had the forbearance not to allude again to the scene in the cabin which was the only thing she dreaded after dinner when the family according to custom had retired for the siesta gascoigne and jack who had slept enough in the cart to last for a week went out together in the garden well ned said jack do you wish yourself on board the harpy again no replied gascoigne we have fallen on our feet at last but still not without first being knocked about like peas in a rattle what a lovely little creature that agnes is how strange that you should fall in with her again how odd that we should come here my good fellow we did not come here destiny brought us in a cart she may take us to tyburn in the same way yes if you sport your philosophy as you did when we awoke this morning nevertheless ill be hanged if im not right suppose we argue the point right or wrong you will be hanged jack so instead of arguing the point suppose i tell you what the don made such a long story about with all my heartlet us go to the pavilion our hero and his friend took their seats and gascoigne then communicated the history of don rebiera to which we shall dedicate the ensuing chapter chapter xx a long story which the reader must listen to as well as our hero i have already made you acquainted with my name and i have only to add that it is one of the most noble in sicily and that there are few families who possess such large estates my father was a man who had no pleasure in the pursuits of most of the young men of his age he was of a weakly constitution and was with difficulty reared to manhood when his studies were completed he retired to his country seat belonging to our family which is about twenty miles from palermo and shutting himself up devoted himself wholly to literary pursuits as he was an only son his parents were naturally very anxious that he should marry the more so as his health did not promise him a very extended existence had he consulted his own inclinations he would have declined but he felt that it was his duty to comply with their wishes but he did not trouble himself with the choice leaving it wholly to them they selected a young lady of high family and certainly of most exquisite beauty i only wish i could say more in her favourfor she was my motherbut it is impossible to narrate the history without exposing her conduct the marriage took place and my fatherhaving woke up as it were at the celebrationagain returned to his closet to occupy himself in abstruse studiesthe results of which have been published and have fully established his reputation as a man of superior talent and deep research but however much the public may appreciate the works of a man of genius whether they be written to instruct or to amuse certain it is that a literary man requires in his wife either a mind congenial to his own or that pride in her husbands talents which induces her to sacrifice much of her own domestic enjoyment to the satisfaction of having his name extolled abroad i mention this point as some extenuation of my mothers conduct she was neglected most certainly but not neglected for frivolous amusements or because another form had captivated his fancy but in his desire to instruct others and i may add his ambition for renown he applied himself to his literary pursuits became abstracted answered without hearing and left his wife to amuse herself in any way she might please a literary husband is without exceptionalthough always at homethe least domestic husband in the world and must try the best of tempersnot by unkindness for my father was kind and indulgent to excess but by that state of perfect abstraction and indifference which he showed to everything except the favourite pursuit which absorbed him my mother had but to speak and every wish was granteda refusal was unknown you may say what could she want more i reply that anything to a woman is preferable to indifference the immediate consent to every wish took away in her opinion all merit in the grantthe value of everything is only relative and in proportion to the difficulty of obtaining it the immediate assent to every opinion was tantamount to insultit implied that he did not choose to argue with her it is true that women like to have their own waybut they like at the same time to have difficulties to surmount and to conquer otherwise half the gratification is lost although tempests are to be deplored still a certain degree of oscillation an motion are requisite to keep fresh and clear the lake of matrimony the waters of which otherwise soon stagnate and become foul and without some contrary currents of opinion between a married couple such a stagnation must take place a woman permitted always and invariably to have her own way without control is much in the same situation as the child who insists upon a whole instead of half a holiday and before the evening closes is tired of himself and everything about him in short a little contradiction like salt at dinner seasons and appetises the repast but too much eke the condiment in question spoils the whole and it becomes unpalatable in proportion to its excess my mother was a vain woman in every sense of the wordvain of her birth and of her beauty and accustomed to receive that homage to which she considered herself entitled she had been spoiled in her infancy and as she grew up had leant nothing because she was permitted to do as she pleased she was therefore frivolous and could not appreciate what she could not comprehend there never was a more illassorted union i have always thought that such must be the case replied gascoigne in catholic countries where a young person is taken out of a convent and mated according to what her family or her wealth may consider as the most eligible connection on that subject there are many opinions my friend replied don rebiera it is true that when a marriage of convenience is arranged by the parents the dispositions of the parties are made a secondary point but then again it must be remembered that when a choice is left to the parties themselves it is at an age at which there is little worldly consideration and led away in the first place by their passions they form connections with those inferior in their station which are attended with eventual unhappiness or in the other allowing that they do choose in their own rank of life they make quite as bad or often a worse choice than if their partners were selected for them i cannot understand that replied gascoigne the reason is because there are no means or if means no wish to study each others disposition a young man is attracted by person and he admires the young woman is flattered by the admiration and is agreeable if she has any faults she is not likely to display them not concealing them from hypocrisy but because they are not called out the young man falls in love so does the young woman and when once in love they can no longer see faults they marry imagining that they have found perfection in the blindness of love each raises the other to a standard of perfection which human nature can never attain and each becomes equally annoyed on finding by degrees that they were in error the reaction takes place and they then underrate as much as before they had overrated each other now if two young people marry without this violence of passion they do not expect to find each other perfect and perhaps have a better chance of happiness i dont agree with you thought gascoigne but as you appear to be as fond of argument as my friend jack i shall make no reply lest there be no end to the story don rebiera proceeded my mother finding that my father preferred his closet and his books to gaiety and dissipation soon left him to himself and amused herself after her own fashion but not until i was born which was ten months after their marriage my father was confiding and pleased that my mother should be amused he indulged her in everything time flew on and i had arrived at my fifteenth year and came home from my studies it being intended that i should enter the army which you are aware is generally the only profession embraced in this country by the heirs of noble families of course i knew little of what had passed at home but still i had occasionally heard my mother spoken lightly of when i was not supposed to be present and i always heard my fathers name mentioned with compassion as if an illused man but i knew nothing more still this was quite sufficient for a young man whose blood boiled at the idea of anything like a stigma being cast upon his family i arrived at my fathersi found him at his books i paid my respects to my mother i found her with her confessor i disliked the man at first sight he was handsome certainly his forehead was high and white his eyes large and fiery and his figure commanding but there was a dangerous proud look about him which disgusted menothing like humility or devotion i might have admired him as an officer commanding a regiment of cavalry but as a churchman he appeared to be most misplaced she named me with kindness but he appeared to treat me with disdain he spoke authoritatively to my mother who appeared to yield implicitly and i discovered that he was lord of the whole household my mother too it was said had given up gaieties and become devout i soon perceived more than a common intelligence between them and before i had been two months at home i had certain proofs of my fathers dishonour and what was still more unfortunate for me they were aware that such was the case my first impulse was to acquaint my father but on consideration i thought it better to say nothing provided i could persuade my mother to dismiss father ignatio i took an opportunity when she was alone to express my indignation at her conduct and to demand his immediate dismissal as a condition of my not divulging her crime she appeared frightened and gave her consent but i soon found that her confessor had more power with her than i had and he remained i now resolved to acquaint my father and i roused him from his studies that he might listen to his shame i imagined that he would have acted calmly and discreetly but on the contrary his violence was without bounds and i had the greatest difficulty from preventing his rushing with his sword to sacrifice them both at last he contented himself by turning father ignatio out of the house in the most ignominious manner and desiring my mother to prepare for seclusion in a convent for the remainder of her days but he fell their victim three days afterwards as my mother was by his directions about to be removed he was seized with convulsions and died i need hardly say that he was carried off by poison this however could not be established till long afterwards before he died he seemed to be almost supernaturally prepared for an event which never came into my thoughts he sent for another confessor who drew up his confession in writing at his own request and afterwards inserted it in his will my mother remained in the house and father ignatio had the insolence to return i ordered him away and he resisted he was turned out by the servants i had an interview with my mother who defied me and told me that i should soon have a brother to share in the succession i felt that if so it would be the illegitimate progeny of her adultery and told her my opinion she expressed her rage in the bitterest curses and i left her shortly afterwards she quitted the house and retired to another of our country seats where she lived with father ignatio as before about four months afterwards formal notice was sent to me of the birth of a brother but as when my fathers will was opened he there had inserted his confession or the substance of it in which he stated that aware of my mothers guilt and supposing that consequences might ensue he solemnly declared before god that he had for years lived apart i cared little for this communication i contented myself with replying that as the child belonged to the church it had better be dedicated to its service i had however soon reason to acknowledge the vengeance of my mother and her paramour one night i was attacked by bravos and had i not fortunately received assistance i should have forfeited my life as it was i received a severe wound against attempts of that kind i took every precaution in future but still every attempt was made to ruin my character as well as to take my life a young sister disappeared from a convent in my neighbourhood and on the ground near the window from which she descended was found a hat recognised to be mine i was proceeded against and notwithstanding the strongest interest it was with difficulty that the affair was arranged although i had incontestably proved an alibi a young man of rank was found murdered with a stiletto known to be mine buried in his bosom and it was with difficulty that i could establish my innocence part of a banditti had been seized and on being asked the name of their chief when they received absolution they confessed that i was the chief of the band everything that could be attempted was put into practice and if i did not lose my life at all events i was avoided by almost everybody as a dangerous and doubtful character at last a nobleman of rank the father of don scipio whom you disarmed was assassinated the bravos were taken and they acknowledged that i was the person who hired them i defended myself but the king imposed upon me a heavy fine and banishments i had just received the order and was crying out against the injustices and lamenting my hard fate as i sat down to dinner latterly aware of what my enemies would attempt i had been accustomed to live much alone my faithful valet pedro was my only attendant i was eating my dinner with little appetite and had asked for some wine pedro went to the buffet behind him to give me what i required accidentally i lifted up my head and there being a large pierglass opposite to me i saw the figure of my valet and that he was pouring a powder in the flagon of wine which he was about to present to me i recollected the hat being found at the nunnery and also the stiletto in the body of the young man like lightning it occurred to me that i had been fostering the viper who had assisted to destroy me he brought me the flagon i rose locked the door and drawing my sword i addressed himvillain i know thee down on your knees for your life is forfeited he turned pale trembled and sank upon his knees now then continued i you have but one chance either drink off this flagon of wine or i pass my sword through your body he hesitated and i put the point to his breasteven pierced the flesh a quarter of an inch drink cried i is it so very unjust an order to tell you to drink old wine drink continued i or my sword does its duty he drank and would then have quitted the room no no said i you remain here and the wine must have its effect if i have wronged you i will make amends to youbut i am suspicious in about a quarter of an hour during which time i paced up and down the room with my sword drawn my servant fell down and cried in mercy to let him have a priest i sent for my own confessor and he then acknowledged that he was an agent of my mother and father ignatio and had been the means of making it appear that i was the committer of all the crimes and murders which had been perpetrated by them with a view to my destruction a strong emetic having been administered to him he partially revived and was taken to palermo where he gave his evidence before he expired when this was made known the king revoked his sentence apologised to me and i found that once more i was visited and courted by everybody my mother was ordered to be shut up in a convent where she died i trust in grace and father ignatio fled to italy and i have been informed is since dead having thus rid myself of my principal enemies i considered myself safe i married the lady whom you have just seen and before my eldest son was born don silvio for such was the name given to my asserted legitimate brother came of age and demanded his succession had he asked me for a proper support as my uterine brother i should not have refused but that the son of friar ignatio who had so often attempted my life should in case of my decease succeed to the title and estates was not to be borne a lawsuit was immediately commenced which lasted four or five years during which don silvio married and had a son that young man whom you heard me address by the same name but after much litigation it was decided that my fathers confessor and will had proved his illegitimacy and the suit was in my favour from that time to this there has been a constant enmity don silvio refused all my offers of assistance and followed me with a pertinacity which often endangered my life at last he fell by the hands of his own agents who mistook him for me don silvio died without leaving any provision for his family his widow i pensioned and his son i have had carefully brought up and have indeed treated most liberally but he appears to have imbibed the spirit of his father and no kindness has been able to embue him with gratitude he had lately been placed by me in the army where he found out my two sons and quarrelled with them both upon slight pretence but in both instances he was wounded and carried off the field my two sons have been staying with me these last two months and did not leave till yesterday this morning don silvio accompanied by don scipio came to the house and after accusing me of being the murderer of both their parents drew their rapiers to assassinate me my wife and child hearing the noise came down to my assistanceyou know the rest chapter xxi in which our hero is brought up all standing under a press of sail our limits will not permit us to relate all that passed during our heros stay of a fortnight at don rebieras he and gascoigne were treated as if they were his own sons and the kindness of the female part of the family was equally remarkable agnes naturally perhaps showed a preference or partiality for jack to which gascoigne willingly submitted as he felt that our hero had a prior and stronger claim and during the time that they remained a feeling of attachment was created between agnes and the philosopher which if not love was at least something very near akin to it but the fact was that they were both much too young to think of marriage and although they walked and talked and laughed and played together they were always at home in time for their dinner still the young lady thought she preferred our hero even to her brothers and jack thought that the young lady was the prettiest and kindest girl that he had ever met with at the end of the fortnight our two midshipmen took their leave furnished with letters of recommendation to many of the first nobility in palermo and mounted on two fine mules with bell bridles the old donna kissed them boththe don showered down his blessings of good wishes and donna agnes lips trembled as she bade them adieu and as soon as they were gone she went up to her chamber and wept jack also was very grave and his eyes moistened at the thoughts of leaving agnes neither of them were aware until the hour of parting how much they had wound themselves together the first quarter of an hour our two midshipmen followed their guide in silence jack wished to be left to his own thoughts and gascoigne perceived it well easy said gascoigne at last if i had been in your place constantly in company of and loved by that charming girl i could never have torn myself away loved by her ned replied jack what makes you say that because i am sure it was the case she lived but in your presence why if you were out of the room she never spoke a word but sat there as melancholy as a sick monkeythe moment you came in again she beamed out as glorious as the sun and was all life and spirit i thought people were always melancholy when they were in love replied jack when those that they love are out of their presence well then i am out of her presence and i feel very melancholy so i suppose by your argument i am in love can a man be in love without knowing it i really cannot say jack i never was in love myself but ive seen many others spoony my time will come i suppose byandbye they say that for every man made there is a woman also made to fit him if he could only find her now its my opinion that you have found yoursill lay my life shes crying at this moment do you really think so ned lets go backpoor little agneslets go back i feel i do love her and ill tell her so pooh nonsense its too late now you should have told her that before when you walked with her in the garden but i did not know it ned however as you say it would be foolish to turn back so ill write to her from palermo here an argument ensued upon love which we shall not trouble the reader with as it was not very profound both sides knowing very little on the subject it did however end with our hero being convinced that he was desperately in love and he talked about giving up the service as soon as he arrived at malta it is astonishing what sacrifices midshipmen will make for the objects of their adoration it was not until late in the evening that our adventurers arrived at palermo as soon as they were lodged at the hotel gascoigne sat down and wrote a letter in their joint names to don rebiera returning him many thanks for his great kindness informing him of their safe arrival and trusting that they should soon meet again and jack took up his pen and indicted a letter in spanish to agnes in which he swore that neither tide nor time nor water nor air nor heaven nor earth nor the first lieutenant nor his father nor absence nor death itself should prevent him from coming back and marrying her the first convenient opportunity begging her to refuse a thousand offers as come back he would although there was no saying when it was a perfect love letter that is to say it was the essence of nonsense but that made it perfect for the greater the love the greater the folly these letters were consigned to the man who was sent as their guide and also had to return with the mules he was liberally rewarded and as jack told him to be very careful of his letter the italian naturally concluded that it was to be delivered clandestinely and he delivered it accordingly at a time when agnes was walking in the garden thinking of our hero nothing was more opportune than the arrival of the letter agnes ran to the pavilion read it over twenty times kissed it twenty times and hid it in her bosom sat for a few minutes in deep and placid thought took the letter out of its receptacle and read it over and over again it was very bad spanish and very absurd but she thought it delightful poetical classical sentimental argumentative convincing incontrovertible imaginative and even grammatical for if it was not good spanish there was no spanish half so good alas agnes was indeed unsophisticated to be in such ecstasies with a midshipmans love letter once more she hastened to her room to weep but it was from excess of joy and delight the reader may think agnes silly but he must take into consideration the climate and that she was not yet fifteen our young gentlemen sent for a tailor and each ordered a new suit of clothes they delivered their letters of recommendation and went to the banker to whom they were addressed by don rebiera i shall draw for ten pounds jack said gascoigne on the strength of the shipwreck i shall tell the truth all except that we forgot to ask for leave which i shall leave out and i am sure the story will be worth ten pounds what shall you draw for jack i shall draw for two hundred pounds replied jack i mean to have a good cruise while i can but will your governor stand that easy to be sure he will then youre righthe is a philosopheri wish hed teach mine for he hates the sight of a bill then dont you draw nedi have plenty for both if every man had his equal share and rights in the world you would be as able to draw as much as i and as you cannot upon the principles of equality you shall have half i really shall become a convert to your philosophy jack it does not appear to be so nonsensical as i thought it at all events it has saved my old governor ten pounds which he can ill afford as a colonel on halfpay on their return to the inn they found don philip and don martin to whom don rebiera had written who welcomed them with open arms they were two very fine young men of eighteen and nineteen who were finishing their education in the army jack asked them to dinner and they and our hero soon became inseparable they took him to all the theatres the conversaziones of all the nobility and as jack lost his money with good humour and was a very handsome fellow he was everywhere well received and was made much of many ladies made love to him but jack was only very polite because he thought more and more of agnes every day three weeks passed away like lightning and neither jack nor gascoigne thought of going back at last one fine day hm frigate aurora anchored in the bay and jack and gascoigne who were at a party at the duke of pentaros met with the captain of the aurora who was also invited the duchess introduced them to captain tartar who imagining them from their being in plain clothes to be young englishmen of fortune on their travels was very gracious and condescending jack was so pleased with his urbanity that he requested the pleasure of his company to dinner the next day captain tartar accepted the invitation and they parted shaking hands with many expressions of pleasure in having made his acquaintance jacks party was rather large and the dinner sumptuous the sicilian gentlemen did not drink much wine but captain tartar liked his bottle and although the rest of the company quitted the table to go to a ball given that evening by the marquesa novara jack was too polite not to sit it out with the captain gascoigne closed his chair to jacks who he was afraid being a little affected with the wine would let the cat out of the bag the captain was amazingly entertaining jack told him how happy he should be to see him at forest hill which property the captain discovered to contain six thousand acres of land and also that jack was an only son and captain tartar was quite respectful when he found that he was in such very excellent company the captain of the frigate inquired of jack what brought him out here and jack whose prudence was departing told him that he came in his majestys ship harpy gascoigne gave jack a nudge but it was of no use for as the wine got into jacks brain so did his notions of equality oh wilson gave you a passage hes an old friend of mine so he is of ours replied jack hes a devilish good sort of a fellow wilson but where have you been since you came out inquired captain tartar in the harpy replied jack to be sure i belong to her you belong to her in what capacity may i ask inquired captain tartar in a much less respectful and confidential tone midshipman replied jack so is mr gascoigne umph you are on leave then no indeed replied jack ill tell you how it is my dear fellow excuse me for one moment replied captain tartar rising up i must give some directions to my servant which i forgot captain tartar hailed his coxswain out of the window gave orders just outside of the door and then returned to the table in the meantime gascoigne who expected a breeze had been cautioning jack in a low tone at intervals when captain tartars back was turned but it was useless the extra quantity of wine had got into jacks head and he cared nothing for gascoignes remonstrance when the captain resumed his seat at the table jack gave him the true narrative of all that had passed to which his guest paid the greatest attention jack wound up his confidence by saying that in a week or so he should go back to don rebiera and propose for donna agnes ah exclaimed captain tartar drawing his breath with astonishment and compressing his lip tartar the wine stands with you said jack allow me to help you captain tartar threw himself back in his chair and let all the air out of his chest with a sort of whistle as if he could hardly contain himself have you had wine enough said jack very politely if so we will go to the marquesas the coxswain came to the door touched his hat to the captain and looked significantly and so sir cried captain tartar in a voice of thunder rising from his chair youre a dd runaway midshipman who if you belonged to my ship instead of marrying donna agnes i would marry you to the gunners daughter by gd two midshipmen sporting plain clothes in the best society in palermo and having the impudence to ask a postcaptain to dine with them to ask me and address me as tartar and my dear fellow you infernal young scamps continued captain tartar now boiling with rage and striking his fist on the table so as to set all the glasses waltzing allow me to observe sir said jack who was completely sobered by the address that we do not belong to your ship and that we are in plain clothes in plain clothesmidshipmen in muftiyes you are so a couple of young swindlers without a sixpence in your pocket passing yourselves off as young men of fortune and walking off through the window without paying your bill do you mean to call me a swindler sir replied jack yes sir you then you lie exclaimed our hero in a rage i am a gentleman siri am sorry i cannot pay you the same compliment the astonishment and rage of captain tartar took away his breath he tried to speak but could nothe gasped and gasped and then sat or almost fell down in his chairat last he recovered himself matthewsmatthews sir replied the coxswain who had remained at the door the sergeant of marines here he is sir the sergeant entered and raised the back of his hand to his hat bring your marines intake charge of these two directly you are on board put them both legs in irons the marines with their bayonets walked in and took possession of our hero and gascoigne perhaps sir replied jack who was now cool again you will permit us to pay our bill before we go on board we are no swindlers and it is rather a heavy oneor as you have taken possession of our persons you will perhaps do us the favour to discharge it yourself and jack threw on the table a heavy purse of dollars i have only to observe captain tartar that i wish to be very liberal to the waiters sergeant let them pay their bill said captain tartar in a more subdued tone taking his hat and sword and walking out of the room by heavens easy what have you doneyou will be tried by a courtmartial and turned out of the service i hope so replied jack i was a fool to come into it but he called me a swindler and i would give the same answer tomorrow if you are ready gentlemen said the sergeant who had been long enough with captain tartar to be aware that to be punished by him was no proof of fault having been committed i will go and pack up our things easy while you pay the bill said gascoigne marine you had better come with me in less than half an hour our hero and his comrade instead of finding themselves at the marquesas ball found themselves very comfortably in irons under the halfdeck of his majestys frigate aurora we shall leave them and return to captain tartar who had proceeded to the ball to which he had been invited on his entering he was accosted by don martin and don philip who inquired what had become of our hero and his friend captain tartar who was in no very good humour replied briskly that they were on board his ship in irons in irons for what exclaimed don philip because sir they are a couple of young scamps who have introduced themselves into the best company passing themselves off as people of consequence when they are only a couple of midshipmen who have run away from their ship now the rebieras knew very well that jack and his friend were midshipmen but this did not appear to them any reason why they should not be considered as gentlemen and treated accordingly do you mean to say signor said don philip that you have accepted their hospitality laughed talked walked arminarm with them pledged them in wine as we have seen you this evening and after they have confided in you that you have put them in irons yes sir i do replied captain tartar then by heaven you have my defiance and you are no gentleman replied don philip the elder and i repeat my brothers words sir cried don martin the two brothers felt so much attachment for our hero who had twice rendered such signal service to their family that their anger was without bounds in every other service but the english navy there is not that power of grossly insulting and then sheltering yourself under your rank nor is it necessary for the discipline of any service to these young officers if the power did exist the use of such power under such circumstances appeared monstrous and they were determined at all events to show to captain tartar that in society at least it could be resented they collected their friends told them what had passed and begged them to circulate it through the room this was soon done and captain tartar found himself avoided he went up to the marquesa and spoke to her she turned her head the other way he addressed a count he had been conversing with the night beforehe turned short round upon his heel while don philip and don martin walked up and down talking so that he might hear what they said and looking at him with eyes flashing with indignation captain tartar left the ballroom and returned to the inn more indignant than ever when he rose the next morning he was informed that a gentleman wished to speak with him he sent up his card as don ignatio verez colonel commanding the fourth regiment of infantry on being admitted he informed captain tartar that don philip de rebiera wished to have the pleasure of crossing swords with him and requested to know when it would be convenient for captain tartar to meet him it was not in captain tartars nature to refuse a challenge his courage was unquestionable but he felt indignant that a midshipman should be the cause of his getting into such a scrape he accepted the challenge but having no knowledge of the small sword refused to fight unless with pistols to this the colonel raised no objections and captain tartar despatched his coxswain with a note to his second lieutenant for he was not on good terms with his first the meeting took placeat the first fire the ball of don philip passed through captain tartars brain and he instantly fell dead the second lieutenant hastened on board to report the fatal result of the meeting and shortly after don philip and his brother with many of their friends went off in the governors barge to condole with our hero the first lieutenant now captain pro tempore received them graciously and listened to their remonstrances relative to our hero and gascoigne i have never been informed by the captain of the grounds of complaint against the young gentlemen replied he and have therefore no charge to prefer against them i shall therefore order them to be liberated but as i learn that they are officers belonging to one of his majestys ships lying at malta i feel it my duty as i sail immediately to take them there and send them on board of their own ship jack and gascoigne were then taken out of irons and permitted to see don philip who informed them that he had revenged the insult but jack and gascoigne did not wish to go on shore again after what had passed after an hours conversation and assurances of continued friendship don philip his brother and their friends took leave of our two midshipmen and rowed on shore and now we must be serious we do not write these novels merely to amusewe have always had it in our view to instruct and it must not be supposed that we have no other end in view than to make the reader laugh if we were to write an elaborate work telling truths and plain truths confining ourselves only to point out errors and to demand reform it would not be read we have therefore selected this light and trifling species of writing as it is by many denominated as a channel through which we may convey wholesome advice in a palatable shape if we would point out an error we draw a character and although that character appears to weave naturally into the tale of fiction it becomes as much a beacon as it is a vehicle of amusement we consider this to be the true art of novel writing and that crime and folly and error can be as severely lashed as virtue and morality can be upheld by a series of amusing causes and effects that entice the reader to take a medicine which although rendered agreeable to the palate still produces the same internal benefit as if it had been presented to him in its crude state in which it would either be refused or nauseated in our naval novels we have often pointed out the errors which have existed and still do exist in a service which is an honour to its country for what institution is there on earth that is perfect or into which if it once was perfect abuses will not creep unfortunately others have written to decry the service and many have raised up their voices against our writings because they felt that in exposing error we were exposing them but to this we have been indifferent we felt that we were doing good and we have continued to prove that we are correct in asserting that we have done good we will out of several state one single case in the kings own a captain when requested to punish a man instanter for a fault committed replies that he never has and never will punish a man until twentyfour hours after the offence that he may not be induced by the anger of the moment to award a severer punishment than in his cooler moments he might think commensurate and that he wished that the admiralty would give out an order to that effect some time after the publication of that work the order was given by the admiralty forbidding the punishment until a certain time had elapsed after the offence and we had the pleasure of knowing from the first lord of the admiralty of the time that it was in consequence of the suggestion in the novel if our writings had effected nothing else we might still lay down our pen with pride and satisfaction but they have done more much more and while they have amused the reader they have improved the service they have held up in their characters a mirror in which those who have been in error may see their own deformity and many hints which have been given have afterwards returned to the thoughts of those who have had an influence have been considered as their own ideas and have been acted upon the conduct of captain tartar may be considered as a libel on the serviceis it not the fault of captain tartar was not in sending them on board or even putting them in irons as deserters although under the circumstances he might have shown more delicacy the fault was in stigmatising a young man as a swindler and the punishment awarded to the error is intended to point out the moral that such an abuse of power should be severely visited the greatest error now in our service is the disregard shown to the feelings of the junior officers in the language of their superiors that an improvement has taken place i grant but that it still exists to a degree injurious to the service i know too well the articles of war as our hero was informed by his captain were equally binding on officers and crew but what a dead letter do they become if officers are permitted to break them with impunity the captain of a ship will turn the hands up to punishment read the article of war for the transgressing of which the punishment is inflicted and to show at that time their high respect for the articles of war the captain and every officer take off their hats the moment the hands are piped down the second article of war which forbids all swearing etc in derogation of gods honour is immediately disregarded we are not straitlacedwe care little about an oath as a mere expletive we refer now to swearing at others to insulting their feelings grossly by coarse and intemperate language we would never interfere with a man for dg his own eyes but we deny the right of his dg those of another the rank of a master in the service is above that of a midshipman but still the midshipman is a gentleman by birth and the master generally speaking is not even at this moment in the service if the master were to dn the eyes of a midshipman and tell him that he was a liar would there be any redress or if so would it be commensurate to the insult if a midshipman were to request a courtmartial would it be granted certainly not and yet this is a point of more importance than may be conceived our service has been wonderfully improved since the peace and those who are now permitted to enter it must be gentlemen we know that even now there are many who cry out against this as dangerous and injurious to the service as if education spoilt an officer and the scion of an illustrious house would not be more careful to uphold an escutcheon without blemish for centuries than one who has little more than brute courage but those who argue thus are the very people who are injurious to the service for they can have no other reason except that they wish that the juniors may be tyrannised over with impunity be it remembered that these are not the observations of a junior officer smarting under insultthey are the result of deep and calm reflection we have arrived to that grade that although we have the power to inflict we are too high to receive insult but we have not forgotten how our young blood has boiled when wanton reckless and cruel torture has been heaped upon our feelings merely because as a junior officer we were not in a position to retaliate or even to reply and another evil is that this great error is disseminated in observing on it in one of our works called peter simple we have put the following true observation in the mouth of obrien peter observes in his simple rightminded way i should think obrien that the very circumstance of having had your feelings so often wounded by such language when you were a junior officer would make you doubly careful not to use it towards others when you had advanced in the service peter thats just the first feeling which wears away after a time till at last your own sense of indignation becomes blunted and becomes indifferent to it you forget also that you wound the feelings of others and carry the habit with you to the great injury and disgrace of the service let it not be supposed that in making these remarks we want to cause litigation or insubordination on the contrary we assert that this error is the cause and eventually will be much more the cause of insubordination for as the junior officers who enter the service are improved so will they resist it the complaint here is more against the officers than the captains whose power has been perhaps already too much curtailed by late regulations that power must remain for although there may be some few who are so perverted as to make those whom they command uncomfortable in justice to the service we are proud to assert that the majority acknowledge by their conduct that the greatest charm attached to power is to be able to make so many people happy chapter xxii our hero is sick with the service but recovers with proper medicine an argument ending as most do in a blow up mesty lectures upon craniology the day after the funeral hm ship aurora sailed for malta and on her arrival the acting captain sent our two midshipmen on board the harpy without any remark except victualled the day discharged as they had been borne on the ships books as supernumeraries mr james who was acting in the aurora was anxious to join the admiral at toulon and intended to sail the next day he met captain wilson at the governors table and stated that jack and gascoigne had been put in irons by order of captain tartar his suspicions and the report that the duel had in consequence taken place but gascoigne and jack had both agreed that they would not communicate the events of their cruise to anybody on board of the aurora and therefore nothing else was known except that they must have made powerful friends somehow or another and there appeared in the conduct of captain tartar as well as in the whole transaction somewhat of a mystery i should like to know what happened to my friend jack who fought the duel said the governor who had laughed at it till he held his sides wilson do bring him here tomorrow morning and let us have his story i am afraid of encouraging him sir thomas he is much too wild already i told you of his first cruise he has nothing but adventures and they all end too favourably well but you can send for him here and blow him up just as well as in your own cabin and then we will have the truth out of him that you certainly will replied captain wilson for he tells it plainly enough well to oblige me send for him i dont see he was much to blame in absconding as it appears he thought he would be hung i want to see the lad well governor if you wish it replied captain wilson who wrote a note to mr sawbridge requesting he would send mr easy to him at the governors house at ten oclock in the morning jack made his appearance in his uniformhe did not much care for what was said to him as he was resolved to leave the service he had been put in irons and the iron had entered into his soul mr sawbridge had gone on shore about an hour before jack had been sent on board and he had remained on shore all the night he did not therefore see jack but for a few minutes and thinking it his duty to say nothing to him at first or to express his displeasure he merely observed to him that the captain would speak to him as soon as he came on board as gascoigne and our hero did not know how far it might be safe even at malta to acknowledge to what occurred on board the speronare which might get wind they did not even tell their messmates resolving only to confide it to the captain when jack was ushered into the presence of the captain he found him sitting with the governor and the breakfast on the table ready for them jack walked in with courage but respectfully he was fond of captain wilson and wished to show him respect captain wilson addressed him pointed out that he had committed a great error in fighting a duela greater error in demeaning himself by fighting the pursers steward and still greater in running away from his ship jack looked respectfully to captain wilson acknowledged that he had done wrong and promised to be more careful another time if captain wilson would look over it captain wilson allow me to plead for the young gentleman said the governor i am convinced that it has only been an error in judgment well mr easy as you express your contrition and the governor interferes in your behalf i shall take no more notice of this but recollect mr easy that you have occasioned me a great deal of anxiety by your mad pranks and i trust another time you will remember that i am too anxious for your welfare not to be uncomfortable when you run such risks you may now go on board to your duty and tell mr gascoigne to do the same and pray let us hear of no more duels or running away jack whose heart softened at this kind treatment did not venture to speak he made his bow and was about to quit the room when the governor said mr easy you have not breakfasted i have sir replied jack before i came on shore but a midshipman can always eat two breakfasts particularly when his own comes first so sit down and breakfast with usits all over now even if it was not replied captain wilson laughing i doubt whether it would spoil mr easys breakfast come mr easy sit down jack bowed and took his chair and proved that his lecture had not taken away his appetite when breakfast was over captain wilson observed mr easy you have generally a few adventures to speak of when you return will you tell the governor and me what has taken place since you left us certainly sir replied jack but i venture to request that it may be under the promise of secrecy for its rather important to me and gascoigne yes if secrecy is really necessary my boy but im the best judge of that replied the governor jack then entered into a detail of his adventures which we have already described much to the astonishment of the governor and his captain and concluded his narration by stating that he wanted to leave the service he hoped that captain wilson would discharge him and send him home pooh nonsense said the governor you shant leave the mediterranean while i am here no noyou must have more adventures and come back and tell them to me and recollect my lad that whenever you come to malta there is a bed at the governors house and a seat at his table always ready for you you are very kind sir thomas replied jack but no buts at all siryou shant leave the service besides recollect that i can ask for leave of absence for you to go and see donna agnes ay and send you there too captain wilson also remonstrated with our hero and he gave up the point it was harsh treatment which made him form the resolution it was kindness which overcame it with your permission captain wilson mr easy shall dine with us today and bring gascoigne with him you shall first scold him and ill console him with a good dinner and boy dont be afraid to tell your story everywhere sit down and tell it at nix mangare stairs if you please im governor here jack made his obeisance and departed the lad must be treated kindly captain wilson said the governor he would be a loss to the service good heavens what adventures and how honestly he tells everything i shall ask him to stay with me for the time you are here if you will allow me i want to make friends with himhe must not leave the service captain wilson who felt that kindness and attention would be more effectual with our hero than any other measures gave his consent to the governors proposition so jack ate at the governors table and took lessons in spanish and italian until the harpy had been refitted after heaving down before she was ready a vessel arrived from the fleet directing captain wilson to repair to mahon and send a transport lying there to procure live bullocks for the fleet jack did not join his ship very willingly but he had promised the governor to remain in the service and he went on board the evening before she sailed he had been living so well that he had at first a horror of midshipmans fare but a good appetite seasons everything and jack soon complained that there was not enough he was delighted to see jolliffe and mesty after so long an absence he laughed at the boatswains cheeks inquired after the pursers stewards shotholes shook hands with gascoigne and his other messmates gave vigors a thrashing and then sat down to supper ah massa easy why you take a cruise without me said mesty dat very shabby by de power but i wish i was there you ab too much danger massa easy without mesty anyhow the next day the harpy sailed and jack went to his duty mr asper borrowed ten pounds and our hero kept as much watch as he pleased which as watching did not please him was very little mr sawbridge had long conversations with our hero pointing out to him the necessity of discipline and obedience in the service and that there was no such thing as equality and that the rights of man secured to everyone the property which he held in possession according to your ideas mr easy a man has no more right to his wife than anything else and any other man may claim her jack thought of agnes and he made matrimony an exception as he continued to argue the point but although he argued still his philosophy was almost upset at the idea of any one disputing with him the rights of man with respect to agnes the harpy made the african coast the wind continued contrary and they were baffled for many days at last they espied a brig under the land about sixteen miles off her rig and appearance made captain wilson suspect that she was a privateer of some description or another but it was calm and they could not approach her nevertheless captain wilson thought it his duty to examine her so at ten oclock at night the boats were hoisted out as this was merely intended for a reconnoitre for there was no saying what she might be mr sawbridge did not go mr asper was in the sick list so mr smallsole the master had the command of the expedition jack asked mr sawbridge to let him have charge of one of the boats mr jolliffe and mr vigors went in the pinnace with the master the gunner had the charge of one cutter and our hero had the command of the other jack although not much more than seventeen was very strong and tall for his age indeed he was a man grown and shaved twice aweek his only object in going was to have a yarn for the governor when he returned to malta mesty went with him and as the boat shoved off gascoigne slipped in telling jack that he was come to take care of him for which considerate kindness jack expressed his warmest thanks the orders to the master were very explicit he was to reconnoitre the vessel and if she proved heavily armed not to attack for she was embayed and could not escape the harpy as soon as there was wind if not armed he was to board her but he was to do nothing till the morning the reason for sending the boats away so soon was that the men might not suffer from the heat of the sun during the daytime which was excessive and had already put many men on the sick list the boats were to pull to the bottom of the bay not to go so near as to be discovered and then drop their grapnels till daylight the orders were given to mr smallsole in presence of the other officers who were appointed to the boats that there might be no mistake and the boats then shoved off after a three hours pull they arrived to where the brig lay becalmed and as they saw no lights moving on board they supposed they were not seen they dropped their grapnels in about seven fathoms water and waited for daylight when jack heard captain wilsons orders that they were to lie at anchor till daylight he had sent down mesty for fishinglines as fresh fish is always agreeable in a midshipmans berth he and gascoigne amused themselves this way and as they pulled up the fish they entered into an argument and mr smallsole ordered them to be silent the point which they discussed was relative to boat service gascoigne insisted that the boats should all board at oncewhile our hero took it into his head that it was better they should come up one after another a novel idea but jacks ideas on most points were singular if you throw your whole force upon the decks at once you overpower them observed gascoigne if you do not you are beaten in detail very true replied jack supposing that you have an overpowering force or they are not prepared but recollect that if they are the case is altered for instance as to firearmsthey fire theirs at the first boat and they have not time to reload when the second comes up with its fire reserved every fresh boat arriving adds to the courage of those who have boarded and to the alarm of those who defend the men come on fresh and fresh depend upon it gascoigne there is nothing like a corps de reserve will you keep silence in your boat mr easy or will you not cried the master youre a disgrace to the service sir thank ye sir replied jack in a low tone ive another bite ned jack and his comrade continued to fish in silence till the day broke the mist rolled off the stagnant water and discovered the brig who as soon as she perceived the boats threw out the french tricolour and fired a gun of defiance mr smallsole was undecided the gun fired was not a heavy one and so mr jolliffe remarked the men as usual anxious for the attack asserted the same and mr smallsole afraid of retreating from the enemy and being afterwards despised by the ships company ordered the boats to weigh their grapnels stop a moment my lads said jack to his men ive got a bite the men laughed at jacks taking it so easy but he was their pet and they did stop for him to pull up his fish intending to pull up to the other boats and recover their loss of a few seconds ive hooked him now said jack you may up with the grapnel while i up with the fish but this delay gave the other boats a start of a dozen strokes of their oars which was a distance not easy to be regained they will be aboard before us sir said the coxswain never mind that replied jack someone must be last but not the boat i am in replied gascoigne if i could help it i tell you replied jack we shall be the corps de reserve and have the honour of turning the scale in our favour give way my lads cried gascoigne perceiving the other boats still kept their distance ahead of them which was about a cables length gascoigne i command the boat said jack and i do not wish my men to board without any breath in their bodiesthats a very unwise plan a steady pull my lads and not too much exertion by heavens theyll take the vessel before we get alongside even if they should i am right am i not mesty yes massa easy you very rightsuppose they take vessel without you they no want yousuppose they want you you come and the negro who had thrown his jacket off bared his arm as if he intended mischief the first cutter commanded by the gunner now gained upon the launch and was three boatslengths ahead of her when she came alongside the brig poured in her broadsideit was well directed and down went the boat cutters sunk exclaimed gascoigne by heavens give way my men now dont you observe that had we all three been pulling up together the broadside would have sunk us all said jack very composedly theres board in the launchgive way my men give way said gascoigne stamping with impatience the reception was evidently warm by the time that the launch had poured in her men the second cutter was close under the brigs quartertwo more strokes and she was alongside when of a sudden a tremendous explosion took place on the deck of the vessel and bodies and fragments were hurled up in the air so tremendous was the explosion that the men of the second cutter as if transfixed simultaneously stopped pulling their eyes directed to the volumes of smoke which poured through the ports and hid the whole of the masts and rigging of the vessel nows your time my lads give way and alongside cried our hero the men reminded by his voice obeyedbut the impetus already given to the boat was sufficient before they could drop their oars in the water they grazed against the vessels sides and following jack were in a few seconds on the quarterdeck of the vessel a dreadful sight presented itselfthe whole deck was black and corpses lay strewed their clothes on them still burning and among the bodies lay fragments of what once were men the capstern was unshipped and turned over on its sidethe binnacles were in remnants and many of the ropes ignited there was not one person left on deck to oppose them as they afterwards learned from some of the men who had saved their lives by remaining below the french captain had seen the boats before they anchored and had made every preparation he had filled a large ammunition chest with cartridges for the guns that they might not have to hand them up the conflict between the men of the pinnace and the crew of the vessel was carried on near the capstern and a pistol fired had accidentally communicated with the powder which blew up in the very centre of the dense and desperate struggle the first object was to draw water and extinguish the flames which were spreading over the vessel as soon as that was accomplished our hero went aft to the taffrail and looked for the cutter which had been sunk gascoigne jump into the boat with four meni see the cutter floats a quarter of a mile astern there may be someone alive yet i think now i see a head or two gascoigne hastened away and soon returned with three of the cutters men the rest had sunk probably killed or wounded by the discharge of the broadside thank god theres three saved said jack for we have lost too many we must now see if any of these poor fellows are yet alive and clear the decks of the remnants of those who have been blown to pieces i say ned where should we have been if we had boarded with the pinnace you always fall upon your feet easy replied gascoigne but that does not prove that you are right i see theres no convincing you ned you are so confoundedly fond of argument however ive no time to argue nowwe must look to these poor fellows some are still alive body after body was thrown through the ports the habiliments in most cases enabling them to distinguish whether it was that of a departed friend or foe jack turned round and observed mesty with his foot on a head which had been blown from the trunk what are you about mesty massa easy i look at dis and i tink it massa vigors head and den i tink dis skull of his enemy nice present make to little massa gossett and den i tink again and i say no he dead and nebber thrash any moreso let him go overboard jack turned away forgiving vigors in his heart he thought of the petty animosities of a midshipmans berth as he looked at the blackened portion of a body half an hour before possessing intellect massa easy said mesty i tink you say right anyhow when you say forgive den massa vigors continued mesty taking up the head by the singed hair and tossing it out of the port you really very bad manbut ashantee forgive you heres somebody alive said gascoigne to jack examining a body the face of which was black as a cinder and not to be recognised and he is one of our men too by his dress our hero went up to examine and to assist gascoigne in disengaging the body from a heap of ropes and halfburnt tarpaulings with which it was entangled mesty followed and looking at the lower extremities said massa easy dat massa jolliffe i know him trousers marine tailor say he patch um for ever and so old dat de thread no hold yesterday he had dis patch put in and marine tailor say he be dn if he patch anymore please nobody mesty was right it was poor jolliffe whose face was burnt as black as a coal by the explosion he had also lost three fingers of the left hand but as soon as he was brought out on the deck he appeared to recover and pointed to his mouth for water which was instantly procured mesty said jack i leave you in charge of mr jolliffe take every care of him till i can come back the investigation was then continued and four english sailors found who might be expected to recover as well as about the same number of frenchmen the remainder of the bodies were then thrown overboard the hat only of the master was picked up between the guns and there were but eleven frenchmen found below the vessel was the franklin a french privateer of ten guns and sixtyfive men of which eight men were away in prizes the loss on the part of the vessel was fortysix killed and wounded on that of the harpy it was five drowned in the cutter and eighteen blown up belonging to the pinnace out of which total of twentythree they had only mr jolliffe and five seamen alive the harpy is standing in with a breeze from the offing said gascoigne to easy so much the better for i am sick of this ned there is something so horrible in it and i wish i was on board again i have just been to jolliffe he can speak a little i think he will recover i hope so poor fellow he will then obtain his promotion for he is the commanding officer of all us who are left and if he does replied gascoigne he can swear that it was by having been blown up which spoilt his beautybut here comes the harpy i have been looking for an english ensign to hoist over the french but cannot find one so i hoist a wheft over itthat will do the harpy was soon hoveto close to the brig and jack went on board in the cutter to report what had taken place captain wilson was much vexed and grieved at the loss of so many men fresh hands were put in the cutter to man the pinnace and he and sawbridge both went on board to witness the horrible effects of the explosion as described by our hero jolliffe and the wounded men were taken on board and all of them recovered we have before stated how disfigured the countenance of poor mr jolliffe had been by the smallpoxso severely was it burned that the whole of the countenance came off in three weeks like a mask and every one declared that seamed as it still was mr jolliffe was better looking than he was before it may be as well here to state that mr jolliffe not only obtained his promotion but a pension for his wounds and retired from the service he was still very plain but as it was known that he had been blown up the loss of his eye as well as the scars on his face were all put down to the same accident and he excited interest as a gallant and maimed officer he married and lived contented and happy to a good old age the harpy proceeded with her prize to mahon jack as usual obtained a great deal of credit whether he deserved it or whether as gascoigne observed he always fell upon his feet the reader may decide from our narrative perhaps there was a little of both the seamen of the harpy if summoned in a hurry used very often to reply stop a minute ive got a bite as for jack he often said to himself i have a famous good yarn for the governor chapter xxiiii jack goes on another cruiselove and diplomacyjack proves himself as clever for three and upsets all the arrangements of the high contracting powers a few days after the arrival of the harpy at port mahon a cutter came in with despatches from the admiral captain wilson found that he was posted into the aurora frigate in which a vacancy had been made by the result of our heros transgressions mr sawbridge was raised to the rank of commander and appointed to the command of the harpy the admiral informed captain wilson that he must detain the aurora until the arrival of another frigate hourly expected and then she would be sent down to mahon for him to take the command of her further he intimated that a supply of live bullocks would be very agreeable and begged that he would send to tetuan immediately captain wilson had lost so many officers that he knew not whom to send indeed now he was no longer in command of the harpy and there was but one lieutenant and no master or masters mate gascoigne and jack were the only two serviceable midshipmen and he was afraid to trust them on any expedition in which expedition was required what shall we do sawbridge shall we send easy or gascoigne or both or neitherfor if the bullocks are not forthcoming the admiral will not let them off as we do we must send somebody wilson replied captain sawbridge and it is the custom to send two officers as one receives the bullocks on board while the other attends to the embarkation well then send both sawbridge but lecture them well first i dont think they can get into any mischief there replied sawbridge and its such a hole that they will be glad to get away from it easy and gascoigne were summoned listened very respectfully to all captain sawbridge said promised to conduct themselves with the utmost propriety received a letter to the viceconsul and were sent with their hammocks and chests in the cabin on board the eliza ann brig of two hundred and sixteen tons chartered by governmentthe master and crew of which were all busy forward heaving up their anchors the master of the transport came aft to receive them he was short redhaired young man with hands as broad as the flappers of a turtle he was broadfaced broadshouldered well freckled and pugnosed but if not very handsome he was remarkably good humoured as soon as the chests and hammocks were on deck he told them that when he could get the anchor up and make sail he would give them some bottled porter jack proposed that he should get the porter up and they would drink it while he got the anchor up as it would save time it may save time mayhap but it wont save porter replied the master however you shall have it he called the boy ordered him to bring up the porter and then went forward jack made the boy bring up two chairs put the porter on the companion hatch and he and gascoigne sat down the anchor was weighed and the transport ran out under her foretopsail as they were lighthanded and had to secure the anchor the transport passed within ten yards of the harpy and captain sawbridge when he perceived the two midshipmen taking it so very easy sitting in their chairs with their legs crossed arms folded and their porter before them had a very great mind to order the transport to heaveto but he could spare no other officer so he walked away saying to himself therell be another yarn for the governor or im mistaken as soon as sail was made on the transport the master whose name was hogg came up to our hero and asked him how he found the porter jack declared that he never could venture an opinion upon the first bottleso captain hogg well trouble you for a secondafter which they troubled him for a thirdbegged for a fourthmust drink his health in a fifthand finally pointed out the propriety of making up the halfdozen by this time they found themselves rather lightheaded so desiring captain hogg to keep a sharp lookout and not to call them on any account whatever they retired to their hammocks the next morning they awoke late the breeze was fresh and fair they requested captain hogg not to consider the expense as they would pay for all they ate and drank and all he did into the bargain and promised him a fitout when they got to tetuan what with this promise and calling him captain our hero and gascoigne won the masters heart and being a very good tempered fellow they did what they pleased jack also tossed a doubloon to the men for them to drink on their arrival and all the men of the transport were in a transport at jacks coming to reign over them it must be acknowledged that jacks reign was for the most part of it happy and glorious at last they arrived at tetuan and our pylades and orestes went on shore to call upon the viceconsul accompanied by captain hogg they produced their credentials and demanded bullocks the viceconsul was a very young man short and thin and lighthaired his father had held the situation before him and he had been appointed his successor because nobody else had thought the situation worth applying for nevertheless mr hicks was impressed with the immense responsibility of his office it was however a place of some little emolument at this moment and mr hicks had plenty on his hands besides his sister who being the only english lady there set the fashion of the place and usurped all the attention of the gentlemen mariners who occasionally came for bullocks but miss hicks knew her own importance and had successively refused three midshipmen one masters mate and an acting purser african bullocks were plentiful at tetuan but english ladies were scarce moreover she had a pretty little fortune of her own to wit three hundred dollars in a canvas bag left her by her father and entirely at her own disposal miss hicks was very like her brother except that she was more dumpling in her figure with flaxen hair her features were rather pretty and her skin very fair as soon as the preliminaries had been entered into and arrangements made in a small room with bare walls which mr hicks denominated his office they were asked to walk into the parlour to be introduced to the viceconsuls sister miss hicks tossed her head at the two midshipmen but smiled most graciously at captain hogg she knew the relative ranks of midshipman and captain after a short time she requested the honour of captain hoggs company to dinner and begged that he would bring his midshipmen with him at which jack and gascoigne looked at each other and burst out in a laugh and miss hicks was very near rescinding the latter part of her invitation as soon as they were out of the house they told the captain to go on board and get all ready whilst they walked round the town having peeped into every part of it and stared at arabs moors and jews till they were tired they proceeded to the landingplace where they met the captain who informed them that he had done nothing because the men were all drunk with jacks doubloon jack replied that a doubloon would not last for ever and that the sooner they drank it out the better they then returned to the viceconsuls whom they requested to procure for them fifty dozen of fowls twenty sheep and a great many other articles which might be obtained at the place for as jack said they would live well going up to toulon and if there were any of the stock left they would give them to the admiral for jack had taken the precaution to put his fathers philosophy once more to the proof before he quitted mahon as jack gave such a liberal order and the viceconsul cheated him out of at least onethird of what he paid mr hicks thought he could do no less than offer beds to our midshipmen as well as to captain hogg so as soon as dinner was over they ordered captain hogg to go on board and bring their things on shore which he did as the time usual for transports remaining at tetuan before they could be completed with bullocks was three weeks our midshipmen decided upon staying at least so long if they could find anything to do or if they could not doing nothing was infinitely preferable to doing duty so they took up their quarters at the viceconsuls sending for porter and other things which were not to be had but from the transport and jack to prove that he was not a swindler as captain tartar had called him gave captain hogg a hundred dollars on account for captain hogg had a large stock of porter and english luxuries which he had brought out as a venture and of which he had still a considerable portion left as therefore our midshipmen not only were cheated by the viceconsul but they also supplied his table mr hicks was very hospitable and everything was at their service except miss julia who turned up her nose at a midshipman even upon full pay but she made great advances to the captain who on his part was desperately in love so the mate and the men made all ready for the bullocks jack and gascoigne made themselves comfortable and captain hogg made love and thus passed the first week the chamber of easy and gascoigne was at the top of the house and finding it excessively warm gascoigne had forced his way up to the flat roof above for the houses are all built in that way in most mahomedan countries to enable the occupants to enjoy the cool of the evening and sometimes to sleep there those roofs where houses are built next to each other are divided by a wall of several feet to insure that privacy which the mahomedan customs demand gascoigne had not been long up there before he heard the voice of a female singing a plaintive air in a low tone on the other side of the wall gascoigne sang well himself and having a very fine ear he was pleased with the correctness of the notes although he had never heard the air before he leant against the wall smoked his cigar and listened it was repeated again and again at intervals gascoigne soon caught the notes which sounded so clear and pure in the silence of the night at last they ceased and having waited another halfhour in vain our midshipman returned to his bed humming the air which had so pleased his ear it haunted him during his sleep and rang in his ears when he awoke as it is well known any new air that pleases us will do before breakfast was ready gascoigne had put english words to it and sang them over and over again he inquired of the viceconsul who lived in the next house and was answered that it was an old moor who was reported to be wealthy and to have a daughter whom many of the people had asked in marriage but whether for her wealth or for her beauty he could not tell he had however heard that she was very handsome gascoigne made no further inquiries but went out with jack and captain hogg and on board to see the water got in for the bullocks where did you pick up that air gascoigne it is very pretty but i never heard you sing it before gascoigne told him and also what he had heard from mr hicks i am determined jack to see that girl if i can hicks can talk arabic fast enough just ask him the arabic for these wordsdont be afraidi love youi cannot speak your tongue and put them down on paper as they are pronounced jack rallied gascoigne upon his fancy which could end in nothing perhaps not replied gascoigne and i should have cared nothing about it if she had not sung so well i really believe the way to my heart is through my earhowever i shall try tonight and soon find if she has the feeling which i think she has now let us go back im tired of looking at women with garments up to their eyes and men in dirt up to their foreheads as they entered the house they heard an altercation between mr and miss hicks i shall never give my consent julia one of those midshipmen you turn your nose up at is worth a dozen hoggs now if we only knew the price of a hog in this country observed easy we should be able to calculate our exact value ned a hog being an unclean animal is not hush said jack mr hicks replied miss julia i am mistress of myself and my fortune and i shall do as i please depend upon it you shall not julia i consider it my duty to prevent you from making an improper match and as his majestys representative here i cannot allow you to marry this young man mercy on us said gascoigne his majestys representative i shall not ask your consent replied the lady yes but you shall not marry without my consent i have as you know julia from my situation here as one of his majestys corps diplomatick great power and i shall forbid the banns in fact it is only i who can marry you then ill marry elsewhere and what will you do on board of the transport until you are able to be married i shall do as i think proper replied the lady and ill thank you for none of your indelicate insinuations so saying the lady bounced out of the room into her own and our midshipmen then made a noise in the passage to intimate that they had come in they found mr hicks looking very red and viceconsular indeed but he recovered himself and captain hogg making his appearance they went to dinner but miss julia would not make her appearance and mr hicks was barely civil to the captain but he was soon afterwards called out and our midshipmen went into the office to enable the two lovers to meet they were heard then talking together and after a time they said less and their language was more tender let us see whats going on jack said gascoigne and they walked softly so as to perceive the two lovers who were too busy to be on the lookout captain hogg was requesting a lock of his mistresss hair the plump julia could deny him nothing she let fall her flaxen tresses and taking out the scissors cut off a thick bunch from her hair behind which she presented to the captain it was at least a foot and a half long and an inch in circumference the captain took it in his immense hand and thrust it into his coatpocket behind but one thrust down to the bottom would not get it in so he thrust again and again until it was all coiled away like a cable in a tier thats a liberal girl whispered jack she gives by wholesale what it will take some time to retail but here comes mr hicks lets give them warning i like hogg and as she fancies pork she shall have it if i can contrive to help them that night gascoigne went again on the roof and after waiting some time heard the same air repeated he waited until it was concluded and then in a very low tone sung it himself to the words he had arranged for it for some time all was silent and then the singing recommenced but it was not to the same air gascoigne waited until the new air had been repeated several times and then giving full scope to his fine tenor voice sang the first air again it echoed through the silence of the night air and then he waited but in vain the soft voice of the female was heard no more and gascoigne retired to rest this continued for three or four nights gascoigne singing the same airs the ensuing night that he had heard the preceding until at last it appeared that the female had no longer any fear but changed the airs so as to be amused with the repetition of them next evening on the fifth night she sang the first air and our midshipman responding she then sang another until she had sung them all waiting each time for the response the wall was not more than eight feet high and gascoigne now determined with the assistance of jack to have a sight of his unknown songstress he asked captain hogg to bring on shore some inch line and he contrived to make a ladder with three or four poles which were upstairs used for drying linen he fixed them against the wall without noise all ready for the evening it was a beautiful clear moonlight night when he went up accompanied by jack the air was again sung and repeated by gascoigne who then softly mounted the ladder held by jack and raised his head above the wall he perceived a young moorish girl splendidly dressed halflying on an ottoman with her eyes fixed upon the moon whose rays enabled him to observe that she was indeed beautiful she appeared lost in contemplation and gascoigne would have given the world to have divined her thoughts satisfied with what he had seen he descended and singing one of the airs he then repeated the words do not be afraidi love youi cannot speak your language he then sang another of the airs and after he had finished he again repeated the words in arabic but there was no reply he sang the third air and again repeated the words when to his delight he heard an answer in lingua franca can you speak in this tongue yes replied gascoigne i can allah be praised be not afraidi love you i know you not who are you you are not of my people no but i will be anything that you wish i am a frank and an english officer at this reply of gascoigne there was a pause am i then despised said gascoigne no not despised but you are not of my people or of my land speak no more or you will be heard i obey replied gascoigne since you wish it but i shall pine till tomorrows moon i go to dream of you allah protect you how amazingly poetical you were in your language ned said easy when they went down into their room to be sure jack ive read the arabian nights you never saw such eyes in your life what a houri she is is she as handsome as agnes ned twice as handsome by moonlight thats all moonshine and so will be your courting for it will come to nothing not if i can help it why gascoigne what would you do with a wife just exactly what you would do jack i mean my dear ned can you afford to marry not while the old governor lives but i know he has some money in the funds he told me one day that i could not expect more than three thousand pounds you know i have sisters and before you come into that youll have three thousand children thats a large family jack replied gascoigne bursting out into laughter in which our hero joined well you know i only wanted to argue the point with you i know that jack but i think were counting our chickens before they are hatched which is foolish in every other case except when we venture upon matrimony why jack youre becoming quite sensible my wisdom is for my friends my folly for myself goodnight but jack did not go to sleep i must not allow gascoigne to do such a foolish thing thought he marry a dark girl on midshipmans pay if he succeedsget his throat cut if he does not as jack said his wisdom was for his friends and he was so generous that he reserved none for his own occasions miss julia hicks as we before observed set the fashions at tetuan and her style of dress was not unbecoming the moorish women wore large veils or they may be called what you will for their headdresses descend to their heels at times and cover the whole body leaving an eye to peep with and hiding everything else now miss hicks found this much more convenient than the bonnet as she might walk out in the heat of the sun without burning her fair skin and stare at everybody and everything without being stared at in return she therefore never went out without one of these overalls composed of several yards of fine muslin her dress in the house was usually of coloured sarcenet for a small vessel came into the port one day during her fathers lifetime unloaded a great quantity of bales of goods with english marks and as the vessel had gone out in ballast there was a surmise on his part by what means they came into the captains possession he therefore cited the captain up to the governor but the affair was amicably arranged by the viceconsul receiving about one quarter of the cargo in bales of silks and muslins miss hicks had therefore all her dresses of blue green and yellow sarcenet which with the white muslin overall made her as conspicuous as the only frankish lady in the town had a right to be and there was not a dog which barked in tetuan which did not know the sister of the viceconsul although few had seen her face now it occurred to jack as gascoigne was determined to carry on his amour that in case of surprise it would be as well if he dressed himself as miss hicks he proposed it to gascoigne the next morning who approved of the idea and in the course of the day when miss hicks was busy with captain hogg he contrived to abstract one of her dresses and muslin overalls which he could do in safety as there were plenty of them for miss hicks was not troubled with mantuamakers bills when gascoigne went up on the roof the ensuing night he put on the apparel of miss hicks and looked very like her as far as figure went although a little taller he waited for the moorish girl to sing but she did not so he crept up the ladder and looked over the wall when he observed that she was reclining as before in deep thought his head covered with the muslin caught her eye and she gave a faint scream fear not lady said gascoigne it is not the first time that i have beheld that sweet face i sigh for a companion what would i not give to be sitting by your side i am not of your creed tis true but does it therefore follow that we should not love each other the moorish girl was about to reply when gascoigne received an answer from a quarter whence he little expected it it was from the moor himself who hearing his daughters scream had come swiftly up to the roof does the frankish lily wish to mingle her perfumes with the dark violet said he for he had often seen the sister of the viceconsul and he imagined it was she who had come on the roof and ascended the wall to speak with his daughter gascoigne had presence of mind to avail himself of this fortunate mistake i am alone worthy moor replied he pulling the muslin over his face and i pine for a companion i have been charmed by the nightingale on the roof of your dwelling but i thought not to meet the face of a man when i took courage to climb this ladder if the frankish lily will have courage to descend she can sit by the side of the dark violet gascoigne thought it advisable to make no reply fear not said the old moor what is an old man but a woman and the moor brought a ladder which he placed against the wall after a pause gascoigne said it is my fate and he then descended and was led by the moor to the mattress upon which his daughter reclined the moor then took his seat near them and they entered into conversation gascoigne knew quite enough of the viceconsul and his sister to play his part and he thought proper to tell the moor that her brother wished to give her as wife to the captain of the ship whom she abhorred and would take her to a cold and foggy climate that she had been born here and wished to live and die here and would prefer passing her life in his womens apartments to leaving this country at which abdel faza for such was his name felt very amorous he put his hand to his forehead salaamed and told gascoigne that his zenana and all that were in it were hers as well as his house and himself after an hours conversation in which azar his daughter did not join the old moor asked gascoigne to descend into the womens apartment and observing his daughters silence said to her azar you are angry that this frankish houri should come to the apartments of which you have hitherto been sole mistress fear not you will soon be anothers for osman ali has asked thee for his wife and i have listened to his request now osman ali was as old as her father and azar hated him she offered her hand tremblingly and led gascoigne into the zenana the moor attended them to the threshold bowed and left them that gascoigne had time to press his suit and that he did not lose such a golden opportunity may easily be imagined and her fathers communication relative to osman ali very much assisted our midshipmans cause he left the zenana like most midshipmen in love that is a little above quicksilver boiling heat jack who had remained in a state of some suspense all this time was not sorry to hear voices in an amicable tone and in a few minutes afterwards he perceived that gascoigne was ascending the ladder it occurred to our hero that it was perhaps advisable that he should not be seen as the moor in his gallantry might come up the ladder with his supposed lady he was right for abdel faza not only followed her up the ladder on his side but assisted her to descend on the other and with great ceremony took his leave gascoigne hastened to jack who had been peeping and gave him a detail of what had passed describing azar as the most beautiful fascinating and fond creature that ever was created after half an hours relation he stopped short because he discovered that jack was fast asleep the visits of gascoigne were repeated every night old abdel faza became every time more gallant and our midshipman was under the necessity of assuming a virtue if he had it not he pretended to be very modest in the meantime captain hogg continued his attentions to the real miss hicks the mate proceeded to get the bullocks on board and as more than three weeks had already passed away it was time to think of departing for toulon but captain hogg was too much in love and as for gascoigne he intended like all midshipmen in love to give up the service jack reasoned with the captain who appeared to listen to reason because miss hicks had agreed to follow his fortunes and crown his transports in the transport mary ann he therefore proposed that they should get away as fast as they could and as soon as they had weighed the anchor he would come on shore take off miss hicks and make all sail for toulon jack might have suffered this the difficulty was with gascoigne who would not hear of going away without his lovely azar at last jack planned a scheme which he thought would succeed and which would be a good joke to tell the governor he therefore appeared to consent to gascoignes carrying off his little moor and they canvassed how it was to be managed jack then told gascoigne that he had hit upon a plan which would succeed i find said he from captain hogg that he has an intention of carrying off miss hicks and when i sounded him as to his having a lady with him he objected to it immediately saying that he must have all the cabin to himself and his intended now in the first place i have no notion of giving up the cabin to miss hicks or mrs hogg it will be very uncomfortable to be shut out because he wishes to make love i therefore am determined that he shall not take off miss hicks he has proposed to me that he shall go on board and get the brig under way leaving me with a boat on shore to sign the vouchers and that miss hicks shall slip into the boat when i go off at dusk now i will not bring off miss hicks if he wants to marry her let him do it when i am not on board i have paid for everything and i consider the cabin as mine look you ned if you wish to carry off your little moor there is but one way and that is a very simple one leave her a dress of miss hickss when you go there tomorrow night and tell her to slip down at dusk and come out of the house all the danger will be in her own house for as soon as she is out she will be supposed to be the viceconsuls sister and will not be observed or questioned i will look out for and bring her on board instead of miss hicks hogg will have the brig under way and will be too happy to make all sail and she shall lock the cabin inside so that the mistake shall not be discovered till the next morning and we shall have a good laugh at captain hogg gascoigne pronounced that jacks scheme was capital and agreed to it thanking him and declaring that he was the best friend that he ever had so i will be thought jack but you will not acknowledge it at first jack then went to captain hogg and appeared to enter warmly into his views but told him that hicks suspected what was going on and had told him so at the same time declaring that he would not lose sight of his sister until after hogg was on board now says jack you know you cannot do the thing by main force so the best plan will be for you to go on board and get under way leaving me to bring off miss hicks when her brother will imagine all danger to be over many thanks mr easy replied captain hogg it will be capital and ill arrange it all with my sophy how very kind of you but hogg will you promise me secrecy yes replied the captain that gascoigne is a very silly fellow and wants to run away with a girl he has made acquaintance with here and what do you think he has proposed that after the ship was under way that i shall carry her off in the boat and he has borrowed one of the dresses of miss hicks that it may appear to be her i have agreed to it but as i am determined that he shall not commit such a folly i shall bring off miss hicks instead and observe hogg he is that sort of wild fellow that if he was to find that i had cheated him he would immediately go on shore and be left behind therefore we must hand miss hicks down in the cabin and she will lock the door all night so that he may not observe the trick till the next morning and then we shall have a fine laugh at him captain hogg replied it would be an excellent joke as gascoigne did before him now it must be observed that the water and the bullocks and the sheep and fowls were all on board and mr hicks having received his money from jack had very much altered his manner he was barely civil for as he had got all he could out of our hero he was anxious to get rid of him as well as of captain hogg our hero was very indignant at this but as it would not suit his present views pretended not to notice iton the contrary he professed the warmest friendship for the viceconsul and took an opportunity of saying that he could not return his kindness in a better way than by informing him of the plot which had been arranged he then told him of the intended escape of his sister and that he was the person intended to bring her off infamous by heavens cried the viceconsul i shall write to the foreign office on the subject i think said jack it will be much better to do what i shall propose which will end in a hearty laugh and to the confusion of captain hogg do you dress yourself in your sisters clothes and i will bring you off instead of her let him imagine that he has your sister secure i will hand you down to the cabin and do you lock yourself in he cannot sail without my orders and i will not sign the vouchers the next morning we will open the cabindoor and have a good laugh at him desire your boat to be off at daylight to take you on shore and i will then make him proceed to toulon forthwith it will be a capital joke so thought the viceconsul as well as gascoigne and captain hogg he shook hands with jack and was as civil to him as before that night gascoigne left one of miss hickss many dresses with azar who agreed to follow his fortunes and who packed up all the jewels and money she could lay her hands upon poor little child she trembled with fear and delight miss hicks smuggled as she thought a box of clothes on board and in the box was her fortune of three hundred dollars mr hicks laughed in his sleeve so did jack and every one went to bed with expectations that their wishes would be realised after an early dinner captain hogg and gascoigne went on board both squeezing jacks hand as if they were never to see him again and looks of intelligence passed between all the parties as soon as they were out of the door the viceconsul chuckled and miss hicks who thought he chuckled at the idea of having rid himself of captain hogg chuckled still more as she looked at our hero who was her confidant and our hero for reasons known to the reader chuckled more than either of them a little before dark the boat was sent on shore from the brig which was now under way and mr hicks as had been agreed said that he should go into the office and prepare the vouchersthat is put on his sisters clothes miss hicks immediately rose and wishing our hero a pleasant voyage as had been agreed said that she should retire for the night as she had a bad headacheshe wished her brother goodnight and went into her room to wait another hour when our hero having shoved off the boat to deceive the viceconsul was to return meet her in the garden and take her off to the brig our hero then went into the office and assisted the viceconsul who took off all his own clothes and tied them up in a handkerchief intending to resume them after he had gone into the cabin as soon as he was ready jack carried his bundle and led the supposed miss hicks down to the boat they shoved off in a great hurry and jack took an opportunity of dropping mr hickss bundle overboard as soon as they arrived alongside mr hicks ascended and was handed by jack down into the cabin he squeezed jacks hand as he entered saying in a whisper tomorrow morning what a laugh we shall have and then he locked the door in the meantime the boat was hooked on and hoisted up and jack took the precaution to have the dead lights lowered that mr hicks might not be able to ascertain what was going on gascoigne came up to our hero and squeezed his hand im so much obliged to you jack i say tomorrow morning what a laugh we shall have as soon as the boat was up and the mainyard filled captain hogg also came up to our hero shaking him by the hand and thanking him and he too concluded by saying i say mr easy tomorrow morning what a laugh we shall have let those laugh who win thought jack the wind was fair the watch was set the course was steered and all went down to their hammocks and went to sleep waiting for tomorrow morning mr hicks also having nothing better to do went to sleep and by the morning dawn the transport mary ann was more than a hundred miles from the african shore chapter xxiv our hero plays the very devil we must leave the reader to imagine the effect of the next mornings denouement everyone was in a fury except jack who did nothing but laugh the captain wanted to return to obtain miss hicks gascoigne to obtain azar and the viceconsul to obtain his libertybut the wind was foul for their return and jack soon gained the captain on his side he pointed out to him that in the first place if he presumed to return he would forfeit his charter bond in the second he would have to pay for all the bullocks that died in the third that if he wished to take miss hicks as his wife he must not first injure her character by having her on board before the solemnity and lastly that he could always go and marry her whenever he pleased the brother could not prevent him all this was very good advice and the captain became quite calm and rational and set his studdingsails below and aloft as for gascoigne it was no use reasoning with him so it was agreed that he should have satisfaction as soon as they could get on shore again mr hicks was the most violent he insisted that the vessel should return while both jack and the captain refused although he threatened them with the whole foreign office he insisted upon having his clothes but jack replied that they had tumbled overboard as they pulled from the shore he then commanded the mate and men to take the vessel back but they laughed at him and his womans clothes at all events ill have you turned out of the service said he to our hero in his fury i shall be extremely obliged to you said jackand captain hogg was so much amused with the viceconsuls appearance in his sisters clothes that he quite forgot his own disappointment in laughing at his intended brotherinlaw he made friends again with jack who regained his ascendancy and ordered out the porter on the capsternhead they had an excellent dinner but mr hicks refused to join them which however did not spoil the appetite of jack or the captain as for gascoigne he could not eat a mouthful but he drank to excess looking over the rim of his tumbler as if he could devour our hero who only laughed the more mr hicks had applied to the men to lend him some clothes but jack had foreseen that and he was omnipotent there was not a jacket or a pair of trousers to be had for love or money mr hicks then considered it advisable to lower his tone and he applied to captain hogg who begged to be excused without he consented to his marriage with his sister to which mr hicks gave an indignant negative he then applied to gascoigne who told him in a very surly tone to go to hl at last he applied to our hero who laughed and said that he would see him dd first so mr hicks sat down in his petticoats and vowed revenge gascoigne who had drunk much and eaten nothing turned in and went to sleepwhile captain hogg and our hero drank porter on the capstern thus passed the first day and the wind was famously fairthe bullocks lowed the cocks crew the sheep baad and the mary ann made upwards of two hundred miles jack took possession of the other berth in the cabin and his majestys representative was obliged to lie down in his petticoats upon a topsail which lay between decks with a bullock on each side of him who every now and then made a dart at him with their horns as if they knew that it was to him that they were indebted for their embarkation and being destined to drive the scurvy out of the toulon fleet we cannot enter into the details of the passage which as the wind was fair was accomplished in ten days without the loss of a bullock during this time mr hicks condescended to eat without speaking imagining that the hour of retribution would come when they joined the admiral gascoigne gradually recovered himself but did not speak to our hero who continued to laugh and drink porter on the eleventh morning they were in the midst of the toulon fleet and mr hicks smiled exultingly as he passed our hero in his petticoats and wondered that jack showed no signs of trepidation the fleet hoveto jack ran under the admirals stern lowered down his boat and went on board showed his credentials and reported his bullocks the general signal was made there was a fair division of the spoil and then the admiral asked our hero whether the master of the transport had any other stock on board jack replied that he had not but that having been told by the governor of malta that they might be acceptable he had bought a few sheep and some dozen of fowls which were much at his service if he would accept of them the admiral was much obliged to the governor and also to jack for thinking of him but would not of course accept of the stock without paying for them he requested him to send all of them on board that he could spare and then asked jack to dine with him for jack had put on his best attire and looked very much of a gentleman mr easy said the flagcaptain who had been looking at the transport with his glass is that the masters wife on board no sir replied jack its the viceconsul what in petticoats the viceconsul yes the viceconsul of tetuan he came on board in that dress when the brig was under way and i considered it my duty not to delay being aware how very important it was that the fleet should be provided with fresh beef what is all this mr easy said the admiral there has been some trick here you will oblige me by coming into the cabin easy followed the admiral and flagcaptain into the cabin and then boldly told the whole story how he tricked them all it was impossible for either of them to help laughing and when they began to laugh it was almost as impossible to stop mr easy said the admiral at last i do not altogether blame you it appears to me the captain of the transport would have delayed sailing because he was in loveand that mr gascoigne would have stayed behind because he was infatuated independent of the illwill against the english which would have been excited by the abduction of the girl but i think you might have contrived to manage all that without putting the viceconsul in petticoats i acted to the best of my judgment sir replied jack very humbly and altogether you have done well captain malcolm send a boat for the viceconsul mr hicks was too impatient to tell his wrongs to care for his being in his sisters clothes he came on board and although the tittering was great he imagined that it would soon be all in his favour when it was known that he was a diplomatic he told his story and waited for the decision of the admiral which was to crush our hero who stood with the midshipmen on the lee side of the deck but the admiral replied mr hicks in the first place this appears to me to be a family affair concerning the marriage of your sister with which i have nothing to do you went on board of your own free will in womans clothes mr easys orders were positive and he obeyed them it was his duty to sail as soon as the transport was ready you may forward your complaint if you please but as a friend i tell you that it will probably occasion your dismissal for these kind of pranks are not understood at the foreign office you may return to the transport which after she has touched at mahon will proceed again to tetuan the boat is alongside sir mr hicks astonished at the want of respect paid to a viceconsul shoved his petticoats between his legs and went down the side amidst the laughter of the whole of the ships company our hero dined with the admiral and was well received he got his orders to sail that night for minorca and as soon as dinner was over he returned on board where he found captain hogg very busy selling his porter gascoigne walking the deck in a brown studyand mr hicks solus abaft sulking in his petticoats as soon as they were clear of the boats the mary ann hoisted her ensign and made sail and as all the porter was not yet sold jack ordered up a bottle jack was much pleased with the result of his explanation with the admiral and he felt that for once he had not only got into no scrape himself but that he had prevented others gascoigne walked the deck gloomily the fact was that he was very unhappy he had had time to reflect and now that the first violence had subsided he felt that our hero had done him a real service and had prevented him from committing an act of egregious folly and yet he had summoned this friend to meet him in the fieldand such had been his gratitude he would have given the world to recall what had passed and to make friends but he felt ashamed as most people do to acknowledge his error he had however almost made up his mind to it and was walking up and down thinking in what manner he might contrive it when jack who was sitting as usual in a chair by the capstern with his porter by him said to himself now ill lay my life that ned wants to make friends and is ashamed to speak first i may be mistaken and he may fly off at a tangent but even if i am at all events it will not be i who am wrongill try him jack waited till gascoigne passed him again and then said looking kindly and knowingly in his face i say ned will you have a glass of porter gascoigne smiled and jack held out his hand the reconciliation was effected in a moment and the subject of quarrel was not canvassed by either party we shall be at minorca in a day or two observed jack after a while now i shall be glad to get there do you know ned that i feel very much satisfied with myself i have got into no scrape this time and i shall notwithstanding have a good story to tell the governor when i go to malta partly at my expense replied gascoigne why you will figure a little in it but others will figure much more i wonder what has become of that poor girl observed gascoigne who could not refrain from mentioning her what hurts me most is that she must think me such a brute no doubt of that nedtake another glass of porter her father gave me this large diamond the old goatsell it and drink his health with it no ill keep it in memory of his daughter here gascoigne fell into a melancholy reverie and jack thought of agnes in two days they arrived at mahon and found the aurora already there in the command of captain wilson mr hicks had persuaded captain hogg to furnish him with clothes jack having taken off the injunction as soon as he had quitted the admiral mr hicks was aware that if the admiral would not listen to his complaint it was no use speaking to a captain so he remained on board a pensioner upon captain hogg and after our midshipmen quitted the transport they became very good friends mr hicks consented to the match and captain hogg was made happy as for poor azar she had wandered about until she was tired in miss hickss dress and at last returned broken hearted to her fathers and was admitted by abdel faza himself he imagined it was miss hicks and was in transportshe discovered it was his daughter and he was in a fury the next day she went to the zenana of osman ali when jack reported himself he did not tell the history of the elopements that he might not hurt the feelings of gascoigne captain wilson was satisfied with the manner in which he had executed his orders and asked him whether he preferred staying in the harpy or following him into the aurora jack hesitated speak frankly mr easy if you prefer captain sawbridge to me i shall not be affronted no sir replied easy i do not prefer captain sawbridge to you you have both been equally kind to me but i prefer you but the fact is sir that i do not much like to part with gascoigne or or who said the captain smiling with mesty sir you may think me very foolish but i should not be alive at this moment if it had not been for him i do not consider gratitude to be foolish mr easy replied captain wilson mr gascoigne i intend to take with me if he chooses to come as i have a great respect for his father and no fault to find with him that is generally speaking but as for mestywhy he is a good man and as you have behaved yourself very well perhaps i may think of it the next day mesty was included among the boats crew taken with him by captain wilson according to the regulations of the service and appointed to the same situation under the master at arms of the aurora gascoigne and our hero were also discharged into the frigate as our hero never has shown any remarkable predilection for duty the reader will not be surprised at his requesting from captain wilson a few days on shore previous to his going on board of the aurora captain wilson allowed the same licence to gascoigne as they had both been cooped up for some time on board of a transport our hero took up his quarters at the only respectable hotel in the town and whenever he could meet an officer of the aurora he very politely begged the pleasure of his company to dinner jacks reputation had gone before him and the midshipmen drank his wine and swore he was a trump not that jack was to be deceived but upon the principles of equality he argued that it was the duty of those who could afford dinners to give them to those who could not this was a sad error on jacks part but he had not yet learnt the value of money he was such a fool as to think that the only real use of it was to make other people happy it must however be offered in his extenuation that he was a midshipman and a philosopher and not yet eighteen at last jack had remained so long on shore keeping open house and the first lieutenant of the aurora found the officers so much more anxious for leave now that they were at little or no expense that he sent him a very polite message requesting the pleasure of his company on board that evening jack returned an equally polite answer informing the first lieutenant that not being aware that he wished to see him he had promised to accompany some friends to a masquerade that night but that he would not fail to pay his respects to him the next day the first lieutenant admitted the excuse and our hero after having entertained halfadozen of the auroras for the harpy had sailed two days before dressed himself for the masquerade which was held in a church about two miles and a half from mahon jack had selected the costume of the devil as being the most appropriate and mounting a jackass he rode down in his dress to the masquerade but as jack was just going in he perceived a yellow carriage with two footmen in gaudy liveries draw up and with his usual politeness when the footmen opened the door offered his arm to hand out a fat old dowager covered with diamonds the lady looked up and perceiving jack covered with hair with his trident and his horns and long tail gave a loud scream and would have fallen had it not been for captain wilson who in his full uniform was coming in and caught her in his arms while the old lady thanked him and captain wilson bowed jack hastily retreated i shall make no conquests tonight thought he so he entered the church and joined the crowd but it was so dense that it was hardly possible to move and our hero soon got tired of flourishing his trident and sticking it into people who wondered what the devil he meant this is stupid work thought jack i may have more fun outside so jack put on his cloak left the masquerade and went out in search of adventures he walked into the open country about half a mile until he came to a splendid house standing in a garden of orange trees which he determined to reconnoitre he observed that a window was open and lights were in the room and he climbed up to the window and just opened the white curtain and looked in on a bed lay an elderly person evidently dying and by the side of the bed were three priests one of whom held the crucifix in his hand another the censer and a third was sitting at a table with a paper pen and ink as jack understood spanish he listened and heard one of the priests say your sins have been enormous my son and i cannot give you extreme unction or absolution unless you make some amends i have answered the moribund left money for ten thousand masses to be said for my soul five hundred thousand masses are not sufficient how have you gained your enormous wealth by usury and robbing the poor i have left a thousand dollars to be distributed among the poor on the day of my funeral one thousand dollars is nothingyou must leave all your property to holy church and my children replied the dying man faintly what are your children compared to your salvation reply not either consent or not only do i refuse you the consolation of the dying but i excommunicate mercy holy father mercy said the old man in a dying voice there is no mercy you are damned for ever and ever amen now hear excommunicabo te stopstophave you the paper ready tis here all ready by which you revoke all former wills and endow the holy church with your property we will read it for god forbid that it should be said that the holy church received an involuntary gift i will sign it replied the dying man but my sight fails me be quick absolve me and the paper was signed with difficulty as the priests supported the dying man and nowabsolve me i do absolve thee replied the priest who then went through the ceremony now this is a confounded rascally business said jack to himself who then dropped his cloak jumped upon the windowsill opened wide the windowcurtains with both hands and uttered a yelling kind of ha ha ha ha the priests turned round saw the demon as they imagined dropped the paper on the table and threw themselves with their faces on the floor exorciso te stammered one ha ha ha ha repeated jack entering the room and taking up the paper which he burnt by the flame of the candle our hero looked at the old man on the bed his jaw had fallen his eyes were turned he was dead jack then gave one more ha ha ha ha to keep the priests in their places blew out the candles made a spring out of the window caught up his cloak and disappeared as fast as his legs could carry him jack ran until he was out of breath and then he stopped and sat down by the side of the road it was broad moonlight and jack knew not where he was but minorca has not many high roads thought jack and i shall find my way home now let me seei have done some good this evening i have prevented those rogues from disinheriting a family i wonder who they are they ought to be infinitely obliged to me but if the priests find me out what shall i do i never dare come on shore againtheyd have me in the inquisition i wonder where i am said jack i will get on that hill and see if i can take a departure the hill was formed by the road being cut perpendicularly almost through it and was perhaps some twelve or fourteen feet high jack ascended it and looked about him there is the sea at all events with the full moon silvering the waves said jack turning from the road and here is the road then that must be the way to port mahon but what comes hereits a carriage why its the yellow carriage of that old lady with her diamonds and her two splashy footmen jack was watching it as it passed the road under him when of a sudden he perceived about a dozen men rush out and seize the horses headsa discharge of firearms the coachman dropped off the box and the two footmen dropped from behind the robbers then opened the door and were hauling out the fat old lady covered with diamonds jack thought a secondit occurred to him that although he could not cope with so many he might frighten them as he had frightened one set of robbers already that night the old lady had just been tumbled out of the carriagedoor like a large bundle of clothes tied up for the wash when jack throwing off his cloak and advancing to the edge of the precipice with the full moon behind him throwing out his figure in strong relief raised his trident and just as they were raising their knives yelled a most unearthly ha ha ha ha the robbers looked up and forgetting the masquerade for there is a double tremor in guilt screamed with fear most of them ran away and dropped after a hundred yards others remained paralysed and insensible jack descended the hill went to the assistance of the old lady who had swooned and had to put her into the carriage but although our hero was very strong this was a work of no small difficulty after one or two attempts he lowered down the steps and contrived to bump her on the first from the first he purchased her on the second and from the second he at last seated her at the door of the carriage jack had no time to be overpolite he then threw her back into the bottom of the carriage her heels went up to the top jack shoved in her petticoats as fast as he could for decency and then shutting the door seized the reins and jumped upon the box i dont know the way thought jack but we must needs go when the devil drives so sticking his trident into the horses they set off at a rattling pace passing over the bodies of the two robbers who had held the reins and who both lay before him in a swoon as soon as he had brought the horses into a trot he slackened the reins for as jack wisely argued they will be certain to go home if i let them have their own way the horses before they arrived at the town turned off and stopped at a large country house that he might not frighten the people jack had put on his cloak and taken off his mask and headpiece which he had laid beside him on the box at the sound of the carriagewheels the servants came out when jack in few words told them what had happened some of the servants ran in and a young lady made her appearance while the others were helping the old lady out of the carriage who had recovered her senses but had been so much frightened that she had remained in the posture in which jack had put her as soon as she was out jack descended from the coachbox and entered the house he stated to the young lady what had taken place and how opportunely he had frightened away the robbers just as they were about to murder her relation and also suggested the propriety of sending after the servants who had fallen in the attack which was immediately done by a strong and wellarmed party collected for the occasion jack having made his speech made a very polite bow and took his leave stating that he was an english officer belonging to a frigate in the harbour he knew his way back and in half an hour was again at the inn and found his comrades jack thought it advisable to keep his own secret and therefore merely said that he had taken a long walk in the country and soon afterwards went to bed the next morning our hero who was always a man of his word packed up his portmanteau and paid his bill he had just completed this heavy operation when somebody wanted to speak to him and a sort of halfclerical halflegal sort of looking gentleman was introduced who with a starched face and prim air said that he came to request in writing the name of the officer who was dressed as a devil in the masquerade of the night before jack looked at his interrogator and thought of the priests and the inquisition no no thought he that wont do a name i must give but it shall be one that you dare not meddle with a midshipman you might get hold of but its more than the whole island dare to touch a postcaptain of one of his majestys frigates so jack took the paper and wrote captain henry wilson of his majestys ship aurora the prim man made a prim bow folded up the paper and left the room jack threw the waiter half a doubloon lighted his cigar and went on board chapter xxv in which the old proverb is illustrated that you must not count your chickens before they are hatched the first lieutenant of the aurora was a very good officer in many respects but as a midshipman he had contracted the habit of putting his hands in his pockets and could never keep them out even when the ship was in a gale of wind and hands are of some use in a heavy lurch he had more than once received serious injury from falling on these occasions but habit was too powerful and although he had once broken his leg by falling down the hatchway and had moreover a large scar on his forehead received from being thrown to leeward against one of the guns he still continued the practice indeed it was said that once when it was necessary for him to go aloft he had actually taken the two first rounds of the jacobs ladder without withdrawing them until losing his balance he discovered that it was not quite so easy to go aloft with his hands in his pockets in fact there was no getting up his hands even when all hands were turned up he had another peculiarity which was that he had taken a peculiar fancy to a quack medicine called enouys universal medicine for all mankind and mr pottyfar was convinced in his own mind that the label was no libel except from the greatness of its truth in his opinion it cured everything and he spent one of his quarterly bills every year in bottles of this stuff which he not only took himself every time he was unwell but occasionally when quite well to prevent his falling sick he recommended it to everybody in the ship and nothing pleased him so much as to give a dose of it to everyone who could be persuaded to take it the officers laughed at him but it was generally behind his back for he became very angry if contradicted upon this one point upon which he certainly might be considered to be a little cracked he was indefatigable in making proselytes to his creed and expatiated upon the virtues of the medicine for an hour running proving the truth of his assertions by a pamphlet which with his hands he always carried in his trousers pocket jack reported himself when he came on board and mr pottyfar who was on the quarterdeck at the time expressed a hope that mr easy would take his share of the duty now that he had had such a spell on shore to which jack very graciously acceded and then went down below where he found gascoigne and his new messmates with most of whom he was already acquainted well easy said gascoigne have you had enough of the shore quite replied jack recollecting that after the events of the night before he was just as well on board i dont intend to ask for any more leave perhaps its quite as well for mr pottyfar is not very liberal on that score i can tell you there is but one way of getting leave from him indeed replied jack and what is that you must pretend that you are not well take some of his quack medicine and then he will allow you a run on shore to work it off oh thats it is it well then as soon as we anchor in valette ill go through a regular course but not till then it ought to suit you jack its an equality medicine cures one disorder just as well as the other or killswhich levels all the patients youre right gascoigne i must patronise that stufffor more reasons than one who was that person on deck in mufti the mufti jack in other words the chaplain of the ship but hes a prime sailor nevertheless hows that why he was brought up on the quarterdeck served his time was acting lieutenant for two years and then somehow or another he bore up for the church indeedwhat were his reasons no one knowsbut they say he has been unhappy ever since why so because he did a very foolish thing which cannot now be remedied he supposed at the time that he would make a good parson and now that he has long got over his fit he finds himself wholly unfit for ithe is still the officer in heart and is always struggling with his natural bent which is very contrary to what a parson should feel why dont they allow parsons to be broke by a courtmartial and turned out of the service or to resign their commissions like other people it wont do jackthey serve heaventheres a difference between that and serving his majesty well i dont understand these things when do we sail the day after tomorrow to join the fleet of toulon yes but i suppose we shall be driven on the spanish coast going there i never knew a manofwar that was not no wind always blows from the south going up the mediterranean perhaps youll take another prize jackmind you dont go away without the articles of war i wont go away without mesty if i can help it o dear how abominable a midshipmans berth is after a long run on shore i positively must go on deck and look at the shore if i can do nothing else why ten minutes ago you had had enough of it yes but ten minutes here has made me feel quite sick i shall go to the first lieutenant for a dose i say easy we must both be physicked on the same day to be sure but stop till we get to malta jack went on deck made acquaintance with the chaplain and some of the officers whom he had not known then climbed up into the maintop where he took a seat on the armolest and as he looked at the shore thought over the events that had passed until agnes came to his memory and he thought only of her when a mid is in love he always goes aloft to think of the object of his affection why i dont know except that his reverie is not so likely to be disturbed by an order from a superior officer the aurora sailed on the second day and with a fine breeze stood across making as much northing as easting the consequence was that one fine morning they saw the spanish coast before they saw the toulon fleet mr pottyfar took his hands out of his pockets because he could not examine the coast through a telescope without so doing but this it is said was the first time that he had done so on the quarterdeck from the day that the ship had sailed from port mahon captain wilson was also occupied with his telescope so were many of the officers and midshipmen and the men at the mastheads used their eyes but there was nothing but a few small fishingboats to be seen so they all went down to breakfast as the ship was hoveto close in with the land what will easy bet said one of the midshipmen that we dont see a prize today i will not bet that we do not see a vesselbut ill bet you what you please that we do not take one before twelve oclock at night no no that wont dojust let the teapot travel over this way for its my forenoon watch its a fine morning observed one of the mates of the name of martin but ive a notion it wont be a fine evening why not inquired another ive now been eight years in the mediterranean and know something about the weather theres a watery sky and the wind is very steady if we are not under doublereefed topsails tonight say im no conjurer that you will be all the same if we are under bare poles said another youre devilish free with your tongue my youngstereasy pull his ears for me pull them easy jack then said the boy laughing all hands make sail now resounded at the hatchways there they are depend upon it cried gascoigne catching up his hat and bolting out of the berth followed by all the others except martin who had just been relieved and thought that his presence in the waist might be dispensed with for the short time at least which it took him to swallow a cup of tea it was very true a galliot and four lateen vessels had just made their appearance round the easternmost point and as soon as they observed the frigate had hauled their wind in a minute the aurora was under a press of canvas and the telescopes were all directed to the vessels all deeply laden sir observed mr hawkins the chaplain how the topsail of the galliot is scored they have a fresh breeze just now observed captain wilson to the first lieutenant yes sir and its coming down fast hands by the royal halyards there the aurora careened with the canvas to the rapidlyincreasing breeze topgallant sheet and halyards luff you may quartermaster luff i tell you a small pull of that weather maintopgallant bracethat will do said the master topmen aloft therestand by to clew up the royals and captain wilson shall we take them inim afraid of that poleit bends now like a coachwhip said mr pottyfar looking up aloft with his hands in both pockets in royalslower away they are going about sir said the second lieutenant mr haswell look out observed the chaplain its coming again the breeze increased and the frigate was borne down hands reef topsails in stays mr pottyfar aye aye sirbout ship the helm was put down and the topsails lowered and reefed in stays very well my lads very well indeed said captain wilson again the topsails were hoisted and topgallant sheets home it was a strong breeze although the water was smooth and the aurora dashed through at the rate of eight miles an hour with her weather leeches lifting didnt i tell you so said martin to his messmates on the gangway but theres more yet my boys we must take the topgallant sails off her said captain wilson looking aloftfor the frigate now careened to her bearings and the wind was increasing and squally try them a little longer but another squall came suddenlythe halyards were lowered and the sails clewed up and furled in the meantime the frigate had rapidly gained upon the vessels which still carried on every stitch of canvas making short tacks inshore the aurora was again put about with her head towards them and they were not two points on her weatherbow the sky which had been clear in the morning was now overcast the sun was obscured with opaque white clouds and the sea was rising fast another ten minutes and then they were under doublereefed topsails and the squalls were accompanied with heavy rain the frigate now dashed through the waves foaming in her course and straining under the press of sail the horizon was so thick that the vessels ahead were no longer to be seen we shall have it i expect said captain wilson didnt i say so observed martin to gascoigne we take no prizes this day depend upon it we must have another hand to the wheel sir if you please said the quartermaster who was assisting the helmsman mr pottyfar with his hands concealed as usual stood by the capstern i fear sir we cannot carry the mainsail much longer no observed the chaplain i was thinking so captain wilson if you please we are very close in said the master dont you think we had better go about yes mr jones hands about shipand yes by heavens we mustup mainsail the mainsail was taken off and the frigate appeared to be immediately relieved she no longer jerked and plunged as before were very near the land captain wilson thick as it is i think i can make out the loom of itshall we wear round sir continued the master yes hands wear shipput the helm up it was but just in time for as the frigate flew round describing a circle as she payed off before the wind they could perceive the breakers lashing the precipitous coast not two cables length from them i had no idea we were so near observed the captain compressing his lipscan they see anything of those vessels i have not seen them this quarter of an hour sir replied the signalman protecting his glass from the rain under his jacket hows her head now quartermaster south southeast sir the sky now assumed a different appearancethe white clouds had been exchanged for others dark and murky the wind roared at intervals and the rain came down in torrents captain wilson went down into the cabin to examine the barometer the barometer has risen said he on his return on deck is the wind steady no sir shes up and off three points this will end in a southwester the wet and heavy sails now flapped from the shifting of the wind up with the helm quartermaster up it isshes off to southbywest the wind lulled the rain came down in a delugefor a minute it was quite calm and the frigate was on an even keel man the braces we shall be taken aback directly depend upon it the braces were hardly stretched along before this was the case the wind flew round to the southwest with a loud roar and it was fortunate that they were preparedthe yards were braced round and the master asked the captain what course they were to steer we must give it up observed captain wilson holding on by the belaying pin shape our course for cape sicie mr jones and the aurora flew before the gale under her foresail and topsails close reefed the weather was now so thick that nothing could be observed twenty yards from the vessel the thunder pealed and the lightning darted in every direction over the dark expanse the watch was called as soon as the sails were trimmed and all who could went below wet uncomfortable and disappointed what an old jonah you are martin said gascoigne yes i am replied he but we have the worst to come yet in my opinion i recollect not two hundred miles from where we are now we had just such a gale in the favourite and we as nearly went down when at this moment a tremendous noise was heard above a shock was felt throughout the whole ship which trembled fore and aft as if it was about to fall into pieces loud shrieks were followed by plaintive cries the lower deck was filled with smoke and the frigate was down on her beam ends without exchanging a word the whole of the occupants of the berth flew out and were up the hatchway not knowing what to think but convinced that some dreadful accident had taken place on their gaining the deck it was at once explained the foremast of the frigate had been struck by lightning had been riven into several pieces and had fallen over the larboard bow carrying with it the maintopmast and jibboom the jagged stump of the foremast was in flames and burned brightly notwithstanding the rain fell in torrents the ship as soon as the foremast and main topmast had gone overboard broachedto furiously throwing the men over the wheel and dashing them senseless against the carronades the forecastle the forepart of the main deck and even the lower deck were spread with men either killed or seriously wounded or insensible from the electric shock the frigate was on her beam ends and the sea broke furiously over her all was dark as pitch except the light from the blazing stump of the foremast appearing like a torch held up by the wild demons of the storm or when occasionally the gleaming lightning cast a momentary glare threatening every moment to repeat its attack upon the vessel while the deafening thunder burst almost on their devoted heads all was dismay and confusion for a minute or two at last captain wilson who had himself lost his sight for a short time called for the carpenter and axesthey climbed up that is two or three of them and he pointed to the mizzenmast the master was also there and he cut loose the axes for the seamen to use in a few minutes the mizzenmast fell over the quarter and the helm being put hard up the frigate payed off and slowly righted but the horror of the scene was not yet over the boatswain who had been on the forecastle had been led below for his vision was gone for ever the men who lay scattered about had been examined and they were assisting them down to the care of the surgeon when the cry of fire issued from the lower deck the ship had taken fire at the coalhole and carpenters storeroom and the smoke that now ascended was intense call the drummer said captain wilson and let him beat to quartersall hands to their stationslet the pumps be rigged and the buckets passed along mr martin see that the wounded men are taken down below wheres mr haswell mr pottyfar station the men to pass the water on by hand on the lower deck i will go there myself mr jones take charge of the ship pottyfar who actually had taken his hands out of his pockets hastened down to comply with the captains orders on the main deck as captain wilson descended to the deck below i say jack this is very different from this morning observed gascoigne yes replied jack so it is but i say gascoigne whats the best thing to dowhen the chimneys on fire on shore they put a wet blanket over it yes replied gascoigne but when the coalholes on fire on board they will not find that sufficient at all events wet blankets must be a good firing ned so let us pull out the hammocks cut the lanyards and get some outwe can but offer them you know and if they do no good at least it will show our zeal yes jack and i think when they turn in again those whose blankets you take will agree with you that zeal makes the service very uncomfortable however i think you are right the two midshipmen collected three or four hands and in a very short time they had more blankets than they could carrythere was no trouble in wetting them for the main deck was afloatand followed by the men they had collected easy and gascoigne went down with large bundles in their arms to where captain wilson was giving directions to the men excellent mr easy excellent mr gascoigne said captain wilson come my lads throw them over now and stamp upon them well the mens jackets and the captains coat had already been sacrificed to the same object easy called the other midshipmen and they went up for a further supply but there was no occasion the fire had been smothered still the danger had been so great that the fore magazine had been floated during all this which lasted perhaps a quarter of an hour the frigate had rolled gunwale under and many were the accidents which occurred at last all danger from fire had ceased and the men were ordered to return to their quarters when three officers and fortyseven men were found absentseven of them were dead most of them were already under the care of the surgeon but some were still lying in the scuppers no one had been more active or more brave during this time of danger than mr hawkins the chaplain he was everywhere and when captain wilson went down to put out the fire he was there encouraging the men and exerting himself most gallantly he and mesty came aft when all was over one just as black as the other the chaplain sat down and wrung his handsgod forgive me said he god forgive me why so sir said easy who stood near i am sure you need not be ashamed of what you have done no no not ashamed of what ive done but mr easyi have sworn so sworn such oaths at the men in hastei the chaplain god forgive mei meant nothing it was very true that mr hawkins had sworn a great deal during his exertions but he was at that time the quarterdeck officer and not the chaplain the example to the men and his gallantry had been most serviceable indeed sir said easy who saw the chaplain was in great tribulation and hoped to pacify him i was certainly not there all the time but i only heard you say god bless you my men be smart and so on surely that is not swearing was it that i said mr easy are you sure i really had an idea that i had dd them all in heaps as some of them deservedno no not deserved did i really bless themnothing but bless them yes sir said mesty who perceived what jack wanted it was nothing i assure you but god bless you captain wilsonbless your heart my good menbless the king and so on you do nothing but shower down blessing and wet blanket i told you so said jack well mr easy youve made me very happy replied the chaplain i was afraid it was otherwise so indeed it was for the chaplain had sworn like a boatswain but as jack and mesty had turned all his curses into blessings the poor man gave himself absolution and shaking hands with jack hoped he would come down into the gunroom and take a glass of grog nor did he forget mesty who received a good allowance at the gunroom door to which jack gladly consented as the rum in the middys berth had all been exhausted after the rainy morning but jack was interrupted in his third glass by somebody telling him the captain wanted to speak with mr hawkins and with him jack went up and found the captain on the quarterdeck with the officers mr easy said captain wilson i have sent for you mr hawkins and mr gascoigne to thank you on the quarterdeck for your exertions and presence of mind on this trying occasion mr hawkins made a bow gascoigne said nothing but he thought of having extra leave when they arrived at malta jack felt inclined to make a speech and began something about when there was danger that it levelled every one to an equality even on board of a manofwar by no means mr easy replied captain wilson it does the very contrary for it proves which is the best man and those who are the best raise themselves at once above the rest jack was very much inclined to argue the point but he took the compliment and held his tongue which was the wisest thing he could have done so he made his bow and was about to go down into the midshipmens berth when the frigate was pooped by a tremendous sea which washed all those who did not hold on down into the waist jack was among the number and naturally catching at the first object which touched him he caught hold of the chaplain by the leg who commenced swearing most terribly but before he could finish the oath the water which had burst into the cabin through the windowsfor the dead lights in the confusion had not yet been shippedburst out of the cross bulkheads sweeping like a torrent the marine the cabindoor and everything else in its force and floating jack and the chaplain with several others down the main hatchway on to the lower deck the lower deck being also full of water men and chests were rolling and tossing about and jack was sometimes in company with the chaplain and at other times separated at last they both recovered their legs and gained the midshipmens berth which although afloat was still a haven of security mr hawkins spluttered and spit and so did jack until he began to laugh this is very trying mr easy said the chaplain very trying indeed to the temper i hope i have not sworn i hope not not a word said jacki was close to you all the timeyou only said god preserve us only that i was afraid that i said god dn it quite a mistake mr hawkins lets go into the gunroom and try to wash this salt water out of our mouths and then i will tell you all you said as far as i could hear it word for word so jack by this means got another glass of grog which was very acceptable in his wet condition and made himself very comfortable while those on deck were putting on the dead lights and very busy setting the goosewings of the mainsail to prevent the frigate from being pooped a second time chapter xxvi in which our hero becomes excessively unwell and agrees to go through a course of medicine the hammocks were not piped down that night some were taken indiscriminately for the wounded but the rest remained in the nettings for all hands were busy preparing jury masts and jury rigging and mr pottyfar was so well employed that for twelve hours his hands were not in his pockets it was indeed a dreadful night the waves were mountains high and chased the frigate in their fury cresting breaking and roaring at her taffrail but she flew before them with the wings of the wind four men at the helm assisted by others at the relieving tackles below jack having been thanked on and washed off the quarterdeck thought that he had done quite enough he was as deep as he could swim before he had satisfied all the scruples of the chaplin and stowing himself away on one of the lockers of the midshipmens berth was soon fast asleep notwithstanding that the frigate rolled gunwale under gascoigne had done much better he had taken down a hammock as he said for a poor wounded man hung it up and turned in himself the consequence was that the next morning the surgeon who saw him lying in the hammock had put him down in the report but as gascoigne had got up as well as ever he laughed and scratched his name out of the list of wounded before morning the ship had been pumped out dry and all below made as secure and safe as circumstances would permit but the gale still continued its violence and there was anything but comfort onboard i say martin you ought to be thrown overboard said gascoigne all this comes from your croakingyoure a mother carys chicken i wish i had been anyones chicken replied martin but the devil a thing to nestle under have i had since i can well remember what a bore to have no galleyfire lighted said one of the youngsters no tea and not allowed any grog the gale will last three days replied martin and by that time we shall not be far from the admiral it wont blow home there well then we shall be ordered in directly and i shall go on shore tomorrow replied easy yes if youre ill replied gascoigne never fear i shall be sick enough we shall be there at least six weeks and then well forget all this yes replied martin we may forget it but will the poor fellows whose limbs are shrivelled forget it and will poor miles the boatswain who is blind forever very true martin we are thinking about ourselves not thankful for our escape and not feeling for others replied gascoigne give us your hand ned said jack easy and martin we ought to thank you for telling us the truthwe are a selfish set of fellows still we took our share with the others replied one of the midshipman thats more reason for us to be grateful and to pity them replied jack suppose you had lost your arm or your eyesightwe would have pitied you so now pity others well so i do now i think of it think oftener youngster observed martin going on deck what a change from the morning of the day before but twentyfour hours had passed away and the sea had been smooth the frigate dashed through the blue water proud in all her canvas graceful as a swan since that there had been fire tempest lightning disaster danger and death her masts were tossed about on the snowy waves hundreds of miles away from her and shea wreckwas rolling heavily groaning and complaining in every timber as she urged her impetuous race with the furious running sea how wrong are those on shore who assert that sailors are not religioushow is it possible supposing them to be possessed of feeling to be otherwise on shore where you have nothing but the change of seasons each in its own peculiar beautynothing but the blessings of the earth its fruits its flowersnothing but the bounty the comforts the luxuries which have been invented where you can rise in the morning in peace and lay down your head at night in securitygod may be neglected and forgotten for a long time but at sea when each gale is a warning each disaster acts as a check each escape as a homily upon the forbearance of providence that man must be indeed brutalised who does not feel that god is there on shore we seldom view him but in all his beauty and kindness but at sea we are as often reminded how terrible he is in his wrath can it be supposed that the occurrences of the last twentyfour hours were lost upon the minds of any one man in that ship no no in their courage and activity they might appear reckless but in their hearts they acknowledged and bowed unto their god before the day was over a juryforemast had been got up and sail having been put upon it the ship was steered with greater ease and safetythe main brace had been spliced to cheer up the exhausted crew and the hammocks were piped down as gascoigne had observed some of the men were not very much pleased to find that they were minus their blankets but captain wilson ordered their losses to be supplied by the purser and expended by the master this quite altered the case as they obtained new blankets in most cases for old ones but still it was impossible to light the galley fire and the men sat on their chests and nibbled biscuit by twelve oclock that night the gale broke and more sail was necessarily put on the scudding vessels for the sea still ran fast and mountains high at daylight the sun burst out and shone brightly on them the sea went gradually down the fire was lighted and mr pottyfar whose hands were again in his pockets at twelve oclock gave the welcome order to pipe to dinner as soon as the men had eaten their dinner the frigate was once more brought to the wind her jurymast forward improved upon and more sail made upon it the next morning there was nothing of the gale left except the dire effects which it had produced the black and riven stump of the foremast still holding up a terrific warning of the power and fury of the elements three days more and the aurora joined the toulon fleet when she was first seen it was imagined by those on board of the other ships that she had been in action but they soon learnt that the conflict had been against more direful weapons than any yet invented by mortal hands captain wilson waited upon the admiral and of course received immediate orders to repair to port and refit in a few hours the aurora had shaped her course for malta and by sunset the toulon fleet were no longer in sight by de holy poker massa easy but that terrible sort of gale the other day anyhowi tink one time we all go to davy joneys lacker very true mesty i hope never to meet with such another den massa easy why you go to sea when man ab no money noting to eat den he go to sea but everybody say you ab plenty money why you come to sea im sure i dont know replied jack thoughtfully i came to sea on account of equality and the rights of man eh massa easy you come to wrong place anyhow now i tink a good deal lately and by all de power i tink equality all stuff all stuff mesty why you used to think otherwise yes massa easy but den i boil de kettle for all young gentleman now dat i ships corporal and hab cane i tink so no longer jack made no reply but he thought the more the reader must have perceived that jacks notions of equality were rapidly disappearing he defended them more from habit and perhaps a wilfulness which would not allow him to acknowledge himself wrongto which may be added his love of argument already he had accustomed himself to obedience of his superiors and notwithstanding his arguments he would admit of no resistance from those below him not that it was hardly ever attempted for jack was anything but a tyrant and was much beloved by all in the ship every day brought its lesson and captain wilson was now satisfied that jack had been almost cured of the effects of his fathers ridiculous philosophy after a few minutes mesty tapped his cane on the funnel and recommenced then why you stay at sea massa easy i dont know mesty i dont dislike it but massa easy why you stay in midshipman berth eat hard biscuit salt pig salt horse when you can go shore and live like gentleman dat very foolish why not be your own master by all power suppose i had money catch me board ship little sea very good massa easy open ones eyes but tink of the lightning tother night poor massa boatswain he shut um eyes for ebber very true mesty me hope you fink of this sar and when you go on shore you take mesty wid you he sarve you well massa easy long as he live by de holy st patrick and den massa easy you marry wifehab pickaninnylib like gentleman you tink of this massa easy the mention of the word marriage turned the thoughts of our hero to his agnes and he made no reply mesty walked away leaving our hero in deep thought this conversation had more effect upon jack than would have been imagined and he very often found he was putting to himself the question of mestywhy do you stay at sea he had not entered the service with any particular view except to find equality and he could not but acknowledge to himself that as mesty observed he had come to the wrong place he had never even thought of staying to serve his time nor had he looked forward to promotion and one day commanding a ship he had only cared for the present without indulging in a future anticipation of any reward except in a union with agnes mestys observations occasioned jack to reflect upon the future for the first time in his life and he was always perplexed when he put the question of mesty and tried to answer to himself as to what were his intentions in remaining in the service nevertheless jack did his duty very much to the satisfaction of mr pottyfar and after a tedious passage from baffling and light winds the aurora arrived at malta our hero had had some conversation with his friend gascoigne in which he canvassed his future plans all of which however ended in one settled point which was that he was to marry agnes as for the rest gascoigne was of opinion that jack ought to follow up the service and become a captain but there was plenty of time to think about that as he observed now all they had to consider was how to get on shore for the refitting of the ship was an excuse for detaining them on board which they knew mr pottyfar would avail himself of jack dined in the gunroom on the day of their arrival and he resolved that he would ask that very evening captain wilson was already on shore at the governors now there had been a little difference of opinion between mr pottyfar and mr hawkins the chaplain on a point of seamanship and most of the officers sided with the chaplain who as we have before observed was a firstrate seaman it had ended in high words for mr hawkins had forgotten himself so far as to tell the first lieutenant that he had a great deal to learn not having even got over the midshipmans trick of keeping his hands in his pockets and mr pottyfar had replied that it was very well for him as chaplain to insult others knowing that his cassock protected him this was a bitter reply to mr hawkins who at the very time that the insinuation made his blood boil was also reminded that his profession forbade a retort he rushed into his cabin poor fellow having no other method left vented his indignation in tears and then consoled himself by degrees with prayer in the meantime mr pottyfar had gone on deck wroth with hawkins and with his messmates as well as displeased with himself he was indeed in a humour to be pleased with nobody and in a most unfortunate humour to be asked leave by a midshipman nevertheless jack politely took off his hat and requested leave to go on shore and see his friend the governor upon which mr pottyfar turned round to him with his feet spread wide open and thrusting his hands to the very bottom of his pockets as if in determination said mr easy you know the state of the ship we have everything to do new masts new rigging everything almost to refitand yet you ask to go on shore now sir you may take this answer for yourself and all the other midshipmen in the ship that not one soul of you puts his foot on shore until we are again all ataunto allow me to observe sir said our hero that it is very true that all our services may be required when the duty commences but this being saturday night and tomorrow sunday the frigate will not be even moved till monday morning and as the work cannot begin before that i trust you will permit leave until that time my opinion is different sir replied the first lieutenant perhaps sir you will allow me to argue the point replied jack no sir i never allow argument walk over to the other side of the deck if you please o certainly sir said jack if you wish it jacks first idea was to go on shore without leave but from this he was persuaded by gascoigne who told him that it would displease captain wilson and that old tom the governor would not receive him jack agreed to this and then after a flourish about the rights of man tyranny oppression and so forth he walked forward to the forecastle where he found his friend mesty who had heard all that had passed and who insidiously said to him in a low tone why you stay at sea massa easy why indeed thought jack boiling with indignation to be cooped up here at the will of another i am a foolmesty is rightill ask for my discharge tomorrow jack went down below and told gascoigne what he had determined to do youll do no such thing jack replied gascoigne depend upon it youll have plenty of leave in a day or two pottyfar was in a pet with the chaplain who was too much for him captain wilson will be on board by nine oclock nevertheless jack walked his first watch in the magnificents as all biddies do when they cannot go on shore and turned in at twelve oclock with the resolution of sticking to his purpose and quitting his majestys service in fact of presenting his majesty with his between two and three years time served as midshipman all free gratis and for nothing except his provisions and his pay which some captains are bold enough to assert that they not only are not worth but not even the salt that accompanies it forgetting that they were once midshipmen themselves and at the period were of course of about the same value the next morning captain wilson came off the ships company were mustered the service read by mr hawkins and jack as soon as all the official duties were over was about to go up to the captain when the captain said to himmr easy the governor desired me to bring you on shore to dine with him and he has a bed at your service jack touched his hat and ran down below to make his few preparations by the time that mesty who had taken charge of his chest etc had put his necessaries in the boat jack had almost made up his mind that his majesty should not be deprived yet awhile of so valuable an officer jack returned on deck and found that the captain was not yet ready he went up to mr pottyfar and told him that the captain had ordered him to go on shore with him and mr pottyfar who had quite got over his spleen said very well mr easyi wish you a great deal of pleasure this is very different from yesterday thought jack suppose i try the medicine i am not very well mr pottyfar and those pills of the doctors dont agree with mei always am ill if i am long without air and exercise very true said the first lieutenant people require air and exercise ive no opinion of the doctors remedies the only thing that is worth a farthing is the universal medicine i should so long to try it sir replied jack i read the book one day and it said that if you took it daily for a fortnight or three weeks and with plenty of air and exercise it would do wonders and its very true replied mr pottyfar and if youd like to try it you shalli have plentyshall i give you a dose now if you please sir replied jack and tell me how often i am to take it for my head aches all day mr pottyfar took jack down and putting into his hand three or four bottles of the preparation told him that he was to take thirty drops at night when he went to bed not to drink more than two glasses of wine and to avoid the heat of the sun but sir replied jack who had put the bottles in his pocket i am afraid that i cannot take it long for as the ship is ready for fitting i shall be exposed to the sun all day yes if you are wanted mr easy but we have plenty here without you and when you are unwell you cannot be expected to work take care of your health and i trust indeed i am sure that you will find this medicine wonderfully efficacious i will begin tonight sir if you please replied jack and i am very much obliged to you i sleep at the governorsshall i come on board tomorrow morning no no take care of yourself and get well i shall be glad to hear that you get better send me word how it acts i will sir send you word by the boat every day replied jack delighted i am very much obliged to you sir gascoigne and i were thinking of asking you but did not like to do so he poor fellow suffers from headaches almost as bad as i do and the doctors pills are of no use to him he shall have some too mr easy i thought he looked pale ill see to it this afternoon recollect moderate exercise mr easy and avoid the sun at midday yes sir replied jack ill not forget and off went jack delighted he ordered mesty to put up his whole portmanteau instead of the small bundle he put into the boat and telling gascoigne what a spoke he had put into his wheel was soon in the boat with the captain and went on shore where he was cordially greeted by the governor chapter xxvii in which captain wilson is repaid with interest for jacks borrowing his name proving that a good name is as good as a legacy well jack my boy have you any long story ready for me inquired the governor yes sir replied jack i have one or two very good ones very well well hear them after dinner replied old tom in the meantime find out your room and take possession that must not be for very long governor observed captain wilson mr easy must learn his duty and there is a good opportunity now if you please sir replied jack im on the sick list sick list said captain wilson you were not in the report i was given this morning no im on mr pottyfars list and im going through a course of the universal medicine whats all this jack whats all this theres some story here dont be afraid of the captainyouve me to back you said the governor jack was not at all afraid of the captain so he told him how the first lieutenant had refused him leave the evening before and how he had now given him permission to remain and try the universal medicine at which the governor laughed heartily nor could captain wilson refrain from joining but mr easy replied the captain after a pause if mr pottyfar will allow you to stay on shore i cannotyou have your duty to learn you must be aware that now is your time and you must not lose opportunities that do not occur every day you must acknowledge the truth of what i say yes sir replied jack i admit it all provided i do intend to follow the profession and so saying our hero bowed and left the veranda where they had been talking this hint of jacks thrown out by him more with the intention of preventing his being sent on board than with any definite idea was not lost upon either the captain or the governor does he jib then observed the governor on the contrary i never knew him more attentive and so entirely getting rid of his former notions he has behaved most nobly in the gale and there has not been one complaint against himi never was more astonishedhe must have meant something ill tell you what he means wilsonthat he does not like to be sent on board nothing more hes not to be cooped upyou may lead him but not drive him yes but the service will not admit of it i never could allow ithe must do his duty like the rest and conform to the rules exactly so he must but look ye wilson you must not lose him its all easily settledappoint him your orderly midshipman to and from the ship that will be employment and he can always remain here at night i will tell him that i have asked as a favour what i now do and leave me to find out what he is thinking about it may be done that way certainly replied captain wilson musing and you are more likely to get his intentions from him than i am i am afraid he has too great a command of money ever to be fond of the ship it is the ruin of a junior officer to be so lavishly supplied hes a long way from ruin yet wilsonhes a very fine fellow even by your own acknowledgment you humoured him out of gratitude to his father when he first came into the service humour him a little now to keep him in it besides if your first lieutenant is such a fool with his universal medicine can you wonder at a midshipman taking advantage of it no but i ought not to allow him to do so with my eyes open he has made it known to you upon honour and you ought not to take advantage of his confidence but still what i proposed would i think be the best for then he will be at his duty in a way that will suit all parties you because you employ him on servicethe first lieutenant because jack can take his medicineand jack because he can dine with me every day well i suppose it must be so replied captain wilson laughing but still i trust you will discover what is working in his mind to induce him to give me that answer governor never fear jack shall confess and lay his soul as bare as that of a catholic bigot before his padre the party sat down to dinner and what with the governors aidedecamp and those invited it was pretty numerous after the cloth had been removed the governor called upon jack for his stories whereupon much to the surprise of captain wilson who had never heard one word of it for the admiral had not mentioned anything about it to him during the short time the aurora was with the toulon fleet our hero gave the governor and the company the narrative of all that happened in the mary ann transportthe loves of captain hogg and miss hicksthe adventures of gascoigneand his plan by which he baulked them all the governor was delighted and captain wilson not a little astonished you prevented a very foolish thing mr easy and behaved very well observed the captain laughing again at the idea but you never told me of all this no sir replied jack i have always reserved my stories for the governors table where i am sure to meet you and then telling once does for all jack received his appointment as orderly midshipman and everything went on well for of his own accord he stayed on board the major part of the day to learn his duty which very much pleased the captain and mr pottyfar in this jack showed a great deal of good sense and captain wilson did not repent of the indulgence he had shown him jacks health improved daily much to mr pottyfars satisfaction who imagined that he took the universal medicine night and morning gascoigne also was a patient under the first lieutenants hands and often on shore with our hero who thought no more of quitting the service for seven weeks they had now remained in harbour for even the masts had to be made when one day captain wilson opened a letter he received at breakfasttime and having read it laid it down with the greatest surprise depicted in his countenance good heavens what can this mean said he whats the matter wilson said the governor just hear its contents sir thomas captain wilson then read in spanish as follows honourable sir it is my duty to advise you that the honourable lady senora alforgas de cuzman now deceased has in her testament bequeathed to you the sum of one thousand doubloons in gold as a testimony of your kind services on the night of the th of august if you will authorise any merchant here to receive the money it shall be paid forthwith or remitted in any way you please to appoint may you live a thousand years your most obedient servant alfonzo xerez jack heard the letter read rose quietly whistled low as if not attending to it and then slipped out of the room unperceived by the governor or captain wilson the fact was that although jack had longed to tell the governor about his adventures after the masquerade he did not like yet awhile until he was sure that there were no consequencesbecause he had given the captains name instead of his own as soon as he heard the letter read he at once perceived that it had been the old lady and not the priests who had made the inquiry and that by giving captain wilsons name he had obtained for him this fine legacy jack was delighted but still puzzled so he walked out of the room to reflect a little what can it mean said captain wilson i never rendered any services to anyone on the th of august or after it it is some mistaketh of augustthat was the day of the grand masquerade a lucky one for you at all eventsfor you know mistake or not no one else can touch the legacy it can only be paid to you i never heard of anything taking place at the masqueradei was there but i left early for i was not very well mr easy said captain wilson turning round but jack was gone was he at the masquerade asked the governor yes i know he was for the first lieutenant told me that he requested not to come on board till the next day depend upon it replied the governor striking his fist upon the table that jacks at the bottom of it i should not be surprised at his being at the bottom of anything replied captain wilson laughing leave it to me wilson ill find it out after a little more conversation captain wilson went on board leaving jack on purpose that the governor might pump him but this sir thomas had no occasion to do for jack had made up his mind to make the governor his confidant and he immediately told him the whole story the governor held his sides at our heros description especially at his ruse of giving the captains name instead of his own youll kill me jack before youve done with me said old tom at last but now what is to be done our hero now became grave he pointed out to the governor that he himself had plenty of money and would come into a large fortune and that captain wilson was poor with a large family all jack wanted the governor to manage was that captain wilson might consent to accept the legacy right boy right youre my own boy replied the governor but we must think of this for wilson is the very soul of honour and there might be some difficulty about it you have told nobody not a soul but you sir thomas it will never do to tell him all this jack for he would insist that the legacy belonged to you i have it sir replied jack when i was going into the masquerade i offered to hand this very old lady who was covered with diamonds out of her carriage and she was so frightened at my dress of the devil that she would have fallen down had it not been for captain wilson who supported her and she was very thankful to him you are right jack replied the governor after a short pause that will i think do i must tell him the story of the friars because i swore you had something to do with itbut ill tell him no more leave it all to me captain wilson returned in the afternoon and found the governor on the veranda i have had some talk with young easy said the governor and he has told me a strange story about that night which he was afraid to tell to everybody the governor then narrated the history of the friars and the will well but observed captain wilson the history of that will afford no clue to the legacy no it does not but still as i said jack had a hand in this he frightened the old lady as a devil and you caught her in your arms and saved her from falling so he had a hand in it you see i do now remember that i did save a very dowagerlike old personage from falling at the sight of a devil who of course must have been our friend easy well and that accounts for the whole of it a thousand doubloons for picking up an old lady yes why nothave you not heard of a man having a fortune left him for merely opening the pew door of a church to an old gentleman yes but it appears so strange theres nothing strange in this world wilson nothing at a we may slave for years and get no reward and do a trifle out of politeness and become independent in my opinion this mystery is unravelled the old lady for i knew the family must have died immensely rich she knew you in your full uniform and she asked your name a heavy fall would have been to one so fat a most serious affair you saved her and she has rewarded you handsomely well replied captain wilson as i can give no other explanation i suppose yours is the correct one but its hardly fair to take a thousand doubloons from her relations merely for an act of civility you really are quite ridiculous the old lady owned half murcia to my knowledge it is no more to them than anyone leaving you a suit of mourning in an english legacy i wish you joy it will help you with a large family and in justice to them you are bound to take it everybody does as he pleases with his own moneydepend upon it you saved her from breaking her leg short off at the hip joint upon that supposition i presume i must accept of the legacy replied captain wilson laughing of course send for it at once the rate of exchange is now high i will give you government bills which will make it nearly four thousand pounds four thousand pounds for preventing an old woman from falling replied captain wilson devilish well paid wilson and i congratulate you for how much am i indebted to the father of young easy observed captain wilson after a silence of some minutes if he had not assisted me when i was appointed to a ship i should not have gained my promotionnor three thousand pounds i have made in prizemoney the command of a fine frigateand now four thousand pounds in a windfall the governor thought that he was more indebted to jack than to his father for some of these advantages but he was careful not to point them out its very true observed the governor that mr easy was of service to you when you were appointed but allow me to observe that for your ship your prizemoney and for your windfall you have been wholly indebted to your own gallantry in both senses of the word still mr easy is a fine generous fellow and so is his son i can tell you bythebye i had a long conversation with him the other day about himself yes all about himself he appears to me to have come into the service without any particular motive and will be just as likely to leave it in the same way he appears to be very much in love with that sicilian noblemans daughter i find that he has written to her and to her brother since he has been here that he came into the service in search of what he never will find in this world i know very well and i presume that he has found that outand that he will follow up the service is also very doubtful but i do not wish that he should leave it yet it is doing him great good replied captain wilson i agree with you therei have great influence with him and he shall stay yet awhile he is heir to a very large fortune is he not a clear eight thousand pounds a year if not more if his father dies he must of course leave a midshipman with eight thousand pounds a year would indeed be an anomaly that the service could not permit it would be as injurious to himself as it would to others about him at present he has almost indeed i may say quite an unlimited command of money thats bad very bad i wonder he behaves so well as he does and so do i but he really is a very superior lad with all his peculiarities and a general favourite with those whose opinions and friendship are worth having well dont curb him too tightfor really he does not require it he goes very well in a snaffle chapter xxviii philosophy made easy upon agrarian principles the subject of some uneasiness to our herothe first appearance but not the last of an important personage the conversation was here interrupted by a mail from england which they had been expecting captain wilson retired with his letters the governor remained equally occupied and our hero received the first letter ever written to him by his father it ran as follows my dear son i have many times taken up my pen with the intention of letting you know how things went on in this country but as i can perceive around but one dark horizon of evil i have as often laid it down again without venturing to make you unhappy with such bad intelligence the account of your death and also of your unexpectedly being yet spared to us were duly received and i trust i mourned and rejoiced on each occasion with all the moderation characteristic of a philosopher in the first instance i consoled myself with the reflection that the world you had left was in a state of slavery and pressed down by the iron arm of despotism and that to die was gain not only in all the parson tells us but also in our liberty and at the second intelligence i moderated my joy for nearly about the same reasons resolving notwithstanding what dr middleton may say to die as i have lived a true philosopher the more i reflect the more am i convinced that there is nothing required to make this world happy but equality and the rights of man being duly observedin short that everything and everybody should be reduced to one level do we not observe that it is the law of naturedo not brooks run into riversrivers into seasmountains crumble down upon the plainsare not the seasons contented to equalise the parts of the earth why does the sun run round the ecliptic instead of the equator but to give an equal share of his heat to both sides of the world are we not all equally born in misery does not death level us all aequo pede as the poet hath are we not all equally hungry thirsty and sleepy and thus levelled by our natural wants and such being the case ought we not to have our equal share of good things in this world to which we have undoubted equal right can any argument be more solid or more level than this whatever nonsense dr middleton may talk yes my son if it were not that i still hope to see the sun of justice arise and disperse the manifold dark clouds which obscure the landif i did not still hope in my time to see an equal distribution of propertyan agrarian law passed by the house of commons in which all should benefit alikei would not care how soon i left this vale of tears created by tyranny and injustice at present the same system is carried on the nation is taxed for the benefit of the few and it groans under oppression and despotism but i still do think that there is if i may fortunately express myself a bright star in the west and signs of the times which comfort me already we have had a good deal of incendiarism about the country and some of the highest aristocracy have pledged themselves to raise the people above themselves and have advised sedition and conspiracy have shown to the debased and unenlightened multitude that their force is physically irresistible and recommended them to make use of it promising that if they hold in power they will only use that power to the abolition of our farce of a constitution of a church and of a king and that if the nation is to be governed at all it shall only be governed by the many this is cheering hail patriot lords all hail i am in hopes yet that the great work will be achieved in spite of the laughs and sneers and shakes of the head which my arguments still meet with from that obstinate fellow dr middleton your mother is in a quiet way she has given over reading and working and even her knitting as useless and she now sits all day long at the chimney corner twiddling her thumbs and waiting as she says for the millennium poor thing she is very foolish with her ideas upon this matter but as usual i let her have her own way in everything copying the philosopher of old who was tied to his xantippe i trust my dear son that your principles have strengthened with your years and fortified with your growth and that if necessary you will sacrifice all to obtain what in my opinion will prove to be the real millennium make all the converts you can and believe me to be your affectionate father and true guide nicodemus easy jack who was alone shook his head as he read this letter and then laid it down with a pish he did it involuntarily and was surprised at himself when he found that he had so done i should like to argue the point thought jack in spite of himself and then he threw the letter on the table and went into gascoignes room displeased with his father and with himself he asked ned whether he had received any letters from england and it being near dinnertime went back to dress on his coming down into the receiving room with gascoigne the governor said to them as you both speak italian you must take charge of a sicilian officer who has come here with letters of introduction to me and who dines here today before dinner they were introduced to the party in question a slightmade welllooking young man but still there was an expression in his countenance which was not agreeable in compliance with the wishes of the governor don mathias for so he was called was placed between our two midshipmen who immediately entered into conversation with him being themselves anxious to make enquiries about their friends at palermo in the course of conversation jack enquired of him whether he was acquainted with don rebiera to which the sicilian answered in the affirmative and they talked about the different members of the family don mathias towards the close of the dinner enquired of jack by what means he had become acquainted with don rebiera and jack in reply narrated how he and his friend gascoigne had saved him from being murdered by two villains after this reply the young officer appeared to be less inclined for conversation but before the party broke up requested to have the acquaintance of our two midshipmen as soon as he was gone gascoigne observed in a reflective way i have seen that face before but where i cannot exactly say but you know jack what a memory of people i have and i have seen him before i am sure i cant recollect that ever i have replied our hero but i never knew anyone who could recollect in that way as you do the conversation was then dropped between them and jack was for some time listening to the governor and captain wilson for the whole party were gone away when gascoigne who had been in deep thought since he had made the observation to jack sprang up i have him at last cried he have who demanded captain wilson that sicilian officeri could have sworn that i had seen him before that don mathias no sir thomas he is not don mathias he is the very don silvio who was murdering don rebiera when we came to his assistance and saved him i do believe you are right gascoigne im positive of it replied gascoigne i never made a mistake in my life bring me those letters easy said the governor and let us see what they say of him here it isdon mathias de alayeres you may be mistaken gascoigne it is a heavy charge you are making against this young man well sir thomas if that is not don silvio id forfeit my commission if i had it here in my hand besides i observed the change in his countenance when we told him it was easy and i who had come to don rebieras assistance and did you observe after that easy that he hardly said a word very true replied jack well well we must see to this observed the governor if so this letter of introduction must be a forgery the party then retired to bed and the next morning while easy was in gascoignes room talking over their suspicions letters from palermo were brought up to him they were in answer to those written by jack on his arrival at malta a few lines from don rebiera a small note from agnes and a voluminous detail from his friend don philip who informed him of the good health of all parties and of their goodwill towards him of agnes being as partial as ever of his having spoken plainly as he had promised jack to his father and mother relative to the mutual attachment of their consent being given and then withheld because father thomaso their confessor would not listen to the union of agnes with a heretic but nevertheless telling jack that this would be got over through the medium of his brother and himself who were determined that their sister and he should not be made unhappy about such a trifle but the latter part of the letter contained intelligence equally important which was that don silvio had again attempted the life of their father and would have succeeded had not father thomaso who happened to be there thrown himself between them that don silvio in his rage had actually stabbed the confessor although the wound was not dangerous that in consequence of this all further lenity was denied to him and the authorities were in search of him to award him the punishment due to murder and sacrilege that up to the present they could not find him and it was supposed that he had made his escape to malta in one of the speronares such were the contents of the letter which were immediately communicated to the governor and captain wilson upon their meeting at breakfast very well we must see to this observed the governor who then made his enquiries as to the other intelligence contained in the letters jack and gascoigne were uneasy till the breakfast was over when they made their escape a few moments afterwards captain wilson rose to go on board and sent for them but they were not to be found i understand it all wilson said the governor leave them to me go on board and make yourself quite easy in the meantime our two midshipmen had taken their hats and walked away to the parapet of the battery where they would not be interrupted now gascoigne observed jack you guess what im abouti must shoot that rascal this very morning and thats why i came out with you but easy the only difference is this that i must shoot him and not you he is my property for i found him out well argue that point replied jack he has attempted the life of my istobe please god fatherinlaw and therefore i have the best claim to him i beg your pardon jack he is mine for i discovered him now let me put a case suppose one man walking several yards before another picks up a purse what claim has the other to it i found him and not you thats all very well gascoigne but suppose the purse you picked up to be mine then i have a right to it although you found it he is my bird by right and not yours but i have another observation to make which is very important he is a blood relation of agnes and if his blood is on your hands however much he may deserve it depend upon it it will be raised as an obstacle to your union think of that jack paused in thought and let me induce you by another remarkyou will confer on me a most particular favour it will be the greatest i ever could replied jack and you ought to be eternally indebted to me i trust to make him eternally indebted to me replied gascoigne sailors if going into action always begin to reckon what their share of the prizemoney may be before a shot is firedour two midshipmen appear in this instance to be doing the same the point having been conceded to gascoigne jack went to the inn where don silvio had mentioned that he had taken up his quarters and sending up his card followed the waiter upstairs the waiter opened the door and presented the card very well replied don silvio you can go down and show him up jack hearing these words did not wait but walked in where he found don silvio very busy removing a hone upon which he had been whetting a sharp doubleedged stiletto the sicilian walked up to him offering his hand with apparent cordiality but jack with a look of defiance said don silvio we know you my object now is to demand on the part of my friend the satisfaction which you do not deserve but which our indignation at your second attempt upon don rebiera induces us to offer for if you escape from him you will have to do with me on the whole don silvio you may think yourself fortunate for it is better to die by the hands of a gentleman than by the gibbet don silvio turned deadly palehis hand sought his stiletto in his bosom but it was remaining on the table at last he replied be it soi will meet you when and where you please in an hour from this jack mentioned the place of meeting and then walked out of the room he and gascoigne then hastened to the quarters of an officer they were intimate with and having provided themselves with the necessary firearms were at the spot before the time they waited for him till the exact time yet no don silvio made his appearance hes off observed gascoigne the villain has escaped us half an hour over the time had passed and still there was no sign of gascoignes antagonist but one of the governors aidesdecamp was seen walking up to them heres atkins observed jack thats unlucky but he wont interfere gentlemen said atkins taking off his hat with much solemnity the governor particularly wishes to speak to you both we cant come just nowwell be there in half an hour you must be there in three minutes both of you excuse me my orders are positiveand to see them duly executed i have a corporal and a file of men behind that wallof course if you walk with me quietly there will be no occasion to send for their assistance this is confounded tyranny cried jack well may they call him king tom yes replied atkins and he governs here in rey absoluto so come along jack and gascoigne having no choice walked up to the government house where they found sir thomas in the veranda which commanded a view of the harbour and offing come here young gentlemen said the governor in a severe tone do you see that vessel about two miles clear of the port don silvio is in it going back to sicily under a guard and now remember what i say as a maxim through life fight with gentlemen if you must fight but not with villains and murderers by consenting to fight with a blackguard you as much disparage your cloth and compromise your own characters as by refusing to give satisfaction to a gentleman there go away for im angry with you and dont let me see you till dinnertime chapter xxix in which our hero sees a little more service and is better employed than in fighting don silvio but before they met the governor at his table a sloop of war arrived from the fleet with despatches from the commanderinchief those to captain wilson required him to make all possible haste in fitting and then to proceed and cruise off corsica to fall in with a russian frigate which was on that coast if not there to obtain intelligence and to follow her wherever she might be all was now bustle and activity on board of the aurora captain wilson with our hero and gascoigne quieted the governors house and repaired on board where they remained day and night on the third day the aurora was complete and ready for sea and about noon sailed out of valette harbour in a week the aurora had gained the coast of corsica and there was no need of sending lookout men to the masthead for one of the officers or midshipmen was there from daylight to dark she ran up the coast to the northward without seeing the object of her pursuit or obtaining any intelligence calms and light airs detained them for a few days when a northerly breeze enabled them to run down the eastern side of the island it was on the eighteenth day after they had quieted malta that a large vessel was seen ahead about eighteen miles off the men were then at breakfast a frigate captain wilson im sure of it said mr hawkins the chaplain whose anxiety induced him to go to the masthead how is she steering the same way as we are the aurora was under all possible sail and when the hands were piped to dinner it was thought that they had neared the chase about two miles this will be a long chase a stern chase always is observed martin to gascoigne yes im afraid sobut im more afraid of her escaping thats not unlikely either replied the mate you are one of jobs comforters martin replied gascoigne then im not so often disappointed replied the mate there are two points to be ascertained the first is whether we shall come up with the vessel or lose herthe next is if we do come up with her whether she is the vessel we are looking for you seem very indifferent about it indeed i am not i am the oldest passed midshipman in the ship and the taking of the frigate will if i live give me my promotion and if im killed i shant want it but ive been so often disappointed that i now make sure of nothing until i have it well for your sake martin i will still hope that the vessel is the one we seek that we shall not be killed and that you will gain your promotion i thank you easyi wish i was one that dared hope as you do poor martin he had long felt how bitter it was to meet disappointment upon disappointment how true it is that hope deferred maketh the heart sick and his anticipations of early days the buoyant calculations of youth had been one by one crushed and now having served his time nearly three times over the reaction had become too painful and as he truly said he dared not hope still his temper was not soured but chastened she has hauled her wind sir hailed the second lieutenant from the topmast crosstrees what think you of that martin observed jack either that she is an english frigate or that she is a vessel commanded by a very brave fellow and wellmanned it was sunset before the aurora had arrived within two miles of the vessel the private signal had been thrown out but had not been answered either because it was too dark to make out the colours of the flags or that these were unknown to an enemy the stranger had hoisted the english colours but that was no satisfactory proof of her being a friend and just before dark she had put her head towards the aurora who had now come stem down to her the ships company of the aurora were all at their quarters as a few minutes would now decide whether they had to deal with a friend or foe there is no situation perhaps more difficult and demanding so much caution as the occasional meeting with a doubtful ship on the one hand it being necessary to be fully prepared and not allow the enemy the advantage which may be derived from your inaction and on the other the necessity of prudence that you may not assault your friends and countrymen captain wilson had hoisted the private nightsignal but here again it was difficult from his sails intervening for the other ship to make it out before the two frigates were within three cables length of each other captain wilson determined that there should be no mistake from any want of precaution on his part hauled up his courses and brailed up his driver that the nightsignal might be clearly seen lights were seen abaft on the quarterdeck of the other vessel as if they were about to answer but she continued to keep the aurora to leeward at about half a cables length and as the foremost guns of each vessel were abreast of each other hailed in english ship ahoy what ships that his majestys ship aurora replied captain wilson who stood on the hammocks what ships that by this time the other frigate had passed half her length clear of the beam of the aurora and at the same time that a pretended reply of his majestys ship was heard a broadside from her guns which had been trained aft on purpose was poured into the aurora and at so short a distance doing considerable execution the crew of the aurora hearing the hailing in english and the vessel passing them apparently without firing had imagined that she had been one of their own cruisers the captains of the guns had dropped their lanyards in disappointment and the silence which had been maintained as the two vessels met was just breaking up in various ways of lamentation at their bad luck when the broadside was poured in thundering in their ears and the ripping and tearing of the beams and planks astonished their senses many were carried down below but it was difficult to say whether indignation at the enemys ruse or satisfaction at discovering that they were not called to quarters in vain most predominated at all events it was answered by three voluntary cheers which drowned the cries of those who were being assisted to the cockpit man the larboard guns and about ship cried captain wilson leaping off the hammocks look out my lads and rake her in stays well pay him off for that foul play before weve done with him look out my lads and take good aim as she pays round the aurora was put about and her broadside poured into the stern of the russian frigatefor such she was it was almost dark but the enemy who appeared as anxious as the aurora to come to action hauled up her courses to await her coming up in five minutes the two vessels were alongside exchanging murderous broadsides at little more than pistolshotrunning slowly in for the land then not more than five miles distant the skinclad mountaineers of corsica were aroused by the furious cannonading watching the incessant flashes of the guns and listening to their reverberating roar after half an hours fierce combat during which the fire of both vessels was kept up with undiminished vigour captain wilson went down on the main deck and himself separately pointed each gun after it was loaded those amidships being direct for the main channels of the enemys ship while those abaft the beam were gradually trained more and more forward and those before the beam more and more aft so as to throw all their shot nearly into one focus giving directions that they were all to be fired at once at the word of command the enemy not aware of the cause of the delay imagined that the fire of the aurora had slackened and loudly cheered at the word given the broadside was poured in and dark as it was the effects from it were evident two of the midship ports of the antagonist were blown into one and her mainmast was seen to totter and then to fall over the side the aurora then set her courses which had been hauled up and shooting ahead took up a raking position while the russian was still hampered with her wreck and poured in grape and cannister from her upper deck carronades to impede their labours on deck while she continued her destructive fire upon the hull of the enemy from the main deck battery the moon now burst out from a low bank of clouds and enabled them to accomplish their work with more precision in a quarter of an hour the russian was totally dismasted and captain wilson ordered half of his remaining ships company to repair the damages which had been most severe whilst the larboard men at quarters continued the fire from the main deck the enemy continued to return the fire from four guns two on each of her decks which she could still make bear upon the aurora but after some time even these ceased either from the men having deserted them or from their being dismounted observing that the fire from her antagonist had ceased the aurora also discontinued and the jollyboat astern being still uninjured the second lieutenant was deputed to pull alongside of the frigate to ascertain if she had struck the beams of the bright moon silvered the rippling water as the boat shoved off and captain wilson and his officers who were still unhurt leant over the shattered sides of the aurora waiting for a reply suddenly the silence of the night was broken upon by a loud splash from the bows of the russian frigate then about three cables length distant what could that be cried captain wilson her anchors down mr jones a lead over the side and see what water we have mr jones had long been carried down below severed in two with a round shotbut a man leaped into the chains and lowering down the lead sounded in seven fathoms then i suspect he will give us more trouble yet observed captain wilson and so indeed it proved for the russian captain in reply to the second lieutenant had told him in english that he would answer that question with his broadside and before the boat was dropped astern he had warped round with the springs on his cable and had recommenced his fire upon the aurora captain wilson made sail upon his ship and sailed round and round the anchored vessel so as to give her two broadsides to her one and from the slowness with which she worked at her springs upon her cables it was evident that she must be now very weak handed still the pertinacity and decided courage of the russian captain convinced captain wilson that in all probability he would sink at his anchor before he would haul down his colours and not only would he lose more of the auroras men but also the russian vessel without he took a more decided step captain wilson therefore resolved to try her by the board having poured in a raking fire he stood off for a few moments during which he called the officers and men on deck and stated his intention he then went about and himself conning the aurora ran her on board the russian pouring in his reserved broadside as the vessels came into collision and heading his men as they leaped on the enemys decks although as captain wilson had imagined the russian frigate had not many men to oppose to the auroras the deck was obstinately defended the voice and the arm of the russian captain were to be heard and seen everywhere and his men encouraged by him were cut down by numbers where they stood our hero who had the good fortune to be still unhurt was for a little while close to captain wilson when he boarded and was about to oppose his unequal force against that of the russian captain when he was pulled back by the collar by mr hawkins the chaplain who rushed in advance with a sabre in his hand the opponents were well matched and it may be said that with little interruption a handtohand conflict ensued for the moon lighted up the scene of carnage and they were well able to distinguish each others faces at last the chaplains sword broke he rushed in drove the hilt into his antagonists face closed with him and they both fell down the hatchway together after this the deck was gained or rather cleared by the crew of the aurora for few could be said to have resisted and in a minute or two the frigate was in their possession the chaplain and the russian captain were hoisted up still clinging to each other both senseless from the fall but neither of them dead although bleeding from several wounds as soon as the main deck had been cleared captain wilson ordered the hatches to be put on and left a party on board while he hastened to attend to the condition of his own ship and ships company it was daylight before anything like order had been restored to the decks of the aurora the water was still smooth and instead of letting go her own anchor she had hung on with a hawser to the prize but her sails had been furled her decks cleared guns secured and the buckets were dashing away the blood from her planks and the carriages of the guns when the sun rose and shone upon them the numerous wounded had by this time been put into their hammocks although there were still one or two cases of amputation to be performed the carpenter had repaired all shotholes under or too near to the waterline and then had proceeded to sound the well of the prize but although her upper works had been dreadfully shattered there was no reason to suppose that she had received any serious injury below and therefore the hatches still remained on although a few hands were put to the pumps to try if she made any water it was not until the aurora presented a more cheerful appearance that captain wilson went over to the other ship whose deck now that the light of heaven enabled them to witness all the horrors even to minuteness presented a shocking spectacle of blood and carnage body after body was thrown over the wounded were supplied with water and such assistance as could be rendered until the surgeons could attend them the hatches were then taken off and the remainder of her crew ordered on deck about two hundred obeyed the summons but the lower deck was as crowded with killed and wounded as was the upper for the present the prisoners were handed over down into the forehold of the aurora which had been prepared for their reception and the work of separation of the dead from the living then underwent after this such repairs as were immediately necessary were made and a portion of the auroras crew under the orders of the second lieutenant were sent on board to take charge of her it was not till the evening of the day after this night conflict that the aurora was in a situation to make sail all hands were then sent on board of the trident for such was the name of the russian frigate to fit her out as soon as possible before morningfor there was no relaxation from their fatigue nor was there any wish for itall was completed and the two frigates although in a shattered condition were prepared to meet any common conflict with the elements the aurora made sail with the trident in tow the hammocks were allowed to be taken down and the watch below permitted to repose in this murderous conflict the trident had more than two hundred men killed and wounded the auroras loss had not been so great but still it was severe having lost sixtyfive men and officers among the fallen there were mr jones the master the third lieutenant mr arkwright and two midshipmen dead mr pottyfar the first lieutenant was severely wounded at the commencement of the action martin the masters mate and gascoigne the first mortally and the second badly were wounded our hero had also received a slight cutlass wound which obliged him to wear his arm for a short time in a sling among the ships company who were wounded was mesty he had been hurt with a splinter before the trident was taken by the board but had remained on deck and had followed our hero watching over him and protecting him as a father he had done even more for he had with jack thrown himself before captain wilson at a time that he had received such a blow with the flat of a sword as to stun him and bring him down on his knee and jack had taken good care that captain wilson should not be ignorant as he really would have been of this timely service on the part of mesty who certainly although with a great deal of sangfroid in his composition when in repose was a fiend incarnate when his blood was up but you must have been with mesty observed captain wilson when he did me the service i was with him sir replied jack with great modesty but was of very little service how is your friend gascoigne this evening oh not very bad sirhe wants a glass of grog and mr martin jack shook his head why the surgeon thinks he will do well yes sir and so i told martin but he said that it was very well to give him hopebut that he thought otherwise you must manage him mr easy tell him that he is sure of his promotion i have sir but he wont believe it he never will believe it till he has his commission signed i really think that an acting order would do more than the doctor can well mr easy he shall have one tomorrow morning have you seen mr pottyfar he i am afraid is very bad very bad sir and they say is worse every day and yet his wound is healthy and ought to be doing well such was the conversation between jack and his captain as they sat at breakfast on the third morning after the action the next day easy took down an acting order for martin and put it into his hands the mate read it over as he lay bandaged in his hammock its only an acting order jack said he it may not be confirmed jack swore by all the articles of war that it would be but martin replied that he was sure it never would no no said the mate i knew very well that i never should be made if it is not confirmed i may live but if it is i am sure to die everyone that went to martins hammock wished him joy of his promotion but six days after the action poor martins remains were consigned to the deep the next person who followed him was mr pottyfar the first lieutenant who had contrived wounded as he was to reach a packet of the universal medicine and had taken so many bottles before he was found out that he was one morning found dead in his bed with more than two dozen empty phials under his pillow and by the side of his mattress he was not buried with his hands in his pockets but when sewed up in his hammock they were at all events laid in the right position chapter xxx modern philanthropy which as usual is the cause of much trouble and vexation in three weeks the aurora with her prize in tow arrived at malta the wounded were sent to the hospital and the gallant russian captain recovered from his wounds about the same time as mr hawkins the chaplain jack who constantly called to see the chaplain had a great deal to do to console him he would shake his hands as he lay in his bed exclaiming against himself oh would he say the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak that i a man of god as they term me who ought to have been down with the surgeons whispering comfort to the desponding should have gone on deck but i could not help it and have mixed in such a scene of slaughter what will become of me jack attempted to console him by pointing out that not only chaplains but bishops have been known to fight in armour from time immemorial but mr hawkinss recovery was long doubtful from the agitation of his mind when he was able to walk jack introduced to him the russian captain who was also just out of his bed i am most happy to embrace so gallant an officer said the russian who recognised his antagonist throwing his arms round the chaplain and giving him a kiss on both cheeks what is his rank continued he addressing himself to jack who replied very quietly that he was the ships padre the padre replied the captain with surprise as hawkins turned away with confusion the padrepar exemple well i always had a great respect for the church pray sir said he turning to easy do your padres always head your boarders always sir replied jack its a rule of the serviceand the duty of a padre to show the men the way to heaven its our ninetyninth article of war you are a fighting nation replied the russian bowing to hawkins and continuing his walk not exactly pleased that he had been floored by a parson mr hawkins continued very disconsolate for some time he then invalided and applied himself to his duties on shore where he would not be exposed to such temptations from his former habits as the aurora when she was last at malta had nearly exhausted the dockyard for her repairs she was even longer fitting out this time during which captain wilsons despatches had been received by the admiral and had been acknowledged by a brig sent to malta the admiral in reply after complimenting him upon his gallantry and success desired that as soon as he was ready he should proceed to palermo with communications of importance to the authorities and having remained there for an answer was again to return to malta to pick up such of his men as might be fit to leave the hospital and then join the toulon fleet this intelligence was soon known to our hero who was in ecstasies at the idea of again seeing agnes and her brothers once more the aurora sailed away from the high crowned rocks of valette and with a fine breeze dashed through the deep blue waves but towards the evening the breeze increased and they were under doublereefed topsails on the second day they made the coast of sicily not far from where easy and gascoigne had been driven on shore the weather was then more moderate and the sea had to a great degree subsided they therefore stood in close to the coast as they had not a leading wind to palermo as they stood in the glasses as usual were directed to land observing the villas with which the hills and valleys were studded with their white fronts embowered in orange groves what is that gascoigne said easy under that precipiceit looks like a vessel gascoigne turned his glass in the directionyes it is a vessel on the rocks by her prow she looks like a galley it is a galley sirone of the row galleysi can make out her bank of oars observed the signalman this was reported to captain wilson who also examined her she is on the rocks certainly observed he and i think i see people on board keep her away a point quartermaster the aurora was now steered right for the vessel and in the course of an hour was not more than a mile from her their suppositions were correctit was one of the sicilian government galleys bilged on the rocks and they now perceived that there were people on board of her making signals with their shirts and pieces of linen they must be the galleyslaves for i perceive that they do not one of them change their positions the galley must have been abandoned by their officers and seamen and the slaves left to perish thats very hard observed jack to gascoigne they were condemned to the galleys but not to death they will not have much mercy from the waves replied gascoigne they will all be in kingdom come tomorrow morning if the breeze comes more on the land we have already come up two points this forenoon although captain wilson did not join in this conversation which he overheard as he stood on the forecastle gun with his glass over the hammocks it appears he was of the same opinion but he demurred he had to choose between allowing so many of his fellow creatures to perish miserably or to let loose upon society a set of miscreants who would again enter a course of crime until they were recaptured and by so doing probably displease the sicilian authorities after some little reflection he resolved that he would take his chance of the latter the aurora was hoveto in stays and the two cutters ordered to be lowered down and the boats crew to be armed mr easy do you take one cutter and the armourers pull on board of the galley release those people and land them in small divisions mr gascoigne you will take the other to assist mr easy and when he lands them in his boat you will pull by hit side ready to act in case of any hostile attempt on the part of the scoundrels for we must not expect gratitude of course land them at the nearest safe spot for debarkation in pursuance of these orders our two midshipmen pulled away to the vessel they found her fixed hard upon the rocks which had pierced her slight timbers and as they had supposed the respectable part of her crew with the commander had taken to the boats leaving the galleyslaves to their fate she pulled fifty oars but had only thirtysix manned these oars were forty feet long and ran in from the tholepin with a loom six feet long each manned by four slaves who were chained to their seat before it by a running chain made fast by a padlock in amidships a plank of two feet wide ran fore and aft the vessel between the two banks of oars for the boatswain to apply the lash to those who did not sufficiently exert themselves viva los inglesos cried the galleyslaves as easy climbed up over the quarter of the vessel i say ned did you ever see such a precious set of villains observed easy as he surveyed the faces of the men who were chained no replied gascoigne and i think if the captain had seen them as we have that he would have left them where they were i dont knowbut however our orders are positive armourer knock off all the padlocks beginning aft when we have a cargo we will land them how many are theretwelve dozentwelve dozen villains to let loose upon society i have a great mind to go on board again and report my opinion to the captainone hundred and fortyfour villains who all deserve hangingfor drowning is too good for them our orders are to liberate them jack yes but i should like to argue this point with captain wilson theyll send after them fast enough jack and theyll all be in limbo again before long replied gascoigne well i suppose we must obey orders but it goes against my conscience to save such villainouslooking rascals armourer hammer away the armourer who with the seamen appeared very much of jacks opinion and had not commenced his work now struck off the padlocks one by one with his sledgehammer as soon as they were released the slaves were ordered into the cutter and when it was sufficiently loaded jack shoved off followed by gascoigne as guard and landed them at the point about a cables length distant it required six trips before they were all landed the last cargo were on shore and easy was desiring the men to shove off when one of the galleriens turned round and cried out to jack in a mocking tone addio signor a reveder la jack started stared and in the squalid naked wretch who addressed him he recognised don silvio i will acquaint don rebiera of your arrival signor said the miscreant springing up the rocks and mixing with the rest who now commenced hooting and laughing at their preservers ned observed easy to gascoigne we have let that rascal loose mores the pity replied gascoigne but we have only obeyed orders it cant be helped but ive a notion there will be some mischief out of this we obeyed orders replied gascoigne weve let the rascals loose not ten miles from don rebieras obeyed orders jack with a whole gang to back him if he goes there orders jack agnes at his mercy captains orders jack i shall argue this point when i go on board replied jack too late jack yes replied easy sinking down on the stem sheets with a look of despair give way my lads give way jack returned on board and reported what he had done also that don silvio was among those liberated and he ventured to mention his fears of what might take place from their contiguity to the house of don rebiera captain wilson bit his lips he felt that his philanthropy had induced him to act without his usual prudence i have done a rash thing mr easy i am afraid i should have taken them all on board and delivered them up to the authorities i wish i had thought of that before we must get to palermo as fast as we can and have the troops sent after these miscreants hands bout ship fill the main yard the wind had veered round and the aurora was now able to lay up clear of the island of maritimo the next morning she anchored in palermo roads and gave immediate notice to the authorities who wishing captain wilsons philanthropy at the devil immediately despatched a large body of troops in quest of the liberated malefactors captain wilson feeling for jacks anxiety about his friends called him over to him on deck and gave him and gascoigne permission to go on shore will you allow me to take mesty with me sir if you please said jack yes mr easy but recollect that even with mesty you are no match for one hundred and fifty men so be prudent i send you to relieve your anxiety not to run into danger of course sir replied jack touching his hat and walking away quietly till he came to the hatchway when he darted down like a shot and was immediately occupied with his preparations in half an hour our two midshipmen with mesty had landed and proceeded to the inn where they had put up before they were armed up to the teeth their first inquiries were for don philip and his brother both on leave of absence replied the landlord and staying with don rebiera thats some comfort thought jack now we must get horses as fast as we can mesty can you ride by all de power can i ride massa easy suppose you ride kentucky horse you ride anyting in half an hour four horses and a guide were procured and at eight oclock in the morning the party set off in the direction of don rebieras country seat they had not ridden more than six miles when they came up with one of the detachments sent out in pursuit of the liberated criminals our hero recognised the commanding officer as an old acquaintance and imparting to him the release of don silvio and his fears upon don rebieras account begged him to direct his attention that way corpo di baccoyou are right signor mid replied the officer but don philip is there and his brother too i believe i will be there by ten oclock tomorrow morning we will march almost the whole night they have no arms observed easy no but they will soon get them they will go to some small town in a body plunder it and then seek the protection of the mountains your captain has given us a pretty job jack exchanged a few more words and then excusing himself on account of his haste put the spurs to his horse and regained his own party who now proceeded at a rapid pace o signor said the guide we shall kill the horses ill pay for them said jack yes but we shall kill them before we get there jack replied gascoigne and have to walk the rest of the way very true ned lets pull up and give them their wind by de holy poker massa easy but my shirt stick to my ribs cried mesty whose black face was hung with dewdrops from their rapid course never mind mesty it was about five oclock in the afternoon when they arrived at the seat of don rebiera jack threw himself off his jaded steed and hastened into the house followed by gascoigne they found the whole family collected in the large sittingroom quite ignorant of any danger threatening them and equally astonished and pleased at the arrival of their old friends jack flew to agnes who screamed when she saw him and felt so giddy afterwards that he was obliged to support her having seated her again he was kindly greeted by the old people and the two young officers after a few minutes dedicated to mutual inquiries our hero stated the cause of their expeditious arrival don silvio with one hundred and fifty galleriens let loose on the coast yesterday afternoon exclaimed don rebiera you are right i only wonder they were not here last night but i expect pedro from the town he has gone down with a load of wine he will bring us intelligence at all events we must be prepared said don philip the troops you say will be here tomorrow morning holy virgin exclaimed the ladies in a breath how many can we muster said gascoigne we have five men here or we shall have by the evening replied don philipall i think good menmy father my brother and myself we are threefour with the guide whom i know nothing about twelve in allnot one too many but i think that now we are prepared if they attack we can hold out till the morning had we not better send the ladies away said jack who is to escort them replied don philip we shall only weaken our force besides they may fall into the miscreants hands shall we all leave the house together they can but plunder it observed don rebiera still we may be intercepted by them and our whole force will be nothing against so many observed don philip if we are without defence whereas in the house we shall have an advantage evero replied don rebiera thoughtfully then let us prepare for depend upon it don silvio will not lose such an opportunity to wreak his vengeance he will be here tonight i only wonder he has not been here with his companions before however pedro will arrive in two hours we must now see what means we have of defence said philip come brotherwill you come sir chapter xxxi a regular setto in which the parties beaten are not knocked down but rise higher and higher at each discomfiturenothing but the troops could have prevented them from going up to heaven don rebiera and his two sons quitted the room gascoigne entered into conversation with the senora while easy took this opportunity of addressing agnes he had been too much occupied with the consultation to pay her much attention before he had spoken with his eyes fixed upon her and had been surprised at the improvement which had taken place in less than a year he now went to her and asked her in a low voice whether she had received his letter oh yes replied she colouring and were you angry with what i said agnes in a low tone no replied she casting her eyes down on the floor i repeat now what i said agnesi have never forgotten you but but what father thomaso what of him he never will will what you are a heretic he says tell him to mind his own business he has great influence with my father and mother your brothers are on our side i know that but there will be great difficulty our religion is not the same he must talk to youhe will convert you well argue that point agnes i will convert him if he has common sense if not its no use arguing with him where is he he will soon be at home tell me agnes if you had your own will would you marry me i dont know i have never seen anyone i liked so well is that all is it not enough for a maiden to say replied agnes raising her eyes and looking reproachfully signor let me go here comes my father notwithstanding jack cast his eyes to the window where gascoigne and the senora were in converse and perceiving that the old ladys back was turned he pressed agnes to his bosom before he released her the gentlemen then returned with all the firearms and destructive weapons they could collect we have enough observed don philip to arm all the people we have with us and we are well armed replied jack who had left agnes standing alone what now are your plans those we must now consult about it appears but at this moment the conversation was interrupted by the sudden entrance of pedro who had been despatched to the town with the load of wine he rushed in flurried and heated with his red cap in his hand how now pedro back so early o signor exclaimed the manthey have taken the cart and the wine and have drawn it away up to the mountains who inquired don rebiera the galleyslaves who have been let looseand by the body of our blessed saint they have done pretty mischiefthey have broken into the houses robbed everythingmurdered manyclothed themselves with the bestcollected all the arms provisions and wine they could lay their hands on and have marched away into the mountains this took place last night as i was coming down within a mile of the town they met me with my loaded cart and they turned the bullocks round and drove them away along with the rest by the blessed virgin but they are stained with blood but not altogether of men for they have cut up some of the oxen i heard this from one of the herdsmen but he too fled and could not tell me more but signor i heard them mention your name i have no doubt of it replied don rebiera as for the wine i only hope they will drink too much of it tonight but pedro they will be here and we must defend ourselvesso call the men together i must speak to them we shall never see the bullocks again observed pedro mournfully no but we shall never see one another again if we do not take care i have information they come here tonight holy saint francis and they say there are a thousand of them not quite so many to my knowledge observed jack they told me that a great many were killed in their attack upon the town before they mastered it so much the better go now pedro drink a cup of wine and then call the other men the house was barricaded as well as circumstances would permit the first story was also made a fortress by loading the landing place with armoires and chests of drawers the upper story or attic if it might be so called was defended in the same way that they might retreat from one to the other if the doors were forced it was eight oclock in the evening before all was ready and they were still occupied with the last defence under the superintendence of mesty who showed himself an able engineer when they heard the sound of an approaching multitude they looked out of one of the windows and perceived the house surrounded by the galleyslaves in number apparently about a hundred they were all dressed in a most fantastic manner with whatever they could pick up some had firearms but the most of them were supplied with only swords or knives with them came also their cortege of plunder carts of various descriptions loaded with provisions of all sorts and wine women lashed down with ropes sails from the vessels and boats to supply them with covering in the mountains hay and straw and mattresses their plunder appeared to be well chosen for their exigencies to the carts were tied a variety of cattle intended to accompany them to their retreat they all appeared to be under a leader who was issuing directionsthat leader was soon recognised by those in the house to be don silvio massa easy you show me dat man said mesty when he heard the conversation between easy and the rebieras only let me know him do you see him there mesty walking down in front of those men he has a musket in his hand a jacket with silver buttons and white trousers yes massa easy me see him welllet me look little moredat enough the galleyslaves appeared to be very anxious to surround the house that no one should escape and don silvio was arranging the men ned said jack let us show him that we are here he said that he would acquaint don rebiera with our arrivallet us prove to him that he is too late it would not be a bad plan replied gascoigne if it were possible that these fellows had any gratitude among them some of them might relent at the idea of attacking those who saved them not a bit but it will prove to them that there are more in the house than they think for and we can frighten some of them by telling them that the soldiers are near at hand jack immediately threw up the casement and called out in a loud voice don silvio galleyslave don silvio the party hailed turned round and beheld jack gascoigne and mesty standing at the window of the upper floor we have saved you the trouble of announcing us called out gascoigne we are here to receive you and in three hours the troops will be here so you must be quick don silvio continued jack a reveder la continued gascoigne letting fly his pistol at don silvio the window was then immediately closed the appearance of our heroes and their communication of the speedy arrival of the troops was not without effect the criminals trembled at the idea don silvio was mad with rage he pointed out to the men the necessity of immediate attackthe improbability of the troops arriving so soon and the wealth which he expected was locked up by don rebiera in his mansion this rallied them and they advanced to the doors which they attempted to force without success losing several men by the occasional fire from those within the house finding their efforts after half an hours repeated attempts to be useless they retreated and then bringing up a long piece of timber which required sixty men to carry it they ran with it against the door and the weight and impetus of the timber drove it off its hinges and an entrance was obtained by this time it was dark the lower story had been abandoned but the barricade at the head of the stairs opposed their progress convenient loopholes had been prepared by the defenders who now opened a smart fire upon the assailants the latter having no means of returning it effectually had they had ammunition for their muskets which fortunately they had not been able to procure the combat now became fierce and the galleyslaves were several times repulsed with great loss during a contest of two hours but encouraged by don silvio and refreshed by repeated draughts of wine they continued by degrees removing the barriers opposed to them we shall have to retreat exclaimed don rebiera very soon they will have torn down all what do you think signor easy hold this as long as we can how are we off for ammunition plenty as yetplenty to last for six hours i think what do you say mesty by holy st patrig i say hold out herethey got no firearms and we ab um at armlength this decision was the occasion of the first defence being held for two hours more an occasional relief being afforded by the retreat of the convicts to the covered carts at last it was evident that the barricade was no longer tenable for the heavy pieces of furniture they had heaped up to oppose entrance were completely hammered to fragments by poles brought up by the assailants and used as batteringrams the retreat was sounded they all hastened to the other story where the ladies were already placed and the galleyslaves were soon in possession of the first floor exasperated by the defence mad with wine and victory but finding nothing again was the attack made upon the second landing but as the stairs were now narrower and their defences stronger in proportion they for a long while gained no advantage on the contrary many of their men were wounded and taken down below the darkness of the night prevented both parties from seeing distinctly which was rather in favour of the assailants many climbed over the fortress of piledup furniture and were killed as soon as they appeared on the other side and at last the only ammunition used was against those who made this rash attempt for four long hours did this assault and defence continue until daylight came and then the plan of assault was altered they again brought up the poles hammered the pieces of furniture into fragments and gained ground the defenders were worn out with fatigue but flinched not they knew that their lives and the lives of those dearest to them were at stake and they never relaxed their exertions still the criminals with silvio at their head progressed the distance between the parties gradually decreased and there was but one massive chest of drawers now defending the landingplace and over which there was a constant succession of blows from long poles and cutlasses returned with the bullets from their pistols we must now fight for our lives exclaimed gascoigne to easy for what else can we do doget on the roof and fight there then replied jack bythebye thats well thought of jack said gascoigne mesty up and see if there is any place we can retreat to in case of need mesty hastened to obey and soon returned with a report that there was a trapdoor leading into the loft under the roof and that they could draw the ladder up after them then we may laugh at them cried jack mesty stay here while i and gascoigne assist the ladies up explaining to the rebieras and to their domestics why they went easy and gascoigne hastened to the signora and agnes conducted them up the ladder into the loft and requested them to have no fear they then returned to the defences on the stairs and joined their companions they found them hard pressed and that there was little chance of holding out much longer but the stairs were narrow and the assailants could not bring their force against them but now as the defences were nearly destroyed although the convicts could not reach them with their knives they brought up a large supply of heavy stones which they threw with great force and execution two of don rebieras men and don martin were struck down and this new weapon proved most fatal we must retreat jack said gascoigne the stones can do no harm where we are going to what think you don philip i agree with you let those who are wounded be first carried up and then we will follow this was effected and as soon as the wounded men were carried up the ladder and the arms taken up to prevent their falling into the hands of the assailants for they were now of little use to them the ammunition being exhausted the whole body went into the large room which contained the trapdoor of the loft and as soon as they were up they drew the ladder after them they had hardly effected this when they were followed with the yells and shouting of the galleyslaves who had passed the last barriers and thought themselves sure of their prey but they were disappointedthey found them more secure than ever nothing could exceed the rage of don silvio at the protracted resistance of the party and the security of their retreat to get at them was impossible so he determined to set fire to the room and suffocate them if he could do no otherwise he gave his directions to his men who rushed down for straw but in so doing he carelessly passed under the trapdoor and mesty who had carried up with him two or three of the stones dashed one down on the head of don silvio who fell immediately he was carried away but his orders were put in execution the room was filled with straw and fodder and lighted the effects were soon felt the trapdoor had been shut but the heat and smoke burst through after a time the planks and rafters took fire and their situation was terrible a small trapwindow in the roof on the side of the house was knocked open and gave them a temporary relief but now the rafters burned and crackled and the smoke burst on them in thick columns they could not see and with difficulty could breathe fortunately the room below that which had been fired was but one out of four on the attics and as the loft they were in spread over the whole of the roof they were able to remove far from it the house was slated with massive slate of some hundred weights each and it was not found possible to remove them so as to give air although frequent attempts were made donna rebiera sank exhausted in the arms of her husband and agnes fell into those of our hero who enveloped in the smoke kissed her again and again and she poor girl thinking that they must all inevitably perish made no scruple in what she supposed her last moment of returning these proofs of her ardent attachment massy easy help me heremassa gascoigne come here now heab wid all your might when we get one off we get plenty summoned by mesty jack and gascoigne put their shoulders to one of the lower slates it yielded was disengaged and slid down with a loud rattling below the ladies were brought to it and their heads put outside they soon recovered and now that they had removed one they found no difficulty in removing others in a few minutes they were all with their heads in the open air but still the house was on fire below and they had no chance of escape it was while they were debating upon that point and consulting as to their chance of safety that a breeze of wind wafted the smoke that issued from the roof away from them and they beheld the detachment of troops making up to the house a loud cheer was given and attracted the notice of the soldiers they perceived easy and his companions the house was surrounded and entered in an instant the galleyslaves who were in the house searching for the treasure reported by don silvio to be concealed were captured or killed and in five minutes the troops had possession but how to assist those above was the difficulty the room below was in flames and burning fiercely there were no ladders that could reach so high and there were no means of getting to them the commandant made signs from below as if to ask what he was to do i see no chance observed don philip mournfully easy my dear fellow and you gascoigne i am sorry that the feuds of our family should have brought you to such a dreadful death but what can be done i dont know replied jack unless we could get ropes you quite sure massy easy that all galley rascals below gone asked mesty yes replied easy you may see that look at some of them bound there under charge of the soldiers den sar i tink it high time we go too so do i mesty but how how stop a little come help me massy easy dis board for the loft was floored is loose come help all of you they all went and with united strength pulled up the board now strike like helland drive down de plaster said mesty commencing the operation in a few minutes they had beaten an opening into one of the rooms below not on fire pulled up another board and mesty having fetched the ladder they all descended in safety and to the astonishment of the commandant of the troops walked out of the door of the house those who had been stunned with the stones having so far recovered as to require little assistance the soldiers shouted as they saw them appear supporting the females the commanding officer who was an intimate friend of don philip flew to his arms the prisoners were carefully examined by mesty and don silvio was not among them he might however be among the dead who were left in the house which now began to burn furiously the galleyslaves who were captured amounted in number to fortyseven their dead they could not count the major part of the plunder and the carts were still where they had been drawn up as soon as the culprits had been secured the attention of the troops was directed to putting out the flames but their attempts were ineffectual the mansion was burned to the bare walls and but little of the furniture saved indeed the major part of it had been destroyed in the attack made by don silvio and his adherents leaving directions with pedro and his people that the property collected by the miscreants should be restored to the owners don rebiera ordered the horses and with the whole party put himself under the protection of the troops who as soon as they had been refreshed and taken some repose bent their way back to palermo with the galleyslaves bound and linked together in a long double row they halted when they had gone halfway and remained for the night the next day at noon don rebiera and his family were once more in their palazzo and our two midshipmen and mesty took their leave and repaired on board to make themselves a little less like chimneysweepers captain wilson was not out of the ship jack made his report and then went down below very much pleased at what had passed especially as he would have another long yarn for the governor on his return to malta chapter xxxii in which our hero and gascoigne ought to be ashamed of themselves and did feel what might be called midshipmite compunction the aurora continued three weeks at palermo during which the most active search had been made for the remainder of the galleyslaves and some few had been captured but still don silvio a considerable number were at large and it was said that they had retired to the fastnesses in the mountains our hero was constantly on shore at don rebieras house and after what had passed he was now looked upon as soon to become a member of the family the difference of religion was overlooked by don rebiera and the relationsby all but the confessor father thomaso who now began to agitate and fulminate into the ears of the donna rebiera all the pains and penalties attending heretical connection such as excommunication and utter damnation the effects of his remonstrances were soon visible and jack found that there was constraint on the part of the old lady tears on the part of agnes and all father confessors heartily wished at the devil ten times a day on the part of don philip and his brother at last he wormed the truth out of agnes who told her tale and wept bitterly ned i dont much like the appearance of things observed jack i must get rid of that father thomaso youll find that rather difficult observed gascoigne besides if you were rid of him you would have his place filled up with another he has frightened that poor old woman into the dismals and she has the pains of purgatory on her already i shall go and talk to mesty how can mesty help you i dont know but you cant so for want of better advice ill try the ashantee our hero went to mesty and laid the difficult affair open to him i see said mesty showing his filed teeth you want him skull no i dont mesty but i want him out of the way how that possible massy easyship sail day after tomorrow now pose i ab time i soon manage all dat stop a little confound it but theres no stopping replied jack suppose massy easy you get leave go on shorenot come off again that will be deserting mesty by holy poker i ab ityou go on shore and break your leg break my legbreak my leave you mean no massy easyyou break your legden captain leave you shore and leave me to take care of you but why should i break my leg and how am i to break my leg only pretend break leg massa easy go talk massa don philip he manage all dat suppose man break his leg in seven pieces it is not possible to take him board seven pieces mesty thats rather too many however ill think of this jack then went back and consulted gascoigne who approved of mestys advice and thought the scheme feasible if we could only pretend that we were thrown out of a caricola you break your leg a compound fracture of course i break my armboth left on shore at sick quarters with mesty to take care of us capital indeed replied jack i really would not mind it if it really took place at all events well overturn the caricola but shall we get leave the last day yes its two days since i have been on shore for i have not liked to go to don rebieras since what agnes told me besides my clothes are all on shore and that will be an excuse for a few hours our two midshipmen applied for leave the next morning to be off in the afternoon the first lieutenant gave them permission they hastened to the hotel sent for don philip and made him a party to their plan he readily promised his assistance for he had resolved that our hero should marry his sister and was fearful of the effect of his absence coupled with friar thomasos influence over his mother he went to the surgeon of his regiment who immediately entered into the scheme our two midshipmen got into a caricola rattled up and down the streets and perceiving captain wilson at his window flogged the horse into a gallop when abreast of the barracks jack ran the wheel against a bank and threw himself and gascoigne out midshipmen are never hurt by these accidents but fortunately for the success of the enterprise their faces were cut and bruised don philip was standing by he called the men to pick up our two scamps carried them into the barracks and sent for the surgeons who undressed them put jacks left leg into a multitude of splints and did the same to gascoignes arm they were then put to bed their contused faces with the blood left in statu quo while don philip sent an orderly as from the commandant to captain wilson to acquaint him that two of his officers had been thrown out of a caricola and were lying dangerously hurt at the barracks good heavens it must be mr easy and mr gascoigne said captain wilson when the intelligence was communicated i saw them galloping down the street like two madmen just now coxswain take the gig on board and then tell the surgeon to come on shore immediately and bring him up to me at the barracks captain wilson then put on his hat buckled on his sword and hastened to ascertain the extent of the injury don philip kept out of the way but the captain was ushered into the room by one of the officers where he found in two beds our two midshipmen stretched out the surgeon of the forces and the regimental surgeon in consultation between them while attendants were standing by each bed with restoratives the medical gentlemen saluted captain wilson and looked very grave talked about fractures contusions injuries in the most interminable mannerhoped that mr easy would recoverbut had doubts the other gentleman might do well with care that is so far as his arm was concerned but there appeared to be a concussion of the brain captain wilson looked at the cut and bloodsmeared faces of the two young men and waited with anxiety the arrival of his own surgeon who came at last puffing with the haste he had made and received the report of the brothers of the faculty the leg of mr easy fractured in two placeshad been setbone protrudingimpossible to move him gascoigne arm compound fracturecontusion of the brain not certain now that all this would have been discovered to be false if the surgeon had been able to examine is true but how could he not credit the surgeon of the forces and the regimental surgeon and how could he put the young men to fresh tortures by removing splints and unsetting limbs politeness if nothing else prevented his so doing for it would have been as much as to say that either he did not credit their report or that he doubted their skill he looked at our hero and his companion who kept their eyes closed and breathed heavily with their mouths open put on a grave face as well as his brothers in the art and reported to captain wilson but when can they be moved mr daly inquired the latter i cannot wait we must sail tomorrow or the next day at the farthest the surgeon as in duty bound put the question to the others who replied that there would be great risk in moving before the fever which might be expected the next day and which might last ten days but that captain wilson had better not think of removing them as they should have every care and attention where they were and could rejoin the ship at malta mr daly the surgeon agreed that this would be the most prudent step and captain wilson then gave his consent that being settled he walked up to the bed of gascoigne and spoke to him but gascoigne knew that he was to have a concussion of the brain and he made no reply nor gave any signs of knowing that captain wilson was near him he then went to our hero who at the sound of captain wilsons voice slowly opened his eyes without moving his head and appeared to recognise him are you in much pain easy said the captain kindly easy closed his eyes again and murmured mesty mesty he wants his servant the ships corporal sir said the surgeon well replied captain wilson he had better have him he is a faithful fellow and will nurse him well when you go on board mr daly desire the first lieutenant to send mesty on shore with mr gascoignes and mr easys chests and his own bag and hammock good heavens i would not for a thousand pounds that this accident had occurred poor foolish boysthey run in couples and if ones in a scrape the other is sure to share it gentlemen i return you many thanks for your kindness and i must accept of your promised care for my unfortunate officers i sail tomorrow at daylight you will oblige me by informing their friends the rebieras of their mischance as i am sure they will contribute all they can to their comfort so saying captain wilson bowed and quitted the room followed by the surgeon as soon as the door was closed the two midshipmen turned their heads round and looked at each other but they were afraid to speak at first in case of the return of the surgeon as soon as it was announced to them that captain wilson and mr daly were outside the barrackgate our hero commenceddo you know ned that my conscience smites me and if it had not been that i should have betrayed those who wish to oblige us when poor captain wilson appeared so much hurt and annoyed at our accident i was very near getting up and telling him of the imposition to relieve his mind i agree with you jack and i felt much the samebut whats done cannot be undone we must now keep up the imposition for the sake of those who to help us have deceived him i dont think that you would find an english surgeon who would have consented to such an imposition no that is certain but after all it is an imposition that has hurt nobody oh i do not wish to moralisebut i repent of my share in the deceit and had it to be done over again i would not consent to it not even for but i wont mention her name in barracks i dont know replied jack but lets say no more about it and thank these gentlemen for their kindness yes but we must keep it up until we see the aurora under all sail and longer too replied jack we must not let the affair get wind even on shore we must not recover quickly but still appear to recover don rebiera and his wife must be deceived i have a plot in my head but i cannot work it out clear till i see mesty don philip now came in he had seen captain wilson who had requested him to look after the two invalids and stated his intention to sail the next morning they consulted with him and it was agreed that no one should be acquainted with the real fact but his brother martin and that all palermo should be as much deceived as captain wilson for if not it would put father thomaso on the qui vive and make him fulminate more than ever our midshipmen ate an excellent dinner and then remained in bed conversing till it was time to go to sleep but long before that mesty had made his appearance with their clothes the eyes of the ashantee said all that was necessaryhe never spoke a word but unlashed his hammock and lay down in a corner and they were soon all three asleep the next morning captain wilson called to ascertain how our hero and his companion were but the room had been darkened and he could not see their faces plainly easy thanked him for his kindness in allowing mesty to attend them and having received his orders as to their joining the ship as soon as they recovered and having promised to be very cautious in their behaviour and keep out of all scrapes he wished them a speedy recovery and departed in little more than half an hour afterwards mesty who had been peeping out of the shutters suddenly threw them open with a loud laugh the aurora was under way with studding sails below and aloft standing out of the roads jack and gascoigne got up threw off the splints and danced about in their shirts as soon as they were quiet again mesty said in a grave tone den why you stay at sea massa easy very true mesty ive asked myself that question often enough lately because im a fool i suppose and i because i cant help it replied gascoigne never mind we are on shore now and i look for a famous cruise but first we must see what the ground is we are to cruise on replied jack so mesty let us have a palaver as they say in your country the two midshipmen got into their beds and mesty sat on the chest between them looking as grave as a judge the question was how to get rid of the padre thomaso was he to be thrown over the molehead to the fishesor his skull brokewas mestys knife to be resorted towas he to be kidnapped or poisonedor were fair means to be employedpersuasion bribery every one knows how difficult it is to get rid of a priest as our hero and gascoigne were not italians they thought that bribery would be the more englishlike way of doing the thing so they composed a letter to be delivered by mesty to the friar in which jack offered to father thomaso the moderate sum of one thousand dollars provided he would allow the marriage to proceed and not frighten the old lady with ecclesiastical squibs and crackers as mesty was often on shore with jack and knew the friar very well by sight it was agreed that the letter should be confided to his charge but as it was not consistent that a person in such a state as our hero was represented to be should sit up and write letters the delivery was deferred for a few days when after waiting that time mesty delivered the letter to the friar and made signs that he was to take back the answer the friar beckoned him that he was to accompany him to his room where he read the letter and then again made signs to him to follow him the friar led the way to his monastery and as soon as mesty was in his cell he summoned another who could speak english to act as interpreter is your master recovering yes replied mesty he is at present doing well have you served him long no replied mesty are you very fond of him does he treat you well give you plenty of money at these questions the artful black conceived that there was something in the wind and he therefore very quietly replied i do not care much for him the friar fixed his keen eye upon mesty and perceived there was a savage look about the black from which he augured that he was a man who would suit his purpose your master offers me a thousand dollars would you wish to gain this money for yourself mesty grinned and showed his sharpfiled teeth it would make me a rich man in my own country it would replied the friar now you shall have it if you will only give your master a small powder i understand replied mesty hab those things in my country welldo you consentif so i will write the letter to get the money suppose they find me out replied mesty you will be safe and you shall be sent away as soon as possible say will you consent the whole thousand dollars every one of them den give me the powder stay a little replied the friar who went out of the cell and in about ten minutes returned with an answer to our heros letter and a paper containing a greyish powder give him this in his soup or anythingspread it on his meat or mix it up with his sugar if he eats an orange i see replied mesty the dollars shall be yours i swear it on the holy cross mesty grinned horribly took his credentials and then asked when i come again as soon as you have received the money bring it to me at don rebierasthen give the powder as soon as it is given you must let me know for you must not remain in palermo i will myself conduct you to a place of safety mesty then quitted the cell and was shown out of the monastery by de holy poker he one dn rascal muttered mesty as he was once in the open air but stop a little the ashantee soon arrived at the barracks and repeated the whole of the conference between him and friar thomaso it must be poison of course observed gascoigne suppose we try it upon some animal no massa gascoigne replied mesty i try it myself byandbye now what we do i must give you the order for the thousand dollars mesty replied jack the rascal here writes to me that for that sum he will consent not only not to oppose me but agrees to assist my cause but the great question is whether he will keep his word with you mesty if not i shall lose my money so therefore we must now have another palaver and argue the point the point was argued between jack and gascoigne a thousand dollars was a large sum but jacks father was a philosopher after many pros and cons it was at last decided that the money should be given to mesty but mesty should state when he took the money to the friar that he had administered the powder and claim it when he presented it the next day the order for the money was given to mesty and he went to friar thomaso with it the friar hastened with mesty to the monastery and sent for the interpreter you have given it inquired the friar yesnot one hour ago here de order for de money you must run for the money before he is dead for the powder is very rapid and me replied mesty apparently much alarmed where am i to go as soon as you bring the money here you must go back to the barracks remain there till he is dead and then return here i will have all ready and take you as soon as it is dusk to a monastery of our order in the mountains where no one will think of looking for you till the affair is blown over and then i will find you a passage in some vessel out of the island mesty hastened for the money and taking it in a large bag to the monastery delivered it to the friars charge and then returned to the barracks to easy and gascoigne it was agreed that he should go with the friar who would probably remain away some time indeed mesty insisted upon so doing mesty stayed two hours and then returned about dusk to the monastery and reported the death of our hero he remained there until it was dark and then the friar ordered him to tie the bag of dollars to his saddlebow they mounted two mules which stood already caparisoned and quitted palermo in the morning don philip as usual made his appearance and told our hero that the friar had been summoned away by the abbot and would not return for some time i came to tell you this news said don philip as i thought it would please you the sooner you are now well the better i mean to propose your being both removed to my fathers palazzo and then you can recover your lost ground during the confessors absence and i have the means replied jack showing the friars letter don philip read it with astonishment but was still more surprised when he heard the whole story from jack he was for a time silent at last he said i am sorry for your poor black why so replied jack you will never see him again depend upon it a thousand dollars would sign the death warrant of a thousand blacks but there is another reasonthey will put him out of the way that he may not give evidence where is the powder mesty has it he would not part with it he is a shrewd fellow that black he may be too much for the friar replied don philip he means mischief im sure replied gascoigne still i feel a great deal of alarm about him replied easy i wish now that i had not let him go are you sure that he went no i am not but the friar told him that he should take him to the mountains as soon as it was dark and probably he will replied don philip as the best place to get rid of him however the whole of this story must be told both to my father and my mother to the former that he may take the right measures and to my mother that it may open her eyes give me the copy of the letter you wrote to the friar and then i shall have it all the report of the accident which had occurred to easy and gascoigne had been spread and fully believed throughout palermo indeed as usual it had been magnified and asserted that they could not recover to agnes only had the case been imparted in confidence by don philip for her distress at the first intelligence had been so great that her brother could not conceal it two days after don philip had made his parents acquainted with the villainy of the friar the midshipmen were transported to the palazzo much to the surprise of everybody and much to the renown of the surgeons who were indemnified for their duplicity and falsehood by an amazing extension of their credit as skilful men after their arrival at the palazzo don rebiera was also entrusted with the secret but it went no farther as now there was no particular hurry for our hero to get well he was contented and happy in the society of agnes and her parents the old lady after she had been informed of the conduct of friar thomaso having turned round in our heros favour and made a vow never to have a confessor in the house again jack and gascoigne were now as happy as could be all their alarm was about mesty for whose return they were most anxious to don rebiera jack made known formally his intentions with regard to agnes he fully satisfied him as to his qualifications and his property and don rebiera was fully aware of his debt of gratitude to our hero but all he required was the consent of jacks father and until this was obtained he would not consent to the marriage taking place jack attempted to argue the point his father he said had married without consulting him and therefore he had a right to marry without consulting his father but don rebiera not having any acquaintance with the rights of man and equality did not feel the full force of jacks argument and made it a sine qua non that his parents should write and consent to the alliance before it took place chapter xxxiii in which mesty should be called throughout mephistopheles for it abounds in black cloaks disguises daggers and dark deeds on the fourth evening after the removal of our two midshipmen to the palazzo of don rebiera as they were sitting in company with agnes and don philip in their own room a friar made his appearance at the door they all started for by his height they imagined him to be friar thomaso but no one addressed him the friar shut the door without saying a word and then lifting up his cowl which had been drawn over it discovered the black face of mesty agnes screamed and all sprang from their seats at this unusual and unexpected apparition mesty grinned and there was that in his countenance which said that he had much to communicate where is the friarmesty inquired easy stop a little massasuppose we lock door first and den i tell all

yesterday morning i hide myself all day and come in at night and now massa easy you ab haf de whole truth and you ab your tousand dollarsand you ab got rid of de rascal friar and de dn galleyslave don silvio tell them all this ned said jack who whilst gascoigne was so employed talked with mesty i was very much frightened for you mesty said jack but still i thought you quite as cunning as the friar and so it has turned out but the thousand dollars ought to be yours no sar replied mesty the dollars not mine but i hab plenty of gold in don silvios purseplenty plenty of gold i keep my property massa easy and you keep yours im afraid that this affair may be found out mesty the woman will spread the report of having been attacked by a black friar and that will lead to suspicion as the other friars of the convent knew that you left with friar thomaso so i tink dat but when a man starve he quite forget his thought i dont blame you but now i must talk to don philip suppose you no objection while you talk i eat something from the table then massa easy for i hungry enough to eat de friar mule and all eat my good fellow and drink as much as you please the consultation between our two midshipmen and don philip was not long they perceived the immediate necessity for the departure of mesty and the suspicion which would attach to themselves don philip and agnes left them to go to don rebiera and make him acquainted with what had passed and to ask his advice when they went into the room don rebiera immediately accosted his son have you heard philip that friar thomaso has returned at lastso the servants tell me the report may be fortunate replied don philip but i have another story to tell you he then sat down and imparted to don rebiera all the adventures of mesty don rebiera was for some time in deep thought at last he replied that don silvio is no more is fortunate and the negro would be entitled to reward for his destructionbut for the friar that is a bad business the negro might remain and tell the whole story and the facts might be proved by the evidence of signor easy and the letters but what then we should raise the whole host of the clergy against our house and we have suffered too much from them already the best plan would be the immediate departure not only of the negro but of our two young friends the supposition of friar thomaso being here and their departure with the negro servant to rejoin their ship will remove much suspicion and destroy all inquiry they must be off immediately go to them philip and point out to them the absolute necessity of this measure and tell our young friend that i rigidly adhere to my promise and as soon as he has his fathers sanction i will bestow upon him my daughter in the meantime i will send down and see if a vessel can be chartered for malta our hero and gascoigne fully admitted the wisdom of this measure and prepared for their departure indeed now that don rebieras resolution had been made known to our hero he cared more for obtaining his fathers consent than he did for remaining to enjoy himself at palermo and before noon of the next day all was ready the vessel had been procured jack took his leave of agnes and her mother and accompanied by don rebiera and don phillip for don martin was on duty a few miles from palermo went down to the beach and having bid them farewell embarked with gascoigne and mesty on board of the twomasted lateen which had been engaged and before sunset not a steeple of palermo was to be seen what are you thinking of jack said gascoigne after our hero had been silent half an hour i have been thinking ned that we are well out of it so do i replied gascoigne and here the conversation dropped for a time what are you thinking of now jack said gascoigne after a long pause ive been thinking that ive a good story for the old governor very true replied gascoigne and both were again silent for some time what are you thinking of now jack said gascoigne after another long interval ive been thinking that i shall leave the service replied jack i wish you would take me with you replied gascoigne with a sigh and again they were both in deep contemplation what are you thinking of now jack said gascoigne again of agnes replied our hero well if thats the case ill call you when suppers ready in the meantime ill go and talk with mesty chapter xxxiv jack leaves the service in which he had no business and goes home to mind his own business on the fourth day they arrived at malta and our two midshipmen as soon as they had settled with the padrone of the vessel went up to the government house they found the governor in the veranda who held out both his hands one to each glad to see you my lads well jack hows the legall right dont limp and your arm gascoigne all right sir and as sound as ever it was replied they both then youre in luck and have made more haste than you deserve after your mad pranks but now sit down and i suppose my friend jack you have a story to tell me o yes sir thomas and a very long one then i wont have it now for i expect people on business well have it after dinner get your things up and take possession of your rooms the aurora sailed four days ago youve had a wonderful recovery wonderful sir replied our hero all palermo rings with it well you may go nowi shall see you at dinner wilson will be delighted when he hears that you have got round again for he was lowspirited about it i can tell you which is more than you deserve hes right there said our hero to gascoigne as they walked away when dinner was over jack narrated to the governor the adventures of mesty with which he was much interested but when they were quite alone in the evening the governor called our two midshipmen into the veranda and said now my lads im not going to preach as the saying is but ive been long enough in the world to know that a compound fracture of the leg is not cured in fourteen or sixteen days i ask you to tell me the truth did not you deceive captain wilson on this point i am ashamed to say that we did sir replied easy how did you manage that and why jack then went into further details relative to himself and his amour stating his wish to be left behind and all that had passed well theres some excuse for you but none for the surgeons if any surgeon here had played such a trick i would have hung him as sure as im governor this affair of yours has become serious mr easy we must have some conversation on the matter tomorrow morning the next morning the packet from england was reported off the harbours mouth after breakfast the letters were brought on shore and the governor sent for our hero mr easy here are two letters for you i am sorry to say with black seals i trust that they do not bring the intelligence of the death of any very near relative jack bowed without speaking took the letters and went to his room the first he opened was from his father my dear john you will be much grieved to hear that your poor mother after sitting in the corner for nearly two years waiting for the millennium appeared to pine away whether from disappointment or not i do not know but at last in spite of all dr middleton could do she departed this life and as the millennium would not come to her as she expected it is to be hoped she is gone to the millennium she was a good wife and i always let her have her own way dr middleton does not appear to be satisfied as to the cause of her death and has wished to examine but i said no for i am a philosopher and it is no use looking for causes after effects but i have done since her death what she never would permit me to do during her life i have had her head shaved and examined it very carefully as a phrenologist and most curiously has she proved the truth of the sublime science i will give you the result determination very prominent benevolence small caution extreme veneration not very great philoprogenitiveness strange to say is very large considering she has but one child imagination very strong you know my dear boy she was always imagining some nonsense or another her other organs were all moderate poor dear creature she is gone and we may well wail for a better mother or a better wife never existed and now my dear boy i must request that you call for your discharge and come home as soon as possible i cannot exist without you and i require your assistance in the grand work i have in contemplation the time is at hand the cause of equality will soon triumph the abject slaves now hold up their heads i have electrified them with my speeches but i am getting old and feeble i require my son to leave my mantle to as one prophet did to another and then i will like him ascend in glory your affectionate father nicodemus easy from this it would appear thought jack that my mother is dead and that my father is mad for some time our hero remained in a melancholy mood he dropped many tears to the memory of his mother whom if he had never respected he had much loved and it was not till half an hour had elapsed that he thought of opening the other letter it was from dr middleton my dear boy although not a correspondent of yours i take the right of having watched you through all your childhood and from a knowledge of your disposition to write you a few lines that you have by this time discarded your fathers foolish nonsensical philosophy i am very sure it was i who advised your going away for that purpose and i am sure that as a young man of sense and the heir to a large property you will before this have seen the fallacy of your fathers doctrines your father tells me that he has requested you to come home and allow me to add any weight i may have with you in persuading you to do the same it is fortunate for you that the estate is entailed or you might soon be a beggar for there is no saying what debts he might in his madness be guilty of he has already been dismissed from the magistracy by the lordlieutenant in consequence of his haranguing the discontented peasantry and i may say exciting them to acts of violence and insubordination he has been seen dancing and hurrahing round a stack fired by an incendiary he has turned away his keepers and allowed all poachers to go over the manor in short he is not in his senses and although i am far from advising coercive measures i do consider that it is absolutely necessary that you should immediately return home and look after what will one day be your property you have no occasion to follow the profession with eight thousand pounds per annum you have distinguished yourself now make room for those who require it for their subsistence god bless you i shall soon hope to shake hands with you yours most truly g middleton there was matter for deep reflection in these two letters and jack never felt before how much his father had been in the wrong that he had gradually been weaned from his ideas was true but still he had to a certain degree clung to them as we do to a habit but now he felt that his eyes were opened the silly almost unfeeling letter of his father upon the occasion of his mothers death opened his eyes for a long while jack was in a melancholy meditation and then casting his eyes upon his watch he perceived that it was almost dinnertime that he could eat his dinner was certain and he scorned to pretend to feel what he did not he therefore dressed himself and went down grave it is true but not in tears he spoke little at dinner and retired as soon as it was over presenting his two letters to the governor and asking his advice for the next morning gascoigne followed him and to him he confided his trouble and ned finding that jack was very lowspirited consoled him to the best of his power and brought a bottle of wine which he procured from the butler before they returned to bed jack had given his ideas to his friend which were approved of and wishing him a goodnight he threw himself into bed and was soon fast asleep one thing is certain my good fellow observed the governor to our hero as he gave him back his letters at the breakfast table the next morning that your father is as mad as a march hare i agree with that doctor who appears a sensible man that you had better go home immediately and leave the service altogether sir replied jack why i must say that i do not think you exactly fitted for it i shall be sorry to lose you as you have a wonderful talent for adventure and i shall have no more yams to hear when you return but if i understand right from captain wilson you were brought into the profession because he thought that the service might be of use in eradicating false notions rather than from any intention or necessity of your following it up as a profession i suspect that was the case sir replied jack as for my own part i hardly know why i entered it to find a mares nest my lad ive heard all about it but never mind that the question is now about your leaving it to look after your own property and i think i may venture to say that i can arrange all that matter at once without referring to admiral or captain i will be responsible for you and you may go home in the packet which sails on wednesday for england thank you sir thomas i am much obliged to you replied jack you mr gascoigne i shall of course send out by the first opportunity to rejoin your ship thank you sir thomas i am much obliged to you replied gascoigne making a bow youll break no more arms if you please sir continued the governor a man in love may have some excuse in breaking his leg but you had none i beg your pardon sir if mr easy was warranted in breaking his leg out of love i submit that i could do no less than break my arm out of friendship hold your tongue sir or ill break your head from the very opposite feeling replied the governor goodhumouredly but observe young man i shall keep this affair secret as in honour bound but let me advise you as you have only your profession to look to to follow it up steadily it is high time that you and mr easy were separated he is independent of the service and you are not a young man possessing such ample means will never be fitted for the duties of a junior officer he can do no good for himself and is certain to do much harm to others a continuance of his friendship would probably end in your ruin mr gascoigne you must be aware that if the greatest indulgence had not been shown to mr easy by his captain and first lieutenant he never could have remained in the service so long as he has done as the governor made the last remark in rather a severe tone our two midshipmen were silent for a minute at last jack observed very quietly and yet sir i think considering all i have behaved pretty well you have behaved very well my good lad on all occasions in which your courage and conduct as an officer have been called forth i admit it and had you been sent to sea with a mind properly regulated and without such an unlimited command of money i have no doubt but that you would have proved an ornament to the service even now i think you would if you were to remain in the service under proper guidance and necessary restrictions for you have at least learnt to obey which is absolutely necessary before you are fit to command but recollect what your conduct would have brought upon you if you had not been under the parental care of captain wilson but let us say no more about that a midshipman with the prospect of eight thousand pounds a year is an anomaly which the service cannot admit especially when that midshipman is resolved to take to himself a wife i hope that you approve of that step sir that entirely depends upon the merit of the party which i know nothing of except that she has a pretty face and is of one of the best sicilian families i think the difference of religion a ground of objection we will argue that point sir replied jack perhaps it will be the cause of more argument than you think for mr easy but every man makes his own bed and as he makes it so must he lie down in it what am i to do about mesty sir i cannot bear the idea of parting with him i am afraid that you must i cannot well interfere there he is of little use to the service sir he has been sent to sick quarters as my servant if he may be permitted to go home with me i will procure his discharge as soon as i arrive and send him on board the guardship till i obtain it i think that on the whole he is as well out of the service as in it and therefore i will on consideration take upon myself the responsibility provided you do as you say the conversation was here ended as the governor had business to attend to and jack and gascoigne went to their rooms to make their arrangements the governor is right observed gascoigne it is better that we part jack you have half unfitted me for the service already i have a disgust of the midshipmens berth the very smell of pitch and tar has become odious to me this is all wrong i must forget you and all our pleasant cruises on shore and once more swelter in my greasy jacket when i think that if our pretended accidents were discovered i should be dismissed the service and the misery which that would cause to my poor father i tremble at my escape the governor is right jack we must part but i hope you never will forget me my hand upon it ned command my interest if ever i have anymy moneywhat i have and the house whether it belongs to me or my fatheras far as you are concerned at least i adhere to my notions of perfect equality and abjure them i trust jack as a universal principle i admit as the governor asserts that my father is as mad as a march hare that is sufficient you dont know how glad it makes me to hear you say that the two friends were inseparable during the short time that they remained together they talked over their future prospects their hopes and anticipations and when the conversation flagged gascoigne brought up the name of agnes mestys delight at leaving the service and going home with his patron was indescribable he laid out a portion of his gold in a suit of plain clothes white linen shirts and in every respect the wardrobe of a man of fashion in fact he was now a complete gentlemans gentleman was very particular in frizzing his woolly hairwore a white neckcloth gloves and cane every one felt inclined to laugh when he made his appearance but there was something in mestys look which at all events prevented their doing so before his face the day for sailing arrived jack took leave of the governor thanking him for his great kindness and stating his intention of taking malta in his way out to palermo in a month or two gascoigne went on board with him and did not go down the vessels side till it was more than a mile clear of the harbour chapter xxxv mr easys wonderful invention fully explained by himselfmuch to the satisfaction of our hero and it is to be presumed to that also of the reader at last the packet anchored in falmouth roads jack accompanied by mesty was soon on shore with his luggage threw himself into the mail arrived in london and waiting there two or three days to obtain what he considered necessary from a fashionable tailor ordered a chaise to forest hill he had not written to his father to announce his arrival and it was late in the morning when the chaise drew up at his fathers door jack stepped out and rang the bell the servants who opened the door did not know him they were not the same as those he left where is mr easy demanded jack who are you replied one of the men in a gruff tone by de powers you very soon find out who he is observed mesty stay here and ill see if he is at home stay here stay in the hall like a footman what do you mean you rascal cried jack attempting to push by the man o that wont do here master this is equality hall one mans as good as another not always replied jack knocking him down take that for your insolence pack up your traps and walk out of the house tomorrow morning mesty in the meantime had seized the other by the throat what i do with this fellow massa easy leave him now mesty well settle their account tomorrow morning i presume i shall find my father in the library his father said one of the men to the other hes not exactly a chip off the old block we shall have a change i expect replied the other as they walked away mesty cried jack in an authoritative tone bring those two rascals back to take the luggage out of the chaise pay the position and tell the housekeeper to show you my room and yours come to me for orders as soon as you have done this yes sir replied mesty now come here you dn blackguard and take tings out of chaise or by de holy poker i choak your luff both of you the filed teeth the savage look and determination of mesty had the due effect the men sullenly returned and unloaded the chaise in the meantime jack walked into his fathers study his father was therethe study was lighted up with argand lamps and jack looked with astonishment mr easy was busy with a plaster cast of a human head which he pored over so that he did not perceive the entrance of his son the cast of the skull was divided into many compartments with writing on each but what most astonished our hero was the alteration in the apartment the bookcases and books had all been removed and in the centre suspended from the ceiling was an apparatus which would have puzzled anyone composed of rods in every direction with screws at the end of them and also tubes in equal number one of which communicated with a large airpump which stood on a table jack took a short survey and then walked up to his father and accosted him what exclaimed mr easy is it possibleyes it is my son john im glad to see you johnvery glad indeed continued the old gentleman shaking him by both handsvery glad that you have come home i wanted youwanted your assistance in my great and glorious project which i thank heaven is now advancing rapidly very soon shall equality and the rights of man be proclaimed everywhere the pressure from without is enormous and the bulwarks of our ridiculous and tyrannical constitution must give way king lords and aristocrats landholders tithecollectors church and state thank god will soon be overthrown and the golden age revivedthe millenniumthe true millenniumnot what your poor mother talked about i am at the head of twentynine societies and if my health lasts you will see what i will accomplish now that i have your assistance jack and mr easys eyes sparkled and flashed in all the brilliancy of incipient insanity jack sighed and to turn the conversation he observed you have made a great change in this room sir what may all this be for is it a machine to improve equality and the rights of man my dear son replied mr easy sitting down and crossing his legs complacently with his two hands under his right thigh according to his usual custom when much pleased with himselfwhy my dear son that is not exactly the case and yet you have shown some degree of perception even in your guess for if my invention succeeds and i have no doubt of it i shall have discovered the great art of rectifying the mistakes of nature and giving an equality of organisation to the whole species of introducing all the finer organs of humanity and of destroying the baser it is a splendid invention jack very splendid they may talk of call and spurzheim and all those but what have they done nothing but divided the brain into sections classed the organs and discovered where they reside but what good result has been gained from that the murderer by nature remained a murdererthe benevolent man a benevolent manhe could not alter his organisation i have found out how to change all that surely sir you would not interfere with the organ of benevolence but indeed i must jack i myself am suffering from my organ of benevolence being too large i must reduce it and then i shall be capable of greater things shall not be so terrified by difficulties shall overlook trifles and only carry on great schemes for universal equality and the supreme rights of man i have put myself into that machine every morning for two hours for these last three months and i feel now that i am daily losing a great portion will you do me the favour to explain an invention so extraordinary sir said our hero most willingly my boy you observe that in the centre there is a frame to confine the human head somewhat larger than the head itself and that the head rests upon the iron collar beneath when the head is thus firmly fixed suppose i want to reduce the size of any particular organ i take the boss corresponding to where that organ is situated in the cranium and fix it on it for you will observe that all the bosses inside of the top of the frame correspond to the organs as described in this plaster cast on the table i then screw down pretty tight and increase the pressure daily until the organ disappears altogether or is reduced to the size required i comprehend that part perfectly sir replied jack but now explain to me by what method you contrive to raise an organ which does not previously exist that replied mr easy is the greatest perfection of the whole invention for without i could do that i could have done little i feel convinced that this invention of mine will immortalise me observe all these little bellglasses which communicate with the airpump i shave my patients head grease it a little and fix on the bellglass which is exactly shaped to fit the organ in length and breadth i work the airpump and raise the organ by an exhausted receiver it cannot fail there is my butler now a man who escaped hanging last spring assizes on an undoubted charge of murder i selected him on purpose i have flattened down murder to nothing and i have raised benevolence till its like a wen i am afraid my poor fathers head is an exhausted receiver thought jack who then replied well sir if it succeeds it will be a good invention if it succeedswhy it has succeededit cannot fail it has cost me near two thousand pounds bythebye jack you have drawn very liberally lately and i had some trouble with my own expenses to meet your bills not that i complainbut what with societies and my machine and tenants refusing to pay their rents on the principle that the farms are no more mine than theirs which i admit to be true i have had some difficulty in meeting all demands the governor was right thought jack who now inquired after dr middleton ah poor silly man hes alive yeti believe doing well he is one who will interfere with the business of others complains of my servantsvery silly man indeedbut i let him have his own way so i did your poor mother silly woman mrs easybut never mind that if you please sir i have also a complaint to make of the servants for their insolence to me but we will adjourn if you please as i wish to have some refreshment certainly jack if you are hungry i will go with you complain of my servants say youthere must be some mistakethey are all shaved and wear wigs and i put them in the machine every other morning but i mean to make an alteration in one respect you observe jack it requires more dignity we must raise the whole machinery some feet ascend it with state as a throne for it is the throne of reason the victory of mind over nature as you please sir but i am really hungry just now jack and his father went into the drawingroom and rang the bell not being answered jack rose and rang again my dear sir observed mr easy you must not be in a hurry every man naturally provides for his own wants first and afterwards for those of others now my servants are a set of insolent scoundrels sir and insolence i never permit i knocked one down as i entered your house and with your permission i will discharge two at least tomorrow my dear son exclaimed mr easy you knocked my servant downare you not aware by the laws of equality i am aware of this my dear father replied jack that by all the laws of society we have a right to expect civility and obedience from those we pay and feed pay and feed why my dear sonmy dear jackyou must recollect i recollect sir very well but if your servants do not come to their recollection in a very short time either i or they must quit the house but my dear boy have you forgotten the principles i instilled into you did you not go to sea to obtain that equality foiled by tyranny and despotism here on shore do you not acknowledge and support my philosophy well argue that point tomorrow sirat present i want to obtain my supper and jack rang the bell furiously the butler made his appearance at this last summons and he was followed by mesty who looked like a demon with anger mercy on me whom have we here my servant father exclaimed jack starting up one that i can trust to and who will obey me mesty i wish some supper and wine to be brought immediatelysee that scoundrel gets it ready in a moment if he does not throw him out of the door and lock him out you understand me yes massa grinned mesty now you hab supper very quick or mesty know the reason why follow me sar cried mesty in an imperative tone to the butler quick sar or by de holy poker i show you what mesty can do and mesty grinned in his wrath bring supper and wine immediately said mr easy giving an order such as the butler had never heard since he had been in the house the butler quitted the room followed by the ashantee my dear boy my jacki can make every allowance for hunger it is often the cause of theft and crime in the present unnatural state of societybut really you are too violent the principles your principles are all confounded nonsense father cried jack in a rage what

you will be pleased to summon one of the servants that he may inform the others that the household is under my control for the future the bell was again rung and was this time answered with more expedition jack told the servant in presence of his father that with the consent of the latter he should hereafter take the whole control of the establishment and that mesty would be the majordomo from whom they would receive their orders the man stared and cast an appealing look to mr easy who hesitated and at last said yes william youll apologise to all and say that i have made the arrangement you apologise to none sir cried jack but tell them that i will arrange the whole business tomorrow morning tell the woman to come here and show me my bedroom mesty get your supper and then come up to me if they dare to refuse you recollect who does and point them out tomorrow morning that will do sir away with you and bring flat candlesticks chapter xxxvi in which jack takes up the other side of the argument and proves that he can argue as well on one side as the other this scene may give some idea of the state of mr easys household upon our heros arrival the poor lunatic for such we must call him was at the mercy of his servants who robbed laughed at and neglected him the waste and expense were enormous our hero who found how matters stood went to bed and lay the best part of the night resolving what to do he determined to send for dr middleton and consult him the next morning jack rose early mesty was in the room with warm water as soon as he rang by de power massa easy your fader very silly old man im afraid so replied jack he not right here observed mesty putting his fingers to his head jack sighed and desired mesty to send one of the grooms up to the door when the man knocked he desired him to mount a horse and ride over to dr middleton and request his immediate attendance the man who was really a good servant replied yes sir very respectfully and hastened away jack went down to breakfast and found it all ready but his father was not in the room he went to his study and found him occupied with the carpenter who was making a sort of a frame as the model of the platform or dais to be raised under the wonderful invention mr easy was so busy that he could not come to breakfast so jack took his alone an hour after this dr middletons carriage drove up to the door the doctor heartily greeted our hero my dear sirfor so i suppose i must now call youi am heartily glad that you have returned i can assure you that it is not a moment too soon i have found out that already doctor replied jack sit down have you breakfasted no i have not for i was so anxious to see you that i ordered my carriage at once then sit down doctor and we will talk over matters quietly you of course perceive the state of your father he has been some time quite unfit to manage his own affairs so i am afraid what do you intend to do thenput them in the hands of trustees i will be trustee for myself dr middleton i could not do the other without submitting my poor father to a process and confinement which i cannot think of i can assure you that there are not many in bedlam worse than he is but i perfectly agree with you that is if he will consent to your taking charge of the property a power of attorney will be all that is requisite replied jack that is as soon as i have rid the house of the set of miscreants who are in it and who are now in open mutiny i think replied the doctor that you will have some trouble you know the character of the butler yes i have it from my fathers own mouth i really should take it as a great favour dr middleton if you could stay here a day or two i know that you have retired from practice i would have made the same offer my young friend i will come here with two of my servants for you must discharge these i have one of my own who is worth his weight in goldthat will be sufficient i will dismiss every man you think i ought and as for the women we can give them warning and replace them at leisure that is exactly what i should propose replied the doctor i will now go if you please procure the assistance of a couple of constables and also of your fathers former legal adviser who shall prepare a power of attorney yes replied jack and we must then find out the tenants who refuse to pay upon the principles of equality and he shall serve them with notice immediately i am rejoiced my dear young friend to perceive that your fathers absurd notions have not taken root they lasted some time nevertheless doctor replied jack laughing well then i will only quit you for an hour or two and then as you wish it will take up my quarters here as long as you find me useful in the forenoon dr middleton again made his appearance accompanied by mr hanson the solicitor bringing with him his portmanteau and his servants mr easy had come into the parlour and was at breakfast when they entered he received them very coolly but a little judicious praise of the wonderful invention had its due effect and after jack had reminded him of his promise that in future he was to control the household he was easily persuaded to sign the order for his so doingthat is the power of attorney mr easy also gave up to jack the key of his escritoire and mr hanson possessed himself of the books papers and receipts necessary to ascertain the state of his affairs and the rents which had not yet been paid up in the meantime the constables arrived the servants were all summoned mr hanson showed them the power of attorney empowering jack to act for his father and in less than half an hour afterwards all the menservants but two grooms were dismissed the presence of the constables and mesty prevented any resistance but not without various threats on the part of the butler whose name was orourke thus in twentyfour hours jack had made a reformation in the household mr easy took no notice of anything he returned to his study and his wonderful invention mesty had received the keys of the cellar and had now complete control over those who remained dr middleton mr hanson mr easy and jack sat down to dinner and everything wore the appearance of order and comfort mr easy ate very heartily but said nothing till after dinner when as was his usual custom he commenced arguing upon the truth and soundness of his philosophy bythebye my dear son if i recollect right you told me last night that you were no longer of my opinion now if you please we will argue this point ill argue the point with all my heart sir replied jack will you begin lets fill our glasses cried mr easy triumphantly lets fill our glasses and then i will bring jack back to the proper way of thinking now then my son i trust you will not deny that we are all born equal i do deny it sir replied jack i deny it in totodeny it from the evidence of our own senses and from the authority of scripture to suppose all men were born equal is to suppose that they are equally endowed with the same strength and with the same capacity of mind which we know is not the case i deny it from scripture from which i could quote many passages but i will restrict myself to one the parable of the talents to one he gave five talents to another but one holding them responsible for the trust reposed in them we are all intended to fill various situations in society and are provided by heaven accordingly that may be replied mr easy but that does not prove that the earth was not intended to be equally distributed among all alike i beg your pardon the proof that that was not the intention of providence is that that equality allowing it to be put in practice could never be maintained not maintainedno because the strong oppress the weak tyrants rise up and conquermen combine to do wrong not so my dear father i say it could not be maintained without the organisation of each individual had been equalised and several other points established for instance allowing that every man had ab origins a certain portion of ground he who was the strongest or the cleverest would soon cause his to yield more than others would and thus the equality be destroyed again if one couple had ten children and another had none then again would equality be broken in upon as the land that supports two in the one instance would have to feed twelve in the other you perceive therefore that without rapine or injustice your equality could not be preserved but jack allowing that there might be some diversity from such causes that would be a very different thing from the present monstrous state of society in which we have kings and lords and people rolling in wealth while others are in a state of pauperism and obliged to steal for their daily bread my dear father i consider that it is to this inequality that society owes its firmest cementationthat we are enabled to live in peace and happiness protected by just laws each doing his duty in that state of life to which he is called rising above or sinking in the scale of society according as he has been entrusted with the five talents or the one equality can and does exist nowhere we are told that it does not exist in heaven itselfhow can it exist upon earth but that is only asserted jack and it is not proof that it ought not to exist let us argue the point father coolly let us examine a little what would be the effect if all was equality were all equal in beauty there would be no beauty for beauty is only by comparisonwere all equal in strength conflicts would be interminablewere all equal in rank and power and possessions the greatest charms of existence would be destroyedgenerosity gratitude and half the finer virtues would be unknown the first principle of our religion charity could not be practisedpity would never be called forthbenevolence your great organ would be useless and selfdenial a blank letter were all equal in ability there would be no instruction no talent no geniusnothing to admire nothing to copy to respectnothing to rouse emulation or stimulate to praiseworthy ambition why my dear father what an idle unprofitable weary world would this be if it were based on equality but allowing all that jack replied mr easy and i will say you argue well in a bad cause why should the inequality be carried so farking and lords for instance the most lasting and imperishable form of building is that of the pyramid which defies ages and to that may the most perfect form of society be compared it is based upon the many and rising by degrees it becomes less as wealth talent and rank increase in the individual until it ends at the apex or monarch above all yet each several stone from the apex to the base is necessary for the preservation of the structure and fulfils its duty in its allotted place could you prove that those at the summit possess the greatest share of happiness in this world then indeed you have a position to argue on but it is well known that such is not the case and provided he is of a contented mind the peasant is more happy than the king surrounded as the latter is by cares and anxiety very well argued indeed my dear sir observed dr middleton but my dear boy there are other states of society than monarchy we have republics and despotisms we have but how long do they last compared to the first there is a cycle in the changes which never varies a monarchy may be overthrown by a revolution and republicanism succeed but that is shortly followed by despotism till after a time monarchy succeeds again by unanimous consent as the most legitimate and equitable form of government but in none of these do you find a single advance to equality in a republic those who govern are more powerful than the rulers in a restricted monarchya president is greater than a king and next to a despot whose will is law even in small societies you find that some will naturally take the lead and assume domination we commence the system at school when we are first thrown into society and there we are taught systems of petty tyranny there are some few points in which we obtain equality in this world and that equality can only be obtained under a wellregulated form of society and consists in an equal administration of justice and of laws to which we have agreed to submit for the benefit of the wholethe equal right to live and not be permitted to starve which has been obtained in this country and when we are called to account we shall have equal justice now my dear father you have my opinion yes my dear this is all very well in the abstract but how does it work it works well the luxury the pampered state the idlenessif you please the wickednessof the rich all contribute to the support the comfort and employment of the poor you may behold extravagance it is a vice but that very extravagance circulates money and the vice of one contributes to the happiness of many the only vice which is not redeemed by producing commensurate good is avarice if all were equal there would be no arts no manufactures no industry no employment as it is the inequality of the distribution of wealth may be compared to the heart pouring forth the blood like a steamengine through the human frame the same blood returning from the extremities by the veins to be again propelled and keep up a healthy and vigorous circulation bravo jack said dr middleton have you anything to reply sir continued he addressing mr easy to reply sir replied mr easy with scorn why he has not given me half an argument yet why that black servant even laughs at him look at him there showing his teeth can he forget the horrors of slavery can he forget the base unfeeling lash no sir he has suffered and he can estimate the divine right of equality ask him now ask him if you dare jack whether he will admit the truth of your argument well ill ask him replied jack and i tell you candidly that he was once one of your disciples mesty whats your opinion of equality equality massa easy replied mesty pulling up his cravat i say dn equality now i majordomo the rascal deserves to be a slave all his life true i ab been slavebut i a prince in my own country massa easy tell how many skulls i have skullsskullsdo you know anything of the sublime science are you a phrenologist i know mans skull very well in ashantee country anyhow then if you know that you must be one i had no idea that the science had extended so farmaybe it was brought from thence i will have some talk with you tomorrow this is very curious dr middleton is it not very indeed mr easy i shall feel his head tomorrow after breakfast and if there is anything wrong i shall correct it with my machine bythebye i have quite forgot gentlemen you will excuse me but i wish to see what the carpenter has done for me and after that i shall attend the meeting of the society jack my boy wont you come and hear my speech thank you sir but i cannot well leave your friends mr easy quitted the room are you aware my dear sir that your father has opened his preserves to all the poachers said mr hanson the devil he has yes he has allowed several gangs of gipsies to locate themselves in his woods much to the annoyance of the neighbourhood who suffer from their depredations continued dr middleton i find by the receipts and books that there is nearly two years rental of the estate due some tenants have paid up in full others not for four years i reckon fourteen thousand pounds still in arrear you will oblige me by taking immediate steps mr hanson for the recovery of the sums due most certainly mr john i trust your father will not commit himself tonight as he has done lately when they rose to retire dr middleton took out hero by the hand you do not know my dear fellow what pleasure it gives me to find that in spite of the doting of your mother and the madness of your father you have turned out so well it is very fortunate that you have come home i trust you will now give up the profession i have given it up sir which bythebye reminds me that i have not applied for either my discharge or that of my servant but i cannot spare time yet so i shall not report myself chapter xxxvii in which our hero finds himself an orphan and resolves to go to sea again without the smallest idea of equality the next morning when they met at breakfast mr easy did not make his appearance and jack inquired of mesty where he was they say down below that the old gentleman not come home last night did not come home said dr middleton this must be looked to he great rascal dat butler man said mesty to jack but de old gentleman not sleep in his bed dat for sure make enquiries when he went out said jack i hope no accident has happened observed mr hanson but his company has lately been very strange nobody see him go out sar last night reported mesty very likely he is in his study observed dr middleton he may have remained all night fast asleep by his wonderful invention ill go and see replied jack dr middleton accompanied him and mesty followed they opened the door and beheld a spectacle which made them recoil with horror there was mr easy with his head in the machine the platform below fallen from under him hanging with his toes just touching the ground dr middleton hastened to him and assisted by mesty and our hero took him out of the steel collar which was round his neck but life had been extinct for many hours and on examination it was found that the poor old gentlemans neck was dislocated it was surmised that the accident must have taken place the evening before and it was easy to account for it mr easy who had had the machine raised four feet higher for the platform and steps to be placed underneath must have mounted on the frame modelled by the carpenter for his work and have fixed his head in for the knob was pressed on his bump of benevolence the framework hastily put together with a few short nails had given way with his weight and the sudden fall had dislocated his neck mr hanson led away our hero who was much shocked at this unfortunate and tragical end of his poor father while dr middleton ordered the body to be taken up into a bedroom and immediately despatched a messenger to the coroner of the county poor mr easy had told his son but the day before that he felt convinced that this wonderful invention would immortalise him and so it had although not exactly in the sense that he anticipated we must pass over the few days of sorrow and closed shutters which always are given to these scenes the coroners inquest and the funeral over daylight was again admitted our heros spirits revived and he found himself in possession of a splendid property and his own master he was not of age it is true for he wanted nine months but on opening the will of his father he found that dr middleton was his sole guardian mr hanson on examining and collecting the papers which were in the greatest confusion discovered banknotes in different corners and huddled up with bills and receipts to the amount of two thousand pounds and further a cheque signed by captain wilson on his banker for the thousand pounds advanced by mr easy dated more than fifteen months back dr middleton wrote to the admiralty informing them that family affairs necessitated mr john easy who had been left at sick quarters to leave his majestys service requesting his discharge from it forthwith the admiralty were graciously pleased to grant the request and lose the services of a midshipman the admiralty were also pleased to grant the discharge of mesty on the sum required for a substitute being paid in the gipsies were routed out of their abodes and sent once more to wander the gamekeepers were restored the preserves cleared of all poachers and the gentry of the country were not a little pleased at jacks succession for they had wished that mr easys neck had been broken long ago the societies were dissolved since now that mr easy no longer paid for the beer there was nothing to meet for cards and compliments were sent from all parts of the county and every one was anxious that our hero should come of age as then he would be able to marry to give dinners subscribe to the foxhounds and live as a gentleman ought to do but during all these speculations jack had made dr middleton acquainted with the history of his amour with agnes de rebiera and all particulars connected therewith also with his determination to go out to bring her home as his wife dr middleton saw no objection to the match and he perceived that our hero was sincere and jack had made inquiries when the packet would sail for malta when mesty who stood behind his chair observed packet bad vessel massa easy why not go out in manofwar very true replied jack but you know mesty that is not so easy and den how come home sar suppose you and missy agnes taken prisonerput in prison very true replied jack and as for a passage home in a manofwar that will be more difficult still den i tink sar suppose you buy one fine vesselplenty of guns take out letter of marqueplenty of men and bring missy agnes home like a lady you captain of your own ship that deserves consideration mesty replied jack who thought of it during that night and the next day resolved to follow mestys advice the portsmouth paper lay on the breakfasttable jack took it up and his eye was caught by an advertisement for the sale of the joan darc prize to hm ship thetis brigantine of tons copperbottomed armed en flutes with all her stores spars sails running and standing rigging then lying in the harbour of portsmouth to take place on the following wednesday jack rang the bell and ordered posthorses where are you going my dear boy inquired dr middleton to portsmouth doctor and pray what for if not an impertinent question jack then gave dr middleton an insight into his plan and requested that he would allow him to do so as there was plenty of ready money but the expense will be enormous it will be heavy sir i grant but i have calculated it pretty nearly and i shall not spend at the rate of more than my income besides as letter of marque i shall have the right of capture in fact i mean to take out a privateers regular licence but not to remain there and cruise no upon my honour i am too anxious to get home again you must not refuse me my dear guardian as a lady is in the case i will not my dear boy but be careful what you are about never fear sir i will be back in four months at the farthest but i must now set off and ascertain if the vessel answers the description given in the advertisement jack threw himself into the chariot mesty mounted into the rumble and in two hours they were at portsmouth went to the agent viewed the vessel which proved to be a very fine fastsailing craft well found with six brass carronades on each side the cabins were handsome fitted up with birdseye maple and gilt mouldings this will do thought jack a couple of long brass nines forty men and six boys and she will be just the thing we require so mesty and jack went on shore again and returned to forest hill to dinner when he desired mr hanson to set off for portsmouth and bid at the sale for the vessel as he wished to purchase her this was monday and on wednesday mr hanson purchased her as she stood for pounds which was considered about half her value dr middleton had in the meantime been thinking very seriously of jacks project he could see no objection to it provided that he was steady and prudent but in both these qualities jack had not exactly been tried he therefore determined to look out for some steady naval lieutenant and make it a sine qua non that our hero should be accompanied by him and that he should go out as sailingmaster now that the vessel was purchased he informed jack of his wish indeed as dr middleton observed his duty as guardian demanded this precaution and our hero who felt very grateful to dr middleton immediately acquiesced and bythebye doctor see that he is a good navigator for although i can fudge a days work pretty well latterly i have been out of practice everyone was now busy jack and mesty at portsmouth fitting out the vessel and offering three guineas ahead to the crimps for every good able seamanmr hanson obtaining the english register and the letters of licence and dr middleton in search of a good naval drynurse jack found time to write to don philip and agnes apprising them of the death of his father and his intentions in about six weeks all was ready and the brigantine which had taken out her british register and licence under the name of the rebiera went out of harbour and anchored at spithead dr middleton had procured as he thought a very fit person to sail with jack and our hero and mesty embarked wishing the doctor and solicitor goodbye and leaving them nothing to do but to pay the bills the person selected by dr middleton by the advice of an old friend of his a purser in the navy who lived at southsea was a lieutenant oxbelly who with the ships company which had been collected received our hero as their captain and owner upon his arrival on board there certainly was no small contrast between our heros active slight figure and handsome person set off with a blue coat something like the present yachtclub uniform and that of his second in command who waddled to the side to receive him he was a very short man with an uncommon protuberance of stomach with shoulders and arms too short for his body and hands much too large more like the paws of a polar bear than anything else he wore trousers shoes and buckles on his head was a foraging cap which when he took it off showed that he was quite bald his age might be about fiftyfive or sixty his complexion florid no whiskers and little beard nose straight lips thin teeth black with chewing and always a little brown dribble from the left corner of his mouth there was a leak there he said altogether his countenance was prepossessing for it was honest and manly but his waist was preposterous steady enough thought jack as he returned mr oxbellys salute how do you do sir said jack i trust we shall be good shipmates for jack had not seen him before mr easy replied the lieutenant i never quarrel with anyone except i wont tell a story with my wife i am sorry that you have ever domestic dissensions mr oxbelly and i only quarrel with her at night sir she will take up more than her share of the bed and wont allow me to sleep single but never mind that sir now will you please to muster the men if you please mr oxbelly the men were mustered and jack made them a long speech upon subordination discipline activity duty and so forth a very good speech mr easy said mr oxbelly as the men went forward i wish my wife had heard it but sir if you please well now get under way as fast as we can for there is a channel cruiser working up at st helens and we may give him the goby by running through the needles but what need we care for the channel cruiser you forget sir that as soon as she drops her anchor she will come on board and take a fancy to at least ten of our men but they are protected yes sir but thats no protection nowadays i have sailed in a privateer at least three years and i know that they have no respect for letters of marque or for privateers i believe you are right mr oxbelly so if you please we will up with the anchor at once the crew of the rebiera had been well chosen they were prime menofwars men most of whom had deserted from the various ships on the station and of course were most anxious to be off in a few minutes the rebiera was under way with all sail set below and aloft she was in excellent trim and flew through the water the wind was fair and by night they had passed portland lights and the next morning were steering a course for the bay of biscay without having encountered what they feared more than an enemya british cruiser to overhaul them i think we shall do now sir observed mr oxbelly to our hero we have made a famous run its twelve oclock and if you please ill work the latitude and let you know what it is we must shape our course so as not to run in with the brest squadron a little more westing sir ill be up in one minute my wifebut ill tell you about that when i come up latitude degs min sir i was about to say that my wife when she was on board of the privateer that i commanded board of the privateer mr oxbelly yes sir would go told her it was impossible but she wouldnt listen to reasoncame on board flopped herself into the standing bedplace and said that there she was for the cruiselittle billy with her what your child too yes two years oldfine boyalways laughed when the guns were fired while his mother stood on the ladder and held him on the top of the boobyhatch i wonder that mrs oxbelly let you come here now so you would sir but ill explain thatshe thinks im in london about my halfpay she knows all by this time and frets i dont doubt but that will make her thin and then there will be more room in the bed mrs oxbelly is a very stout woman why you are not a little man no not littletending to be lusty as the saying isthat is in good condition its very strange that mrs oxbelly has an idea that she is not large i cannot persuade her to it thats the reason we always spar in bed she says it is i and i know that it is she who takes the largest share of it perhaps you may both be right no no it is she who creates all the disturbance if i get nearer to the wall she jams me up till i am as thin as a thread paper if i put her inside and stay outside she cuts me out as you do a cask by the chime till i tumble out of bed why dont you make your bed larger mr oxbelly sir i have proposed it but my wife will have it that the bed is large enough if i would not toss in my sleep i cant convince her however shell have it all to herself now i slept well last night for the first time since i left the boadicea the boadicea yes sir i was second lieutenant of the boadicea for three years shes a fine frigate im told on the contrary such a pinchedup little craft below i never saw why mr easy i could hardly get into the door of my cabinand yet as you must see im not a large man good heavens is it possible thought jack that this man does not really know that he is monstrous yet such was the case mr oxbelly had no idea that he was otherwise than in good condition although he had probably not seen his knees for years it was his obesity that was the great objection to him for in every other point there was nothing against him he had upon one pretence and another been shifted by the manoeuvres of the captains out of different ships until he went up to the admiralty to know if there was any charge against him the first lord at once perceived the charge to be preferred and made a mark against his name as not fit for anything but harbour duty out of employment he had taken the command of a privateer cutter when his wife who was excessively fond would as he said follow him with little billy he was sober steady knew his duty well but he weighed twentysix stone and his weight had swamped him in the service his wish long indulged had become as shakespeare says the father of his thoughts and he had really at last brought himself to think that he was not by any means what could be considered a fat man his wife as he said was also a very stout woman and this exuberance of flesh on both sides was the only but continual ground of dispute chapter xxxviii in which our hero as usual gets into the very middle of it on the eleventh day the rebiera entered the straits and the rock of gibraltar was in sight as the sun went down after which the wind fell light and about midnight it became calm and they drifted up at sunrise they were roused by the report of heavy guns and perceived an english frigate about eight miles further up the straits and more in the midchannel engaging nine or ten spanish gunboats which had come out from algesiras to attack her it still continued a dead calm and the boats of the frigate were all ahead towing her so as to bring her broadside to bear upon the spanish flotilla the reverberating of the heavy cannon on both sides over the placid surface of the waterthe white smoke ascending as the sun rose in brilliancy in a clear blue skythe distant echoes repeated from the high hillshad a very beautiful effect for those who are partial to the picturesque but jack thought it advisable to prepare for action instead of watching for tintsand in a short time all was ready theyll not come to us mr easy as long as they have the frigate to hammer at but still we had better be prepared for we cannot well pass them without having a few shot when i came up the straits in the privateer we were attacked by two and fought them for three hours their shot dashed the water over our decks till they were wet fore and aft but somehow or another they never hit uswe were as low as they were ill be bound but theyll hull the frigate though mrs oxbelly and billy were on deck the whole timeand billy was quite delighted and cried when they took him down to breakfast why mrs oxbelly must be very courageous cares neither for shot nor shell sirlaughs when they whiz over her head and tells billy to hark but sir its not surprising her father is a major and her two brothers are lieutenants in the bombardiers that indeed replied jackbut see there is a breeze springing up from the westward very true mr easy and a steady one it will be for it comes up dark and slow so much the better for the frigate for shell get little honour and plenty of mauling at this work i hope we shall take it up with us observed jack how far do you reckon the gunboats from the shore i should think about five miles or rather less trim sails mr oxbellyperhaps we may cut one or two of these off steer inshore of them exactly up there my lads set topgallant studding sails topmast studdings to handrig out the boomskeep as you go now my ladswe shall be well inshore of them and out of the range of the batteries the breeze came down fresh and all sail was set upon the rebiera she took the wind down with her and it passed her but littlehalf a mile ahead of them all was still and smooth as a glass mirror and they neared and gained inshore at the same time the gunboats were still engaging the frigate and did not appear to pay any attention to the rebiera coming down at last the breeze reached them and the frigate light at first and then gradually increasing while the rebiera foamed through the water and had now every chance of cutting off some of the gunboats the frigate trimmed her sails and steered towards the flotilla which now thought proper to haul off and put their heads inshore followed by the frigate firing her bowchasers but the rebiera was now within half gunshot inshore and steering so as to intercept them as she rapidly closed the flotilla scarcely knew how to act to attack her would be to lose time and allow the frigate to come up and occasion their own capture so they satisfied themselves with firing at her as she continued to run down between them and the land as they neared jack opened his fire with his eighteenpound carronades and long nines the gunboats returned his fire and they were within a quarter of a mile when jack shortened sail to his topsails and a warm engagement took place which ended in one of the gunboats being in a few minutes dismasted the frigate under all canvas came rapidly up and her shot now fell thick the flotilla then ceased firing passing about two cables length ahead of the rebiera and making all possible sail for the land jack now fired at the flotilla as they passed with his larboard broadside while with his starboard he poured in grape and canister upon the unfortunate gunboat which was dismasted and which soon hauled down her colours in a few minutes more the remainder were too far distant for the carronades and as they did not fire jack turned his attention to take possession of his prize sending a boat with ten men on board and heavingto close to her to take her in tow ten minutes more and the frigate was also hoveto a cables length from the rebiera and our hero lowered down his other quarterboat to go on board have we any men hurt mr oxbelly inquired jack only two spearling has lost his thumb with a piece of langrage and james has a bad wound in the thigh very well i will ask for the surgeon to come on board jack pulled to the frigate and went up the side touched his hat in due form and was introduced by the midshipmen to the other side where the captain stood mr easy exclaimed the captain captain sawbridge replied our hero with surprise good heavens what brought you here said the captain and what vessel is that the rebiera letter of marque commanded and owned by mr easy replied jack laughing captain sawbridge gave him his hand come down with me into the cabin mr easy i am very glad to see you give you great credit for your conduct and am still more anxious to know what has induced you to come out again i knew that you had left the service jack in a very few words told his object in fitting out the rebiera but continued jack allow me to congratulate you upon your promotion which i was not aware of may i ask where you left the harpy and what is the name of your frigate the latona i have only been appointed to her one month after an action in which the harpy took a large corvette and am ordered home with despatches to england we sailed yesterday evening from gibraltar were becalmed the whole night and attacked this morning by the gunboats how is captain wilson sir i believe he is very well but i have not seen him how did you know then that i had left the service captain sawbridge from mr gascoigne who is now on board gascoigne exclaimed our hero yes he was sent up to join the aurora by the governor but she had left the fleet and having served his time and a passing day being ordered he passed and thought he might as well go home with me and see if he could make any interest for his promotion pray captain sawbridge is the gunboat our prize or yours it ought to be wholly yours but the fact is by the regulations we share with all my heart sir will you send an assistantsurgeon on board to look after two of my men who are hurt yes directly now send your boat away easy with directions to your officer in command we must go back to gibraltar for we have received some injury and i am sorry to say lost some men you are going then i presume to stay on board and dine with me we shall be at anchor before night i will with pleasure sir but now i will send my boat away and shake hands with gascoigne gascoigne was under the halfdeck waiting to receive his friend for he had seen him come up the side from his station on the forecastle a hurried conversation took place after our hero had dismissed his boat with the assistantsurgeon in it to dress the two wounded men jack then went on deck talked with the officers looked with pleasure at the rebiera with the gunboat in tow keeping company with the frigate although only under the same canvaspromised gascoigne to spend the next day with him either on shore or on board the rebiera and then returned to the cabin where he had a long conference with captain sawbridge when you first entered the service easy said captain sawbridge i thought that the sooner the service was rid of you the better now that you have left it i feel that it has lost one who in all probability would have proved a credit to it many thanks sir replied jack but how can i be a midshipman with eight thousand pounds a year i agree with you that it is impossiblebut dinner is serving go into the aftercabin and the steward will give you all you require our hero whose face and hands were not a little grimed with the gunpowder washed himself combed out his curly black hair and found all the party in the forecabin gascoigne who had not been asked in the forenoon was by the consideration of captain sawbridge added to the number before dinner was long off the table the first lieutenant reported that it was necessary to turn the hands up as they were close to the anchorage the party therefore broke up sooner than otherwise would have been the case and as soon as the latonas sails were furled captain sawbridge went on shore to acquaint the governor with the results of the action he asked jack to accompany him but our hero wishing to be with gascoigne excused himself until the next day and now easy said gascoigne as soon as the captain had gone over the side i will ask permission to go on board with youor will you ask i will ask replied jack a gentleman of fortune has more weight with a first lieutenant than a midshipman so jack went up to the first lieutenant and with one of his polite bows hoped if duty would permit he would honour him by coming on board that evening with some of his officers to see the rebiera and to drink a bottle or two of champagne the first lieutenant as the rebiera was anchored not two cables lengths from him replied that as soon as he had shifted the prisoners and secured the gunboat he would be very glad so did three or four more of the officers and then jack begged as a favour that his old friend mr gascoigne might be permitted to go with him now as he had important packages to entrust to his care to england the first lieutenant was very willing and gascoigne and our hero jumped into the boat and were once more in all the confidence of tried and deserved friendship jack ive been thinking of it and ive made up my mind said gascoigne i shall gain little or nothing by going home for my promotion i may as well stay here and as i have served my time and passed my pay is now of little consequence will you take me with you it was exactly what i was thinking of ned do you think that captain sawbridge will consent i do he knows how i am circumstanced and that my going home was merely because i was tired of looking after the aurora well go together and ask him tomorrow replied jack at all events youll have a more gentlemanly companion than mr oxbelly but not so steady ned the first lieutenant and officers came on board and passed a merry evening theres nothing passes time more agreeably away than champagne and if you do not affront this regal wine by mixing him with any other he never punishes you the next morning chapter xxxix a council of war in which jack decides that he will have one more cruise as captain sawbridge did not return on board that evening easy went on shore and called upon him at the governors to whom he was introduced and received an invitation to dine with him as gascoigne could not come on shore our hero took this opportunity of making his request to captain sawbridge stating that the person he had with him was not such as he wished and could confide everything to that is not one to whom he could talk about agnes jack as he found that captain sawbridge did not immediately assent pressed the matter hard at last captain sawbridge who reflected that gascoignes interest hereafter would be much greater through his friend easy than any other quarter and that the more the friendship was cemented the more advantageous it might prove to gascoigne gave his consent to our heros wish who called on board of the latona to acquaint gascoigne and the first lieutenant of captain sawbridges intentions and then went on board of the rebiera and ordered mesty to come with his portmanteau on shore to the inn that he might dress for dinner gascoigne now considered as not belonging to the latona was permitted to accompany him and jack found himself looking out of the window at which he had hung out his trousers upon the memorable occasion when the boatswain had to follow his own precept of duty before decency what scenes of adventures i have passed through since that thought jack not much more than four years ago then not three weeks in the service whereupon jack fell into a deep reverie and thought of the baboon and of agnes the repairs of the latona were all made good by the next day and gascoigne having received his discharge ticket went on board of the rebiera the gunboat was put into the hands of the agent and shortly afterwards purchased by government the rebieras crew did not however obtain their prizemoney and share of the headmoney for she had seventy men on board until their return but as they said they had broken the ice and that was everything moreover it gave them confidence in themselves in their vessel and in their commander our hero weighed a short time after the latona having first taken leave of captain sawbridge and committed to his care a letter to dr middleton once more behold the trio togetherthe two midshipmen hanging over the taffrail and mesty standing by them they had rounded europa point and with a fine breeze off the land were lying closehauled along the spanish shore mr oxbelly was also walking near them when i was cruising here it was very different observed jack i had a vessel which i did not know how to manage a crew which i could not command and had it not been for mesty what would have become of me massa easy you know very well how to get out of scrapes anyhow yes and how to get into them continued gascoigne and how to get others out of them too ned no more of that hal an thou lovest me quoted gascoigne i have often wondered what has been the lot of poor azar the lot of most women ned in every countryprized at first neglected afterwardsthe lot she might have had with you perhaps so replied ned with a sigh massa easy you get eberybody out of scrape you get me out of scrape i do not recollect how mesty you get me out from boil kettle for young gentlemendat devil of a scrape and im sure ive got you out of a scrape mr oxbelly how so mr easy how sohave i not prevented your quarrelling with your wife every night certainly sir you have been the means but do you know when we were engaging the other day i could not help saying to myself i wish my wife was here now holding little billy at the hatchway but at night mr oxbelly at nightwhy then im afraid i should have wished her home again its astonishing how comfortable i sleep now every night besides in this climate it would be intolerable mrs oxbelly is a very large womanvery large indeed well but now we must hold a council of war are we to run up the coast or to shape a course direct for palermo course direct and we shall take nothing that is certain said gascoigne if we take nothing we shall make no prizemoney continued oxbelly if we make no prizemoney the men will be discontented said easy if no ab noting to doit will be dd tupid continued mesty now then the other side of the question if we steer for palermo we shall be sooner there and sooner home to which i reply said gascoigne that the shorter the cruise is the less i shall have of your company and i shall have to sleep with mrs oxbelly continued oxbelly hab fine ship fine gun fine men and do noting cried mesty by de power i no like dat massa easy you want eight months of coming of age jack observed gascoigne it wont make a difference of more than three or four weeks said mr oxbelly and the expenses have been very great but but what jack agnes agnes will be better defended going home by men who have been accustomed to be in action and as for her waiting a little longer it will only make her love you a little more sleep single a little longer mr easy its very pleasant said mr oxbelly thats not very bad advice of yours observed gascoigne stop a little massa easy said mesty you know dat very good advice well then replied jack i will as i am quite in the minority we will work up the whole coastup to toulon after all theres something very pleasant in commanding your own ship and im not in a hurry to resign itso that points decided the rebiera was steered into the land and at sunset they were not four miles from the lofty blue mountains which overhang the town of malaga there were many vessels lying at the bottom of the bay close in with the town the wind now fell light and the rebiera as she could not fetch the town tacked as if she were a merchant vessel standing in and showed american colours a hint which they took from perceiving three or four large vessels lying in the outer roads with the colours of that nation hoisted at the peak what is your intention jack said gascoigne ill be hanged if i know yet i think of working up to the outer roads and anchoring at nightboarding the american vessels and gaining intelligence not a bad idea we shall then learn if there is anything to be done and if not we may be off at daylight the pratique boat will not come off after sunset and if they did we could pass for an american bound to barcelona or anywhere elsethe outer roads where the vessels lie are hardly within gunshot mesty who had resumed his sailors clothes now observed what we do massa easy we do quicklytime for all ting time for show face and fighttime for hide face crawl and steal very true mesty well crawl this time and steal if we can its not the warfare i like best of the two both good massa easy suppose you no steal board of polacca ship you not see missy agnes very true mesty bout ship mr oxbelly mr oxbelly not good for boat service observed mesty showing his teeth it was dark before the rebiera was anchored in the outer roads a cables length astern of the outermost american vessel one of her quarterboats was lowered down and gascoigne and our hero pulled alongside and lying on their oars hailed and asked the name of the vessel so help me gad just now i forget her name replied a negro looking over the gangway whos the captain so help me gad he gone on shore is the mate on board no so help me gadhe gone shore too who is aboard then so help me gad nobody on board but pompeyand dat me good shipkeepers at all events said jack a ship in the outer roads with only a black fellow on board i say pompey do they always leave you in charge of the vessel no sar but tonight great pleasure on shore eberybody dance and sing get drunk kick up bobbery and all dat what is it a festival so help me gad i no know sar is there anyone on board of the other vessels eberybody gone on shore suppose they have black man he stay on board goodnight pompey goodnight sar who i say call when captain come on board captain easy captain hesee very well sar our hero pulled to another ship and found it equally deserted but at the third he found the second mate with his arm in a sling and from him they gained the information that it was a great festival being the last day of the carnival and that everyone was thinking of nothing but amusement ive a notion said the mate in reply that youre american youve guessed right replied jack what ship and from what port rhode island the susan and mary replied gascoigne i thought you were north were of new york what news do you bring nothing replied he we are from liverpool last a succession of questions was now put by the american mate and answered very skilfully by gascoigne who then inquired how the market was it was necessary to make and reply to all these enquiries before they could ask apparently indifferent questions of american traders at last gascoigne enquired do you think they would allow us to go on shore the pratique boat has not been on board theyll never find you out if you are off before daylight i doubt if they know that you are anchored besides from liverpool you would have a clean bill of health and if they found it out they would not say much theyre not over particular ive a notion what are those vessels lying inshore i guess they have olive oil on board the chief on em but there are two double lateens come in from valparaiso the day before yesterday with hides and copper how they scaped the british i cant tell but they did thats sure enough goodnight then you wont take a glass of sling this fine night with a countryman tomorrow my good fellow tomorrow we must go on shore now our hero and gascoigne returned on board the rebiera consulted with oxbelly and mesty and then manned and armed the two quarter and stern boats they thought it advisable not to hoist out their longboat no firearms were permitted to be taken lest going off by accident or otherwise an alarm should be given our hero and mesty proceeded in the first boat and pulled in for the town gascoigne shortly after in the second and the boatswain in the jollyboat followed at some distance there was no notice taken of them they pulled gently down to the landingplace which was deserted there was a blaze of light and the sounds of revelry in every quarter on shore but the vessels appeared equally deserted as the american ones in the offing finding themselves unobserved for they had taken the precaution to pull only two oars in each boat they dropped gently alongside one of the doublemasted lateen vessels and mesty stepped on board he peeped down in the cabin and perceived a man lying on the lockers he came up in his stealthy manner closed the hatch softly and said all right jack left gascoigne to take out this vessel which he did very successfully for it was very dark and although there were sentries posted not far off their eyes and ears were turned towards the town listening to the music a second vessel her consort was boarded in the same way but here they found a man on deck whom they were obliged to seize and gag they put him down in the cabin and mesty with another boats crew cut her cables and swept her gently out towards the american vessels one more vessel was required and jack pulling two oars as usual saluted a galliot heavily laden but of what her cargo consisted was not known in this vessel they found two men in the cabin playing cards whom they seized and bound and cutting her cables were obliged to make sail upon her as she was much too large to sweep out as they were making sail they however met with an interruption which they did not expect the crew belonging to the vessel having had enough amusement for the evening and intending to sail the next morning had thought it right to come off sooner than the others it was then about midnight or a little later and while some of jacks men were aloft for he had six with him jack to his annoyance heard a boat coming off from the shore the men in her singing a chorus the galliot was at that time just under steerage way her topsails had been loosed and her jib hoisted but the former had not been sheeted home for the three men below could not in the dark find the ropes the other three men were on the foreyard loosing the foresail and jack was undetermined whether to call them down immediately or to allow them to loose the sail and thus get good way on the vessel so as to prevent the boat which was loaded with men from overtaking them the boat was not more than twenty yards from the galliot when not finding her where they left her they pulled to the right and lay on their oars this gave a moment of time but they very soon spied her out caramba was the exclamationand the head of the boat was pulled round down my lads in a moment by the swifters cried jack heres a boat on board of us the men were in a few seconds on deck and the others who had now sheeted home the topsails hastened aft the vessel soon gathered way but before that her way was sufficient the boat had pulled under the counter and the spaniards letting their oars swing fore and aft were climbing up their knives in their teeth a scuffle ensued and they were thrown down again but they renewed their attempt our hero perceiving a small water or wine cask lashed to the gunwale cut it loose with his cutlass and with one of the men who was by his side pushed it over and dropped it into the boat it struck the gunwale stove a plank and the boat began to fill rapidly in the meantime the galliot had gained waythe boat could not longer be held on from its weight and dropped astern with the men in it those who were half in and half out were left clinging to the gunwale of the vessel and as they climbed up were secured and put down in the cabin fortunately no firearms having been used on either side the alarm was not given generally but the sentry reported fighting on board one of the vessels and the people of the guardboat were collected and pulled out but they only arrived in time to see that the galliot was under way and that the two other vessels from valparaiso were not in their berths they hastened on shore gave the alarm the gunboats of which there were three at the mole were ordered out but half the crew and all the officers were on shore some at balls others drinking at taverns or posadas before they could be collected all three vessels were alongside of the rebiera and not aware that anything had been discovered our hero and his crew were lulled in security jack had gone on board leaving fourteen of his men on board the galliot gascoigne had done the samemesty still remained on board his vessel and they were congratulating themselves and ordering the men on board to the windlass when they heard the sound of oars silencewhat is that exclaimed oxbelly the gunboats or rowboats as sure as im alive at this moment mesty jumped up the side massa easy i hear rowboat not far off so do we mesty gascoigne jump into the boattell the men in the prizes to make all sail right out and leave us to defend their retreatstay on board of one and divide your men dat all right massa easy mr gascoigne be smartand now sar cut cable and make sail no time get up anchor this order was given but although the men were aloft in a moment and very expeditious as the rebiera payed her head round and the jib was hoisted they could perceive the boom of the three gunboats pulling and sailing not five cables length from them although rather shorthanded topsails courses and topgallant sails were soon set the men down to their quarters and the guns cast loose before the gunboats were close under their stern then jack rounded to braced up and the rebiera stood across them to the westward why the devil dont they fire said jack i tink because they no ab powder said mesty mesty was rightthe ammunition chests of the gunboats were always landed when they were at the mole in case of accidents which might arise from the crew being continually with cigars in their mouths and in the hurry they had quite forgotten to put them on board at all events we have powder said jack and now well prove it grape and canister my lads and take good aim the commanders of the gunboats had hailed each other and agreed to board the rebiera but she now had good way on her and sailed faster than they pulled a welldirected broadside astonished themthey had no idea of her force and the execution done was so great that they first lay on their oars and then pulled back to the mole with all speed leaving the rebiera in quiet possession of her prizes which had already gained two miles in the offing the rebiera as soon as jack perceived that the gunboats had retreated was put before the wind and soon closed with her captures when she was hoveto till daylight with the three vessels in company gascoigne returned on board prizemasters were selected and jack determined to keep them all with him and take them to palermo chapter xl in which there is another slight difference of opinion between those who should be friends the two lateen vessels proved of considerable value being laden with copper hides and cochineal the galliot was laden with sweetoil and was also no despicable prize at daylight they were all ready and to the mortification of the good people of malaga sailed away to the eastward without interruption me tink we do dat job pretty well massa easy observed mesty as he laid the breakfast table nothing like trying replied gascoigne im sure when we stood into the bay i would have sold all my prizemoney for a doubloon how do i share jack only as one of the crew ned for you are a supernumerary and our articles and agreement for prizemoney were signed previous to our sailing i ought to share with mr oxbellys class by rights replied gascoigne that would be to take half my prizemoney away i shall want it all mr gascoigne to pacify my wife for giving her the slip ah very well ill get all i can for ten days they ran down the coast going much too fast for the wishes of the crew who were anxious to make more money they seized a fishingboat and put on board of her the four prisoners which they had found in the vessels and arrived off barcelona without falling in with friend or foe the next morning the wind being very light they discovered a large vessel at daylight astern of them to the westward and soon made her out to be a frigate she made all sail in chase but that gave them very little uneasiness as they felt assured that she was a british cruiser one fear however came over them that she would if she came up with them impress a portion of their men as certain as im here and mrs oxbellys at southsea said oxbelly theyll take some of the menthe more so as supposing us to be a spanish convoy they will be disappointed they will hardly take them out of the prizes observed easy i dont know that men must be had for his majestys service somehow its not their fault mr easythe navy must be manned and as things are so so things must be its the kings prerogative mr easy and we cannot fight the battles of the country without it yes replied gascoigne and although as soon as the services of seamen are no longer wanted you find that there are demagogues on shore who exclaim against impressment they are quiet enough on the point when they know that their lives and property depend upon sailors exertions very true mr gascoigne but its not our fault if we are obliged to take men by force its the fault of those who do not legislate so as to prevent the necessity mrs oxbelly used to say that she would easily manage the matter if she were chancellor of the exchequer i dare say mrs oxbelly would make a very good chancellor of the exchequer replied gascoigne smiling one thing is certain that if they gave the subject half the consideration they have others of less magnitude an arrangement might be made by which his majestys navy would never be short of men no doubt no doubt mr gascoigne but nevertheless the kings prerogative must never be given up there i agree with you mr oxbelly it must be held in case of sudden emergency and absolute need well argue that point byandbye replied jack now let us consult as to our measures my opinion is that if i made more sail we should beat the frigate but she would come up with the prizes thats the best thing we can do mr easy but let us send a boat on board of them and take out all the men that can possibly be spared that there may be no excuse for impressing them yes replied gascoigne and as the wind is falling it is possible it may fall calm and they may send their boats suppose we separate a mile or two from each other dat very good advice massa gascoigne observed mesty this plan was acted upon only three men were left in the lateens and four in the galliot and the vessels in obedience to the orders sheered off on both sides of the rebiera who made all sail and started ahead of the prizes this manoeuvre was perceived on board of the frigate and made them sure that it was a spanish convoy attempting to escape the fireengine was got on deck sails wetted and every exertion made to come up but about four oclock in the afternoon when the frigate was eight or nine miles off it fell calm as gascoigne had predicted and the heads of all the vessels as well as the frigate were now round the compass theres out boats said mr oxbelly they will have a long pull and all for nothing how savage they will be observed gascoigne never mind that replied jack mesty says that dinner is ready after dinner they all went on deck and found that the boats had separated one pulling for each of the prizes and two for the rebiera in less than an hour they would probably be alongside and now let us decide how we are to act we must not resist if they attempt to impress the men ive been thinking upon that matter mr easy and it appears to me that the men must be permitted to act as they please and that we must be neuter i as a lieutenant in his majestys service cannot of course act neither can mr gascoigne you are not in the service but i should recommend you to do the same that the men have a right to resist if possible is admitted they always do so and never are punished for so doing under the guns of the frigate of course we should only have to submit but those two boats do not contain more than twentyfive men i should think and our men are the stronger party we had better leave it to them and stand neuter dat very good advice said mesty leab it to us and mesty walked away forward where the seamen were already in consultation jack also agreed to the prudence of this measure and he perceived that the seamen after a consultation with mesty were all arming themselves for resistance the boats were now close on board and english colours were hoisted at the gaff this did not however check the impetus of the boats who with their ensigns trailing in the still water astern of them dashed alongside and an officer leaped on board cutlass in hand followed by the seamen of the frigate the men of the rebiera remained collected forwardeasy gascoigne and oxbelly aft what vessel is this cried the lieutenant who commanded the boats jack with the greatest politeness took off his hat and told him that it was the rebiera letter of marque and that the papers were ready for his inspection and the other vessels prizes to the rebiera cut out of malaga bay replied jack then you are a privateer observed the disappointed officer where are your papers mr oxbelly oblige me by bringing them up said jack fat jack of the bone house observed the lieutenant looking at oxbelly a lieutenant in his majestys service of longer standing than yourself young man replied oxbelly firmlyand who if he ever meets you in any other situation will make you answer for your insolent remark indeed observed the lieutenant ironically now if you had said you were once a boatswain or gunner consider yourself kicked roared oxbelly losing his temper heyday why you old porpoise sir observed jack who listened with indignation mr oxbelly is a lieutenant in his majestys service and you have no right to insult him even if he were not i presume you are all officers replied the lieutenant i am sir retorted gascoigne an officer in his majestys service and on board of this vessel by permission of captain sawbridge of the latona and i was until a few months ago sir continued jack at present i am captain and owner of this vesselbut here are the papers you will have no obstruction from us in the execution of your dutyat the same time i call upon the two young gentlemen by your side and your own men to bear witness to what takes place o very well sirjust as you please your papers i perceive are all right now you will oblige me by mustering your men certainly sir replied jack send all the men aft to muster mr oxbelly the men came aft to the mainmast with mesty at their head and answered to their names as the men passed over the lieutenant made a pencilmark against ten of them who appeared the finest seamen and when the roll had been called he ordered those men to get their bags and go into the boat sir as you must observe i am shorthanded with my men away in prizes and i as commander of this vessel protest against this proceeding if you insist upon taking them of course i can do nothing observed jack i do insist sir im not going on board emptyhanded at all events well sir i can say no more said jack walking aft to the taffrail to which oxbelly and gascoigne had retreated come my lads get those men in the boat said the lieutenant but the men had all retreated forward in a body with mesty at their head and had armed themselves some of the seamen of the frigate had gone forward in obedience to their officer to lead the men selected into the boat but they were immediately desired to keep back the scuffle forward attracted the notice of the lieutenant who immediately summoned all his men out of the boats mutiny by heavens come up all of you my lads mesty then came forward with a sabre in one hand and a pistol in the other and then addressed the seamen of the frigate i tell you dis my ladsyou not so strong as weyou not got better armswe not under gun of frigate now and ab determination not to go board pose you want us come take uspose you can by all de power but we make mincemeat of you anyhow the seamen pausedthey were ready to fight for their country but not to be killed by or kill those who were their own countrymen and who were doing exactly what they would have done themselves the lieutenant thought otherwise he was exasperated at this sensation you black scoundrel i left you out because i thought you not worth having but now ill add you to the number stop a little replied mesty the lieutenant would not take the ashantees very prudent advice he flew forward to seize mesty who striking him a blow with the flat of his sabre almost levelled him to the deck at this the men and other officers of the frigate darted forward but after a short scuffle in which a few wounds were received were beaten back into the boats the lieutenant was thrown in after them by the nervous arm of mestyand assailed by cold shot and other missiles they sheered off with precipitation and pulled back in the direction of the frigate there will be a row about this said oxbelly as soon as they come clear of the vessel if the frigate gets hold of us she will show us no mercy there is a breeze coming from the northwest how fortunate we shall be three leagues to windward and may escape i doubt if she could catch us at any point of sailing they may come up with the prizes but can do nothing with them no the boats which boarded them are already returned to the frigate she must wait for them and that will give us a start and it will be night before they can make sail fire a gun for the prizes to close said jack we will put the men on board again and then be off to palermo as fast as we can we can do no better said oxbelly if ever i chance to meet that fellow again i will trouble him to repeat his words trim the sails my lads his language was unpardonable observed jack since ive been in the service mr easy i have always observed that some officers appear to imagine that because they are under the kings pennant they are warranted in insulting and tyrannising over all those who have not the honour to hoist it whereas the very fact of their being kings officers should be an inducement to them to show an example of courtesy and gentlemanly conduct in the execution of their duty however unpleasant it may be it is only those who insignificant themselves want to make themselves of importance by the pennant they serve under replied our hero very true mr easy but you are not aware that a great part of the illwill shown to the service is owing to the insolence of those young men in office the kings name is a warrant for every species of tyranny and unwarrantable conduct i remember mrs oxbelly telling one of them when i beg your pardon mr oxbelly interrupted jack but we have no time to chat now the breeze is coming down fast and i perceive the prizes are closing let us lower down the boat send the men on board again and give them their orderswhich i will do in writing in case they part company very true sir it will be dark in half an hour and as we are now standing inshore they will think that we intend to remain on the coast as soon as it is quite dark we will shape our course for palermo i will go down and look at the chart chapter xli which winds up the nautical adventures of mr midshipman easy in half an hour the prizes were again alongside the men put on board and the boat hoisted up the frigate still remained becalmed to leeward and hoisted in her boats they watched until she was hid by the shades of night and then wearing round stood away with the wind two points free for the coast of sicily the next morning when the sun rose there was nothing in sight strange anomaly in a state of high civilisation where you find your own countrymen avoided and more dreaded than even your foes the run was prosperous the weather was fine and the prizes did not part company on the sixteenth day the rebiera and her convoy anchored in palermo bay the wind was light in the morning that they stood in and as jack had a large blue flag with rebiera in white letters hoisted at the main don philip and don martin were on board and greeting our hero before the rebieras anchor had plunged into the clear blue water the information which our hero received after having been assured of the health of agnes and her parents was satisfactory the disappearance of the friar had at first occasioned much surprise but as the servants of don rebiera swore to his return without the black and the letter of don rebiera sent to the convent requesting his presence was opened and read there was no suspicion against the family a hundred conjectures had been afloat but gradually they had subsided and it was at last supposed that he had been carried off by the banditti some of whom had been taken and acknowledged that they had seized a friar on a day which they could not recollect the reader will remember that it was mesty the rebiera received pratique and jack hastened on shore with don philip and his brother and was once more in company of agnes who in our heros opinion had improved since his departure most young men in love think the same after an absence provided it is not too long the prizes were sold and the money distributed and every man was satisfied as the cargoes fetched a larger sum than they had anticipated we must pass over the pros and cons of don rebiera and his lady the pleading of jack for immediate nuptials the unwillingness of the mother to part with her only daughter the family consultation the dowry and all these particulars a month after his arrival jack was married and was of course as happy as the day was long a few days afterwards mr oxbelly advised departure as the expenses of the vessel were heavy and it was his duty so to do don philip and don martin obtained leave to go to england with their sister and her husband nevertheless jack who found palermo a very pleasant residence was persuaded by the don and his wife to remain there a month and then there was crying and sobbing and embracing and embarking and at last the rebiera whose cabins had been arranged for the reception of the party weighed and made sail for malta jack having promised to call upon the governor in four days they anchored in valette harbour and jack paid his respects to his old friend who was very glad to see him the governor sent his own barge for mrs easy and she was installed in the state apartments which were acknowledged to be very comfortable our hero had as usual a long story to tell the governor and the governor listened to it very attentively probably because he thought it would be the last which opportunity jack employed to narrate the unfortunate end of his father i would not have said so at the time mr easy but now the wound is healed i tell you that it is the best thing that could have happenedpoor old gentleman he was mad indeed our hero remained a fortnight at malta and then signora easy was reembarked and once more the rebiera made sail fare you well my lad what i have seen of your brothersinlaw pleases me much and as for your wife it will be your own fault if she is not all that you would wish if ever i come to england again i will pay my first visit to forest hill god bless you but sir thomas never did go back to england and this was their final adieu once more the rebiera pursued her course stopped a day or two at gibraltar shared the proceeds of the captured gunboat and then made sail for england where she arrived without adventure or accident in three weeks thus ended the last cruise of mr midshipman easy as soon as their quarantine at the motherbank was over they disembarked and found dr middleton and mr hanson waiting for them at the george hotel our hero scarcely had time to introduce his wife when the waiter said that a lady wished to speak to him she did not wait to know if jack was visible but forced her way past him jack looked at her large proportions and decided at once that it must be mrs oxbelly in which conjecture he was right pray sir what do you mean by carrying off my husband in that way exclaimed the lady red with anger god forbid that i should have to carry your husband mrs oxbelly he is rather too heavy yes sir but its little better than kidnapping and theres a law for kidnapping children at all events i shall send my lawyer to you that you may depend upon you hardly can consider your husband as a child mrs oxbelly replied jack laughing very well sir we shall see pray where is he now he is on board mrs oxbelly and will be delighted to see you im not quite so sure

seat in parliament don philip and don martin after two months stay took their passage back to palermo fully satisfied with the prospects of their sister as to competence and happiness jack had no

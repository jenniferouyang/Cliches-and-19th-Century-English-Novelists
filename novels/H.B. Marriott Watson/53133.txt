contents page under the moon the draper's niece miss and my lady the lord chief justice the attack on the chaise the gentlemanly haberdasher the man in black the lady in the coach the turtle doves my lady's ring gallows gate the high toby under the moon i ever had the name of one that kept to himself nor was bedfellow to none upon the high toby 'tis true enough that i have mixed in one or two affairs with others of my kidney but these were mainly in my heady youth and when i was raw upon the pad and the issues for the more part were against me for one there was that business with creech about the king's treasure chests the which came near to hanging of us all through that toad timothy grubbe indeed i have never cared to participate in any act that was not of my own devising and there was none on the road that i would ha' pinned my faith on no not even old jeremy starbottle that was hanged afore my time for this reason it was that i was used to avoid the portsmouth road which being so greatly traversed and so set with wastes and wilds was pretty much in favour with our gentry i was often in the west where my chief quarry lay or the north road was that on which i beat but lord there was no point nor parcel of these shires that knew me not at one time or another and i warrant i kept the officers all over the country a jigging yet i was once took for an affair near petersfield and swore not to touch that road again but to leave it to the scurvy tiddlers that hold it i came back however once after and that was upon a late december night and when the moon was shining and the sky alight and glistening i had rode across from alton with two bottles of good wine under my jacket and a pocket of gold guineas and i was trotting across witley common whistling of an air very merry and with no thought but to come by town the easier lying maybe by guildford that night in a cosy private tavern that i knew some imp of mischief shook me up and cozened me that night for i had no intent in the world but to walk like a plain citizen or any talking parson yet what happens but this that i like a sorry fool spying of a coach that was running down from the hills with a great clatter and two postilions before set up a cry and a hulloa and ere they or dick ryder himself was aware of what he would do why calypso was alongside i had gotten the reins in my hands and the nose of my pistol was through the window the body of that coach trembled under a concussion of someone that threw himself about within but there came a voice on that stay nick you fool and let's guess at where we are 'sdeath says another voice i will run this fellow through young man says i seeing the moon shine clear upon his face as he peered through the window you know not with whom ye are dealing heaven rest the soul of them that withstand dick ryder at that the other man puts his head to the window also and looks out oh says he in a quiet voice so this is captain ryder i ha' heard some talk of you captain your name has travelled why yes said i laughing for this was no news to me you will find it from the quantocks to the humber and that with a significance i tell you sirs that ryder spells terror to those that he chooses well then says the second gentleman eyeing me queerly we are now to learn if captain ryder does so choose with us poor devils stab me cries t'other who was a hot young blood i will snick the rogue through avory you will do nothing of the like nick says he sharply would ye peril our precious lives hear ye not that i have some inkling of this gentleman's repute gad i would keep my skin sound so i would and turning to me he smiled pleasantly beckoning away my pistol that was still directed on the window we are at your mercy captain said he coolly what prize guess you that you have taken why said i i give not a groat for prize or no prize i do what i list and 'tis my whim to catch a pair of fine cocks thus well says he to the other i see we must needs open our pockets i thank heaven that 'twas you won from me this evening so i shall lose the less he was a tall fellow was this one with a fair wig and two cold eyes and he spoke in an equable fashion with neither a smile nor a frown upon him yet he had clearly a command of the other who prepared to empty his pockets this set me thinking what says i to myself is amiss with this game cock that he will not venture his spurs and i looked sharply on him captain ryder says he very deliberate there is on our bodies as i assure you as a gentleman but ten poor guineas scant alms for this great office of yours as i will admit deliver said i 'twill serve me for some madam in town as well as you that is very true ryder said he bending his golden eyebrows at me yet consider this behind these fine apparels no doubt you will say there is a stout purse somewhere ay so it is we are upon our way to godalming where we lie at the angel what d'ye suppose that any gentleman of the court would travel abroad so ill provided what does this mean i asked bluntly looking at both but very wary for i trusted him not look ye captain he answered showing his teeth i am in want of some such brave fellow as yourself and you shall choose between two courses whether to strip us of these few and paltry coins or to take service for a noble sum there is some emprise you would do i asked surprised nay a very easy task said he airily but one to be well paid i warrant what price would you put on this job said i considering i believe nick there is one hundred guineas awaiting at the angel is't not said he turning to his fellow he that was termed nick nodded in a surly fashion 'tis a nice round bag said i and what should be done for this for i was sick of these approaches and i liked him not i have a runaway wife says he with a faint smile faith captain she is a madcap she stalketh by day and by night and she has taken wings from her dear husband i would have you to unite us again i grinned on him for i knew what this portended sure this poor lady must be clipped but where i asked she rides from midhurst said he and doubtless will pass this way i had intended with this friend who is so kind to give me sympathy and his company i had intended to have catched her myself and brought her to a meeting but captain you will understand my feelings my emotions run i am wax she were best in your civil hands that would not imbrue themselves in hasty deeds you will soothe and dissuade her i warrant a man of your tongue she needs but a sure hand and a cool heart which i dare not promise i am disaffected by my passion i would use an instrument rather again i corresponded with him in a grin for i guessed at what fellow he was this is very well said i but by your leave i would learn what warranty have i of this payment you have the honour of sir gilbert avory said he i knew him then for what he was the greatest cupid in the court and one that stood at no hazards to boot there were tales of this sir gilbert in sooth upon every wench's tongue but this was no business of mine very well said i if 'tis a petticoat you are after i say no more faith i have been about them myself and i know no greater zest in a pursuit 'slife your worship i blame you not and you shall come by your own that is spoken with spirit he answered and now there remains to set you on your quarry the coach has a green body and the lady my lady that is is crowned with a mass of red hair there was never a nut said i given dick ryder but he cracked it i' the jaw then says he smiling civilly out of his broad face we have your leave to depart go in heaven's name said i laughing and if i get not those hundred guineas call me catchpole with that i drew off and the coach rolled away disappearing into the shining distance but i rode back a little distance until i had come to the half moon tavern in the middle of that wilderness here i sat for an hour or more hob a nobbing with the landlord and drinking of mulled wine to keep me warm there was no sound upon the roads in all that time so that i had grown to fear sir gilbert was mistaken and that the lady was gone another way a little on eleven however there comes a sound from far away and the landlord sets his ear to the door 'tis a coach says he and they drive fast they have a need said i with a yawn for 'tis growing late enough and indeed 'tis time i was upon my road with which i called on the ostler for calypso by the time i was in the saddle and standing ready before the tavern in that great open space of the woods the coach had rolled up and fled past into the night with a huge clamour and the groaning of axles and shrieking of postilions but in that glimpse of the lights i had seen that the body was of a greenish colour i pulled calypso out on the highway therefore and taking to my pistols set her to canter sharply across the waste the coach was flying like a frightened pigeon and the lights dwindled afore me shaking and rocking as they ran but i was in no hurry and fetched the mare nearer keeping her at an even distance then it seemed that some suspicion took them for the moonlight struck full upon me throwing me out like a black shadow a riding on them so the postilions heightened their pace plying their whips and when that would not serve they began to call out and turned the horses from the highway upon a track that ran among vast and sombre pines i cried to them to halt but the fools only increased their terror and their efforts and the big coach lurched and rumbled over the rough ground crashing among the branches of the firs while the horses galloped and leaped in a panic i put spurs to the mare and went after them cautiously enough for the road was darkened by the trees about it yet i drew nigh foot by foot being in no haste for the wretches knew not whither they rushed and presently i heard a woman's voice calling angrily and calling loudly and then there was a stream of oaths from the postboys mingled with some shrill screaming i came out at that instant from the cover of the firs and there before me was the coach sunk to its axles in a marshy place such as are thereabouts with the devil of a commotion in progress what ado is this i cried coming up and pulling in the nag but at that the screaming began again and one of the postboys levelled a pistol at me put up that toy said i sharply or by the lord i will let light in your brains you numbskull jerry do as the gentleman bids you said a woman's voice out of the coach and looking in i saw plain enough that i had here what i wanted she was a slim bodied girl with a great canopy of guinea coloured hair her bosom moved quickly for all her brave voice but that gave me a kindly sense of her who are you she says boldly enough while the maid was still whimpering by her bless those red lips says i but who should i be save one attracted by your distress who is come to help you she regarded me doubtfully come i went on let me give you a hand mistress for that pretty face will ere long kiss the mud else which is no business for it she shrank away but i took hold on her come come said i by your leave pretty miss she trembled but she kept her face i will give you what you wish she answered put no finger upon me here is my purse you would not rob my maid 'tis not your purse i want said i laughing but your person my dear oh she cried out in alarm and then had not these cravens refused my commands we should be galloping into milford and not thus at your mercy i would ha' gone not only to milford but to the gallows for that sweet face i said bowing what would you do with me she asked now all of a flutter know you not that i am mrs barbara crawford wife to mr crawford of grebe fie said i laughing at her i would be ashamed at your years to talk so what does a chit like you know of wives she turned red and then suddenly white as i haled her from the coach struggling with me like a vixen fire jerry fire she cried but the lout was too frightened and so i flung her before me on calypso and with a discharge of my pistol through jerry's hat as he fumbled with his blunderbuss which set up a new alarm i got out of the marsh swiftly and was soon striking through the firs towards milford this mrs barbara as she called herself wrestled like satan but presently came to be quiet and says she in a cool voice i would sit up fear not you have done your will with me there is spirit in this wench said i and i fetched her up on the mare's crupper where she sat gaping out into the night you go by blind ways said she next this is not the road why said i no or that dulcet voice of yours would call louder than i like you may squeal my pretty says i but you are bound upon what path your legs should go and what path is that she asked soberly 'tis where all women walk i answered with a chuckle they know the road i have seen 'em ride that way in troops you have a generous knowledge of the sex says she after a pause i ha' been in many circumstances said i and i know a stark wench also mark ye i know when one kicks that would be fain i think you mistake me sir said she with dignity but whither are we set what you shall see that you shall see said i lightly for i had an acquaintance with women and knew what way was best to take them sir says she to me on that i have no doubt that you are a man of honour ay so it is there you would tickle me i cried laughing gadzooks so i am and one to keep my word whenever it is given then 'tis given against me she said after a moment's silence and very gravely faith but you talk too much i cried in an irritation at her persistence you shall neither cajole nor trick me and that's plain enough for you i have shut my ears afore to many pleading tongues that wagged in dainty mouths you are none so sweet as to dissuade me madam fair though you be she was silent again for a time and then she spoke bitterly ay said she yet 'tis my fairness that has pulled this ruin upon me why you gabble of ruin said i with a sneer as one that wears the buskin i warrant there is that in you that knows well enough and laments not i care not what ye think or what ye wish you shall do my will and no other she made no answer and now we were come to a hamlet upon the back parts of milford where a stream ran under a bridgeway and by high cliffs 'twas a place called eashing here was an inn that i had once visited with an old goose neck for a landlord and taking pity on mrs barbara if she were so called and her white face i stopped before the door and demanding to be shown into a privy room led her thither you will have a glass of wine against your faintness said i quickly but i will have no speaking raise your voice and you shall learn the worst and what it is to offend dick ryder she said nothing but sat very still and pallid watching me with fluttering eyes nor would she take the wine i ordered drink my little cockatrice said i with command and on that she sipped at the liquor making a pretence a little after comes the innkeeper and staring on us beckons me forth with his finger i stepped into the passage wondering what game this might be when says he suddenly i recognise you captain yonder are fine feathers a precious morsel you ha' gotten somewhere says he oh damn your words says i d'ye suppose i left my home to hear this muck no captain says he lowering his voice but there has been a pother on the heaths this past week and the traps are about there is one or more in the room behind you at that i whistled and thanked him i will put the wine in my gullet and mizzle said i not that i cared for the traps but 'twas safer for the aim i was making so i was not three minutes ere i was in the saddle with the girl as before and we were riding amain for godalming you ride hard sir said she presently and when i made no answer for to say the truth i wanted no more of her voice and the job for the first time disaffected me i think i should say she went on quietly that when you were with the taverner there was one looked in upon me from a further room why d'ye say this i asked abruptly he was well armed says she and there was another with him i had but to raise my finger she says quietly why did you not i asked in a surprise i knew nought of them she answered and i know this of you that you are more honest than you seem sir at that i laughed though i will confess the wench took me by her talk pretty parrot well you must know i said that those were the officers of the law who watched you and they would ha' been glad to lay hands on dick ryder it may be she replied thoughtfully but i regret not there is that in your face i would rather trust at that i pulled in calypso look you said i who are you and what do you here i can get no ease of this puzzle are ye maid saint or sinner nay but i am wife and maid sir says she her face deepening with colour i am the mistress barbara crawford that was wed this day at midhurst what cried i you are wed this day indeed says she 'tis so and now am i stolen away and like to be no longer what i am where is your husband i asked sharply fixing her with my eyes he was called away almost ere the marriage was finished she answered distressfully there was news brought of his father's illness and he rode off yet was he to meet me this night at guildford for a moment i was silent for there leaped into my mind a notion of what that rogue sir gilbert avory was about and then for the creature drew me compassionately and she was but a chick for all her steady face by heaven says i but this is to go beyond me i spoil no proper sport not i and you and your husband sup together to night i promise you so shall ye she looked at me somewhat startled but with a glow of colour on her face i knew you were true i knew you were true said she repeating it and seizing of my hand oh faugh says i i am well enough for it irked me to think for what i had taken her all along will you tell me she asked in a hesitating voice who was it that put you to this you are welcome to that i returned bluntly 'twas sir gilbert avory himself she sighed so i had guessed she said he has persecuted me a full year and no doubt 'twas he that drew off my husband that as i knew was like enough but there was no time to fall discussing of mr crawford nor sir gilbert neither the hour was late and we must be pushing you will take me back says she softly i broke out laughing lord no says i bless your bobbing heart d'ye think you will find the coach still a sticking in the mud you will ride then to guildford she asked with some diffidence and regarding me beseechingly 'twould try your generosity to do this for me ay said i we ride for guildford but by way of godalming what she cried stricken with fear you would carry me where that man lies 'twas that very maggot was in my head mistress i said for indeed i had taken a notion to have the laugh of this same smiling beau she clasped her hands and would have appealed to me but i broke in sharply on that silly pate faith you must render yourself to me or i will none of it i make my plans and so abide you shall come off with a sound skin and cry 'pap' to your husband have no fears to this soothing she said nothing and presently we resumed our journey and getting into the town pulled up afore the angel it was now close upon midnight and there was but one light in the inn which shone from a room above mrs barbara looked on me in alarm when she saw this but she still said nothing as for me i left the mare standing a trick she was used to and pressed up the stairway with the girl it was not my design to seek sir gilbert avory for the nonce as i had other work to do but as it fell the matter was taken out of my hands for the man himself met us at the stair head smiling and courteous i give you welcome madam says he bowing with ceremony there is a chamber all prepared for you and a warming supper you must ha' gotten a rare appetite with the winds she returned him no word but shrank away towards me and says he to me i fear my lady has lost her tongue i' the cold you have had a rough journey but 'tis well done i swear the lady was never in more careful custody and a little smile illumined his even features as we had come upon him there was nought to do save to make the best of the case and though i will admit that at first i was put about i soon recovered my wits and entered the chamber with him whence the light shone with some merry jest on my tongue here was a table spread very generously and some wine heating by the fire by the lord said i i am fain of good liquor you have earned it captain says he pouring forth a glass but keeping his eyes on the girl i drained the glass and now says i to business sir gilbert ay to business sir says he and with a gentle motion of his hands he would have invited mrs barbara to an inner room these coarse facts are not for a lady ryder says he seeing the lady is a main pawn in this business by your leave she shall stay said i with a laugh why yes he says controlling his lips into that little smile she is certainly of chief importance but i would rather call her queen captain call her what you will said i bluffly 'tis all you shall do with her my master he turned slowly from considering her and gazed on me quietly ha says he without showing any perturbation for he was a man of spirit and he must have suspected that something was wrong here we have a riddle for tobymen what is the explanation sirrah very simple said i grinning at him i ha' made the lady's acquaintance and ha' taken a fancy to her myself he raised his eyebrows while he looked from one to the other of us as though he would disentangle my real intention i fear me you have been drinking ryder said he pleasantly true said i but none so deep as you think would you go back on your bargain he asked bending his brows on me nay said i i will take no unfair advantage of any man huff or bishop we shall stand both of us where we stood you and i and where is that he asked as quietly as before upon the heath i answered i had you under my hands you and t'other and there were ten guineas atween you so ye said well said i i will have those guineas and cry quits with you ten guineas was it he says considering ah so 'twas i would not cheat you captain ryder and smiling softly he drew a bag from his pocket i perceive you to be a man of honour says he equably i love to do business so sure if there were more such at court ten guineas say you captain keep your tally and he paid out the pictures on the table afore him i took them up with a nod where i sat but the girl mrs barbara watched us from the distance standing with her arm resting upon a tall chair to support her then here's your good health sir gilbert said i wondering what method he would take for i was sure enough that he had a design against me now says he we are quits as you say and that leaves us free you to go your way and me to ask the offices of the law to recover that which is stolen of me nick cries he in a clear voice and at the word the young fellow's nose was through the door an officer from the justice nick he says i have been robbed and smiled pleasantly in my face now i will confess that this predicament had not occurred to me for to say the truth i had a thought that he would fall on me with his weapon which i minded not being as good a swordsman as ever any chamber knight in town and on that astonishment followed also these sequels in my mind that if so be he carried out the plan he had i should not only go to the jug but he would have the wife that was maid this put me in a frenzy yet i dared not attack him with nick outside and i knew not what other also so very quickly making my resolution i broke out a laughing and said i you have me held your worship by heaven you have yet i was but jesting am i a fool to peril a hundred guineas for a chitty face come here are your ten guineas pay me down my price and there stands your madam for you he cocked his eye on mrs barbara smiling the while as if pleased with his victory but mightily civil madam he says you will see that i have no responsibility in this insult 'tis the gentleman's manner no doubt i can but think myself fortunate to deliver you of his custody but she stood where she was white and fearful throwing her troubled eyes about and part of her terror was no doubt feigned but i think that in part it was earnest she knew not poor wretch what i would be at but lord love you i had no fears the hundred guineas says i and i pray mr nick for witness for i was resolved to get that young bantam into the room forthwith ho nick says sir gilbert merrily come in for a witness to me and in steps that young and elegant ninny looking very sour and sleepy sir gilbert pulled out his bag and counted the money to me 'slife says he with a frown 'tis like the thirty pieces and then he shrugged his shoulders i took 'em up one by one and with the very movement in which the last was taken to my pouch out slipped my sword and defend ye defend ye said i or i will run ye through d'ye think to get even with dick ryder you fool you sir gilbert started back and lugged out his iron and master nick leaped forward let be nick let be says t'other the fellow shall have his way devil take him he shall feed the crows some way but in the course of my life i have never come upon any save one that was more than the match of dick ryder and so he soon found for he plied his point elegantly but with no proper freedom and presently down comes i with my favourite twist and took him through the left breast he fell a bleeding to the floor curse you he cried and gasped but nick then sprang at my throat with his weapon drawn yet was i no such lambkin to be took unawares by such a raw smooth face what says i d'ye fancy that such as i will take thought to drill holes in veal not i young master not i and dodging his point i drove the hilt of my rapier hard upon his forehead he dropped like a shot partridge and giving neither any further thought i turned to the lady fly says i down the stairway mistress for i have not a blink of wind more within me she ran in terror and i clattered after her being afraid lest the noise might have woke those in the inn and so indeed it proved for when we were got into the road where calypso stood a commotion broke out behind us and i heard sir gilbert's voice raised in angry oaths 'twas the work of a moment to set the lady on the mare and to leap after her calypso has carried heavier burdens than that yet she has carried none so gallantly or so speedily and thus it had grown to be scarce one o'clock in the morning on that frosty night when we reached guildford in company and drew up at the red lion the draper's niece 'twas late of night when i reached wimbledon common out of the west where i had been patrolling the roads for some two months or more and with mighty little success as it chanced that year i love the west country not only because i have as a rule found there fat pockets jogging home untimely on a nag or fine noblemen in rich chaises very proud but tender to pick but i have also a sentimental leaning towards that part and that's the truth i will not deny there is some that hanker after the great north road and boast that there is no better toby ground than 'twixt stevenage and grantham while i have even known 'em to set up finchley common or hounslow for choice old irons who never had much self respect and was not above turning common crib cracker if it so served him was wont to go no further than finchley when he was lacking a goldfinch or two sink me says he in my presence once to the landlord of the king's head who spoke of his score there i will pay you to morrow and be hanged to you the which he did sure enough by a visit to finchley and not so much as a charged pistol that was never my way i never could abide such sport give me a creditable fellow that shows fight and gives your wits some exercise there's the true spirit in which to take the life of the road i would not give a pint of mulled ale for it else but the west is after my heart being big and populous and swarming with squires and comfortable warm folk i know the north road and was once very well known there myself and celebrated on the yorkshire moors a confounded cold uncivil place indeed there are few parts of the kingdom i have not traversed in my time well i was newly out of the west that may night but on this occasion in no very good humour as you may imagine when i say that i had been forced to leave a belt of guineas behind at devizes so close upon me were the traps indeed i was very nearly taken in the night all owing to the treachery of an innkeeper roast him 'twas a fine mild night and i was for lying in clerkenwell at a house i knew but i had reached no further than roehampton lane when of a sudden i reined in for i remembered an inn there that i had sometimes used and to say the truth i was thirsty well thinks i maybe i will lie here and maybe not i will let fortune decide and i was turning the mare into the lane when something comes up quick in the thick of the darkness and rushes upon calypso's rump the mare started and backed into the hedge and i raised my voice and cursed as you may guess why says i you toad you muckrake you dung fork and the lord knows where i should ha' gotten to if a gleam of white in the blackness had not in that instant disclosed to me the blunderer 'twas a woman or at least a slip so young and silly that maybe she should not be so styled and i had no sooner made that out and ceased in the middle of my objurgations than i made another discovery it was her voice that did it for no doubt she was mightily in terror seeing me so wrathful and the night being so black and lonely oh sir she calls in a trembling voice i did not see i and here she broke a weeping well dick ryder is not the man to stand by while a pretty woman weeps for i could have sworn she was pretty enough and so down i popped off calypso and approached her why said i i love not to see a miss like you in tears and as for my words pray forget them i thought you was some blundering hulking bully that was meat for my bodkin or my whip if no more but as it is says i there's no more ado so dry your eyes my dear for i am no ogre to eat pretty children oh she says with a gulp i was not afraid of you i only feared i had angered you justly oh i said trying for a look at her face in the darkness why i see you are a very brave girl for sure that i'll swear you are and if those pearly drops be not for me why i should like to know what opened the wells my dear and then i will see if you have broken the mare's leg with your onset and get on to bed like any honest sober man that leaves the witching hours to maids and misses and innocent children as is only right and proper i do not suppose the girl took me for women have but scant appreciation of irony but she spoke glibly enough i i am thrown out into the night sir she cries i have nowhere to go now you may imagine how this touched me and what i felt but she was innocent as a lamb and as foolish as you might detect from her voice to say nothing of her face the which i saw later so i considered a moment that's just my case said i and i was going to wake up some fat villain to take me in and sup me but says i if you will find me the particular villain fat or lean and cock or cockatrice that has thrown out a ba lamb like you miss well 'tis he or she i will have awake and out and something more beside rip me if i don't i had put her down as a child from her stature which was small and her body which was slight but i was to be undeceived in that presently 'tis my uncle she sobbed he has shut the door on me he will not let me in he vows he has done with me maybe said i he has some cause for his anger but uncles are not hard masters even to young misses that know not the world nor their own minds nay she says he has a reason for his anger and he will not relent he has threatened me before and he is full of burning fury he will not have me back she said in a voice of hesitating timidity and seeming of a sudden to have taken in the shame of her situation she began to withdraw into the night not so fast young madam said i you have broken my mare's leg i believe and i must have a talk with you what's the reason says i she paused and then in a tremulous quick voice said he will not hear that george riseley shall marry me oh ho said i i begin to smell powder and he has turned you out of doors no she faltered he would not admit me i begin to see beyond my nose i said you were walking with this george and returned late she hesitated why come i said rallying her i'd ha' done the same myself although you would not credit it of a prim and proper youth like me you was back late yes says she in a low voice well said i old hunks shall take you in never fear so come along of me and show me where nunky lives and fumes and fusses at that i threw calypso's bridle over my arm and began to go along the road the little miss walking by my side something reluctant as i guessed but cheering as she went her uncle says she was a draper in the city with a good custom and a deep purse while this george was but a 'prentice with small prospects well i have no prospects myself said i but i warrant i can get what i want in the end 'tis the same with george let him worry at it as a dog a bone i'll wager he is a handsome fellow to have taken a pretty girl's eyes he is very handsome says miss with enthusiasm and he is the best judge of calico in the city damme says i smacking my thigh as we walked on together quite friendly damme that's the lad for my money and i don't wonder at you said i whereat poor chit she brings me forth tales of her blessed george's goodness and estimable virtues and how his master trusted him and how his neighbours loved him well i said best let 'em not love him too much or maybe this paragon will slip you and on that she came to a halt and falling very tremulous again pointed at a house 'tis my uncle's she says but there are no lights and he is gone to bed so shall you said i and forthwith went up and banged upon the door now i could guess very much what had happened in that house and how old hunks had taken a fit of choler and choking on it had sent his niece packing for a peccadillo to be sure she was out over late for virtuous maids but what's a clock in the balance with lovers' vows and if any was to blame 'twas this same george that should have been swinged not pretty miss like a dove thought i to myself old hunks slams the door in an anabaptist frenzy and presently after while setting on his night cap and a saying his prayers remembers and considers what a fool he is and how the girl is under his authority and malleable and that he has pitched her into the roads to come by what she may on a lone night what does that come to then but this that nunky sits uneasy and a tremble at the first knock and ready to open and take miss to his arms well i was right about the readiness to open but as for the rest you shall hear the door comes open sharply and there was an old fat fellow with a candle in his hand glaring at me who are you says he for my appearance took him by surprise well says i in a friendly way i'm not old rowley nor am i the topsman but something in between and what that is matters nothing but i found a poor maid astray on the heath and have taken the liberty to fetch her home safe and secure he pushed his head further out holding the candle so as to throw the light into the road it's you nelly said he sharply have i not said i have done with you go to your lover you baggage and he made a motion to pull to the door but my foot was inside softly said i softly gaffer this is your niece i believe nodding over my arm to miss well he snarled as she is mine and not yours i can do what i like with her oh is that how the wind blows said i then sink me but i shall have to go to school again to learn morals but there is one thing i have no need to learn again and that's how to knock sense and discretion into a thick head said i meaningly and at the same time i threw the bridle over calypso's ears and stood free before the old villain he looked at me a moment the flame of the candle wagging before his face and the grease guttering down the candlestick you do not understand sir he said in a quieter voice i have to give my niece lessons i have to teach her by severity but since it is probable that she has been sufficiently frightened by this night's adventure and come to reason let her enter and so saying he stepped back and held the door wide that he was of a savage uncontrollable temper was evident but i had not reckoned with the old bear's cunning and i vow i was to blame for it so old a hand as dick ryder should not have been caught by so simple a trick yet he was miss's uncle and how was i to suspect him so deeply at anyrate the facts are that on seeing him alter so reasonably and step back with the invitation on his lips and in his bearing i too stepped back from the doorway to leave way for miss to enter then of a sudden bang goes the door to shaking the very walls of the house and a great key is turned on the inside groaning rustily i will confess i felt blank but i recovered in a moment when out of the window above the old rascal stuck his head let her go back to her lover he says with a sneer or maybe you can take her yourself i want no soiled pieces in a christian house and then the head was withdrawn the window shut tight and the house was plunged in darkness you may suppose how this usage annoyed me who am not wont to be treated in so scurvy a fashion or to come out of any contest so shabbily i was on the instant for flying at the door and employing barkers and point forthwith but it is not wise to leap too soon with your eyes shut and so i held my temper and my tongue only showing my teeth in an ugly grin as i turned to mrs nelly why says i the old buck has said the truth and there is something in his whimsies after all it seems that george and i must fight or toss for you my dear you must remember that i had not seen her face all this time for all the streaming candle the old gentleman carried but i gathered that she was in distress from the note of her voice which trembled you cannot mean it sir she cried and shrank away into the darkness whence i caught the noise of sobbing why bless you child said i touched at the exhibition of her weakness and innocence such chitterkins as you are no meat for me pretty as you be i'll swear no you're for george or may i perish i would as leave mishandle a sucking babe as pink and white and fifteen so i would child sir says she staying her tears and speaking with an air of dignity vastly entertaining i am past eighteen well says i if you are so old as that i would i had a mother like you granny but as for old suet yonder rip and stab me if i do not pay him back in gold coin before two hours is out and in the meantime you come along with me grandam i think she was confused and fluttered to be so addressed not understanding my sarcasm but she followed me obediently not having any ideas of her own poor soul i led the way towards roehampton where i had made up my mind she should lie meanwhile in the care of a wench i knew at the inn i was fashioning in my mind a plan for the confounding of the old tub of lard as i went for i never lose time but am speedy at my aim yet all the same i talked with miss pretty jovial for she was a shrinking slip of a girl who was beginning now to get scared and no wonder when we were got to the tavern i came into the tap room and called out for costley who had the house then but is since dead of good liquor and out runs he in his apron with a lively face for he was in a merry state enough the hour being late what dick ryder says he in surprise yes 'tis dick ryder says i and he wants a bed along of sally for a little madam and supper for both a madam he calls out and laughs broadly 'tis unexpected orders captain says he at least 'tis put in an amazing odd way but he cries out bursting with his news old irons is here what that old damber said i annoyed for i was no friend to old irons yes said he eagerly you'll sup along of him damme i won't said i i want no cutpurses in my company come captain says he protesting for he had a fear of me and knew of my repute on many roads fair play and equality in a trade says he i was on the point to give him the rough edge of my tongue for it was like his impudence to try cozening me when down the stairs into the passage came a man walking very stiffly and with his head in the air i stopped at once for i knew not who he might be and down he stepped into the light showing a foppish sort of a face hair very particularly curled and a becoming dress no sooner did i clap eyes on him than i knew what kidney he was and that he was not worth two blinks of the ogles as they say so i turned my back on him and was beginning on costley again when i was surprised by the girl's voice crying out from the entrance behind me what the devil says i flying about for i thought she was insulted maybe by some of costley's fellows and i ran to the door but there was she with her arms about the neck of this jack a dandy what's this miss said i beginning to think there was some truth in old nunky's words after all and at that she stepped into the inn in her excitement and i saw her plainly for the first time lord there was nothing in her face that would not have convinced any court at old bailey forthright she was prettily handsome like a doll that turns eyes up or down and smiles out of pink cheeks in which were two dimples mighty enticing up she comes in a rush almost breathless and breaks out to me 'tis he 'tis he sir who the devil is he said i sharply 'tis mr riseley she says somewhat abashed he has been supping here and is setting forth for his lodging i commend his discretion i said dryly an excellent good place for supper so it is specially for young bloods like that well says i since you're content as it seems i will leave you and young cupid and be about my business at that she looked dumbfounded but she begins stammering and paused i threw a glance at riseley who stood by with an air something 'twixt arrogance and uneasiness i plumbed his depths for i have come across many such as he in my time fine feathers enough and nothing behind 'em but it was true that the coxcomb's appearance did not better her case beyond the titillation of mutual affection so i considered and the idea i had taken suddenly bloomed forth in my mind there was old irons and here were we i could have laughed aloud to think how i was for binding all the threads in one to say nothing of nunky's on the common so i turned about to costley i was wrong says i i will do captain irons the honour to sup with him and this young gentleman i make no doubt will join me i beg your pardon i i have supped he stammered 'tis a friend i heard her whisper if it were not for him i know not what must have happened to me well says i miss here will sup at anyrate at which i saw his colour move i will take the pleasure myself to keep you company sir said he and forthwith we marched into the room here was old irons rude jovial and blatant as ever but happily not too far gone as yet he stared at my guests hard enough but seemed to be at a loss what to make of them or how to deal by them so that he was for a time pretty silent casting glances of perplexity at me and frowning as if he would invite me to say what i was doing he was drinking however of humpty dumpty which soon loosened his tongue what cock and pullet have ye got here dick says he in a loud whisper friends of mine says i oh says he and stared then passed off into a chuckle with his eyes twinkling on miss at which my apprentice in the fine clothes not knowing poor fool what sort of man he had to deal with fired up and demanded haughtily why he laughed at a lady but irons only roared the more paying no more heed to him than if he were a babe in arms shut your mouth says i to him seeing the girl's colour fly about why says he on the grin still you've turned anabaptist dick what fad's this i will say it's as toothsome and sweet mutton as if you close not your cheese trap said i sharply i will take leave to do it for you with my pistol butt at that old irons stared at me for he was never very quarrelsome save in his cups and he had a respect for me captain says he don't go for to say you're going to commit assault on old irons and shut his pretty peepers for ever i'll warrant this pretty lady would be affrighted by it and the gentleman too rip me when they see old irons a lying in his gore oh says i impatiently have done and pull up for i maybe shall want you afore the day comes now that's like dick ryder's own self said the old fool and feigned to wipe a tear from his eye and regain his spirits he whistled a snatch and called for more ale and brandy which was his favourite drink i will now proceed to deliver a toast captain says the dirty old rogue holding his beaker up and ogling towards miss here's to the beauty of roehampton rip me no of putney heath to kingston toast me that dick i let him drink his toast for i did not wish to thwart him too much in view of what i intended later and he continued in a wheedling tone to address the girl asking if she was not the duchess of this or my lady that and feigning to inquire after his friends at court in a mincing fashionable voice that was grotesque to hear but at last i stopped him for i thought it was time to come to business and moreover old irons had taken enough within his jacket for my purpose irons says i a man of heart and tenderness like you would be all agog to do service to a young lady that was in trouble and i winked at him meaningly across the table service says he starting up why i've just been pining dick all this time for you to come to it 'what's dick got' says i to myself and says myself to i 'maybe and i hope he will be for letting me strike a blow in behalf of youth and beauty' stab me dick those was my very words to myself well said i bluntly you shall have your wish old man and this young gentleman too who i see is regularly jumping for to join us i i know not what you mean stuttered the peacock having supped and being called on to retire to my lodging which is far hence i will take the opportunity to thank you sir for your hospitality and begone now at that i was only confirmed in the opinion i had formed of him as nothing but a cur of no spirit for here he was willing nay anxious to fly off and leave his lady in the hands of those whom he knew not with never a roof to cover her he had taken a fear of irons maybe or perhaps his suspicion was due to my masterful air but i was not going to let him escape that way specially as he was part of the plot i was laying against old nunky so i put my hand on his shoulder sit down said i cheerily you must not begone till you have put something inside of that brave coat of yours moreover says i here is a lady in trouble and if i read your honest face aright you are not the man to leave a poor maid in the lurch not you rip me no he's a brave young gentleman i can see it in his cheeks chuckled old irons i i do not know what can be done said the other in confusion i am willing to help in any way but her uncle refuses well said i looking on him attentively you may be thankful that you have met one who however inferior in courage does not need to cry mercy to your wits for here's my plan plain and pat and i gave it them there and then it had come into my head as i walked along the road with mrs nelly but i had the whole form perfect only when i had encountered the apprentice and heard irons was in the tavern old irons and i were to make an entry into the house and the peacock was to make the rescue by which means as you will see the way would be cleared for nunky's reconciliation with his niece's choice but no sooner had i told them than cries the peacock stammering but but i could not 'tis not seemly i will be no party 'tis time i was gone home oh very well says i then we will adventure without you and 'tis i will rescue miss from old irons the girl's eyes lighted up you will do it george says she beaming i believe it will convince my uncle of all that i have said of you he hesitated and being pushed into the corner knew not what to say but says he in a troubled voice and glancing from old irons to me and from me to old irons anxiously i do not know who these gentlemen are i sink me says old irons in a cozening voice d'ye think we are really on the toby why bless you young master we are both noblemen in disguise so we are and would think shame of this job if it were not to make an honest girl come by her own we're only a posing as crib crackers says he george says the girl in a voice of soft entreaty that would have persuaded a topsman no good will come of it said he with an air of protest 'twill fail and he cast up his eyes in despair agreed like a brave lad said i clapping him on the back and you shall drink to us and success with which i filled him up a pot of humpty dumpty well laced he drank and coughed but the compound mounting in his blood fired him presently so that he began to talk lightly and proffer advice and boast of what he would do and what part he would take why yes says old irons a pistol clapped at the head and bang goes the priming out flows the red blood sink me there you are as cold as clay and with no more life in you than in a dead maggot 'slife here's a jolly boy dick that is handy with his barker i'll vow but i stopped him ere he went too far and he and i prepared the arrangements we left miss behind in sally's charge with strict instructions and 'twas nigh three before we reached the house there i set the popinjay outside the window to shiver pot valiant until so be the time should come while irons and i went to the back of the house and made scrutiny of the yard there was little trouble in the job as it chanced for irons is skilled in the business which i should scorn to be holding it for a scurvy mean livered craft unworthy of a gentleman but i was committed to it for this occasion only and so was resolved to go through with it irons fetched out his tools and got to work and in a short time we were through the window of the kitchen and irons with his glim was creeping up the stairs but he stopped half way and whispered back to me as if he had only then recalled something what ken's this he asked using his cant word why an honest merchant's house said i and he traffics in calicoes look ye dick ryder says he sitting down on the stairs i may be dullard but rip me if i know how you stand in this why says i you need only know where you stand irons and that's pretty sure you know me he stared at me a moment and then said he well i'll empty old nunky of his spanks and we'll settle afterwards and he resumed his journey now what i had arranged with the apprentice was that i should knock upon the window when the time was come at which he would spring in with cries of alarm and fury falling upon the rascals that had dared break into the merchant's house at which irons and i were to make off and the old gentleman rising in terror from his bed should discover us in flight and his deliverer george full armed in possession yet it did not fall out quite in this way owing as i believe to old irons's muddled head and his stopping on the stairs at anyrate we were no sooner come to the hall after irons had visited two rooms than we were surprised by the figure of the old gentleman moving down the staircase in his night dress and a large blunderbuss in his hand stand says he seeing irons in the faint light stand rogue or i fire old irons uttered a curse and edging into the shadows put up an arm to slip the catches of the window but his knuckles fell on it with a rap as he withdrew the catch and immediately after there was a loud shrill cry the window fell open and there was our peacock in the midst calling in his falsetto surrender or i will blow a hole in you surrender by i could have broken out laughing at the sight only the situation promised to grow risky for old irons taken aback at this and never very particular when on his lay jumped up sharply and smashed at t'other with his pistol butt while to make confusion worse the old man in the night cap let off his blunderbuss such a screeching arose as would have astonished a churchyard of ghosts for the truth was old nunky hit george somewhere in his hinderparts and simultaneously down came irons's blow on his head that set his finger to work on the trigger of the pistol i had given him and ere i was aware something had took me in the big toe and set me cursing here says i grabbing old irons in the darkness for he was ready to destroy both in his wildness this is no place for a tender hearted chicken like you or me we're no match for savage fire eaters like these we'd best go and i dragged him through the window and we made off together when we reached the inn i called out the girl what has happened she cried eagerly well said i i think you had best walk home sharp i'll wager nunky will be calling for you presently to reward a gallant youth that has risked his life for to save him her eyes glistened and lord i believe the poor fool thought her george had been brave she clasped her hands oh i must thank you sir she cried nay never thank me said i for if i mistake not old irons has taken thanks for us both and would have had more if it had not been for young jack a dandy split him cries old irons i would i had hit him harder hit she cries and clutches at me nay never fear i said 'twas not irons but nunky's blunderbuss faith he took both wounds like a lamb i would i had his courage and was to be comforted like him but he is in no danger oh sir says she gratefully and if she were fool she was pretty enough and her innocence touched me for she had scarce understood anything of what we spoke but run home says i and i'll warrant you'll find him a rubbing of his head and nunky a hugging him for joy and gratitude but even ere i had finished she was gone flying lightly into the grey of the coming dawn and as i heard afterwards from costley what i had forecast was pretty accurate but i had finished with miss then and the next business was to divide with old irons 'twas the first time that i had ever engaged in a job with him and i vow 'twill be the last so scurvy was he in the partition but then i had always a detestation of so ungentlemanly a game as cracking cribs miss and my lady there are few people that can truly say they have tricked dick ryder and fewer still can say that in the end he did not wriggle out of his predicament whatsoever it might be and turn the tables on them yet of these few one i will confess was a woman and a woman i had eyes for though i am not fool enough to cast my wits away for a petticoat i have always admired spirit in the sex but there is a point at which it degenerates into vice and of such shrews or vixens i wish any man joy they are good to be beat if you be so inclined but for myself i have never taken up stick lash or fist against any woman and never would so long as i am free of the topsman the adventure happened when i was by maidstone in the summer of coming up from dover very merry i had ridden round from deal and lain at the crown in dover the night before and i warrant i had made the people of the inn open their eyes with what tales i told of court and old rowley and affairs of state i cannot say why but all the way from deal to london i seemed possessed of a devil that would wag me whether i willed it or not i am not used to be so precipitate but 'twas as if a cask of french brandy had gotten into my brains and set 'em a quarrelling at least i was gay headed and recked of nothing not that i care for any risk or peril under the sun if it be necessary but this was to go rollicking with the gait so to say of a drunken man whistling on danger and leering at fate a mighty foolish thing to do for any man there is no question but i would not have fallen into that blunder by leeds castle if i had been in any other mood but there it was the devil was in me as i say i pulled out of dover pretty late and with a parting wave of my hand at as sweet a kinxiewinsy as i have seen i started on the london road in good temper and good fettle but ere i had gone a mile or so i came up with a little fat dark fellow that had been at the inn and had listened agog to my tales it was lord sir say you so and bless me i would not ha' believed it and then again save us what shall we hear next well this little black man as it seems was steward or factotum or what ye may call it to my lady dane who also as it seemed had lain at dover overnight having crossed in a packet from france and was on her way to winchester by reigate and guildford the fellow was not given to talking but more to listening with his bless me s but he was a simple rustic and you may fancy that i led him on so that he opened his mouth as wide as i my ears for this lady dane was a rich widow so he said and moreover a woman that was greatly besought in marriage by many suitors of all degrees and both for her looks and her money 'tis not i that would blame any man that saw his chance to seize beauty and booty alike together 'tis the worst of it that they generally go singly at least to judge by what i have seen of fine ladies well says the little black man my lady dane was on a journey to her home on the itchin in the company of her niece that was daughter to the late sir philip's brother and he was going afore to prepare for them at maidstone as they were not yet started it seemed that my lady had property in maidstone and was for giving a water fountain to the town in her kindness my lady says he puffing himself out rises late like any lady of the court why said i she must be a rare fine woman that she must from your accounts i would like to clap eyes on her so that i might compare her with the beauties for he was the most obsequious in praise of his mistress that ever you heard and vexed my soul and the niece says i would be pretty handsome too the niece says he with a gesture of contempt waving his hands in a foreign way in imitation of what he had seen in france and thus nearly falling off his nag oh the niece is well enough says he and recovered himself carefully je ne sais quoi says he and shook his head with a mighty knowing look she would do pretty well but not in a capital not in paris or london where there is need always of the most elegant style you sir with your knowledge of cities know that you have the air it tickled me to see the little fool a sitting uneasily on his big horse with his toes cocked out on each side looking for all the world like a radish that would split as he bobbed and bounced up and down upon the saddle and mimicking foreign airs and tongues and manners as if 'twere natural to him but i kept a grave face until i had gotten out of him what i wanted by which time 'twas late in the afternoon for we had ridden together all the way and we were within ten miles of maidstone so i bade him good bye and good luck for he was not worth any gentleman wasting his hands on and turning the mare up a lane left him to pursue his way to maidstone alone but a mile or so along the lane i pitched on a wayside tavern where i took leave to rest and refresh the mare and myself while waiting for from what i had gathered from the steward the lady would make no start before twelve in which case she would not be in maidstone before six at the least so there i sat and waited with never a companion and not even a serving wench to clack tongues with a little before six i rode down and came into the maidstone highway near by leeds castle where the moat was shining in the descending sun and the pastures spread very ample and green to the heights beyond i waited there for an hour in a convenient copse and in the end got very tired damme says i with a yawn this mother beauty has overslept herself for certain and will save her jewels after all for i was in no mood to wait until the next day for the chance being due in london there was the lake first gleaming with the sun then with long shadows afloat and stretching and at the last plunged in vacant blankness this was near upon twilight and i was for cursing myself as a fool to attend upon the whims of a woman when there was the sound in the distance of rumbling wheels and i pulled calypso out and waited by the grassy border of the road 'twas not long before the chaise came up rolling in a dignified way down the hill and speaking of wealth and consideration in every spoke and appointment there was the coachman with his fellow beside him and two spirited horses and if you please by the lackey was a huge and bell mouthed blunderbuss like a brass viol i could ha' yelled for laughter at the sight of them and their brave preparations rip me what a formidable array 'twas with two gallant fellows in livery all ready to blow the soul out of such as galloping dick and his kidney why the first time i ever clapped peepers on 'em i could see that there was no fight in them so i put the mare right across the way and waited the twilight was come now and the coachman called out to me to stand aside are you drunk says he as he draws up of necessity no says i i am only a poor fellow that's thirsty and tired of waiting on you and would like to be drunk said i 'tis a 'wayman shouted t'other lackey and pulled up his blunderbuss but i put the point of my sword in his wrist and he dropped it with a howl what's this now cried a voice from the interior of the chaise and pushing the mare to the window i looked in there was the lady sure enough of whom the little fat man had spoke and he had been right about her looks for in her anger she was mighty handsome but her companion that was the niece according to the steward was by no means what he had suggested being a tall girl of a delicate beauty with a gentle kindness in her eye very becoming to modest virginity my lady was in a storm of anger who are you she said furiously why said i i know not if 'tis of consequence to your ladyship to discover who it is or who it isn't that rumpads you so long as you be rumpadded but if it be any convenience to you why set me down in your accounts as galloping dick of the roads and debit me with what you will says i you would rob me said she looking at me sharply and as i could see controlling herself with an effort your ladyship has a mind that flies direct to the point said i politely i call miss in witness of its quickness never so much as a word have i spoke afore you out with your guess 'you would rob me' says you why damme i will not deny a lady she looked at me in doubt for a moment as if she would count me up and then it was that i got my first idea of her quality for her gaze pierced me through and there was capacity in her very bearing you would rob a poor woman said she next in a softer voice i thought 'twas only fat bloated purses that you gentlemen of the road would steal no says i i take nothing under five hundred guineas and if there be some jewels to crown the pile i will not refuse them for this i knew from the little fat fool's talk was what her ladyship carried she bit her lip but still kept her temper i see you are pleased to jest with me said she you gentlemen are as light of heart as of finger come you shall have my twenty guineas if you are so hard and i will even refrain my curse if you will kindly withdraw your head and allow me to proceed and at that she thrust towards me a little bag she was as cool as ever i have seen man or woman which was the more remarkable seeing how evil was her real temper but i took the bag and still kept my place hark you madam said i for i was not ill pleased to have a duel worthy of my tongue and skill galloping dick never makes a wanton boast nor asks what he gets not nor is afraid of his own mind there is five hundred guineas with you the which i will beg of you for a keepsake and in kind memory also will ask those pretty toys and i pointed at her necklace had i not been kept a yawning my head off the two hours by the wayside maybe i would have taken the one and left t'other but sink me i am of a mind for both now says i again she shot me a glance and i thought for a moment that she would have shouted an order to her servants and have driven on and trusted to chance but perhaps she came to the conclusion that the hazard was too great as indeed it was for i would have clapped holes through chaise and coachman ere they had rolled three paces and her ladyship might have come off in that case worse than i was for leaving her at anyrate she did nothing so foolish but merely uttered an exclamation in which her fury and her chagrin were indicated and says she in angry despair will nothing make you give up cannot i persuade you in any way to use me decently lord forgive you i thought that the toby had some sense of gallantry by the lord said i promptly and if there is any huff that says 'no' to that i would run him through his midriff we are no money weasels and least of all dick ryder and maybe that name is known to you madam said i why i have heard it sure says she eagerly and those that have spoken of you have given you a good name for a brave and chivalrous fellow i have a good repute and that widely said i for 'twas true enough and maybe she had heard of my adventure with old rowley and the duchess of cleveland in which i played a pretty figure why of course said she i recall you now your name captain has been bruited about the roads from one end of the kingdom to the other and it has always come to my ears in good condition if i recall aright there was a tale in which you did some good to an honest woman does your ladyship refer to mrs barbara crawford and to her abduction said i why said she now 'tis what i did think of more especially as a great friend of mine acquainted me with the facts 'twas on the york road said i looking at her for her glib tongue of a sudden had made me shy at her like a colt of two years 'twas there captain as i remember now well said she well says i 'tis strange you should ha' happened upon some witnesses to that little episode for i thought it had passed out of mind but seeing your ladyship is so mindful of me let me hang if i do not mark it upon my account with you this i said having discovered how greatly false she spoke for 'twas not on york road but by guildford that the affair happened and i would swear that she had heard not a word of it which nevertheless she might very well have done seeing that it was notorious in the town at that time i am always glad to meet a famous man said she no more than i a handsome lady said i and to show how deeply i am in earnest i will forego half the account and all the jewels for a salutation from miss there to say the truth i had enjoyed my bout with the lady and was disposed to be lenient to her for all her airs and sharpness but the sight of the niece's eyes of a sudden warmed me and incited me for she was looking at me gently with an odd expression of interest and of wonder and her bosom rose and fell swiftly you may guess that that set it on even a swifter ebb and tide what d'ye mean asked her ladyship i am a gentleman adventurer said i and damme i will not deny my calling 'tis efficient at the least but if miss there will permit me the salutation rip me you shall go scot free at that miss shrank into her corner all the expression fled from her face which was white and stark but my lady turns on her hear you that celia says she buss and let us get on since this gallant gentleman must have already delayed himself over long you are right said i 'tis a scurvy long time since i ha' been waiting here if you haste not celia says she very ironic in tone the gentleman will be getting impatient as well he may seeing your pale beauty now this for 'twas nothing but a sneer set me against her the girl being mightily more handsome than herself and of a fine frailty but i said nothing only looked at miss who seemed as if she would have withered out of the chaise celia cries her ladyship sharply you you must be jesting madam you cannot mean it says miss in a low voice i have stood much from you but this insult but my lady broke in you will do what i say she said harshly i command you i will not says t'other indeed madam i may not ask me not so to violate myself upon that her ladyship turned about hark ye she said and whispered in her ear and upon that observing her to wince she said aloud what d'ye hesitate when 'tis to spare five hundred guineas and some odd jewels including your own i i value not mine madam says miss trembling well there is mine said she and if they be of not much marketable value there is a higher value i put upon them since they were given me by your dear uncle you shall save them but lord i am a pretty judge of jewels and she was lying for there was more worth in her jewels far than in her guineas but i said nothing only listened to hear what miss would answer she hesitated and her ladyship made a peremptory gesture why 'tis cheap enough said she sardonically miss still hesitated and then as it seemed on a rap from her ladyship very white of face and drawn leaned across to the window i saw the large eyes gleam in the faint light and they were like pools at even in which the stars do set but her lips were trembling i have never bought jewels so cheap says my lady with her sneer thinking no doubt that the bargain was struck now and the act consummated no says i i kiss no maid against her will fetch forth the pieces and the toys my lady miss fell back still white and i saw something leap in her eye she put her kerchief before her face and sobbed damme says i roughly out with the goldfinches or must i make bold to help myself from ye there is too much prattle here and i have delayed long enough the lady had gone red with anger and moved her arm as though she would have struck someone in her fury but suddenly containing herself and considering as i must suppose that 'twould put no embargo on the guineas and the diamonds she says says she if my niece will not save my jewels at the price i at anyrate will save hers and she leaned softly towards me now in a flash i saw what she intended and how she would go any length to preserve her property the which gave me but a poor thought of her for a basely avaricious woman with no pretensions to honour and as was clear a very brutal mind and temper towards the girl so i did that which maybe i should not ha' done though 'tis hard to say and no one ever accused dick ryder justly of handling a woman harshly but she would have put me in a hole else with her quickness and her cunning and there was only the one way out which i took no says i there is no talk of miss's jewels what she may have she may keep i war not on pretty girls and as for yours madam damme there's nothing will save 'em no split me there isn't she fell quite white as i could see even in the gloom and for a perceptible moment hesitated 'twas then i suppose that she made up her mind casting this way and that venomously and desperately for a way out well said she in a muffled voice i cry you mercy here's what ye are wanting and she flung her bag at me and with her fingers that trembled undid the necklet she wore and handed it to me come that's the mood in which to take reverses says i cheerfully i'll warrant there's more where these came from and more behind them again for i should think shame to rob the last jewel from a neck that so becomes 'em this i said by way of consolation for her vanity if that were touched at my previous refusal but she said nothing to that only put her head nearer and addressed me with a chastened voice look ye captain i think you be a hard man but not so hard perhaps as you may seem i ask not for myself as you've taken all i had but for my niece here who has had the privilege of your benevolence to retain what she has you have said your name is ryder and i will believe you 'tis nothing to me now if it be ryder or creech as creech says i for i knew dan creech well and had indeed been in some surprises with him yes creech said she looking me steady in the face i was warned of a ruffian named creech that would haunt this road to maidstone well creech said i will reap nothing from bare acres no said she save from my niece and there she spoke truly enough as i saw for if creech was on that road and maybe he was i knew him better than to suppose he would be content with their asseverations he would rummage and overhaul would creech and there was never gold or farden would escape danny's notice not if 'twas as pitch black as midnight as you have been so generous said my lady i thought that maybe you would go further and save my niece from robbery and me from further needless alarms it seems to me though i may be prejudiced that you owe me that at least i thought on that for a moment and well i had not spared miss to let her fall a victim later so says i you mean that i shall give you my protection i see that you are quick of your wits said she speaking evenly now and not with any irony apparent done says i i will conduct ye to within a mile of maidstone and you shall go secure i'll swear to that will ye not be afraid to venture so closely asked she i will conduct ye up to the doors of maidstone said i damme i'll see you safe within the precincts spoken like a brave knight of the roads said her ladyship and lay back in her seat and now perhaps you will be good enough to bid my coachman drive on there was something in her tones which should have given me pause even then if i had been less pleased with myself but i had been hard with her not in the matter of the jewels only and i was disposed to meet her on a point for all that i was sure she bullied the girl so i rode on in the front and the coach rolled after me for all the world as though i were advance guard in protection of beauty which after all is pretty much what i was there was no denying looks to her ladyship but she was of a hard handsome face that has never taken me you would swear she would never change till the tomb swallowed her but would grow old and fade white insensibly battling for her beauty all the way and holding its handsome ghost until the end if there was anyone that would be attracted by her person and there must ha' been many to say nothing of her purse why thank the lord 'twas not i i would sooner lie in shackles at newgate than have lain in shackles to her at my lady's house not but what i can speak generously of her as witness what i have wrote of her beauty for i came out of the affair all right yet by an accident as you will see we had got near by maidstone within three miles and the twilight had thickened into dark there was never a soul upon the lonely road for you may conceive that i kept a sharp eye not only for danny if he should be about as was possible but also lest my lady should play any trick upon me by the way but i was not much afraid of that as i knew there was nothing between us and maidstone save a few scattered cottages and an insignificant village or two which i would have warranted to scare with a blank charge so when we were as i say within three miles of the town her ladyship put out her head and called to me see you said she there is the town drawing near and you expose yourself in the front it will serve if you ride behind and be for your better safety captain why said i what the deuce do i mind of riding before or behind there's none will take me and i will fetch ye into maidstone as i have said well captain said she with a laugh i will confess 'twas not wholly your safety that moved me which is not strange in the circumstances but i should feel more secure myself were my escort in the rear from which side 'tis more likely any assault would be made i came at you in the front madam said i ah captain ryder is captain ryder said she beaming and was not afraid of my blunderbusses and my rascals but conceive a less brave and straightforward adventurer that sees not only blunderbusses and lackeys but a gallant swordsman to boot in front 'tis surely from the rear such a one would attack oh well said i indifferently afore or behind matters nothing you will have no assault while dick ryder's sign manual is on you and that's his toasting fork and so i fell behind as she wished and we proceeded it was true enough what she said that the body of the coach would protect me from any eyes in front and that i could make off more easily from the rear but lord love you i had no thoughts of that and if i had been thinking of it it might have occurred to me that being in the van i could see more plainly into what we were running than if i were in the rear and sure enough that came near my undoing for we had not gone two miles further and were still some way out of the town bounds when the coach suddenly pulled up before a tavern in a little village thereby of which i cannot recall the name we had passed several of these and as i have said i cared not two straws for them and so i was mildly exercised in my mind at this unexpected stoppage and coming to myself moved the mare slowly round t'other side of the coach to see what was forward if she is thirsty said i to myself she shall drink and if it came to that i was thirsty myself and i was ready to hold up the innkeeper with a pistol butt while we all drank a draught to our better acquaintance and miss's eyes maybe but as i came round i was suddenly aware of a small crowd of people some wearing uniforms armed with halberds and lanthorns and in the middle a short important gentleman with a paper in his hand i had no sooner made this discovery than her ladyship shrieked out very loud seize that man he is a highwayman at that all alert i pulled calypso round and put my heels into her flanks but there was a bank of people before me in that quarter and the chaise to one side and the tavern t'other and ere i could draw half a dozen hands were on the mare and two of a posse that was in the throng had their pistols on the level there was i taken netted like any duck in a decoy for certain and with no prospect even of a struggle for the numbers against me were great i saw that in the twinkling of an eye and so sat still making no effort to escape what is this said i loudly hands off sirrah do you dare arrest an innocent man who is in authority here and what's his foolish name said i at that the short man came forward and i saw that he wore a long gown edged with some sort of fleece who are you i asked assuming the most haughty arrogant air and under what pretence is a gentleman that is on the king's business arrested and delayed sir he said hesitating i am mayor of the town and 'tis at her ladyship's request i know nothing of her ladyship said i interrupting angrily if her ladyship blunders and you through her you must take the consequence mr mayor he seemed put about at that but my lady herself intervened or i would have managed things for myself pretty easily i charge that man with stealing from me jewels and money to the amount of five hundred guineas which you will find upon him said she for she was now out of the coach and standing in the road among them all yes your ladyship says the mayor anxiously it shall be attended to well someone shall smart for this said i ere many days are out and my witness pursued her ladyship calmly sits in the coach and is my late husband's niece oh a witness says mr mayor brightening up to say nothing of my two fellows she ended with that i saw it was all up for she was not one to lose her head and with that plain issue before the mayor he could not blunder very far so i said nothing more but sat in the clutches of the officers cudgelling my wits for a way out celia says she is this the man that attacked us upon the road and stole my jewels i i cannot discern very well 'tis dark stammered miss and rip me i blessed the chit for that reluctance though 'twas useless as it happened for says her ladyship nonsense baggage she says you can see quite plain you are a coward that's what it is here james and joshua what say you is this the villain whereupon the lackeys both swore with one voice that it was i and that i had attacked them brutally and says one that i had put a bullet near his leg whereas 'twas his own silly blunderbuss that he dropped that is sufficient my lady says the mayor looking very pompous and to that added what gave me the clue as to this unexpected trap 'twas nothing more or less than that little toad the fat steward who for all his gabble and talk had forgot to say that the mayor of maidstone was to come forth to meet her ladyship in state in token of gratitude for favours to the townsfolk 'twas along of that fountain as it seems and i cursed the little fat fool in my heart in that being so garrulous he had put a limit to his tongue but at the same time i could not but admire her ladyship's admirable skill and cunning sink me she was a wonder with her quickness so to contrive to drag me into the trap but these considerations availed me nothing and i will confess that i saw no road of escape though i am far from saying that i was beaten or that some notion would not ha' come to me later why i have broke out of newgate jug in the face of all yet this is what happened in the thick of this talk and confusion and even while the throng pressed upon me and my captors suddenly a voice cried out from the coach there is the other seize him there he goes on the right there this was miss's voice as i recognised though i was amazed and for the time did not pick up my wits but in a second all was uproar who d'ye mean what is it you baggage cried out her ladyship seize him there he goes cries miss again leaping from the coach in a state of excitement and to her ladyship why the other my lady the man that assisted creech was it not in an instant i saw how it was and what she intended and i believe her ladyship in her quickness saw it just after me for in the confusion the throng swayed and some ran this way and others that and there were my two jailers gaping into the darkness like moping owls 'twas but the work of a moment to wrench free an arm from one and deliver t'other a rap with a pistol on his skull and at the same time i wheeled calypso about and broke a third that stood there in the wind the three thus scattered with a whistle to the mare i dropped low in the saddle and breaking out of the circle thundered down the road at a gallop while all behind me arose cries and shouts and above all her ladyship's shrill voice screaming with fury i rode till i reached the first turning on the left and then went up a black lane for some distance after which i paused and listened sounds still came to me sailing on the night and i stood awhile chuckling to think how deeply her ladyship was cursing and how smartly i had evaded her and upon that comes the thought of miss why thinks i she's a heart o' gold is miss and that wild cat will be flying in her face with her claws and the devil being in me as i have said all through that business i turned about and came back into the road i jogged along comfortably until i was within a hundred yards of the inn and here was the same confusion that i had left what's this said i to a fellow that passed me oh says he 'tis a highwayman that has robbed a lady and is got off stab me says i what fools these traps be and i moved on until i came by the coach where i stood in the darkness i heard her ladyship's voice coming out of the inn and still angry and there was several in the roadway but the traps had vanished and i make no doubt were looking for me busily as i stood there thinking someone comes from t'other side of the chaise and i saw it was miss at the same time she saw me and started what do you here she asked tremulously why says i i am a looking anxiously for a tobyman that has wickedly robbed a lady go she cried you will be caught they will be back directly no said i i am not the man to leave other people with my burdens what do you mean said she after a pause there is her ladyship said i and there is yourself oh i am well used to deal with her ladyship she said a little bitterly you need be in no alarm well 'tis i shall deal with her ladyship this time said i you are mad she said go go i hear them coming no says i oh go she pleaded anxiously if you stay you will do me no good and yourself all harm i think you are bewitched to stay with that i looked at her and though i could not see her very clearly in the small light i vow she was mightily pretty i suppose 'twas the devil in me moved me or maybe 'twas only her beauty but at anyrate said i if i may have now what i denied myself upon the road there i will go said i she drew herself straight and i could see her under lip quiver sir she said i know you to be a highwayman at least let me think you a gentleman damme says i bluntly for i was taken aback at this damme no one shall say i am no gentleman for i am that afore everything else as i will prove on any buck's body and so with a big congee in my stirrups i turned and left her the lord chief justice there was many an adventure befell me in a pretty broad circuit of life that tickled my ribs to a proper tune and i have cackled over some escapades with a wider mouth than ever i sat out the most roaring comedy of the play houses not but what there were some high stepping pieces to my taste in the town well enough to clap eyes on no doubt but cockatrices mighty greedy of the gullet as you could spy at a glance and after all a wench is no food for humour but for another purpose altogether i pin no faith upon 'em at the best but of all the chances that i encountered what most rarely served my palate was this unexpected meeting in the west country which i will admit at the outset and ere i saw clearly the shape of my predicament set my heart a bobbing fast enough it fell in this way 'twas on a monday in the late summer of that year of grace that i rode up from the valleys of the north in the company of tony flack and we came to a pause upon the hind quarters of exeter town tony himself was for caution and would have us turn away to a little roadside tavern that we both knew for a safe resting place with a staunch innkeeper to boot but i was for exeter itself for to say the truth my stomach was sour with those rank swipes of the country side and 'twas some days since i champed my teeth about a town the facts argued with tony chicken hearted as he was and i will not deny it for there right before us lay the argument in the shape of a rumbling muddy parti coloured chaise that was creeping up the hill now it had so fallen out more by way of a jest than by any material design that we had scarified the occupant of this same carriage some ten miles back in the thick of a waste moorland that afternoon 'twas a mere idle freak taken out of wantonness and upon a merry dinner and by no means for the sake of the guinea or two that we found in his pockets tony gives the nag a slap of his sword and off she goes a spinning down the highway for dear life with the coachman all a sweat with terror and the melancholy visage of a gentleman in his red periwig hanging out of the window while there we stood the two of us laughing a broadside the nag had a piebald front to her and the chaise as i have said was in several colours and thus it happened that the lights falling suddenly on 'em in that tail of the day as we came out upon the back of exeter tony drew up and shoved his paw forward with a mighty blank face see there dick says he and what d'ye make of that 'twas plain enough what i made of it but i only laughed i make a chaise and the half says i and i'll warrant to make two by the time we reach exeter for to be sure swipes or no swipes we had each of us a good warm lining to the stomach tony cast me a surly glance rot you said he an' if the liquor spoil your wits i'll be damned if it shall mine nor i won't run my neck into the noose for you nor any like you you're a white livered sort of cur you are tony said i with another laugh and i suppose the traps will be waiting for us in a posse outside the white hart and i shouldn't wonder if the topsman himself was to snatch off his hat to us as we passed by sink me growled tony you forget 'twas broad daylight when we took 'em well says i i have a notion to sleep in exeter and i mind me of a very dainty belly under my belt with that we brought up in a disputation and being in a merry mood what with the wine and the sight of the windows twinkling in the town above me i gave him a pretty salvo of wit which sent him presently into a sullen temper as you will said he at last but i am no fool and none knows better than you dick ryder that i am no coward and i will be hanged for a common cutpurse if i go forth again upon any such mad business with a tipsy braggart braggart i cried starting aflame and twisting calypso round against his horse's rump but tony saw in a flash that he had gone too far and he turned very mild again i mean no offence said he we have been good comrades together dick ryder but i will warrant these daredevil humours will fetch us both up in newgate ere long and that's what i'm looking at says he i laughed you would prove a better tobyman tony said i if you would think less of your neck and then looking at him i roared but zounds i don't wonder at your fears for his neck was like a cygnet's only discoloured to a rusty iron but tony was still in a sour enough mood and though he jogged his horse to my summons he spoke no word as we went up the hill the chaise had vanished but for all that i could see his thoughts were twittering about it and in this way we rode up into the town sprinkled with growing lights and 'twas not until we came abreast of the white hart that tony opened his mouth if i was you and was of your kidney says he with a sneer i should think shame to dine upon a sanded floor and drink out of ale jugs nothing short of the white hart would suit me no not if i was to swing for it if i was you dick ryder damme says i suddenly and reining in that same thought was in my own noddle and sure the white hart it shall be with that i turned the mare's nose and was pointing for the door when tony stopped me what the devil would you do he cried in his alarm you will fetch the noose over us faith said i but you may go to the devil for me i am weary of your clacking and i have a mind to dine in good company he fell back with a curse and calypso moved on but turning back i saw him staring with a sulky sneer upon his face and i could perceive from his attitude that he took my words for an empty piece of boasting then there was that term braggart stuck in my gullet and in a second and upon the impulse i pulled the mare's nose against the doorway and bawled for the ostler tony was still visible standing agape in the centre of the road but i paid him no heed merely handing the bridle to the ostler and then leaping from the saddle i walked through the doorway as bold as you please now within the doorway there was a space of hall very bare and plain and upon two sides there opened doors into the further parts of the house but the third was filled with a screen of windows separating a little privy corner in which sat the innkeeper very greasy and affable of look i threw down a guinea and he fetched out a pint of wine the which drunken i turned on my heel and clattered up to a great door set with brass knobs but the little fat landlord was on my heels in a moment you cannot enter there says he in a great taking 'tis a private room and not for strangers but with the wine newly bubbling in my head i made little of him the devil said i i will have what i pay for and i will enter where i list but indeed he gasped 'tis a place privily set apart and for an occasion 'tis good news i answered with a cackle for that is what my heart is set upon he clasped my arm sir sir he cried indeed this will be most vexatious to his lordship and will lose me his custom i started round on him sharply if i want a door with brass knobs says i angrily i will have you know that i will have a door with brass knobs ye little louse ye and throwing off his hand i opened the door now 'tis certain enough that had i conserved my wits more properly and that dismal juice was not so fluent in my blood i would never have risked this piece of devilry not but what dick ryder wears a better face on him in the nick of peril than most but this as you will see was scarce the occasion for a wanton adventure and i will confess that tony's counsels were wiser than my own but i was heated with the drink and the long ride and i would bear no gainsaying and so back i flung the door the same instant a cackle of laughter saluted my ears and a stream of light flashed in my eyes what i made out was a long table very elegantly prepared and a dozen or more of gentle folk seated at the board and plying their knives like good trenchermen there was a fire roaring on the hearth and altogether the scene was very merry and presented a comfortable face and what with that appearance of warmth and the smell of the viands tickling my nostrils i hesitated no longer upon the threshold where i stood but pulling to the door i strode across the room and shot my eyes about the table just then there came another flood of laughter and in the noise of it i stood surveying the company by this time in something of a confusion and wondering in my fuddled wits what the devil i was at when suddenly there gets up a gentleman from his seat near by and very civilly offers me a chair oh well thinks i as i am gone so far i may as well flesh my nose in the victuals and with a word of grace in answer to his courtesy down i propped upon my prats and fell upon the viands with a will the room was buzzing with sound and the warmth and the fare pleased me very well but where the devil i was gotten and who the devil these cullies might be and why in god's name i was thus politely admitted to the board these were the enigmas that floated about in my head not that i was in any embarrassment for it was enough for me if i was to be entertained thus royally waited upon with the best and conjoined with a high company such as was scattered about me and all without so much as a single trespass upon the pocket but by and by my civil neighbour turns to me you are late he says i suppose you were held at the court or do you ride from town well says i very careful for i am not the man to trip myself over a word in a manner you may say yes i says and i took a draught of the tanker afore me ah he said and seemed to puzzle his wits over the rejoinder but i conceive he was in no very active condition of mind and it is like enough that what i said seemed from some corners of aspect to contain a sensible answer so he followed after my example and sipped his wine meditatively his lordship says he soon again is in high feather this evening you may say that said i delivering a glance towards the head of the table where sat a long faced handsome looking fellow whom to say sooth i had not as yet minded in the satisfaction of my appetite he is filling a paunch i warrant i said with a laugh hush whispered he with a scared look on his face and glancing about him you will be overheard overheard i said am i a wench that must walk mim mouthed through her wine and not deal in the king's plain english i permit no man to dictate me upon my language not i the fellow stared at me for a time and then you have a bold tongue said he with what i could perceive was a hint of the ironic i have no doubt you ply it well what is your court says he ay there was the rub what was my court and what the devil was i when you came to the kernel i had made out nothing as yet being taken up with the food and the attentions of this gaping oaf but i was not to be confounded by him not if i knew my own temper and court or no court i made answer bluff as you please the same as yours says i oh says he breaking into a smile i wear my professions very discernible then yes you do said i bluntly i am glad i have met you he went on pleasantly and i shall make it my duty to pursue our acquaintance it is odd indeed and what think you sir of the fassett business he spoke with the air of hanging on my words and i was convinced that whatever this d d matter was 'twas something of which i must needs be cognizant so in i plunged ah you may well ask says i nodding my head gad and i see you are agreed with me the circumstances stand so plain that there is no denial by god you are right i'll warrant that and i myself am game to prove it with the point says i slapping my sword the gentleman drew away looking at me with some amazement and presently his face took on an expression of confusion and says he quite so says he oh yes i am of your party and in truth i believe the fool took what i said for a reply to his interrogation but by this i was now sobered enough to discover the responsibilities among which i was thrown and that i must keep a strong observation open if i was not to run my head into danger and the first i must enlighten myself upon this company in which i found myself for which purpose leaning forward i set my eyes upon the man at the end of the table and examined him diligently he was i judged somewhere about thirty five of a fine oval face very justly proportioned a sallow brown in habit and crowned above his rich brown eyes with a great brown wig which sat awry upon his head and added an effeminate look to the profligate softness of his lower face his features were very finely marked his nose long and straight and delicately fleshed as were his curved and smiling lips and his eyes which were large within the sockets gleamed like agates between the narrow curtains of his eyelids and sprang very quickly into one simulation or another altogether his was a remarkable face to look on and attracted strongly for all the saturnine changes of his colour he was laughing flushed to the sombre eyes i had finished my scrutiny and i took off my gaze from him and was for letting it fall back on my neighbour to interrogate him upon the identity of this fine cock when in its passage along the opposite side of the table i discovered not very far from his lordship himself no other than the prim faced gentleman of the parti coloured chaise that tony and i had ransacked that same afternoon upon the moors the discovery struck me with dismay as you will imagine but there was worse to tread upon its heels for the man was bowing with a delicate and sickly smile to one that toasted him from t'other side and in putting down his glass and with the grin still upon his lips his eyes lighted upon mine and we exchanged glances the cully turned a trifle pale and winced moving in his seat then he frowned and seemed mightily taken up with his plate after which he lifted his head again and directed a look on me i met him very bold and square and his eyes gave way before me surrendering so to say to my discharge for i warrant i gave him a heavy broadside but all the time i kept seeking in my brain for some way out of this damnable predicament presently he catches up a piece of paper and ripping out a quill makes some writing and calling to a lackey hands him the document what's he up to now thinks i but i was soon to learn for the footboy walked up to the head of the table and with a bow offered the paper to his lordship whoever the devil he might be well says i to myself i am committed to it now and it's my bearing against his and the best credentials and with that feeling that the matter was passed out of my hands i turned on my neighbour and says i to him but still keeping an eye on the pale faced booby who may his lordship be i says now 'twas folly in me to have put the query so direct and indeed i would not have ventured on the simplicity had not my wits been disturbed by the incident i have related but in point of fact it mattered very little to the issue of the misadventure though my friend started very suddenly and gazed at me in a gaping fashion you are jesting he says his lordship well says i a trifle grimly for i saw the same lordship casting his eyes upon the paper and maybe you can put a name on him if i can't but but he stammered and then who may you be he asked with some suspicion and in another manner damn you said i i've put you a question and a gentleman should need no reminder of his necessary civilities for by this i saw his lordship's soft and shining eyes directed on us what's the cully's name i asked he looked up following my glance and we both stared at the man who was staring at us 'tis my lord jeffreys he says in a bare whisper you will believe me and i make no shame to admit it that my legs took a tremor at the words but i can keep a face upon me with any and so i stared at that sinister and smiling butcher and he stared at me for the space of some seconds and then i took a draught of wine thank'ee says i calmly to my neighbour 'tis well i have some business with his lordship i spoke very calmly as i say but you will believe me my heart was sunk into my boots on this news there was no man at that time but held the name of bloody jeffreys in a horror he lumped so large in the popular fear that he was taken for an emblem and ensign of satan himself so diabolic and so ensanguined was his practice i have seen many formidable persons in my time and exchanged passadoes with several of them but there it was the fact and figure of that murdering black hearted handsome rake almost of an age with myself seated there in his chair crept over me like the pest and discharged my wits abroad like a spray of sand scattered afore the wind i cast my eye again on him for indeed i could not keep it away and a faint sardonic grin touched his face as he met my glance he summoned to him a lackey and spoke in his ear with an imperious gesture whereat the fellow seeming very much frightened hurried out of the room and i doubted not that he was gone for the officers his lordship then turns to the gentleman near him and still with his stealthy and terrible smile whispers under his breath the whole company meanwhile which had all along hung upon his looks and conversation like a pack of craven dogs on their master was fallen into sudden silence but this communication was spread from mouth to mouth like a running fire and in a moment the whole room was agape and directing on me surprised and startled glances but this pulled me together and 'twas high time too well thinks i an' i must lay my back against a wall i must but they shall learn that dick ryder is not to be browbeat by a lot of scurvy lawyers for so i supposed 'em whatever fate be in store for him and so turning to my next door neighbour i began very loudly and as if resuming a conversation with him nay nay but i am at odds with you sir faith i disagree with you entirely upon my soul i have never seen his lordship in a better condition and better plumed for service a worm in his head say you godsakes i'll never believe it his wits wear to a knife edge with practice now this was spoke as i have said in a clamant voice which resounding on the unnatural silence that had fallen on the room reaches me the ears of all this company as i had desired and more particularly those of his lordship for whom i had designed the speech jeffreys turned of a sudden a darker red under his brown and his woman's eyes shot anger and who is this that dares pass questions on his lordship he cries in a sharp clear tone come i should like to look on him attentively he says that i might know him again he must be a fellow worth acquaintance if for his future only i promise you that shall be secured to him and that he shall know very soon but at this ugly exhibition of temper and more especially at the malicious menace it conveyed my poor neighbour fell into a fluster and ran white and red in turns opening his mouth and trembling and stuttering and gasping like a dying fish my lord i i said nothing 'tis false he stammered the poor wretch was in so pitiable a way that i found it in my heart to be sorry for him and after all he had served me very kindly at the start so i spoke up rising in my seat and bowing my lord i said the gentleman says well though 'twas to him that my remarks in praise of yourself were addressed i was mistook 'twas not on you that his comment was directed that is a very likely tale said his lordship with a frown and then appearing to recover himself as he was used to do quite rapidly he stared at me with another expression i am in your debt sir he said for your defence of me you do well i warrant jeffreys has still his wits about him he has an eye for a rogue sir you will do him the justice to acknowledge that i hope on our better acquaintance and he laughed somewhat harshly and eyed the board as if inviting a round of acclamation the miserable time servers cackled their loudest and his lordship turning again to me i should know your face says he and offers a kind of wink to the company 'tis no wonder my lord i answered pat as you will 'tis almost as well known as your lordship's and almost as favourably received at that a young fellow across the table from me broke into a stutter of laughter but all the rest were silent jeffreys looked at him savagely i will remember you charteris he said simply and i saw the light flaming in the eyes he directed on me that's well he said and i make no doubt that you are like myself a dispenser of justice you hold the scales indeed my lord said i for i was not in a mood to be thus baited whilst waiting on the officers there is more resemblance between you and me perchance than your lordship will acknowledge ha he cried with his cold and bitter laugh i knew not that i was unawares entertaining a rival a learned man in the law is this gentleman no doubt well sir i will be greedy of your advice while i may look you there was a man tried afore me this day that had rumpadded a civil and innocent gentleman upon the king's highway and faith the rascal was rash enough to venture into the company of his victim to dinner what d'ye say to that what sort of sentence would ye deliver on the wretch how was he took said i well says his lordship after a pause and smiling towards the door i fancy the sheriff's officers were summoned upon him nay said i then had i been justice since he was took i would ha' hanged him for 'twas a poor wit that served him no surer than to be so took fie says jeffreys what interpreter of the law is here 'twould not be the first time that the law was twisted by its dispenser my lord said i boldly his lordship's smile stole farther up his face and opened his lips so that the white teeth shone and he smiled in an ugly fashion to the fellow next him you hear that my lord says he in his sneering way faith they will presently be saying that we did not deal justice to dame alice lisle the man that he addressed winced and smiled uneasily for 'twas well known that the popular feeling ran high upon the scandalous trial which was but newly concluded though i wondered to hear the prime engine of that infamous conviction jest so wantonly upon it but that was jeffreys's way to offer a bold face and play the bully when he was in power but when he was down there was no coward to whine like him as events proved subsequently but jeffreys turns to me again content enough with his sally sirrah he said you have a signal charter for your tongue i can perceive it is a righteous conscience keeps you in countenance you are bold upon your virtues i have met your kidney before and if i must hang a knave i prefer to hang one with an insolent front to him that snivels i would disembowel t'other in the pillory there is too much softness in this modern justice my lord says i you speak my feelings like a book faith i would griddle the canting rogue with these two hands his lordship smiled very diabolic and then finished his wine with the air of one that has tired of the play at the same time nodding to the lackey that stood near by him exceedingly respectful but he went out of the room gad says the young man that was called charteris in a whisper to his neighbour 'tis a pity to go farther faith i think he hath earned his pardon for the steady face he keeps but you must suppose that all this time i was not idle in my mind but kept casting my wits about the predicament with a mighty sharp eye upon any chances that emerged well the case was turning very black by now seeing i knew well enough for what the signal of his lordship was intended and i had as yet gotten no very clear notion in my head yet at the next opening of the door and when the first noise of heavy feet sounded on the threshold my thoughts spouted forth in a clear stream and there sat i as taut and cool as you please for all the world as though 'twas a private party to which jeffreys had invited me for a guest his lordship rose as the officers entered and was turning away indifferently without ever a sign or a word when he suddenly stopped again 'twould be strange to learn sirrah said he addressing me out of a natural curiosity what robbed thee of thy senses to fetch thee here 'tis an odd new policy for the hare to lie down with the fox with that i got to my feet my lord said i very boldly and in a public voice i have come here uninvited 'tis true and i proffer you my apologies for the trespass but i have come upon a pressing private business with your lordship his lordship stared at me with a sour look in his eye indeed says he harshly i am not used to have any business but the one with your kidney and that not private he says my lord said i 'tis the most urgent message and needeth instant delivery i saw in his eye that he still meditated to refuse me but i set my gaze upon him very intently and what he thought he saw there made him waver well said he in his tyrannical fashion i hope we shall hear good of this message for i swear if i do not i will have thee hanged the higher and he motioned to me to draw nearer at the same time that the other gentlemen of the king's counsel withdrew to the bottom of the room conversing together but the officers approached and stood a little way off by jeffreys's signal but keeping out of earshot who are you fellow and what pretences are these you make asked his lordship roughly as soon as we were alone but examining me with curiosity my lord said i i make no pretences as i shall assure you and as for myself believe me that i play a truer part than does appear i looked at him meaningly let us come to plain speech said he sharply i cannot dawdle with your riddles i ask no better my lord i cried i bear a message from the prince he started and stared at me under his brows in suspicion what prince he asked brusquely there is but one said i boldly and one that shall rest so no longer by god's grace and the trusty arms of england you mean the prince of orange he asked in a lower voice i nodded for a while he looked me in the eyes and then turning to the sheriff's officers ordered them to withdraw a little after which he came back to me surveying me with his cold and savage eyes but with something of anxiety you are a bold man he said to bring me this message i would do that and more than that for the good cause said i jeffreys was silent and then come what is this message then he inquired with a sardonic glance for the life of me i could not have determined if he were taken with the bait but i swore to hook him as indeed it was the only course left to me your lordship has not heard the news from the coast says i looking round very cautiously proceed he commanded watching me with his beautiful and horrid eyes events have been stirring in the low country said i as your lordship will be aware the whole of the north is disaffected against his majesty it needs but to land i said and your lordship knows what might happen i think sir we were to come to quarters said jeffreys in a low voice but still in his imperious way well if he would take it he was to have it then and there the prince says i whispering is already landed he started before my eyes but recovering himself i have had runners from plymouth this afternoon he said and there was no news of import nay said i 'tis not from plymouth i come my lord if i were to ask you whence he began after a pause you would remember my lord ere you did so that i have not yet delivered my message and thus have had no reply i said you remind me of my duty he exclaimed sternly deliver this message for i can tarry no longer my lord said i i would have come to it sooner were it not for your distrust i am charged by the prince himself no less i have ridden all day upon a circuit three noblemen were named and your lordship also the prince lies on english soil to night and would confer with these four faithful subjects jeffreys stood awhile in thought his delicate face changing with a dozen emotions then he spoke very harshly this is very well sirrah you make an excellent liar he said you would come here and offer me a cock and bull tale thinking me a lack wit to see you so impudently stand in your lie my lord said i as warm as may be see in what my position stands i am come here penetrating to your very fireside i stake my head upon the risk 'tis in your office to sound a word and these fellows will take me forth upon a capital charge of treason i have cast my die for the good cause yet my death which would be an evil to me in that case would profit you nothing my lord nay less than nothing in the coming trouble again he paused the chief justice of this realm does not parley with treason said he but i had a glimpse of the man now i saw what fear ran in his blood he would not have kept me haggling there if he had it not in his heart to coquet with fortune my lord i said and who would credit that a poor highwayman talked of state politics with the lord chief justice why a gallows and the topsman would serve his turn he heaved a little sigh fidgeting with his fingers who the devil are you he asked you are taken for a padsman my lord said i 'tis strange company a man may keep for a purpose i will not deny that i know your suspicions and whence they spring indeed it was the gentleman's natural conclusion i was pressed to carry my mission sure i have been worse accompanied than by a tobyman but as for my name your lordship has given me no answer call me ryder i am for the prince he heard me out and 'twas the little touch of braggadocio i think that converted him as much as anything what do you propose he asked in another tone i would ride back to night i said unless your lordship decide that i must lodge in jail as to that he exclaimed mr ryder i fear that we must lodge you there in the meantime what hour would you start the sooner the better said i but nine will serve he regarded me with an urgent face of inquiry this may be a trap he said suspiciously your lordship may guard against that said i suavely as large an escort of horse as you will and none to know our destination save us two nay none save yourself mr ryder it appears he said grimly but you say well i will be with you at nine thereupon he motioned me away with a gesture of impatience and calling on the sheriff pointed at me the next moment i was surrounded and in their arms but i played my part like a play actor crying upon his lordship to hear me and making a piteous struggle with the officers a little later and you might see me settled in the compter hugging myself the one minute and the next perplexed upon a further step for by what i saw of jeffreys i reckoned upon my punctual deliverance the fact is that he was afeared of what would issue from this promised trouble of the dutchman and 'twas reported that such was the state of most of those about the court who were in the mind to play two parts and neither with any stomach yet as the time drew on and i had ample leisure to digest the various aspects of the adventure i confess i was assailed by a fear lest jeffreys should have been disporting himself with me or should have cocked the white feather and that i was still to rest and rot in that pestiferous dungeon so that when at last the door swung wide and one of the turnkeys appeared i was like to have cried out in my glee 'twas the signal sure enough for i was taken forthright out of my cell and commanded into the presence of the governor i do not know by what trickery the affair was managed but if there was ever any dark intrigue to the point you might trust bloody jeffreys for that all i know is that 'twas but a few minutes ere i was out of the gates of the compter under the pale face of the moon and with my heels in the flanks of calypso gently ambling in a silent company towards the plymouth road his lordship had taken me at my word and there were six or more in the band that surrounded me but we rode in a deep quiet and for a long while i offered no address to the horseman by me whom i supposed to be the chief justice himself but presently and when our faces were well set upon the plymouth highway and there was less chance that the cavalcade would invite curiosity owing to the sparseness of the wayfarers he turned to me and spoke up for himself it was jeffreys sure enough and he wore a mighty look of worry as i could perceive at the first glance you have not informed me mr ryder says he to what destination we are bound now this was pretty much to the point for bloody jeffreys was not the man to waste useless words but lord love you i had as much notion of whither we were set for as he had himself 'twas for a chance i was playing and now that i had my two legs across calypso once more it would go badly with the whole half dozen of 'em if i did not show a clean pair of heels somewhere and sometime but of course i had thought upon the question in my prison and says i you will understand your lordship that it's not in my authority to commit anything to words i am bound by the prince's orders that is very well he retorted in his arrogant way but it appears that i must commit myself and no one else 'tis a one sided bargain i am not used to make my lord said i very earnestly i will not deny but there is reason in your argument and for myself i would at once admit you to my plans but i am the custodian of the prince's secret 'tis none of my own i guard well well he cried with impatience i suppose that i am to arrive somewhere and where that somewhere is your lordship shall learn said i with the permission and from the lips of his gracious majesty king william he started at the words and eyed me askance for a space a dubious expression of irresolution crossing his features you are a bold man mr ryder he exclaimed with something of a sneer i may remind you that there surround you five stalwart men at arms that own allegiance to his majesty james ii and you would have added my lord said i that james stuart's trusted servant is conversing with me i am sensible of the peril in which i stand but i am no facing both ways i hold by my conscience i' faith sir he rapped out harsh and sudden i have laid you by the heels within the precincts of the compter once and there i will lay you again if you brandish your impudence before me in the which case my lord quoth i coldly you will be nothing bettered and king william would have a loyal servant to avenge he said nothing angrily considering me come come my lord i said we are in a kind of silly balance one against t'other and to put no veil upon the situation we scarce dare trust each other i walk in a great public peril sure with your hands upon me but consider upon what risks you yourself also move i am familiar to the prince my errand is known about his court turn about your horse fetch me in chains to justice and how will you appear 'tis a summary way with a royal herald i ask you with what eyes the king will view this act and with what penalties he will reward it jeffreys said nothing for a time and then speaking slowly you have he said in a quieter voice a strong persuasion of the prince's triumph my lord said i you yourself shall be the judge what cries are these that issue from the town these many months with what voices was the duke of monmouth welcomed but yesterday nay the people of this very country side newly trodden and trampled by king james's dragoons scarred and lacerated by your own ensanguined hands my lord with what a face do they regard james stuart and what a welcome think you they would give ye for yourself his lordship whitened under the moonlight and his face betrayed an emotion of terror 'twas plain that he had entertained these same thoughts and that my design had given him several unhappy hours but he made me no answer and rode on digesting these considerations with what stomach he might now all this time we were getting farther into the rude country parts of the shire and more than once i had turned the party upon a by way so that by this we were come out by the devil knows where moreover it was become very late and a shrewd wind from the south came snapping about our faces and thus it grew upon me that i must bring this topsy turvy adventure to some close with what wit i might the more particularly as by his lordship's contrivance i make no doubt i rode in the midst of a circle and was evidently to consider myself a fast prisoner in the meantime now i had bred in my mind a very tolerable design by which i might have given 'em the slip but by this time i was too nearly watched for that and the bare appearance of the little inn of wolcombe which i was contemplating would have served to start suspicions if not certainty in jeffreys's noddle so thinks i to myself that 'tis ever a bold course that runs the least risk as indeed i have always attributed my own security to my never shirking a hazard in the passage of fortune upon which suggestion comes another that the present would serve as well as another opportunity and better too seeing that his lordship's eyes were beginning to lower on me at this undue delay wherefore what do i at this juncture and when jogging along the way in the full face of old oliver but rein the nag to one side and reaching down open a huge gate that stood a little aback from the road what is this asked jeffreys in surprise this is the place my lord said i in a whisper if you will march with me a little in the fore of these men i will instruct you further as we ride up there was a moment's pause on his part but then i suppose he considered the probabilities and he saw that the road was clearly an approach to some great house at anyrate he issued an order to his escort and the party wheeled up after me through the gateway and up the avenue i take it sir he said at once that the prince lies here that is so my lord said i though to say sooth i was all the time wondering what the devil might lie at the end of this long passage and what should be my next turn in the game but jeffreys seemed quite satisfied and he even displayed a ruffle of eagerness at this juncture and so once more in deep silence we rode on and came out soon upon a great terrace of gravel surrounded by an amphitheatre of trees with the long house lying black and high upon one side the whole troop came to a halt here and his lordship turned to me as who should ask what must be done now it was manifest on the instant that my only course lay in some prompt act seeing that there was no opportunity to show my heels and so beckoning him with a quiet motion i jogged on towards the house calypso's heels making a devilish noise trampling on the stones somewhere within the house shone a faint light though 'twas long past midnight and it seemed therefore that someone was astir within his lordship's eyes met mine anxiously and he moistened his lips he was greatly agitated for certain and the sight strung my nerves off i leaped and rapped loudly upon the knocker before the big door now i swear to you that when i laid my fingers to the knocker i had never a thought in my head as to the course i should pursue but on that instant and while the echoes rang still in my ears i took a quick notion leaning forward to jeffreys i said whispering my lord i will prepare your way keep ye here and you shall be fetched presently he stared at me suspiciously and in some bewilderment but ere he could say anything the door swung gently back with a spring i was across the threshold and click goes the lock behind me in the very face of the astonished janitor but he fell a trembling who are you he said while the light he carried shook in his hands hush says i warningly make no noise your lives hang on it there is a pack of dirty cut throats on my heels i says oh lord he groaned and retired hurriedly from the door i followed him but he drew back very suspicious my good man said i judging him by his looks to be the butler pray use me with no suspicion i am come to warn you see i bear no arms but am a private and peaceful citizen like yourself how come you here he asked being somewhat reassured i became privy to their designs by accident at the wolcombe inn the scurvy rogues said i very pat and indignant and i have rode on to warn your master in the nick of time where may he be his lordship is abed sir he says oh well said i hale him forth nay but i dare not says he oh very well said i then you shall have your throats cut every man his jaw fell then i have a blunderbuss says he brightening of a sudden blunderbuss says i with a sneer why 'tis a veritable band of roaring satans that lives on blunderbusses oh lord deliver us he cried and wrung his hands what shall we do now in point of fact as you may see 'twas in my power without more ado to play on my poor butler's fears and so skipping out of a back door to leave jeffreys and his crew to cool their heels on the terrace but i was by this time infused with a certain zest of the adventure i entertained it with a gusto and so drawing him gravely to a window near by that looked upon the front see you said i pointing out the escort where they lay in waiting there's a monstrous set of rascals for ye all a hungering for blood they are all a spitting on their hands to flirt their hangers with which to slit the throats of poor civil citizens like me and you lord save us he said with his teeth going and just at that moment a thin voice sounded from somewhere above and a tall lean old gentleman wrapped in a night rail and looking choleric of face peered over the stairway at us what the devil are you at jenkins he says peevishly oh my lord cried jenkins if that was the fool's name 'tis a gentleman that has come to warn us and there is a pack of highwaymen without and our throats shall all be cut heaven help us silence sirrah i will have none of this noise cries the old gentleman in a peppery voice you have disturbed my rest he says angrily but my lord cried poor jenkins the highwaymen well well says he shrilly send 'em away you must get rid of 'em and he looked testily at the butler but by this time with the noise of our talking the whole house was awake and there came the sound of doors opening and forth from dark passages broke lights and faces peeped over balustrades my lord said i for 'twas time for me to think of old jeffreys outside 'tis true there's highwaymen without but i can think of a way to trap 'em 'tis well someone has his wits says he pettishly well what would you do i would let the captain in said i when he knocks on the door and shutting him off from his fellows fall upon him and take him what then said he why says i you may then make your terms with the gang having him for a hostage why did you not think of that jenkins said the old gentleman querulously jenkins you shall capture the captain as this gentleman advises but jenkins's face fell and he fidgeted with his fingers 'twas plain the mission was not to his taste there was no time to spend upon such tremors for indeed i knew that jeffreys would be getting suspicious in his mind and i was now resolute to put a score upon him for his ugly behaviour so said i there is no need my lord to entrust the matter to jenkins here seeing that all may bear a hand i make no doubt that there be weapons of a kind and if mr jenkins maybe will jump on the villain's back when he is down faith that will i said jenkins stoutly and armed himself forthwith with a warming pan that hung upon the walls and that act setting the note the company broke away in a commotion each securing some form of a missile wherewith to assail the miscreant and with that as if the affair was already at an end the old gentleman pulls his wrapper close around him and returns very coolly to his bed but i had no time for these observations for now was come the occasion upon which my scheme depended and there he knocks said i suddenly but they were all so cluttered with their fears and their excitement that not one of them but believed i spoke the truth lord how savage he knocks says a wench with a shiver and lays hold of a lackey's arm i went down to the door and upon the first lifting of the latch they popped away like rabbits in a warren there sure enough was his lordship in a mighty trepidation and with an ugly scowl come in says i in a whisper the prince was abed but will see you at once my lord he came over the threshold and clap i shut the door behind him and when that was done i breathed more freely for i knew that i was secure in my game the chief justice looking very fine and stately advanced down the solitary hall emerging under the dim light and then all of a sudden a hassock came rustling through the air and took him in the belly over he went with a little gasp and measured his length upon the floor upon that leaps out my friend jenkins with his warming pan and bestriding his lordship's back sets to belabouring for dear life immediately after and encouraged by this others of the lackeys sprang forth and fell to maltreating the poor cully where he lay take that you lousy knave you says one fat wench and turns over him a kitchen utensil of some kind let me scratch his eyes cries another and lord love you what with their exclamations and the screaming to say nothing of the noise of jenkins's warming pan and his lordship's angry oaths you would have thought that bedlam was broke loose but in the midst of it all i caught suddenly a sound of horses' hoofs upon the gravel and on the top of that came a hammering at the door i am no fool to outstay my welcome and so thinks i that the time is come and seizing a light that stood near by i made straight through the midst of that uproar and plunged into the nether darkness of the house here by picking my way through divers passages i presently came forth by a side door and passed out into the night a shrill whistle in the old way fetched calypso to me whinnying and as i put my hand upon her bridle i turned back and listened there was that pandemonium still within the hall reaching me faintly through the open doorway and the escort was still hammering on the hall door then i leaped into the saddle and turned the mare's nose down a side track in the park and the last i heard as i rode off chuckling to myself was the noise of the escort pounding on the door the attack on the chaise i have had ever an eye for a doxy and in the course of my life have happened upon a variety of the sex such as falls to few men some have been fine ladies brave with their lace and powder and others again have descended upon a scale to the common kixsywinsy but in the end i would wager polly scarlet against any of the pack yet i will confess that there were some that have mightily tickled me and one or two that went near to turn my head for their looks alone to speak nothing of their state and grace not but what i have long learned the measure of beauty and how far it may go a man is a fool to surrender to that on the summons yet i will not deny how greatly it disturbs the midriff and coming home so sharp does thus affect the bearing of us all madam or miss there was no handsomer lady in town on that summer night when i encountered her than sir philip caswell's ward and 'twas that i'll be bound influenced me in my behaviour subsequently nevertheless i vow i did not care two straws for the pretty puss in my heart 'twas after a long evening at a gaming house in marylebone that i was returning on my two legs through the fields for soho i was in a pleasant temper having filled my pockets with king's pictures and i had drunk nothing save a bottle or so of good burgundy since dinner the hour indeed was past midnight and i was casting up the chances to find supper at the pack horse or the golden eagle or some other house known to me well says i as i came out in the hedgerows 'tis nearly one and rip me if i do not sup and lie abed by two and live virtuous for i was pleased with what i was carrying and loth to lose it a bird was calling in a flutter from the hedge and just upon that another sound came to my ears and on the still air arose the clamour of swords in engagement this was nothing to me for i am not used to intermeddle in such affairs as nocturnal brawls unless indeed i am gone in liquor as sometimes happens or am led off by troublesome company but to the sounds of the fight succeeded the voice of a woman crying but not very loudly for help this as you may believe was upon another footing for there was never a petticoat that appealed to dick ryder in her trouble in vain as my records will prove on any road in england so off i set at a run in the direction of the sounds which seemed to stream out of the entrance to windmill street the houses here were black and silent it being so late and there was no sign of any interest on the part of the inhabitants of the quarter but the moon which had been under a scurry of clouds struck out of her shelter and showed me plain the scene of the struggle there in the roadway stood the body of a chaise with two trampling horses while about it was a melley of figures two of which were engaged hammer and tongs upon each other i was not long ere i had seized the situation and interpreted it properly and whipping out my blade i made no ado about falling on the assailants of the chaise 'twas easy to make out who these were inasmuch as one of the men wore a mask across his eyes i ran upon him and those behind him while i was aware of the woman's cry that still issued out of the chaise but now suddenly stopped at that i lunged but on that same instant the scum about him came at me from the side so that i was forced to keep my eyes and weapon in two places the man in the mask had not ceased to ply his point on the gentleman whom i took to be the owner of the chaise and this seemed a sturdy obstinate fellow enough for he puffed and grunted hard at my ear but fought like any dragon one of those that came at me i winged in the arm and swiftly dodging behind my ally i came upon the masked man and ran him through the shoulder without advertisement he dropped his arm with an oath and as he did so the mask fell from his face which showed clear and lean in the moonlight but that was no sooner done than the big man by me lurched and staggered so that it was plain he had taken something in his vitals well here was i now all alone with that evil pack about me pressing on me like birds of prey for although i had pinked one and his master there was two more able bodied culleys left to say nothing of the master himself whose wound to judge from his language was more painful than serious i am quick at a resolve and know when to withdraw from in front of odds there was a man fallen wounded and maybe dead and no signs of the watch while from the chaise peered as i caught a glimpse a white and terrified face in the moonlight the coachman it was clear had taken to his heels already and the horses stood champing and trembling and swaying in their alarm at the noises what does i then as there was a little lull in the fray and the others temporarily drew off but stoop and lift the big man from the ground and bundle him rapidly into the chaise bang goes the door and leaping to the coachman's seat i lashed the horses with the flat of my blade they started in a panic and the chaise went plunging and rocking down the narrow way this fetched me into king street and in fear of pursuit i stood up and banged at the nags so that i had them bumping at a gallop round into the oxford road and on the way for tyburn when we had run some distance i brought 'em to with an effort and hearing no noise of the enemy descended and opened the door of the chaise the moon shone sufficiently for me to make out the humped body of the man i had thrust in so roughly and opposite white shrinking and in an evident state of terror and agitation a mighty handsome and engaging miss that stared at me helplessly is is he dead she asked hoarsely faith miss says i i cannot say yet i hope not he's not for worms i'll warrant best get him home and have a surgeon fetched and if you will acquaint me with the house i will make so bold as to take you myself she waited a moment and then spoke giving a street in st james's at which i made her a congee and got upon the box again i am better astride a nag than with a whip in my hand and moreover the night was now pretty dark yet 'twas not long ere we had reached the house and the bell being rung and the servants called the fat gentleman was got in safely enough upon that someone flies for the surgeon and there was i all alone with the lady and not loth to clap my peepers on her more nearly she moved with a style but had a fearful air yet it was her face that took me most she was young and slender and nothing too tall large eyed and round of limb and with a mouth that budded in repose and opened like a flower in speech but she was very still and white just then i am sir philip caswell's ward sir she says very tremulously and we are much beholden to you i am honoured madam said i with a congee again to have been of some small service to you the scoundrels fell upon us by windmill street upon our way home she continued with a pretty shudder sir philip stepped out to face them i begged he would not but he is very obstinate faith miss what could he do less said i we might have whipped up and so escaped them says she with an air of some petulance now but that our cowardly man took to his heels and left us helpless as she spoke she eyed me with more coldness i thought than the occasion warranted for all she was so shook and though she had made me her compliments quite prettily she had spoke as if she were thinking of something else which as you will conceive nettled me not a little it was as if she wished me away for she fell silent and cast glances at the chamber clock that hung at the wall but seeing i had been at the pains for her and the old fat man why says i to myself rip me if i will go like any discharged lackey i will tire her out says i and let beauty yawn or pay in gratitude so i sat on in the saloon making conversation as it seemed fit to me to serve one of her class and age no doubt she was tired for the hour was about two in the morning yet her pretty yawns which she feigned to cover with her hands vexed me but indeed i might have gone forth and left her there and then for very shame as would have been natural had it not been that an excuse came to aid me in a message from sir philip who had recovered under the attentions of the surgeon he had learned it seemed that his rescuer was in the house and begged that he might be allowed to thank him in person presently this set me in feather but miss in the sulks as i thought which maddened me the more that the hussy should prove so ungrateful particularly at a time when she should be showing concern at her adventure or at least grief for her guardian yet as i watched her perish me but she charmed me with her petulant prettiness the more such a dainty head and a mouth so pert and alluring i had never yet clapped eyes on which i say for all that followed there then were we set awaiting sir philip in the big chamber she yawning without disguise and me racking my wits to attract her i'll warrant she must have taken an idea of me as a buck of town although she feigned coldness then i spoke of the play and the court of both of which i knew secrets and i talked on a level proper to the sex d'ye not love the play miss says i lard it is pretty well says she and covered up a yawn with ostentation i doubt not but you have seen love in a tub said i for i would not be beat by her impudence maybe says she i have a poor memory there was one played in it t'other day like to you miss said i with significance thinking to rouse her she lifted her eyebrows well indeed says she indifferently as handsome as i might wish to see so she was said i persisting why do you say so cries miss what a fortunate lady and stifles another yawn you favour her miss says i giving her an eye lard i favour none sir said she tartly i am cross like two sticks that could beat myself and ere i could find a word in retort she had gone from the room if i had followed my first temper i should have marched from the house forthright being sore to be so used by the minx but i will admit she had a fascination for me and wherein my teeth are set there i hold so that i paced the chamber once or twice and faith says i angrily i will make the little cockatrice sing another tune afore i've done and no sooner was i come to this conclusion than the door at the foot of the room opened and in walks an elegant gentleman the sound made me turn and i watched him till he came into the light of the candles when i cried out sharply for the face was no other than that which had lain behind the mask in that nocturnal attack i took some steps across the room and halted by him so that he might see me as clearly as i saw him well sir says i i'll make bold to say you recognise me for i was amazed and disordered by his remarkable appearance in that house he looked me up and down not the least in the world says he coolly and arranged some nice point in his sleeves who the devil may you be rip me says i angrily the question is not that so much as who be you and what audacity brings you here but if you want it you shall have it my name is ryder he paused again before he replied to me and there was no manner of irritation in his voice but merely languor well mr ryder one good turn deserves another so my name is york and i am a friend of sir philip caswell what said i mightily taken aback at this rejoinder as you may suppose then i laughed s'blood i said 'tis a pretty demonstration of friendship to be for striking your bodkin in someone's belly as you was an hour ago you rogue york's eyebrows lifted at this but i will admit he had a fine command of himself which took my admiration toad as he was he was a healthy ruddy man of looks not displeasing indeed says he to me why here is news have we simon bedlam here madam and he turned to miss who had entered at that moment he bowed very low to her and the colour sprang in her face mr york she cried in a fluttered way why you did not look for me so late madam says he pleasantly but i spied lights and thought maybe sir philip was at his cards and would give me welcome and the door was open but i find only he concluded with an indifferent glance on me a merry andrew who talks brimstone and looks daggers sir philip has been attacked stammered miss the surgeon has just left him 'tis not serious i trust says the fellow gravely and when she had faltered out her negative continued very polite footpads i doubt not the streets are abominable in these days and the watch is ever asleep but that was too much for me and i burst forth footpads said i hear him miss why 'twas the dung fork himself the mask fell from his face as he fought me and i saw him plain i would have you and sir philip know what manner of man this is who calls himself friend softly softly you crow loud said he as impudent as ever and smiling softly who d'ye suppose would credit this cock and bull story i profess i know none would you madam he asked turning suddenly on the girl she hesitated ever so little and showed some confusion i i think the gentleman mistook said she i cannot credit such a story 'tis monstrous why miss said i 'tis true as i am a living man and as for this muckrake here why i will prove it on his skin if he denies it and out i whipped my iron ready for an onfall but it seemed that he would not budge and smiled as indifferent as ever and miss too though she showed no colour regained her composure and says she firmly 'tis monstrous i cannot believe it this gentleman is a friend to me and sir philip he is on terms of intimacy lard sir you surprise me to make such rash statements your eyes deceived you or the dark the man that called himself york nodded impudently that is it madam he says 'twas his eyes no doubt and the blinking moon this gentleman whom i have not the honour of knowing is doubtless much excited by the event and must be excused otherwise he shrugged his shoulders significantly i am honoured by the resemblance he detects and my faith i shall be seeing my double kick the triple beam so i shall and curse him for a rogue but you may guess that this was too much for me to stand there quiet and see the cully talk so suave and false and the girl so credulous and perilling herself and the house by blind faith in such a villain upon his features moreover there was a faint grin that spread and counterfeited civility almost as it were a leer and that maddened me so that i spoke out pretty hotly 'tis very true what you say sir said i and there was no witness of what happened save me and old oliver the moon and so the law shall go free of you indeed i have no particular fancy for the law myself but perish me sir says i i detect a mighty resemblance in you to a wheedler that cheated me at dice this night and rip me if i will not run you through the midriff for it there was my point towards him with that little menacing twist of my wrist such as has served me often in good stead and he must have seen what sort of kidney he had to deal with for he gazed at me in surprise laughed slightly and made protest with his shoulders exhibiting some discomposure i would remind you sir said he that there is a lady here faith says i but she will not be outside then and thither you shall go york frowned at this and stood for a moment as though he was at a loss for answer i was not to be put down by a naughty fop like him with his punctilios more especially as i was acting in the interests of the lady so i pressed him with the naked blade come says i let's see your tricks out of doors but at that a voice broke in and stayed me coming from the door behind pray sir says this very level and quiet what may this scene mean round i whipped and there on the threshold of the room was the tall big man that had fought by me sir philip himself with his arm in a bandage a cap on his iron grey hair and on his face a stern commanding expression out of the tail of my eye i saw miss shrank back against the wall in a posture of alarm but york was no whit abashed he saluted most ceremoniously good evening sir philip said he your servant you are come in time perish me in the very nick here's a most impudent and amazing case and he cocks his finger at me i have never heard of a more shameless audacious fellow faith it has made me laugh so impudent is it i should like to know what it is mr york so that i maybe might share the jest says sir philip with some dryness of tone why naturally returned t'other cheerfully having had the good fortune to rescue you and your ward from a pack of villains cutpurses or worse what is my surprise to find installed in your house the very chief of the villains as impudent as you please faith if it were not so grave 'twould tickle me still i must admit that the fellow took me back and for all i was furious i could not but admire his cool bearing and ready wit sir philip stared at me with a black frown for i could find nothing for the moment to counter this monstrous brazen charge but at last i broke out only with an oath for sure so amiss was i you damnable rogue said i but york goes on as calm as ever 'twould be a good thing sir says he looking at me with a kind of wondering interest if perhaps the watch was called for he is a man that can use a weapon as your arm bears witness and indeed my own skin too with which he stroked his elbow gently sir philip had come forward and now began in a formidable voice of anger what he cries to me you are the ruffian but i was not going to put up meekly under this and broke out myself rip me said i if i have ever heard or seen the like why yonder stands the fellow that was in the assault on your carriage and 'twas me dick ryder that thrust him through the elbow as he fell on you sir philip's eyes went from one to t'other of us under his bent black brows but york's eyebrows were lifted in a feint of amazement why sir philip said he you will see from this how an excess of impudence may move a man it may be that he is drunk that he plays so wildly you have known me long sure i needn't speak in my own behalf to so preposterous a charge and dropped silent with a grand air i have known you long as you say sir said sir philip slowly and i have known you to be a suitor for my ward's hand i have always had that honour said york with a bow towards miss which unhappily you have not seen fit to allow me so far yet if any witness is wanted why here is your ward herself at that sir philip turned as though reminded lydia said he what is the truth of this story we were attacked and rescued was this gentleman in the assault and he pointed at me miss's eyes fell she was fluttered and her bosom went fast and there flashed i'll swear a glance from york indeed sir she faltered i could not say the men were masked ay so they were said he considering 'twas from this one's face that i took the cover put in york pertly but certain it is that mr york rescued us went on miss in a faint voice at that news i could have reeled under the words so little was i ripe for them and so unsuspicious of her why said i opening my mouth and stuttering why 'twas i drove off the pack and fetched the chaise home 'twas i lifted you in and took the reins the lord deliver me from this wicked puss sir philip threw up his sword arm with a gesture of black wrath 'tis plain said he that one here is a villainous rogue and if we have not always agreed mr york at least i cannot think you that miss leaned against the wall white and trembling and i gave her a congee very deep and ironical truth to say as soon as i had recovered i had after my habit begun to ply my wits pretty sharply and already i had taken a notion of how things stood between the two moreover i was not done with yet and i cast about to be even with the pair sir philip it seemed was hostile to the addresses of this york and as patently miss herself was not the attack then must have been part of a plan to gain miss lydia's person to which she was herself privy what do i then but step in and interfere with the pretty plot this was why she bore me no goodwill no doubt well says i with the congee i cannot contest a lady's word be she poll or moll let the gentleman have his way sir philip without more ado turned to him mr york said he civilly i beg your pardon for my coldness which indeed had nothing of suspicion but you must remember that we have never quite agreed i hope that will mend i remain greatly in your debt and i trust you will be good enough to add to my obligations by keeping this man secure until my return i will have the watch fetched at once nothing will give me greater satisfaction sir says the rogue cheerfully and off goes sir philip with his black portentous face leaving us three there together again as for me i had made up my mind and was feeling my way to some action but says york looking on me pleasantly egad you're in a ticklish case stap me you've run your head into a noose now why the devil did you yield that way i had looked for a good round fight as good egad as we had this evening and i had begun to have my fears too stap me i did but i paid him no heed then for i will confess that i was all eyes for miss lydia whose face was very piteous she was trembling violently and looked out of tragic eyes and then it came upon me like a flash that she was no party to the lie herself but had spoken in fear of that bully indeed it may be that she took a distaste of him as it were from that scene which began to show from that minute how else can be explained what ensued you had better go sir said she at last in a whisper ay that's true says york nodding i had not thought of that you had better go the watch will be fetched he looked so comfortable and so friendly rather than what he was at heart that my gorge rose of a sudden perish me if i will go says i if i must hang i must hang miss started oh she cried and you must go oh you must go sir fly fly while there is time here were the two culprits in unison for my withdrawal which would fetch them out of a scrape yet how far the girl was involved in the business i had not yet determined so i pushed her further as indeed i had the right i folded my arms i am waiting my reward madam i said something in recognition of my efforts on behalf of yourself and sir philip but at this she fell into a greater exhibition of distress imploring me to go and flitting in agitation 'twixt me and the door on which she kept anxious watch well thought i if here's not innocence at least she's in a pickle enough and i believe i would have gone had it not been for york whose bearing annoyed me besides i wanted to see how far miss would go and if her resolution to veil the truth would stand out against the watch and a poor victim haled to prison not that i wanted the watch or the law about me nearer than was necessary for sundry reasons but i can always trust to my own ingenuity and sword if it comes to the pinch so i listened to her deafly and made no sign to go let him be lydia says york pleasantly he's an obstinate fellow and faith deserves his fate let him hang i'll warrant it must have come to that some day but this turns me on him and i whipped out my blade again in a fury at his insolence only miss lydia intervened and her face very pale put a hand on my arm oh sir says she very low of voice but clear and earnest for all that i beg you will not suffer further harm to come to night indeed but i am ashamed to look you in the face i will not excuse myself i will offer no apologies yet maybe you will not think too hardly of me if you know more my guardian keeps me close he stands in my way and will not allow me what is allowed all women i am not a schoolgirl sir i am grown a height and she raised herself to her full stature surely i may have that liberty to command to choose where i will and whom sir he has sought to make himself all the law to me she cries with heaving bosom and as for his hurt god knows i did not wish it and was not privy to it and she cast a glance as i thought of scorn and reproach at her lover the eloquence of this new attitude struck me to the reins tender as i ever was to the wounds of women though not to be frustrated or deceived by vain pretences he is a hog says i a pig of a man to interfere with you madam but here spoke york when he had better have held his tongue yet it was impossible faith child he said lightly you have touched him there best stop and go no farther let it work i will go on she cried stamping her foot and turning on him i will tell all to this gentleman all that should be told for it is his due and meed a small recompense for the unworthy usage he has had you have heard him sir she says and indeed your eyes have been witness to his deeds and what he is my guardian came between us and denied us and this was his plan to snatch me away by violence while i stood passive not refusing nor accepting she wrung her hands in a transport of distress i i was wild i did madly yet sir i would not have you judge me by that see it has all ended in trouble nothing but trouble and i have gained nothing for myself but shame she paused upon the edge of tears as i could see pretty plain and says i bluntly you were misled and by them that should not and i scowled at york where he stood but york says nothing merely lifting his shoulders and being content no doubt to let miss deal with the situation she sank her face in her hands which moved me strangely for she had a helpless look if i have misjudged sir and been mistook she said can you blame me if i would bury that shame and not have it flaunted in my face not i madam said i i would i might help you troth i do you can she cried sparkling shyly and eagerly upon me why says i if you will go sir there will be no trouble no inquiry and no law will be set in motion 'twill die a quiet death and nothing will be digged up against me i shall not have to tell the truth as i shall have else she cried her lips parted in her fever her eyes burning with a wild zeal york uttered a sound but i was silent oh sir she pleaded why i said with a laugh it seems i must condone wounds and abduction and all 'tis on me the brunt will fall the shame and scandal she urged and looking in her pretty face i could resist no longer for i'll swear she was genuine and had been misled by that muckrake i will go says i and then of a sudden remembered but how am i to escape says i by the window she said pointing to it with animation why to be sure says i slowly for i was taken with a notion but there is this gentleman who is my guard oh says she archly i think your sword is better than his and he will not stay you true says i but 'tis best to be prudent and to avoid sir philip's suspicions he must have some marks of a struggle either i must leave him with a wound or senseless or gagged and bound or maybe suspicion will come to rest on you madam her brows were bent in a little frown that is true she said and turned to york whose face for the first time as i could see wore a look of discomposure he must be bound and gagged says i shaking my head ye es she says hesitatingly whereupon i went forward to the fellow who gnawed his lip and fidgeted he looked at miss lydia as if about to speak and then shot an angry glance at me but paused oh very well says he at last with a grin but pray make haste or you will be surprised in the middle of your job and he had the air of yielding himself with good humour but i knew what must be his chagrin though i admired him for his manner he would have done pretty well on the road if he could have put by his scurvy way with women yet i was not for letting him off after what he had done so withdrawing the cords from the window curtains i tied him pretty quickly in a fast enough bundle but when his arms being lashed behind i approached with a wedge of wood york cried out in protest i'll have none of that said he he must be gagged says i to the lady appealing to her she hesitated and looking on him appeared to take pity or maybe she was afraid of him perhaps it is not necessary she said why look you madam said i earnestly we must convince sir philip of our good faith else he will smell out this trickery and all our pains are thrown away she made no answer and with the wedge i moved a step nearer to york who grimaced and cried out with an oath may i be but ere he could get it forth i had it between his teeth and with my knee in his wind threw him in a heap upon the floor miss lydia looked on with open eyes and with an air of uncertainty what she would have said i know not but at that moment there was a sound without the door and she broke out go go she cried running to me you can go now in safety yes 'tis time i was gone if i am to keep the bargain said i looking with a grin on york who was wriggling on the floor i gave miss a congee and backed to the window if you will credit me madam says i you will think twice ere you take up with york there i know i know says she eagerly for she was terrified of the sounds outside i will be wise i promise you her skirts swung against me and that touch on my arm sent through me an amazing thrill so that beholding her so vastly handsome and passionate at my elbow my blood fired at the sight madam said i very grave i had thought to do you some good and that privilege would have been my reward but i find myself only to have plunged you in embarrassments for which may i be whipped what get i for my pains then why nothing not even the private consolation to have relieved you and in this escape what touches me is not so much the ignominy as the deprivation of these eyes of one they would have dwelled on always 'twas not ill phrased as you will admit and i got it off with unction her face being so close to me and devilish enticing the sounds were not now audible and i was at the window so that i suppose she had forgot her tremors a demure look crept in her face under my boldness and says she softly what would you have me do oh madam said i burning on her look up look up i pray you and i'll warrant you'll read me as clear as a book i cannot guess sir says she looking up with her innocent eyes all the same while from the floor there was a choking sound which maybe was the dust in york's nostrils miss looked round we are keeping mr york in an uncomfortable position says she sweetly 'tis not a pleasant posture to be in faith said i boldly i would lie so all night if i might get what i want now what is it you want says she opening her eyes in wonder why what i will take and suffer all risks says i of a sudden with which i put my arm about her swiftly and carried her face to mine miss lydia called out oh and the gag was shaken with uncouth unintelligible sounds a noise streamed out of the hall go go cries she pink of face and sparkling and seeing my time was come i turned and went leaving the gag still spluttering in the corner the gentlemanly haberdasher i have dealt in my time with traps and catchpoles of many colours i have treated with justices and officers of the law that were mighty difficult and i have encountered innumerable rough bucks that have pressed me badly but give me them all rather than a pack of silly screaming women that know not their own mind for two minutes on end many times have i adventured the sex in one way or another and i can claim to have been esteemed by them from milkmaids to ladies even to my lady barbara duchess of cleveland but i will confess that my heart beats too soft in me to confront them rightly i cannot abide tears nor a swollen countenance and a petticoat catches me and there it is not that i am a fool where women are concerned for on occasion there is no harder flint than dick ryder as is known in the four quarters of the kingdom but i lean to mercy and consideration and particularly if i be in a good humour or in liquor 'twas in a frolic mood that i met the wench of the magpie which meeting led to an evening's entertainment tolerably humoursome but something pretty missy for a stark man like me i was newly come from the bath road with my purse full of king's pictures to the which i had added on turnham green without so much as a thought of it 'twas fallen dark of a foul december evening and as i was riding for town i missed the road and calypso floundered into a bog of water and mire with a curse i pulled her out when just at that moment i heard a voice crying out a little way off the common oozed mud for the rain had been falling heavily but i pushed the mare across in the direction of the voice and there was another that had fallen into my plight but much worse for a chaise had wandered off the road and was axle deep in a pond that spreads on the common help says the voice that i will help you and myself too says i and i gave a hand to the coachman and together we got the carriage to land i am much in your debt sir says the master of it when we were done a smug speaking sort of fellow whose face i could not see you have placed samuel hogg haberdasher of bristol under obligations he said pompously oh you are in my debt 'tis no doubt says i laughing but rip me you won't be long and at that i delivered him of a pile of gold guineas and turned my back on his entreaties and objurgations when i was come to town i put up at my favourite inn and where i am known and on the next day i set out for polly scarlet's but when i got there there was my poor girl abed with a swollen cheek so says i giving her good cheer and a certain trinket that i had for her i will make the best of my way to soho and see if maybe some of the lads be assembled but i had got no further than the minories when who should emerge into sight in the company of two officers but timothy grubbe that rascally thief taker crimp and scoundrel i am not to be frightened by any man on earth but 'twas wise to go shy of timothy and his friends at that time so ere they had a sight of me i turned my back on them and slipped in at the magpie tavern here was a warm room and comfortable and the wine when mulled was passable though sour so i tossed off a draught and says to the wench ironically to bring out the flavour of this tap i'll eat cheese my dear 'tis a wine worth testing says i thereat she fetched me cheese and stood staring on a ring that she wore on her finger a little in the shadow well i sat idly there sipping at my glass for 'twas pleasant enough and quiet 'twas a bare empty tap as it chanced and the wench and i had it to ourselves she was a pretty sort of figure all in white white mob and white apron of a middle height and slightness pleasant in so young a maid brisk of eye quick of face and with a certain abruptness of chin she stood as i say staring on a ring in a brooding seriousness and then of a sudden she uttered a little sob and rushed her apron to her eye whoa says i whoa there mare speaking softly enough but she started up and turned about so that her face was no longer in the light and so remained a little while come my pretty said i in a good humoured way wash no colour from that blue i'll warrant 'tis admired and rightly if there's any huff or bully that breeds those dew drops give me his name and on my word i'll make carrion of him at that she turned to me again holding herself erect and her eyes discharged at me a glance 'twas not one of haughtiness merely but rather one in which fear and defiance and anger rubbed shoulders one might have said indeed that all these sentiments rained together from her pretty peepers but then she dropped her head as quickly and affected her interest in the bottles or the casks or something else in the distance why says i i will even taste once more that delectable bin and she came forth reluctant to fill my glass again now says i when i had her there you're a girl of spirit rip me what's amiss sir she says with a glare in her face come if every pretty filly used her hind legs so hard said i with a laugh what room would be left in the stalls she said no word but went about her business the which as i am not used to rebuffs either from man madam or maid nettled me but i know such wildings they be not pigeons nor doves nor tame sparrows neither i must lime her with another manner so i altered my voice and says i in a pleasant but masterful tone you must not think me any peeping tom i said to twist his eyes on you and badger you tears spoil that handsome cheek and i would know if there be no remedy i cannot abide to see youth and beauty weeping she had turned her head now and gave me a searching glance 'tis naught you could help in sir she says with some demureness and then broke out 'tis along of my aunt she has put upon me and treated me ill a hag of an aunt says i sympathetically to bruise one so tender and so dutiful i'll swear yes 'tis so says she now with some confidence and wagging her little head towards me she knows not when she is well served that she doth not i'll take oath of that says i i am daughter to her husband's sister sir said she running on glibly by this time and cousin tom is sib to me why for sure if he be your cousin said i and when my mother died she said taking no heed uncle says i must live with him and there have i lived all these years none so many rip me says i handsomely he has had good service out of me she said casting me a glance as of one who would assert her rights there have i worked for my aunt susan and cast up figures for uncle and no thanks given me no not a crown's worth all these years a sorry pair of skinflints said i nodding but i would not cry tears on them not i if i was a spirited wench 'tis not that says she weeping anew 'tis that i am turned out of doors they will not have me more why how is that i asked whereat she looked demure as a saint and says she oh 'twas but nothing 'twas cousin tom and it appeared that cousin tom had set calf's eyes on her and that his mother destined him for better things so that the wench must quit though she kept the tally for nunkie and the house for aunt well says i 'tis a piece of injustice my dear and that i'll swear to love you this tom whereat she hesitated and stammered and turned aside her face and then heaved up her pretty shoulders he is so silly says she why that is the right kind of silliness for a maid i'll take oath said i but she said nothing so i tossed a guinea on the table for i had just taken a fancy to a little entertainment having nothing to do and being at a loose end by reason of polly there's that will pay for a bottle of wine said i the which i will put under my jacket by your leave mistress and i will be the one to pull you out of your despair she looked at me in surprise oh i have an eye for a wench said i and i know virtue when it peeps out and if so be you want tom rip me you shall have him i do not understand you sir said she still wondering see you here mistress says i with a wink if you was known to be in the expectation of money says i maybe auntie would sing to another tune yes said she with her mouth open and her eyes very well said i a gentlemanly haberdasher has clapped eyes on a pretty miss and taken a fancy to her for a daughter she stared at me say that here sits the haberdasher said i cocking an eye at her a gentlemanly haberdasher that is a widower and is peaking for a daughter that he will never get says i what says auntie and nunkie now she met my glance and presently hers fell i could see she was quick of wit and took me now but sir i do not know who you be said she demurely and fidgeting with her apron oh we will better that says i remembering of the man on turnham green call me samuel hogg said i godly samuel hogg of bristol that wants a daughter all to himself and is willing to leave her a hundred guineas for a dowry and a thousand on his deathbed her lips parted and her eyes gleamed then she gave me a shrewd glance for she was no fool and at last she smiled you are very kind said she pooh said i emptying the bottle you may say that when i see you this evening and confront 'em confront 'em she said d'ye suppose i will not pursue that which i propose i asked i will see auntie nunkie and all and so you may warn 'em the gentlemanly haberdasher rip me will visit 'em to night for to beg their niece of 'em 'twas on that understanding we parted though i believe the girl thought me gone in liquor and talking foolishly but that i was not as she discovered for i meant to go through with the jest and help a poor female against her shrew of an aunt at the same time so that evening when it had fallen dark sure enough i presented myself before the magpie clothed very old and sober and with a wig to suit and knocked for admittance well there were they assembled to meet me for the wench had done her part looking very expectant and all in a flutter there was uncle that was broad and short and of a weak cast of face with a grin on it and by him was aunt prim and stiff but the vinegar of her face sugared over with a smile and to these were added cousin tom a lubberly big fellow with a booby expression and a couple more why had i not been used to distinguished company i might have turned white of trembling and bashfulness before them but as it was the more the merrier and says i with a congee to aunt by your leave madam sir says she our niece nancy has acquainted us with your story at which thinks i 'egad i'm glad i know her name the which i had misremembered to ask she hath done me honour mistress i replied polite as a pea and since you know why i am here faith let us sit down and discuss of it uncle sat down blinking rapidly at us and a little fat man in the corner eyed me curiously your sister's daughter my good man says i to uncle with a benevolent smile he nodded and a very precious daughter she has been to us sir says aunt with a sort of whine now that kind fairly makes my stomach queasy and moreover i guessed what she was after she meant to pull a long face on parting with her niece with an eye to money i hope said i suavely that she will prove a precious daughter to me in good time that depends says the little fat man who it seems was a grocer ay that depends says the remaining person in the room a thin elderly woman well said i annoyed at this intervention it depends on whether miss here suits me i will confess she has took my fancy and i have room for her you want to adopt nancy says the aunt 'tis my intention i answered plump may we ask what set the notion in your head says the grocer from his corner faith you may said i and 'tis easy said for walking down the minories yesterday whom did i spy but a handsome miss with as two pretty eyes as ever sparkled in a wench's face 'she's for me' says i to myself 'she'll suit my town house like a linnet or a piping lark i'll warrant she's all sunshine' at that i thought they looked on me with some suspicion and perish me i believe i had spoken too warmly for she was dainty enough oh says aunt faintly and glanced at her husband as if inviting him to speak but he sat smoking my niece says you are a godly man sir she pursued godly says i is not the word i cry second to none if it comes to church and prayers she looked astonished at that but 'twas the grocer who spoke next 'tis a strange matter he said that you should have took so great a fancy to miss nancy here it may be as you say that you would adopt her yet you are young for a daughter young said i why i be ancient enough i have gone through enough in my time to fetch out grey hairs in bunches there was my poor wife that died ten years gone and my daughter that followed her in the flower of her youth to whom miss hath a most singular likeness 'twas that attracted me you are a haberdasher sir says the thin woman 'tis my calling i replied ah she sighed and so 'twas my poor husband's that is at rest he was engaged in an honourable trade said i you say truly that he was she assented sighing but here uncle spoke for the first time he was clearly no man of words but the fat grocer had been whispering in his ears we should want some warranty said he warranty said i indignantly there's my name samuel hogg of bristol and for the rest if it is the colour you wish why i can satisfy you and i brought out a purse full of king's pictures i could see that their eyes glistened you seem well endowed said the grocer ay and 'tis all at the disposal of miss nancy when i am in my gloomy tomb said i but the grocer whispered to the widow and she to aunt and they glanced askance at me so as matters were not going forward to my taste i got up and said i it seems that suspicions rule here i am the target of eyes rip me i carry not my wares to a market that fancies me not and so i will bid you good evening but that shook them stay sir says the aunt i am sure we may be pardoned if we hesitate to lose one so dear to us 'tis a new idea and we must get used to it why said i smiling for i could see the drift of her thoughts there is no haste you shall satisfy yourself of what i promise 'tis but the preliminary to my design i will not pluck your partridge from you roughly not i but i would have her remain with you during my preparations and only ask that i may present her with that which shall fit her out as becomes one who is to do honour to my house and me and with that i opened the purse and counted out ten golden guineas miss nancy gazed wide eyed and there was a little silence among the others save that uncle started and rubbed his eyes and cried the devil but 'twas enough for them auntie melted like a snowball in the sun the grocer pursed up his lips and the widow regarded me with wonder booby in his corner gave vent to a silly chuckle well that's fair said uncle hastily and at that supper being ready i was invited to join them now this was the time that i should have taken to go for i had done what i promised but i had nothing to attract me that night and moreover i was for pushing the fun a little further lord if tony or old creech could have seen me a sitting there in such company with an adopted daughter on my hands 'twould have made them split their sides so says i at your service and thank ye and down we sat to the table as chance would have it i was set alongside of the widow and on t'other side was the grocer says i to the girl in a whisper as she passed me there 'tis all laid for you and you can fire the train when you will along of booby she cast a glance at me and looked down fingering her guineas as if she loved 'em but bless you i did not mind the guineas there was plenty more behind 'em and then the widow turns on me and begins to ply me with questions about haberdashery and prices but rot me i knew nothing about them more than the babe in its cradle so said i presently madam i leave all such trifles to my man heavens says she you will be ruined 'tis most perilous you want someone that will look after your interests and keep your house in trim why that's what miss will do i laughed she shrugged her shoulders my husband said she was worth his two hundred guineas a year and that's all come to me alas she says sighing 'tis not i would cry 'alack' if that befel me i said with a grin ah 'tis not the money she says but the loneliness and to think that it's all lost to business for i am my own mistress she says and can do what i like having no child to consider well said i i have one now and an amazing beauty she looked sourly at miss nancy who flushed very deep just then i was digged in the ribs t'other side and turning found the grocer with a grin on his face pretty wench says he with a wink that is so said i tossing off the wine which was not so ill there's none too many like her about the town he says again with his significant wink what the plague says i but he winked again i seen what you was after from the first he said the devil you did i said and stared at him he dug his thumb into me again ten guineas for her he said with a knowing air well said i for i guessed what the fool was after well says he in his fat whisper you ain't no haberdasher i seen through you from the first look you said i sharply get on with your supper and keep your foul fingers off me or i will choke your weasand for you that as i conceive startled him for he fell away looking at me mighty anxiously but said no more moreover i was not for turning the party into pepper and mustard so i took another glass and the vintner at t'other end of the table nodded at me in a friendly way 'tis a good bottle says he knowingly and not every man's liquor that was true enough for 'twas not the swipes i had took in his tavern that afternoon and he himself was witness to his words for he had drunk the better part of a bottle already and seemed very merry and on familiar terms with the world he plied the widow on one side and his wife on t'other but aunt's visage for all her simper would have turned the best wine sour miss took but a sip of wine but her face was flushed and eager but booby he made up for that abstinence and drank and talked and laughed as though he was at a goose fair well they were a pretty party and by this time i was entered into the proper spirit of it booby over the way made a feint of embracing miss and whispered in her ear seeing which i bestowed a smile on him as who should say brava i commend your spirit but miss turned away from him sharply and i could see she was firing him a rejoinder thinks i maybe he hath crushed her steels the which no woman will stand and the least of all in public but as 'twas to settle their little affairs that i was there the time had come to speak out and so up jumps i with my glass in hand i will ask this company said i to toast a pretty girl and her lover i'll warrant their names spring to your minds need i put a style on them well when these hairs be whitening sure i shall be comforted in a nursery of babes that shall bring 'em tenderly to the grave all along of my adopted daughter there and cousin tom that shall inherit my fortune now aunt's face was lined with smiles and she lifted up her glass and looked towards the couple the vintner too chuckled and called out an indelicate jest for such maidenly ears but what was my surprise that miss turned crimson and then pale and started up with a little exclamation booby looked sheepish and grinned but she gave him her shoulder and i will not have you drink it says she tartly i am my own mistress and not to be dictated to by any why child who is dictating to you said i amazed and aunt frowned but says sweetly we have known all along 'twas a strong attachment 'twixt my son and niece why so i should ha' guessed i replied no no says uncle shaking his silly head i never did believe there was aught in it so now you know wife but his wife who was as black as night cried out sharply 'tis all nonsense they are affianced duly and then the fat grocer muttered in my ears 'twas precious cunning you have noosed and caught her already gad she'll fall into your maw like a ripe plum if you will not cease said i angrily i will run my hilt down your throat hilt says he staring and edged away from me and i could see him eyeing me up and down to see if i carried a weapon come said i to the girl maybe this is sprung on you too suddenly take your time i said and we will wait 'tis a hundred guineas on your wedding my dear and much more at my funeral i do not want your money said she petulantly and flung the guineas on the table aunt cried out in a fury and uncle stared for he was much in liquor but the grocer and the widow began hurriedly to gather them up steady said i whoa my lass what's come over you this suits not with your mood this afternoon i will admit booby is no beauty and hath a tongue too gross for his phiz but 'tis your own choice whom call you booby cries the youth rising in a passion that was compounded of wine and jealousy if you will not sit down said i i will teach you a lesson sit down and buss you fool buss and be thankful he flopped into his seat foolishly but miss rose and moved from the table i will not stay here for insult she said with spirit you shall not refuse says aunt white with anger or you shall be turned out of doors this very night you shall oh she is a sly slut she casts her eyes high says the widow in a high vindictive note look ye here says the vintner sillily and with a tipsy frown let us not tangle this merry meeting into knots be easy all if nancy wants a husband as well she may being of a marriageable age here's one for her and no better than he mr samuel hogg of bristol sir i toast you and nancy as bride and groom i looked at the girl she had come to a pause and now stood her face demurely cast down and she said nothing not raising any protest and then in a flash it came to me what she wanted i could have laughed aloud if i had been in my own company she took me for a real well to do haberdasher and would have me the puss or maybe 'twas my looks took her for she is not the first to be tantalised by my bearing but i had not bargained for this and so i laughed a little and looked askew at the vintner how says i will you turn a daughter into a wife 'tis infamous says the widow 'tis shocking to the ordinances of religion not so fast said i she's no daughter to me yet nor perhaps will be for i was weary of her hints and innuendoes the meaning of which was apparent oh maybe he can find room for you both says the grocer with his fat laugh though 'tis my only niece says the vintner pursuing his theme as if none had spoken i will spare her to so worthy a gentleman i have known her since she was a chit so high my own sister's child and he began to weep maudlin tears that came of the drink i'm sure says the widow that the gentleman will be well rid of such an ungrateful baggage and 'tis an insult to use him so he does not want a silly slip like that either to daughter or wife undutiful as she would be and extravagant in her habit what would suit you sir she says turning on me would be a staid comely wife near to your own age with a knowledge of haberdashery and some money to will you be quiet says i to her savagely he's got his eye on the young 'un he's marked her says the fat grocer dipping his nose in the wine i knew it all along there's mighty little chance to deceive me i know these dogs why directly he came in i saw a look on him when he eyed her that look here i have warned you once says i infuriated and i gave him a blow under his fat chin that sent him sprawling over the next chair to the floor at that the widow screamed out and cries murder murder i was for turning on her for my blood was up at this silliness when the vintner got upon his legs unsteadily i will have no murder done in my house says he with a hiccough i will fight any man that is for doing murder in my house but ere i could answer booby rushed at me i'll have your blood he cried and when i would have treated him as i had done the grocer the widow put her arms about me and squealed that i was being killed while miss clung to booby behind and strove to pull him off with her hands and nails oh sir oh sir 'tis a christian house cries aunt wringing her hands but christian or not i was not for being choked by the old cat and so i threw her off roughly but a blow from the vintner took me in the stomach so that all my wind was out he was whirling his arms like a mill i'll learn you to do murder cries he 'twas too much for me i had been sorely tried by their stupidity and to have them falling on me was more than i could stand rip me says i as sure as my name is dick ryder i'll lay a corpse out if you do not leave me dick ryder cries miss nancy letting go of booby who toppled over upon the grocer yes says i dick ryder who is mightily sorry that he ever set forth to do any kindness to a ninny like you ay says a voice behind me 'tis dick ryder for sure young woman i turned at the sound and on the steps descending from the tavern was timothy grubbe with the face of a trap behind him dick ryder says he with a grin i arrest you in the name of his majesty for the robbery of one samuel hogg on turnham green last night is that you timothy said i for i never minded the wretch why come in and welcome you come in the nick of time to prevent murder why i see you have been very merry says he with his leer i tapped the vintner on the shoulder here is a party i said that will drink my health i beg you to open a bottle of your best for these good friends of mine how many be you timothy i asked call it three dick says he with his tongue in his cheek make it two bottles host said i cheerily the vintner with his mouth open now coming to his sober senses stared at the visitors and at me but in obedience to my command he moved slowly towards the tap room door where grubbe and the trap stood i followed him and had out of the tail of my eye a glimpse of the wench struck dumb and terrified as touching the guineas of hogg timothy said i you will find 'em on that scratch cat over yonder with the red nose she is an old hand timothy and hath a maw for gold so she hath at that the widow started up protesting and crying out that she knew nothing of it and she was innocent and that he would spare her and the lord knows what so i was avenged on her the vain old noodle but i paid no heed only walked up behind the vintner till i came abreast of grubbe who grinned at me as he eyed me carefully 'twas not so skilful as usual dick says he 'twas a boggle a blunder well there's no boggle this time said i shortly and of a sudden put my foot under him sharply knocked away his leg and sent him flying into the room on the top of booby who was standing mouth open and next moment i thrust the solid body of the vintner in the face of the trap and toppled 'em both over that done i clapped to the door instantaneous and darted through the dark tavern and into the road there was no one there so that i knew that grubbe had lied or else he had posted a man behind the house never thinking i should break out in front once in the road i ran through the blackness of the night and ere the pursuit was after me was safe in a hiding place i know cursing myself for a fool to have wasted my time and temper on a pack of asses the man in black it was after the affair of the king's treasure that there was maybe the hottest hue and cry raised on me which has ever fallen to my lot in the course of many adventurous years the pursuit opened in a little tavern in southwark where i was foolish enough to spend a night and some guineas in entertaining a pack of rude huffs that did not know a gentleman from a dung fork i had took too much of liquor and i suppose that i had spoke too much also at least at three of the morning comes me up the landlord a decent fellow with the news that the traps were on me i hardly rubbed my eyes for the fumes were all gone now but skipped into my clothes and giving him good day was out afoot in a twinkling by a back window and made for clapham here as chance had it i encountered a stout man on his horse coming up for the fair and laying him in the mud i mounted and rode as hard as the nag would carry me towards the south i passed through kingston in the thick of the darkness and made for the wilds beyond only pulling in when i had reached the village of ripley in the dawn 'twas bitter cold of a raw january day and the sun was in a grey welter of clouds that betokened snow so i drank a hot draught of ale and brandy and giving my nag a bite was on the road again for i knew not how near the enemy might be and i had vowed to put ten leagues behind me ere i lay anywhere the way was vile in that weather but i pushed on through guildford and at last came to liphook where i sheltered for the night now what was my predicament on the morrow but to find the nag lame and myself in chains to the spot but i had covered a long distance and so says i to myself i will rest and give odds to fortune so i tarried there pretty comfortable but in the afternoon there comes along a stage from town in the which having spied the ground very carefully i decided to journey for i had by now made up my mind to reach portsmouth and ply between there and southampton and the west until such time as the chase was over so in goes i much against my habit along with a company that seemed at first little to my taste there was a respectable old gentleman that was full of questions and madam his wife that was fat and slumberous and to them was a daughter pretty enough but with eyes that marched and countermarched and usually upon a young man that was dressed like a court popinjay this fellow as i discovered was her lover harringay by name and a pretty cupid he was the last in the coach was a staid faced sober clad man all in a dark kerseymere that had come in with me at liphook and read a book while 'twas light and between the jolts this was dull company as you may guess for dick ryder to find himself in all save the girl whose eyes went on a campaign with mine so thinks i if i must be here for some drab hours i will at least take some merriment of it and so i fell to ogling her at which she minced and took on a better colour 'twas in the act that the old gentleman broke the silence by addressing me snow had fallen in the night and 'twas now darkening for more out on the sussex waste tumbled the stage and of a sudden took the wind it heeled her over and the horses stayed and swayed heaven save us we are overturned cried the old fellow looking at me not we said i why 'twould take all the breath of two heavens to capsize this old village you think 'tis safe says he anxiously as safe as a snail said i and about as speedy confound all such conveyances said i give me a horse atwixt my legs and i ask no more you are a soldier sir said he you may call me that says i a soldier of fortune i knew it says miss beaming and at that the wind took us again and the stage jolted on her creaking wheels sending miss into my arms and the old lady upon the thin black fellow miss got herself back with my assistance blushing ripe and red and the old lady cries geoffrey my smelling salts harringay tuck my skirts down at which the popinjay began fumbling in his pockets and with a sulky air stooped to do as he was bid t'other man feigned to go on reading but it was too dark now to see print i have no taste for these common stages says harringay presently in a fluting voice of affectation if i had my way i would travel by private coach maybe said i you cannot stride a horse indeed said he loftily i am quite accustomed to it 'tis the only way of progression i said a stout nag and a pair of barkers ah said the old man admiringly you soldiers see strange things i'll warrant yes said i i could tell you that which would make your hair stand miss was gaping at me and so was the whole family but young harringay crossed his legs and says he indifferently 'tis said soldiers have long tongues why they have long swords said i peremptorily for i was annoyed by his airs and graces he gave a little laugh as if he were amused with something all to himself and i was aware at the same time that the man in black was eyeing me steadily he had the look of a lawyer's clerk or something of the sort so i returned him his stare with nonchalance this made him give way and he turned his attention to the party opposite for there could be no pretence now of reading a page you go armed always sir inquired the old gentleman one never knows whom one may meet said i with a yawn you signify highwaymen he said in a lower voice why i'm told there is danger from these gentry said i harringay laughed lightly pooh he says they are main cowards and would not attack any man with boldness and a pistol the man in black looked at him with interest you carry a pistol sir i asked politely of the popinjay he tapped his pocket significantly there is none would dare assail me he boasted and miss cast him a glance of admiration we put ourselves in mr harringay's hands explained the old gentleman cheerily he is our escort i thought i saw a smile on the face of the man in black and i could not help meeting it but his suddenly faded away and he looked out at the moor on which the snow and the wind were threshing the old coach was lurching on as if she had been a packet in a storm i shall be sick my stomach heaves cried the fat woman and applied her smelling salts whereat she was attended by her husband and her daughter and lying back seemed to pass off into sleep 'tis a wild night says the old man i misdoubt we shall fetch petersfield why that we shall said i cheerfully unless these same gentry you speak of play us a trick do you think it likely inquired a voice in my ear and there was the man in black broken out of silence for the first time maybe said i indifferently and maybe not why he says in a raucous voice there is nothing here to tempt any such what is there among us all speak for yourself said i i have that which i would not part with willingly and i sir said the old gentleman but with three such young gentlemen to protect us we need fear nothing well i will confess i wouldn't care to be stopped says the man in black but they would not have much of me there is my box of jewels says miss looking eagerly at harringay who smiled and nodded and clapped his hand to a pocket 'tis safe said he you may trust me for that sweetheart at which she smiled on him adoringly the man in black had sunk back into his seat and his heavy breathing sounded presently in my ear so that i concluded he too was fallen asleep i was like to have done the same for the jolting and the stuffiness of the air had wearied me but at that moment the coach came to a stop and there was the voice of the coachman calling out that this was rake 'twas now darkling overhead but the snow had ceased and we entered the flying bull to refresh ourselves a long barn of a place with a surly landlord that had not sense enough to serve his customers properly but the wine was fair and i ordered a bottle or two in the which i asked the old gentleman to join me says he with all my heart sir seeing that you add this to my other obligations what be those said i he gave me a bow for he was a civil gentleman though of a rustic habit you protect us sir he said we are relying upon your good weapons and bright courage in the face of emergency i laughed oh as for that i said i can promise you there's none likely to infest you you are as safe as in whitehall within these fields of white that is well said remarked the man in black and i shall eat for my part with the better assurance after that promise he had certain sourness of voice at which however i could not take offence for there was nothing in his words to warrant it but harringay must be popping into the conversation and so i turned my spleen on him i would not promise said he that we shall not be molested there is plenty of cut throats about as i have heard lord harringay says the old lady dropping her knife and fork you terrify me what possessed us to come on this journey he simpered as one pleased with his effort adding 'tis known as the worst road out of london dear heart cries the lady and i saw miss whitening under the bloom she had took of the cold air 'tis a pity said i that simpletons talk of what they know not 'tis the safest road in the kingdom oh says he with an air i would not discompose anyone 'tis best you should keep up your spirits and he drank of his wine whistling gently and as one who is superior to circumstance and the rest of the company if he had not been so grotesque an ape i would have said something more but as it was i had not the heart to overwhelm him in miss's presence so said i good humouredly well call me when there is danger and i will see if i can spy it out of two spectacles i gave miss a jorum of mulled wine and i plied her mother who would eat anything never did i see a woman with such an appetite but the old gentleman took little or nothing and only sipped his glass being clearly in an anxious state i was promised we should lie at petersfield to night he said in a plaintive way for i have business in portsmouth to morrow oh you shall lie there safe and warm said i and madam and miss too in as snug blankets as any in the realm or call me hangman i got up and walked to the window the black night stared back at me with ominous eyes thinks i to myself that we must be hauling out at once if my words were to come true for there was snow in the sky like lead i turned about and under the candles saw the man in black guttling his wine as if he were in a haste to feel its temper in his stomach he had drunk one bottle and the better part of another i called out to the innkeeper bidding him ask if we were to stay there all night for if not we had better be gone and that seemed to affect the coachman for in a little news was come that we were to start the last i saw of the table was the figure of the man in black drinking his second bottle to the dregs no sooner were we set in the stage again than the storm began the wind swept over the heights and rained on us a deadly flurry of snow it battered against the windows and penetrated even to the recesses of the interior but we were warm with our wine and i for one lay back with contentment with one eye open on miss who was conscious of my stare and fidgeted under it and t'other on nothingness the old lady went off to sleep forthwith with the food she had taken and trumpeted at times to the chagrin of her daughter but what's a snore at least it interfered not with me and presently miss had slipped from me and i was at rest like any child the coach rocked in my dreams and then there was a cry and presently after i opened my eyes with the feeling that the snow was on my temples 'twas not that however but the barrel of a pistol that the man in black held move says he fiercely and you are a dead man as soon as i was awake i guessed what it was and so never stirring a hand said i that command concerns not my jaw i conceive 'twere best you kept your mouth closed said he why said i i perceive that my prognostications were all wrong and that we be fallen indeed into the hands of a tobyman who will i trust prove as gallant as all his kidney silence says he and give me what you have you have my pistols i asked politely yes he replied triumphantly and at that i knew he was a mere bungler and no real gentleman of the road for he was all a tremble with his excitement well said i there is but the matter of a small bag of guineas hand it out said he sharply look'ee said i you promise me death do i move i will find it myself he said quickly but i was not for having his dirty fingers on me so said i with a heavy sigh if i must i must and i drew out a bag from my inner pocket you have saved yourself said he hoarsely and lord i knew again he was new to the game for no born tobyman would have rested content with what i gave him when there was two bags more of golden pictures safely stowed in my coat now that you have what you want said i meekly maybe you will allow me to ask after my companions you will understand said he that i am here with four loaded pistols with the which i will shoot any that moves oh i accept my fate i replied as if desperately tis the young lady that i am thinking on he laughed harshly you have cast sheep's eyes enough my good man i have her jewels damme now says i had the jewels been in my keeping i would not have let 'em go so cheaply is the young gentleman in his gore no says he curtly we have all been taken by surprise and robbed says the voice of the old gentleman tremulously this man silence said the man in black are you there miss said i to the darkness a small voice says yes very frightened keep up your heart said i we are none of us hurt and when once this awesome ruffian i command you to be silent said he savagely come said i let us have some liberty you have took our goods let us have our tongues left at that he said nothing but there came an interruption if you will believe me the old lady had slumbered through it all and now woke up at a jolt of the coach and cried out thieves why madam you say right said i thieves it is and as ferocious a tobyman as ever i remember with that she fell to screaming but the man in black clapped his pistol to her and gave her a fright that paralysed her to silence give me what you have says he i i have nothing she stammered there is no room on me to hide so much as a bah says he if you will cease your clatter i will do you no harm the gentleman has promised to do none of us harm said i if we behave modestly this coach shall not swim in blood for the which we should fall to our prayers in thankfulness whether he perceived my ironic tone and was to resent it i know not but i would have been equal to him the nincompoop but as chance had it just at that moment the coach came to with a crash that sent him flying against the window he flourished his pistols wildly and i thought the fool would have let one off only the door opened on the other side now and the head of the coachman peered in my man presents at him shouting move and you're a dead man what's all this stir says the coachman in amazement are ye gone out of your wits no says he but you shall be gone out of yours if you stir and do not as i wish this gentleman says i in a mild voice has robbed the coach and 'tis only of his kindness that we get off with our lives you shall cut one of the horses loose and let me have it said this ridiculous tobyman or i will blow out your brains you're welcome to a horse grumbled the other still in astonishment you're welcome to 'em all if you can get anywhere from here what is it you mean he demanded haughtily why we're astray we're in a drift somewhere towards liss the lord knows where says t'other indeed says i imploringly you will not venture your valuable life on such a night but he uttered a savage oath yet appeared perplexed look you said i in another voice if you take the horse you will reach nowhere from here and you will leave five hapless mortal beings to starve of cold let 'em get back to the road and then take your nag he was silent for a while but this argument seemed to appeal to him very well said he i consent but if there be any sign of treachery i will not hesitate to shoot go back to your horses at this the coachman no doubt well enough content to be let off at such a price shut the door and departed and presently the stage began to rumble on again floundering on the hills towards liss now you may think how i was tickled at this muckworm trying his hand at the road he was some attorney's clerk or maybe 'prentice i could have sworn and he was as fidgety as a cat seeming not to know what to do or whom to confront and bully moreover my attitude had put him in a flurry and the knowledge that we were astray had discomfited him so he stands with his back at the door saying nothing but holding a barker in each fist but i was not for letting him alone and says i you done that very well i would i had your composure and i would have been his majesty's chief justice by now with the hanging of rogues for my business at that the old gentleman plucked up spirit enough to venture on a word alack he said i fear that all those that follow a trade of violence must come by violence to their end and sighed that's the truth said i smacking my leg you have spoke truth if you die to night silence cries this shoddy highwayman nervously your tongue wags young man says the fat old lady to me but it appears to me you did little in the defence you boasted of some time ago i can't abide cold steel at my ears said i alas that i was born to encounter so redoubtable a captain you are a soldier says she angrily and you see us robbed and put about like this why i can endure any ordinary tobyman said i but this fellow is the very devil i think any man may be excused to surrender to so vehement an antagonist his bark's his bite says i harringay my smelling salts says she petulantly i i have 'em not stammers he no said i 'tis all along of this gentleman with the barkers see you mr harringay and i have had to yield up and if one of mr harringay's spirit hath done so why i think it no shame myself but indeed i went on struck with a comic idea we are neither of us in need of shame for i believe this gentleman to be a notorious gentleman of the road with a terrible reputation is't not so sir says i you are at liberty to believe what you will says he but in a milder voice i have heard of these gentlemen i went on and from his description i would take oath this is not other than galloping dick dick ryder that is a terror on the highways is it so says i again what if i be says he and i believe the huff was well pleased as indeed he might be there said i triumphantly i guessed it and believe me any man might be proud to submit to dick ryder from all i hear ay i have heard of him too says the old gentleman but they say he is better than would appear and merciful oh never fear said i this gentleman will prove merciful ere we are finished with him i warn you to expect nothing from me said he in a more complacent voice just at that moment the coach began to roll along more smoothly and at a faster pace and i judged that we were upon the road again and that the coachman was whipping up this same thought seems to occur to the fellow for he opened the window and shouted out to the man to stop with a lot of horrid threats so that presently the coach came to and the coachman appeared at the door seeing his manoeuvre had failed what is it he said innocently you must keep your bargain says the man in black we are on the road such road as there is he grumbled well cut me one of the horses out or i will make a hole in you cries the fellow come says i we were getting on quite famously till now 'tis a pity to end this pleasant party but he gave me an oath and stepped out of the vehicle at which i seized the young man harringay out with you said i and we will see this mischief to an end we got out into the snow which was still whirling in the air and i watched the coachman extricate one of his nags the tobyman if i may so style him stood with his legs apart drawn up in his most dramatic posture pistols in hand you will not stir says he for full ten minutes after i am gone if you do i will come back and blow your brains out this truculent fellow quite appalled the coachman who busied himself with the gear and presently has one of his horses out this t'other mounted in an awkward fashion and turned to us remember says he in a warning voice i never forget or forgive now whispered i to harringay now is the chance to show your quality you take him on the near side and i will on the off leg or arm will do he will topple off on the least shove the fool but but he stammered he is armed damme said i furious to meet such cowardice are ye frightened of a pistol in the hands of a mumchance and with an oath i left him and flew at my quarry i had got half way to him when he saw me coming and pointed a barker at me stop cries he stop be damned says i and sprang at him the pistol went off and took my hat singeing my forehead which made me all the hotter i seized him leg and neck and swung him down into the snow where he grabbled for another weapon if you move said i i will crack your neck like a rotten stick my brave tobyman quit you worm quit and i gave him my fist between the eyes so that he lay still coachman said i you may take your horse and throw a lantern here and i fumbled in the man's pockets for a pistol now said i we are on terms again and i dragged him to his feet harringay came up now and says he let me help get you gone i want none of you i said sharply damme miss will serve me better she will wear the breeches properly and i called out to her by that time the coachman had his lantern and cast the light on the miserable sheepish object who scowled at us here's a pretty tobyman said i a right gallant fellow that sheds lustre on the craft why a child could manage him see says i for miss was come up looking very handsome and excited in the snow take ye this pistol miss and hold it to him he will do you no harm no more than a louse and never could she hesitated a moment and then summoning up her courage did as i bid holding the barker in a gingerly fashion the while i searched his pockets taking out what he had took of us i had just completed my job when there was the sound of voices quite close for the snow had dulled the tread of the horses of the party that approached they were on us ere i knew and one called out what is this is't an accident it is a little accident to a tobyman said i a brave fellow that is come by misfortune all unknown to his mother the devil says the voice we are after one such let us see him now you conceive how i felt for that this was a party of traps on my heels i guessed at once so i moved a little into the shadow of the lantern and waited while the man examined t'other i do not know if this is our man says he but 'tis enough if he be guilty who is your man asked i emboldened by this ignorance 'tis dick ryder says he we tracked him as far as liphook but the one that could speak to him has been detained by a fall at the village why this is he said i in triumph did he not confess to being ryder i asked of the others for by this the old gentleman and his lady were both with us certainly i will swear to it says the old fellow i heard him with these ears say he was ryder then is our business done says the trap and i'm not sorry considering the night and his men surrounded my man and seized him his face was as pale as the snow and he had a horrid frightened look maybe he was some attorney's clerk that had robbed his master and was in flight i cared not and i never knew and he went off silent with his captors on the way to the triple beam which he deserved for a bungling bragging nincompoop but now we were alone and the guineas and the jewels were in my pockets lord i love the jingle of 'em and so i took my counsel forthwith sir says i to the old gentleman here be your purse and your papers and to you sir says i to harringay i restore the smelling salts that is your charge miss this i'll warrant is your jewels the which i would advise you to place in a better security than heretofore and now justice is done and we conclude with a merry evening but there is my purse says harringay in an amaze my purse with fifty guineas why your purse must be where your heart is in your boots says i contemptuously and called to the coachman give me that nag says i and before he understood i was on the beast and doffing to miss and her mother rode off into the snowy night with a peal of laughter the lady in the coach it was not until i was three parts across the heath upon the adventure that i had gotten any suspicion i was forestalled the night was very thick owing to a pack of clouds that lay furled upon the moon and till then was as still as a mouse but calypso's hoofs started a wether bleating near by and it ran jumping into the distance with its silly bell a tinkling round its neck and just upon that the noise of a commotion far off came down to me and pulling up the mare i set my ears to the valley i knew the coach must be wobbling along two miles this side of belbury and i reckoned to meet it by the fork but this news as you may conjecture put me in a taking there was none along that road save me and creech's lot and 'twas gall to me to play jackal to dan or to anyone else for the matter of that so putting my boots into calypso i rode down the valley at a gallop but i had gone no farther than a few hundred paces when a clatter of nags came up the road to my left and i stopped the roan dead i was not to be taken like a fool all agape with chagrin and i held up under the cover of a tall furze bush till all four were by passing like shadows into the night damn creech i says to myself for i had scarce a crown to my pocket but seeing that vexation would not serve me i rode on mighty discomfited and presently entered the high road near the foot of the heath right afore me and wrapt in the shadows of a black clump of trees was the hulk of the stage out of which proceeded a clamour of excited voices when i came up with it the coachman was gathering his reins for a start but at sight of me rising out of the darkness he dropped 'em again save us he cried with an oath here's more of the gentry and stared at me very sullen at this exclamation an instant silence fell inside the coach and then a head was poked cautiously through the window 'tis useless my good man said a thin high voice we are by this plucked to our bare bones and sit grinning in them heaven save us from this accursed heath i feared 'twould be so says someone else with a whine faith says i coming to a stop alongside 'tis an honour you put upon me i have been mistaken afore now for his highness and for jack ketch too but 'tis the first time i was dubbed gentleman of the highway the old fellow at the window rolled his eyes over me without a word and pretty sharp eyes they were and who may you be then says he with a queer smile upon his lean face why if it comes to that says i in turn who the devil may you be he scrutinised me closely and then coachman he called bestir your horses come come says i for the old scarecrow tickled my curiosity there's no need to quarrel upon our characters you have had the highwaymen here he shrugged his shoulders four dirty rascals he said and we're in no humour for another look 'ee says i sharply i allow no one to repeat a mistake he surveyed me with indifference smiled and withdrew his head in that case he said bluntly 'tis ill to waste your time and ours he was a surly old cock and but that i knew dan must have skinned him close i would have dragged him forth and served him according to his deserts and in truth i was half in the mind to despoil him of some of his fine fig but just then another voice broke in sir says this noodle if you be an officer as i should judge by your dress i pray you will despatch these villains i am a poor man and can ill afford to lose my purse but if a small reward will serve ha ha says i nodding here is some sense at last and drawing the roan nearer i looked into the coach there was six of 'em all looking pretty sheepish and one as i discerned in the dim light was a lady lord says i five of you and the coachman to be frightened by four scurvy cut throats why sir says the man that had just spoke who wore a heavy paunch an you had been here i warrant you could ha' done nothing the ruffians wore black masks and swore abominably for my part all i can say is that there was the cracking of whips and a pistol through each window ere i was out of the lady's lap where being asleep the jolt had thrown me the exchange was effected i assure you put in the old man suavely with less noise than if it had been a sabbath sermon save for the protestations of my friends here protestations says the lady breaking her silence and in an voice rough with anger there were tears enough to have touched a heart of stone and less resistance than a barndoor fowl's a fine company for escort forsooth i shot another look at her for a woman specially if she be beautiful tickles my fancy and sure enough i could perceive even in that light she wore an air of quality but i put her aside a moment and says i to the man with the paunch what have you lost says i sir says he i am a goldsmith the which trade hath in these days sunk so low that but here belinda intervened on him very sharp for heaven's sake says she impatiently spare us the repetition of your circumstances and since she added with a sneer this gentleman is so good as to promise you assistance specify your guineas and be done there were a hundred guineas in my bag said the goldsmith humbly but at that and it may be because of the hint in the lady's words about me there came another voice from t'other side i am a merchant sir it began perhaps says i with a glance at the lady we had better spare that also sir says the cully accepting my rebuke if you will but save me my two hundred and fifty guineas you will place me deeply in your debt a king's officer like yourself should have no difficulty in running these rascals to earth that made me smile as you may fancy and then turning to hoity toity i says and how have you fared madam now that i regarded her more closely i could perceive that she was very elegant but she wore an ill tempered frown that set her beauty askew i says she shrilly am in no mood to indulge a wayside curiosity unless indeed 'tis your business to catch robbers i bowed very solemn and she eyed me with asperity i have been rifled of many valuable jewels which i should now possess had i kept other company than that of chicken hearts 'tis a fool's trick to carry jewels on the king's highway says i these gentlemen of the road snap their fingers at his majesty and you a king's officer to say that she said scornfully faith said i with a laugh i make no such claim to dignity i am a poor civil gentleman of no more pretensions than your brave companions brave she echoed with disdain five able bodied men and never a blow among them pardon me madam interposed the old gentleman softly i have already explained that you must not reckon with me having these five years no certain knowledge if my legs be still my own at this point the coachman broke in with a gruff voice we must be going says he or maybe we shall have further trouble ere belbury heavens would they flay us asked the old gentleman lifting his eyebrows i assure you i have nothing beyond my skin and two very incompetent legs that set me laughing for the old cock tickled me faith says i here is a philosopher whereupon like a pistol shot madam turns upon me in a fury and who are you sir that dares mock at our misfortunes she cried angrily who are you that comes swelling with fine feathers and a cock a doodle doo about assistance oh were there stuff enough within the four walls of this carriage some one should fetch you a clout for your impertinence i was a fool to have ventured in this company a fool not to have taken my lord kerslake's offer of a seat the old gentleman looked amused and glanced whimsically at me but sure i liked her spirit though i made answer mockingly faith gentlemen says i you have here spirit enough to arm a regiment i crave your ladyship's pardon i am of a round and jocund temper and can scarce keep my teeth inside my lips i should grin upon a tombstone but as for your misfortunes rot me but they touch me nearly and had the opportunity fallen i should ha' been proud to draw a skewer for you you have fine words sir says she still very angry i am weary of words i have heard brave words enough to outlast my years you brag of your sword she puffed her nostrils in a sneer had you arrived five minutes sooner the chance had been yours to show the spirit under your fine coat i am weary of words drive on a god's name coachman i glanced about the coach with a smile though to say the truth the wench's tongue nettled me and it seems says i that we are a pack of superfluous cravens why is there none to fight us my stomach i vow heaves for a highwayman how stand yours sirs mine sir is sinking says the old gentleman caustically sinking for the meal from which you detain us pray begone sir added hoity toity as we may not have your valiant aid no doubt your comfortable bed will provide you bloodless dreams of battle there was no limit to the jade's tongue but i kept myself in control and merely laughed why says i it seems i come to the table when the wine is cleared by five minutes she exclaimed by bare five minutes the hoofs of their horses were not round the corner ere yours was poking its nose through the window i would i had forestalled 'em says i with meaning the lady paid me no heed but continued i have come from a town where young gentlemen of blood blink not at danger and to lose five minutes were not to lose the privilege of protecting a lady of birth her sneers made me mad but ha says i your ladyship lives in a brave town and what would these young gentlemen do sink me i am so humble that i must go to school under them they would not hang to gossip upon the wheels of a coach and i should have my jewels within four and twenty hours says she curtly gad says i they are gallant young gentlemen indeed and of a rare devotion to your ladyship as for me as for you sir interrupted the old gentleman testily if you will be good enough to resume your journey we may have some chance at least of our dinner hereupon the coachman cracked his whip and the horses plunged forward a step but i leaned over and laid my hand upon the side fie fie says i to mumble of dinner when the lady's jewels are in question and but four and twenty hours to get 'em the more reason for your leaving at once said the old mawkin sarcastically somehow the behaviour of these two nettled me i could see that the one entertained suspicions of me and t'other used me with so small an amount of ceremony that i was loth to leave 'em ere i had cried quits with 'em but it was the ejaculation of the goldsmith as set the idea suddenly in my head for says he in astonishment taking up the old gentleman's phrase you will undertake the quest sir and immediately the thought of a pretty whimsy flared in my head but ere ever i had taken it up springs the merchant crying mine too mine also sir i pray you young gentleman my bag of guineas the devil says i very calm and as if i had made my resolve long since how would those same young gentlemen of blood entreat you i wonder 'slife i have a notion that they would despatch you all to hell for your common quality it being of untoward audacity for to seat you next her ladyship and then putting my head right through the window i says addressing the lady in the most pretentious solemn manner your ladyship i says frame me in your fancy however high the flight as one of these gentlemen of blood sirs bear your misfortune with patience i adjure you lard and oddsbobs i wish you a more prosperous journey and with a sweeping bow i spurred the roan into a gallop down the road when i pulled up at the foot of the heath i could hear the creaking of the coach as it lumbered in the distance then turning the mare's nose to the common i put her to an easy canter 'twas a design of some humour that possessed me and what further drove me on was the reflection that i had a bare lining to my pockets and if i could not come by a high toby lay well i would juggle with creech for a venture i knew dan's haunts well enough and that as like as not he was hiding in the woodman for to celebrate his success and sure enough when i had crossed the heath and struck into the pine wood on the further slopes after concealing calypso in a thicket there was old kettle met me at the door of his inn very suspicious but of a mighty cheerful countenance he was acquainted with me by sight for he let me pass with a nod and proceeding to the rear of the hostelry i found one of dan's lads stuck before the door of the barn he challenged me as i approached but pooh tom says i keep your lead against traps and such vermin the which made him grin upon recognising my voice what brings you here dick ryder says he we thought you was in london i'm on the king's service i am tom says i whereat he broke into a loud guffaw and says he you'd best forswear then or dan'll crack no bottle for you to night he's in a rare humour is dan but i pushed by him and entered the barn where creech and two more of his rogues were sprawling upon the floor pretty far gone in liquor as i conceived at the sight of me up jumps dan to his feet but falls back again drunkenly you damned pink faced truant dick ryder he cried what do you out of your bed at this hour and mistress polly all forlorn women says i are devilish seductive for ornament dan but theirs is a heavy price and i'm quit of 'em and with that nodding at a crate of bottles i added a fetch of luck eh danny sit down my fine feathered bird says creech sit down and tipple along of us stab me if i keep my luck to myself i'm a generous hand i am the wine was none so bad being sack of an elegant body though creech had never the palate of a fly and presently after i had drunken i looked about me but could see nothing of the booty ah says i i'll warrant you have filled your purse danny you're no company for a poor wastrel like me creech grinned and winked a bloodshot eye on me you should ha' joined the company dick he said but damme you're so devilish shy plague take you haven't i given you your chances stab me you fine young bantam for all your pride i wager you've not a crown in your pockets and ours a bulging out with goldfinches one danny one says i and a good well thumbed crown come by honestly bah says creech with a sneer you'd be dragging your pockets along the ground if you'd been along of us to night did you take a coach says i a coach replied creech such a coach as you never saw just guineas a dropping off the box into your mouth and none to deny you eight hundred and thirty golden pictures you young fool all stamped of his majesty and more to that more says i very innocent and it mightn't be a little box dick only a little box says creech in a wheedling voice but a queen's ransom to its belly and without more ado but as if anxious to strut upon his dungheap he put his hands between his legs and fetching out a casket threw it at me catch it he cried open it and feast your eyes upon it there's glamour enough there to turn a stomach sour 'twas a rare lot of jewels for sure and it was small wonder that her ladyship was in such a taking but creech in the exultation of drink and success could not hold his tongue which it was not my desire that he should where's your damned independence now he chuckled what sort of figure upon the lay does galloping dick cut atween here and london but if i was to have it forth of his fingers i would have it openly and so i says plumply i have a fancy for that box dan says i creech leaned over and set his dirty finger against his nose poking out his tongue yes says i in a careless fashion i have taken a main liking to it i want that dan creech burst into a fit of laughing hear him he cried hearken at the avaricious young fellow he wants it the precious boy and so he does and will his nursey give him the pretty things for a plaything till he falls asleep oh dicky dicky stab me but you'll be my death of bursting and he rolled upon the ground in merriment that came in good part of the sack come dan says i as pleasant as you like you won't deny me old friend not you let us shake hands on it but this set creech yelling with laughter why curse me said he here's a queer game hearties here's a poor young man with but a crown to his pocket and a soul a soaring in the sky but then without further ado i whipped the coin out of my pocket and spun it in the air come danny says i affably i will toss against you with the precious gems for stakes put 'em down atween us and by god i'll nick 'em creech stopped in his laughing and set the box in front of him piling upon it two heavy pistols and a naked sword there dick ryder says he grinning come and fetch 'em there's none as can charge meanness upon me take 'em cocky stab me dick ryder where's your grit and over he rolls upon his side shrieking with laughter in which t'others joined him now he had as it were laid the job fairly before me and for the moment i was in the mind to take him at his word but the next second i had abandoned the purpose for though i had little doubt that i could manage the three with them in a drunken condition i was not for spilling blood at anyrate at that stage so what does i do but merely stick forth my foot and kick the weapons into the air that fetched creech to his legs mighty sudden and scowling at me he says is this serious dick you'd best guard 'em well says i for i mean ill by them look 'ee dick said creech slowly if you want 'em you can take 'em d'ye see i'm not a man to botch my words curse me i've given you your chances afore now well says i i'll fight you for 'em creech winked i ain't afeard of your toasting fork he said though you are used to wear it for a taunt i have as many bloody facts to my tally as maybe dick ryder himself but i'm no precious baby to risk my skin in behalf of what's my own an you take 'em you shall reckon with the gang damme says i gang or no 'tis all one with me i'll have 'em within a round of the clock no no young fellow replied creech with a sly look 'tisn't upon our side as the whole bargain must lie strike me a proper balance curse me if you're for sport i'll meet you put up that crown d'ye think i'm to cast away the baubles on the fall of a shield place me something fat in the scales why my sword says i with a laugh creech grunted calypso says i bah says he mare and sword and all yourself atop my young blood would you buy blood for money i asked faith yes he answered 'tis the fashion of the trade and you're a pretty hand with the irons look at you you with your fine fancy dress for all the world like a gentleman in his majesty's service stout muscles dick but small wits behind 'em what say you you shall have the trinkets and the guineas too if you can get 'em but an you fail we'll have you by hell body and soul for twelve months i knew 'twas his inflation that drew him on thus but it served my purpose and so after a pause i said how long do you give me for the job till this hour to morrow night says dan seeming to consider thereupon i jumped to my feet i'll take you says i and now for another glass creech stares at me for a moment in stupid wonder and then solemnly reached out his hand which i took filling a glass i nodded at the three and gave them a toast here's success to me lads i says but at that creech turned black and spilling the wine he was drinking looked at me savagely damn you he said keep your toasts to yourself and get you gone or tom out there will have leave to thrid you with bullets but having made my point i was in no humour to be offended at the surly hunks and so i tossed off the wine very leisurely good danny i said there's sense in your tipsy brain yet best go to bed and nurse it for you'll need all your wits to night but creech who had now fallen into a dark mood made no answer merely muttering to himself and with a nod i was gone but lord the adventure was ready to my hands for to cheat three such clumsy sots was no difficult task for me i scarce gave it a thought until coming upon tom in the yard afore the barn a sudden notion took my fancy and i came to a stop beside him ah tom says i shaking my head 'tis a raw night for to gnaw the vitals out of a hedgehog and you with no drink i've a mind to spare you what d'ye mean says he without a suspicion when is your time up i asked paying him no heed at midnight says he cursing a little to himself tom says i you're a friendly fellow you are and i have taken a compassion on a poor devil as can neither eat nor drink his belly full and with that and ere he was aware i had my hands upon his throat the sudden action took him by surprise and though he struggled i forced him presently upon his knees why says i pleasantly sure i told you i was upon the king's service tom engaged by his sacred majesty for to get rid of rascals like yourself but then getting his breath he opened his mouth to cry for help only on the instant i slipped a splinter of wood atween his teeth so there was he soon bitted and bound safe enough now these transactions fell and with little noise in the shadow of the barn where it ran forth to the margin of the wood and no sooner was tom secured than there was the noise of someone opening the door and creech's footsteps sounded in the yard in an instant i slipped tom's cloak about me and all muffled to my nose withdrew a pace into the darkness at the same time letting the point of my sword fall on the cully's chest i reckon that he knew well enough what was enjoined on him for he never stirred but i was a little anxious about creech lest even in his state he should recognise my voice he stopped at the corner and called tom in a loud voice to the which i made a surly reply cold eh says he with a chuckle and sulky well if 'twill warm you you'd best put a bullet through galloping dick d'ye hear we have a little game atween us and if he gets by you ye shall answer for it i durst trust myself to nothing but a mumble by way of answer but it suited creech who swaggered off to the barn again and then getting tom in my arms i dragged the body into a coppice and presently resumed my post as sentinel 'twas a shrewd night and the hours passed very slowly but there was that in my heart to warm me against the cold for i knew that all hung upon the change at midnight and when that time came and there was once more the sound of feet in the yard i drew up stiff and stark being solicitous for the hazard twas blake that came to relieve me but as fortune had it his head was mazed with sleep and drink and he paid me little attention i growled out an oath or two to which he gave no answer his teeth chattering in his jaws and with that i left him and rounding the corner i made straight for the entry when i got in there was ned lying in a heap upon some straw snoring like a swine and creech as i perceived seated with his back against the wall and his eyes lifted meditatively to the rafters that you tom says he and without even a glance at me chucked his thumb towards a pile of bottles there's no sleep yet in that voice thinks i and seating myself in a dark corner where the lanthorn shed no light i helped myself to wine 'twas grateful enough to a pinched stomach but when i was done and stretched snugly in the straw there was i destined to wait upon creech's convenience till so be as it pleased him to fall off he had by this as i could see shook off the most of his liquor being i fancy in no wise comfortable as to the bargain he had struck with me but that did not disturb me for i could bide my time only it gave me a start i confess when after half an hour in this fashion he got upon his feet and came towards me i had all along been feigning slumber and as he came i managed to bury my head deeper in my cloak lest he should take a suspicion of my phiz he stood over a moment and then drunk says he and fitting his foot into the small of my back shoved me a pace forward i rolled a little more upon my face and gave a grunt like one stirred in a deep sleep and then i knew 'twas all right for creech's jaws cracked in a yawn and retiring to his corner he flung himself down from where i lay and by the faint light of the lanthorn i could perceive him turning the casket over in his fingers and presently he popped it in the straw beneath him and laying his head upon it disposed himself for the night to this point the affair had gone very well but i must now wait until dan was nodding and a little more than that too so the better part of two hours elapsed before i made a movement then pulling myself cautiously into a sitting posture i listened the barn reverberated with the noise the two cullies made there was little doubt about creech this time i rose still as a spectre the light flickered upon dan's body and very slowly i drew near i warrant there was never a mouse so quiet as me as i bended over him with my fingers in the straw pah the job was easy enough done for all it was so furtive for the box proving hard to his neck his head had slipped away and there was no need to disturb him in extracting it and more by token when i had inserted my fingers they came upon a bag of goldfinches too the which as i recalled was in our pact and so with exceeding wariness i fetched both of 'em out and only a quiver upon dan's features to mark for it that accomplished i tripped it to the door which i unlatched gently now all was going well enough and i should have had the booty without more ado than a sharp time in the frost only who should intervene unexpected but the fat sneak kettle upon whom prowling round the barn after some dirty business of his own i stumbled over the threshold the shock sent me back against the door which fell to with a loud bang and what with that and with the alarm kettle made creech and the others were upon their feet and wide awake in a moment knocking the innkeeper aside with a curse on him for his interference i slipped forth of the yard and made forthright for the wood but creech was sharp enough too he bellowed with rage and came roaring upon me with his pair of rascals at his heels there was little enough to spare between us though the dark was on my side but then again 'twas the dark that made against me too for mistaking my direction i ran into the forest upon the side away from calypso and shortly found myself in a wilderness of coppice scarce able to move a yard for the undergrowth about me creech was not far off for i could hear him breaking through the wood and yelling at the top of his voice i reckon there was never a cully in such a taking afore but i was not yet quit of 'em not by any means for here was i uncertain of my position and wanting a nag to carry me safe out of their hands and the worser part of it was that creech was pretty sure to happen upon the mare in his wanderings still there was nothing further to be done at this juncture for the noise of my advance would be heard and so i lay very still in the brake for upwards of an hour by that time the night was yielding and the dawn came up in a thin white mist that stretched like a counterpane upon the forest overhead heavy bellied clouds were labouring in clumsy flight towards the west i knew creech would not have given up but 'twas foolish to remain longer in concealment and so very circumspectly i crept through the wood towards t'other face of the barn where i guessed calypso was tethered calypso was there sure enough but so was someone else and had it not been that i proceeded with such stealth he must have overheard the sounds of my progress creech knew me too well to suppose i would have left the roan to him and there he sat upon his haunches just afore me in the bracken with his eyes on the nag not a twig stirred as i approached and my steps fell noiselessly upon the grass for here the forest was more open and thus i came within spring of dan when drawing a pistol i suddenly walked out of the bushes with the most unconcerned air you can imagine creech turned sharply but the nozzle of my barker was at his forehead ah danny danny says i you would not rob a poor young fellow of his mare creech turned white with rage and swore horribly hush danny hush says i think on your immortal soul danny and forego wicked words also says i those ugly weapons being the instruments of an evil life dan said nothing but i meant to take his fangs out and so brought him to sharply with the pistol drop 'em says i briskly and with another furious oath creech threw his barkers to the ground after that i had gathered them up says i again very cheerful and now danny i says 'tis time for an innocent young fellow like me to be getting home to his mammie which being so with your kind help faith i will e'en venture to mount the nag me and my treasure and i slapped the box underneath my coat creech was livid and his eyes glared on me full of the devil but i kept him under with the pistol and drove him sullen up to calypso vaulting into the saddle i turned and took off my hat to him with a mocking tongue but in that instant whenas my back was towards him dan had skipped into the thicket and now i heard him scrambling through the bushes yelling and whistling as he went i was not afraid of him or his creatures but i did not design to be caught and so set calypso's heels to work but just as i did so there came up a clatter of hoofs from the yard near by and i knew that creech was upon my track calypso flew forward like a swallow and at the same moment the noise of a pistol spread echoes abroad and a bullet snipped a corner from my hat that was my signal to be gone come my girl says i and the roan leaping to the rowels sped down the narrow pathway in a gallop the track was as lean as a gutter and sloped very sharply the bushes too pressed hard upon it and 'twas not the least of my hazards to come down that descent at a breakneck speed but i knew well enough that the pursuit would be instant and that creech was in too black a rage to pick his footsteps so i kept the nag to her pace and on she rushed floundering from side to side swaying against the bushes and slithering over the smooth rocks i held her up with the reins and more than once saved her from coming down upon her prats and once she took me sudden under the overhanging bough of a tree which fell so low that the sight of it set me a blinking but or ever i was past my doubts we were through and the mare was clattering for the high road not until we reached this did i pull in and twist about in my saddle to inspect what was forward creech and his men were not yet forth of the wood but i could hear 'em pounding away down the path and guessed that they were none so far away but for that i cared not a groat for calypso was staunch and fleet and more than a match for any horse in the shires so pulling her round upon the belbury road i urged her into a gentle canter i reckon that they must ha' been amazed when they were come to the highway to see me no more than half a mile away and jogging along as easy and unconcerned as you please but that was in my device for i had no animosity against such a braggart fool as creech and as i have said i was tickled by a pretty touch of humour so on i cantered and creech and his two lads behind me very much excited as i conceive by the prospect of overtaking me that however was not my notion and no sooner were they drawn within shot than i put the spurs into calypso and forged out of range again this manoeuvre i repeated several times till their faces must ha' been yellow with chagrin if they had entertained but a grain of reason about 'em they might have seen as i was merely playing with 'em and maybe they did but creech had no stomach for defeat and being now a veritable cauldron of passions stuck as close to me as he might and thus we galloped the four of us at length into belbury here i dropped into a canter and coming to a halt afore a little inn in the main street i flung out of the saddle and opened the stable yard t'others were not yet round the corner and so tethering calypso to a stake in the wall immediately below a window in the upper floor i bade the ostler give her a bite where she stood and hurried into the hostelry i was now as you may conceive possessed of a roaring appetite and ordered breakfast forthwith to be served in the said upper room and no sooner was i got there and set comfortable upon a seat than the three horses came thundering down the road and drew up with a plunge before the doorway i laughed at that for i knew they were too drunken with rage to think straightly and i had half a mind to invite danny to breakfast sink me but the ninnies thought that they had nicked me for presently after up comes the innkeeper with the breakfast but bearing a message for me from three gentlemen below as saving my presence would be glad for to breakfast in my company lord how it set me laughing why says i if they be honest folk benjamin by all means they have ridden hard says he hesitating why so have i i answered and then but still with reluctance he was departing when i suddenly fetched him back has the coach been long gone says i for though 'twas early i knew the next stage was long 'tis gone half an hour says he that is well i thinks to myself and dismissing him with a nod i threw open the window and looked down into the yard there was calypso ready bridled and munching her oats beneath me that too contented me and i sat down and handled my knife it was a little time afore any feet ascended the stairs and then at last the handle turned and in tramped creech all alone with a look of triumph fastened on his ugly face it was clear they had had some parley outside and he was set to beard me i rose to my feet and making him a deep bow waved my fingers at a chair pray you sit down said i very ceremonious i takes it kindly of you danny to come for to cheer up an old friend like this 'tis poor fare to a nobleman such as you but suitable enough for a humble man like me creech scowled for he had not looked for me to talk in this fashion i warrant you're game is up my precious cully he said savagely and you'd best put a pleasant phiz on you and give in i glanced at the clock i think not danny i says softly there is some mistake sure there's ten more hours to run a pleasant little holiday for all three and by the way where are my friends ned and blake i don't see their handsome faces creech grinned in a sour way you'll make their acquaintance soon enough says he oh waiting outside eh says i bashful eh yes says creech showing his teeth just waiting outside on your convenience captain just awaiting for to help your honour into the saddle you overload me with favours danny says i going on with my breakfast undisturbed but creech's temper was too constrained to carry the jest further and he broke out harshly hark 'ee dick why the hell d'ye pull such a long face over the job what does this play acting do bah out with the casket and we'll split a bottle on it forthwith i put my hand under my coat and fetching out the casket set it on the table afore me upon that i placed the bag of guineas and atop of all a brace of pistols come and take 'em says i mimicking creech's own words to me come and take 'em danny here they are rip me danny where's your grit he swore abominably and made a step to me but slipping my fingers over a barker i cocked it dan drew back and gazed doubtfully at the door i knew what was passing in his mind and how he was meaning to set the other tykes on me but i said nothing merely replacing the baubles in my pocket this distracted creech again and he yelled give 'em up you young hell hound i laughed and at the laugh creech's temper snapped and he flung himself upon me he was no coward creech though mighty judicious out of his rage but his leap availed him little now for plump goes my pistol on his skull and down he comes to the floor i walked to the window good bye dan i said creech scrambling to his feet with his eyes agog made as though to follow me and then sprang at the door screaming to his men but i was already out of the window ere he had reached the stairs and dropping silently upon calypso cast her free another instant more and the gates of the yard opening calypso shot past the inn and gathering her knees under her belly was sweeping out of belbury at a gallop i was already a quarter of a mile away when glancing behind i saw them making a start for they were in no wise prepared for my diversion and were thrown into confusion thereby but now they came abreast for me at their hardest for all of which the roan held her own without any difficulty in this way the chase sped into the open plain beyond belbury creech clinging like a leech as i knew he would to the smell of the gold half way across the moor i stopped and listened there for sure was what i wanted right ahead of me and so clapping back my heels i galloped over the rise afore me and came down into the hollow where the coach was rumbling along like a blowsy bluebottle 'twas rolling and lurching and pitching like as if 'twas a cockle at sea and i soon overtook it and hailed the driver he looked at me suspiciously but reined in his horses and i pulled the mare across the window why says a piping voice that i recognised bless me here is our young gentleman again i gave the old mawkin a wink and glanced round the company there was hoity toity as plump and proud as you please leaning back against the cushions with her nose in the air your ladyship says i addressing her politely i trust that you have enjoyed your night's rest to the full i am in tolerable health says she shortly but eyeing me in some wonder life your ladyship says i very sententious is full of reverses best forgot and the most excellent intentions are fraught with the most woeful issues oh she broke in coldly if you are come to recount your failure your time is ill spent in truth i had not remembered your face till this good gentleman spoke and i had never a thought for your errand but if i was in any doubt about my business it was that ungracious speech disposed of it and saying no more i drew the casket from my pocket and bowing low to the saddle with a great air of ceremony passed it to her if i am remembered in your ladyship's sneers i says i beg it shall be along of those young gentlemen of blood you talk of but here i glanced along the road and there was the noise of hoofs coming over the hill and i pray said i turning again to her that you will now as always accept the accidents of fortune with better submission i saw that the fat merchant had been eager to speak for some time and now he jumped up and opened his mouth wide but i laughed and sweeping my hat to the saddle pulled off the mare and left 'em with the lady staring in an amaze at the casket on her knee drive on says i to the coachman and slapping the leaders with the flat of my sword as i passed i spurred calypso across their noses and out upon the furze grown common as i did so there was creech and blake clattering up on their blown nags crack goes the coachman's whip and the horses plunged forward but by that i was out of sight behind a clump of trees upon the heath where pausing i looked back the noise of a great commotion reached me and there as i guessed stood creech with t'others about the coach i reckon that the passengers would have short shrift with that angry party i watched 'em for a while with my sides a shaking for laughter and then put the nag to a trot across the common dan i vow must have been astonished but 'twas a pretty even division after all for i kept the goldfinches and creech resumed his jewels whereas hoity toity had the privilege to take a lesson in manners the turtle doves 'tis not the first face of a predicament that is always the right aspect and men may as often as not by holding their peace come at the heart of the matter always provided there is naught in the case to make the blood sing now in a pretty lively turn of life on the road i have met many types and some of these such characters as you would scarce credit but 'tis not always that they are conjoined thus in their odd individualities with a stirring episode and hence i pass them by in these accounts of my career nevertheless there was in the meeting with sir damon boll that which pleased me mightily at least in the end indeed 'twas a rare piece of chicanery from the outset what time i left the boar's head in a chaise and two horses of my own for epsom like any gentleman with an important journey of his own before him and so in truth i had for i was to set up for my lord if you please with a lackey and all but the affair though 'twas humorous beyond fancy enters not into this adventure it was enough that the thought tickled me on my road out of southwark going by camberwell and newington and i was in a fair good humour as we rocked along the ruts that sharp november evening when the postilion was come out by streatham and was for making across the heath the moon that was half and bright struck into the lowering clouds and the open waste glowed of a sudden swiftness the window of the chaise was open and the air streamed in but i could make out little with my peepers because of the blackness and here there was a savage rocking of the body of the chaise and a cracking as of a wheel against something so popped i forth my head and roared to the postilion cursing him for his clumsiness and he cursing back at the horses and between us there was a pretty commotion for here was a nobleman save me upon his travels with a damned dung fork of a rascal on whom he might let loose his tongue and be not questioned that was how i phrased it to myself being not as wroth as i seemed but indeed enjoying to feign it when withdrawing my head as we were got back again upon the track i espied a blacker shadow in the blackness about the heath it held my eye a moment for i knew it well enough to be the figure of a man and then it darted into nearer view and the light bettering at the same instant showed me a fellow with a hat askew on the back of his head a heavy pistol at the stand and deliver and a face under a dark mask at the chaise's edge hold says he loudly to the postilion and catches at the horse nearest the frightened fellow pulled in and says this night bat as boldly as you will and as cheerfully poking his barker through the window now my good sir pray do not dally but hand out forthwith dalliance my dear sir is the spirit of my lady's chamber not of snapping sharp winter nights like this disgorge my buck disgorge now you will conceive it was an odd situation for galloping dick to be thus waylaid and handled after the manner of his own craft though this was not the first occasion that it had happened but to that you will add this that there was that in his air as in his voice and in the very swagger of his challenge which showed me here was no ordinary tobyman so says i to myself silently gazing in his pistol what have we here and then aloud said i sirrah what do you in a lordly tone faith says he not lowering his pistol but speaking in a rollicking way be not my words plain brave knight or must i make 'em bark i require of you all that you have in the chaise barring what i will spare you out of charity your clothes and cock hat for the sake of shame oh said i in a hesitating way then are you a gentleman of the road rascal you honour me to put a name upon me said he with an inclination of his head for myself i should desire to go unnamed so as to escape the perils of the law i will tell you this i broke out in seeming indignation you shall be well hanged that's your destiny maybe said he carelessly as well be picked by crows on a gallows as in a ditch deliver my lord i ask your indulgence captain said i in another voice there is a packet i would fain keep pish i must have all or none he interposed yet i am in a mood to indulge you so be you give me your hand on paper that i took all off you this made me perpend for my wits are sharp and i began to guess that this was maybe by way of a wager and that the fool was rattling the dice on his life i will do that said i after a pause if you will let this document that is important to none but myself remain i have sixty guineas also hand 'em over says he in a jocose way his pistol was still at my head and i made search for my purse and gave it to him the which he pocketed without so much as examining it and for this warranty said he i have quill and paper whereat i knew that i was upon the right thought he put a hand into his pocket but being by now unsuspecting that he had any to deal with save a mild sheep he paid little heed to his earlier precautions and the next i had his pistol hand in my clutch he was taken aback at the first but struggled gamely though lord save us he was no match for me with a twist of the wrist his pistol fell to the road with a dull clank and presently i had the door of the chaise open and was gripping him in the darkness and now 'twas my barker that was against his forehead i was mistook said i as he came to a pause in his struggles and 'tis not the gallows will have you sure but this cold barrel o' mine and so say your prayers he uttered a little reckless laugh oh i will spare you them says he doubtless you're in haste to be on come said i off with that mask and i knocked it clean off his face with the pistol just as the moon emerged in her full whiteness 'twas a young man well formed and of a handsome bearing that stood before me and i saw that his features were disfigured by a cynical smile yet there was in that expression as i judged something impulsive and full hearted that took me i contemplated him you're no tobyman said i a tobyman would think shame to be took as i took you just now for answer he whistled and then good my man get forward with your job said he i have cast and lost why said i lowering my barker i know 'twas along of a wager this was done and so bungled he threw me a glance under the moon without offering to run how know you he asked i shrugged my shoulders rip me said i when a gentleman of the road takes the road save he be in liquor 'tis for a serious purpose and that's guineas he walks with a proper gait he's no come lightly but you i came to a pause you're wrong said he 'twas no wager oh well said i 'tis a pity that so fit a youth should go woo the triple beam and i find it in my heart to give you a chance what say you your story for your life he thought a moment agreed said he 'tis no harm and no good to no one if your ears itch you shall have it then 'tis sealed on that i replied and happened to look away a moment from him in the moonlight the heath emerged dimly and i descried near a patch of bushes a waiting figure so said i that is your game my master you bring confederates and accept of my terms to betray me damme but i will shoot ye both where ye stand or run now i was broke out very furious for it seemed to me that i saw the whole purpose of this ambush very clearly and i raised my pistol as i spoke what's that said he suddenly and stared at me and then away to where my eyes had gone but at that instant the waiting figure took to its heels and ran in a white light limping as it ran till it vanished swiftly into the darkness by the lord crookes said my tobyman so said i not now realising where i was but feeling cautiously ahead and who may crookes be that's such a white liver 'tis sir damon's servant said he and added 'tis in the tale and the bargain in that case said i let's have the tale and the bargain ere my mind shifts as it is apt to do of a cold november night he shrugged his shoulders you have the advantage and 'twill hurt nor harm none sir damon boll is uncle and guardian to a young lady who returns me my passion but he will none of the match being anxious to dispose of her to a certain lord this evening i besought him to acquiesce in our betrothal but he refused 'if it be money' said i ''tis not money' says he with his grin 'if it be place and position' said i again but again he interrupted me ''tis neither' says he 'ye're well enough man but who weds my niece must prove himself ye're a young gentleman of the town' says he 'when i was young we was wont to be more than that and by god young man' says he 'ye shall have her if ye rob a coach or carry stand and deliver to a chaise' 'what mean you' said i not knowing what he meant 'if so be' said he speaking more slowly 'you shall have spirit and temper enough to take all that is within a traveller's chaise this night you have my word you shall have my niece' well said i seeing he paused well here i am said he and laughed discordantly come 'tis a very proper and romantic comedy said i and why d'ye suppose he gives you this chance he shook his head i know not he said and why d'ye suppose this crookes sir damon's man if that be his name is hanging about he started i never thought of that said he well said i deliberately it means if i was you young cockerel i would think twice ere i put faith in sir damon boll he hath you in a cleft stick you mean he asked anxiously why are you not took in the act i replied took with a red hand and why runs that rogue back to his master he hath followed you damnation says he starting and looks at me upon my heart i said ye're a pretty fellow to take to the roads with no more prudence or care about you than a sucking dove if i mistake not down flies this crookes with news of your discomfiture as he would also have been witness to your success and presently maybe up comes sir damon to gloat upon you oh i have a fondness for such deep ripe rascals stap me i have he stood moodily fiddling with his fingers a frown on his brow well said he at last inquiringly and smiling defiant well said i i think i will have a look at this sir damon and gads me if there be not the sound of a vehicle would ye like another fling at the high toby he looked at me in wonder and i winked should this be sir damon he whistled now damme he cried briskly ye're the gamest cock that ever crowed out of whitehall well let's go to meet him and seek what we shall find i said for i did not want that the arriving carriage should come up with mine and so bestowing an order on my wondering fellow we walked back briskly upon the london road the night was still relieved by the pale moon that shone through the naked oaks behind us and we could perceive the huddle of a chaise separating out of the darkness a score or two of yards away 'tis his livery says my friend 'tis his coach for sure well may i perish but he runs a hazard this night does this said sir damon i said with a laugh and i took him by the arm look you says i you were but a bantam with a bantam's voice yonder you shrilled too high damme for your spurs if you would venture another main take heed to one that knows and keep your eyes straight as straight as your weapon with level hands and eyes rot me i would be afraid of nothing under heaven save stalking ghosts and ill willing witches set on man if so you have a mind and i'll wager you will go through with the adventure gad says he with his laugh i will pluck him bare for his pains and enjoy it i am your debtor sir for this night's topsy turvy just then the chaise rocked into the faint light before us that stood in the darkness of the trees and he made a step forward halted as if in doubt and then dashed at it shouting in a loud voice to the postilion but i lay close in my earth like an old fox watching of 'em well the chaise was at a stand still and there was a hubbub as you may fancy for the old gentleman was come out to see a highwayman took and not to be rumpadded himself but he was of a stout spirit and though there was my young gentleman at the window with his barker and his mask that he had refitted on him i could descry a white head poked forth and a voice exchanging words sharply deliver says my man deliver i will see thee damned first says the spirited old bubblyjock i regret the necessity says my man presently but his barker drew nearer i will have this place scoured for you said the old boy if you make more ado says my man amiably i shall be in the sad case of dabbling white hairs red with that seeming to recognise the folly of resistance sir damon sank back in his seat what is't you want he asked in another voice 'tis very simple says t'other merely all that is in your chaise with you save what clothes you sit in and now that the man's head no longer blocked the window he pressed closer in and at the same instant uttered an exclamation of surprise and so i daresay did sir damon also for he must have recognised by that saying with whom he had to deal the which must have astonished him who came forth to see the young buck laid by the heels but he gave vent to no sound just then and 'twas my young gentleman of the toby who spoke i will be content with nothing short of all that is with you sir said he in a gay voice as of one well content with himself and destiny and first your purse well he must have got that for says he next now your jewel case and that too came out of the window in the ghost of a hand that was like a woman's for slenderness ye're prompt in payment my dear sir continues my friend for the which i thank ye as an exacting creditor but you have still something by you then comes in sir damon's voice quite still and cool now you have all sir you have all my word spells my honour unless indeed you have changed your courteous intention about my clothes nay i leave none bare says he in particular to those wild winds but i see you have company and fair company too at the which as you may guess i pricked up my ears and moved forward a step out of the darkness well sir says sir damon from the coach sharply would you rob the lady also no says he with a laugh only of your company i trust i am a gallant tobyman if even upon compulsion in truth i have no real liking for the business but was driven to it of necessity yet while i am in it i must e'en make what i can out of it and since i must take all that is in the chaise save yourself my good sir i will make bold with the lady if she will forgive me hearing that i could have slapped my thigh in my delight at his wit and quickness for i began at once to see how matters stood here was sir damon driving forth with his ward and niece maybe with the intent that she should publicly witness with her own eyes the wretched plight and humiliation of her lover and now that lover appears to discomfit her guardian and wrest her triumphantly from his arms it was an excellent fine ploy and tickled me much for damme 'twas after my own heart but when he had spoken sir damon answers nothing for a time and then seeing i suppose that he was beaten all round he says very well says he i am as i have assured you my good scoundrel a man of my word and honour so what i have said i have said you have now your wages and shall have your reward though i confess i had not anticipated it but to morrow 'tis my turn for i too have an unexpected card in the game and so when the lady is safely alighted in this balmy air and on this cosy heath at your disposal i shall be obliged if you will order my man to drive on so that i may finish this somewhat benighted journey in peace this was you will admit a dignified surrender and i could not but see that he was really at the advantage for though the lad had won his wages and his bride he was at the mercy of this man as hard as satan maybe or as grim as death and he would go hang on the beam for this night's work if so be sir damon desired it and this you may conceive was not a pleasant plight for the young fellow but bless you he had no fears he had won his bet and he had handed forth his sweetheart and was i doubt not all in a flurry of passion for the meeting bah this love turns men dizzy it steals their wits more wildly than wine let be 'tis well enough in a way but rip me if i would be so rankly stirred the old cock had the advantage and knew it he gazed out at the silly pair from his window with hard eyes and expressionless face and shouted a command to his man at which the chaise turned and began to move slowly towards london again at that instant seeing how awkward a face things wore and being of a mind to see the stir through to the end a notion flashed in my head and i came forward to the couple miss i could not see for she was in wraps and she might have been a scullion wench for all i could tell but says i to him see you take my coach and drive on to the nag by carshalton and there await me i will deal with this lord chief justice myself and leaving 'em with no more words i ran after the departing chaise as fast as maybe when i had reached it i rapped on the window and out pops the old gentleman's white head once more another of you says he this place grows 'em like brambles and would have discharged a pistol full in my face hold said i 'tis your assistance i want sir i believe you have been rumpadded by a tobyman just now well i am in a like case and was bound whilst he took you but now he is gone off with my chaise and i beg you will join us in pursuit sure sir seeing nothing on his face but its pale mask we be enough armed as we are to overtake and bring him to account especially that he hath with him now as it seems some go lightly but i cannot without my coach o'ertake them he seemed to consider a little scrutinising me well said he at last you seem a likely man in emergencies if you are armed as you say and have the resolution i do not know but the plan will fit in with my own i had another design but maybe both are admirable and at least they will not conflict so without more ado he invited me into the chaise and then conceive me sitting in miss's place the horse's heads turned again for the south and sir damon and dick ryder chatting agreeably and affably together as they had been sworn friends or long acquaintances at least 'twas i that chatted and he was mostly silent in an amicable enough way interjecting a question or commenting with satiric humour what time we lurched along towards ewell and epsom but now you will have an inkling of my design when i say that if this old fox was permitted to return straightway to town he would no doubt set the officers on his enemy and have him forthwith lodged in the jug maybe thought i to myself with a little trickery and a little persuasion of my own kind that could be prevented and the boy have a run for his life at the least so that was why we were jogging along the epsom road through a dark and miry night on the track as he thought of the runaways presently interrupting a tale of mine about jeremy starbottle says he bluffly we seem no nearer sir it would look as if your horses were superior to mine why said i in answer 'tis odds they'll keep this road for the sideways are foul and lead nowhither moreover they will not expect to be pursued we shall fetch 'em presently very well says he lying back but i beg you will give me a little leave i was shortened of my nap this afternoon now this was a plain hint as you see for me to hold my tongue but i took no offence for there was no occasion sir said i i am mum i do not overstay my welcome and i too lay back for some time we proceeded in silence but presently the chaise jogging more than usual he sat up it seems to me said he that we are upon a wild goose chase we shall not catch him in this wilderness oh said i he cannot be so far in advance not he with my nags i'll warrant he looked at me doubtfully in the small light very well he said at last shortly we will try a little longer and he peered out upon the night if so be he might determine where we were i looked out also and now we were passing through carshalton where i had bid the doves assemble for to meet me but damme my business was not yet done and the coach rolls creaking out of carshalton and on the way to epsom this seemed to stir the old gentleman again to perplexity for again he directed a look out of the window and then another at me i felt his gaze wander over me from top to boot as if he measured me you have fought abroad says he at last not i says i and added to that there's too many that babble about these foreign wars deliver us a good english war is more to my taste and better fighting too says i ah says he still coolly inspecting me as if he cared not whether i saw him or not then you will have fought in his majesty's intestine wars said he what's that said i turning on him no doubt said he suavely you have fought sir for his majesty king james against the unfortunate duke of monmouth who gave you leave to suppose i have fought at all said i sharply being irked by his persistence i am no fighting man but one of peace oh says he but i took you for a soldier and a captain at arms at least and indeed i believe you would have furnished material for a good soldier he surveyed me meditatively yes i'll promise that good material sir sound fighting stock and no splitting straws or scruples damme said i bluntly what d'ye mean he sank back in his seat i mean no offence said he but i think as 'tis shrewd to night i will e'en turn about for home nay said i masterfully you must not do that since we are come so far let us finish the adventure sir and not leave hold of it 'twould never do we will be catching of 'em by the heels presently he pursed his lips together as if he whistled under his breath and there was a pause while the noise of the chaise drowned all sound about us but my senses are not sharp for nothing and next i was aware of a glint of light upon steel for the moon as we rocked swayed in at the window and i guessed that he was bringing his pistol from under his cloak i pulled forth mine abruptly yes says i 'tis as well to be prepared sir i am glad you are so forward we may have a fall to when we encounter but i'll warrant ye're as good with your barker as i with mine i hope so said he without betraying any feeling i do earnestly hope so even sir to be a little better would be to my taste as you say we may come to an encounter soon and 'tis as well to be prepared now the old buck puzzled me and i perpended if he had any suspicion that this was not a genuine pursuit and i was other than i had feigned to be why sat he there silent and cool but if he had no scent of danger what was the significance of his words which did smell to me of the ironic it angered me to be so baffled by him and his quiet features but i did not well see what i might do or say just then and so kept silence like himself and indeed 'twas he broke it we must be drawing nigh ewell so far as i may guess he said would you be good enough to tell me what course you propose when we reach ewell if i might without impropriety make a humble suggestion i would advise that we ate some supper and lay there comfortably for the night to resume this interesting journey doubtless on the morrow or perhaps the next day with that i saw at once how it was and i gave vent to a little laugh why you shall do as you please sir said i and that plan will serve me admirably ah says he looking at me then maybe there is something amiss with it suppose we come to an understanding i think you are too young and i am too old to want to die by violence we both have a taste for life i take it where stand we then we are pursuing a gentleman of the road pardon me said i interrupting for the time was come now to disclose myself and i looked to be mightily tickled by the disclosure no longer pursuing but maybe even pursued pursued he asked doubtfully well at least we are some miles ahead of the turtle doves that are cooing maybe somewhere safe and sound behind us his eyes never changed only the thin lips moved a little ah says he the turtle doves i had some notion but who then are you my dear sir i am but a philosophic observer said i airily 'tis my business to look on and smile i take no part in the rough acts of fortune pardon me said he suavely but i think you are too modest captain captain said i sharply well well i had forgot you were no soldier you have the air of a soldier and the makings as i have remarked but sir let me tell you you are too modest this journey for example oh that was my whim said i i interposed out of a benevolent heart for to serve two young folks fond of billing and to make an illustrious acquaintance for myself he bowed in his corner i trust you will not make a more illustrious acquaintance still he said dryly why said i for i knew what he meant you forget that at your invitation i am here in pursuit of our common enemy true he said considering it has a smooth face upon it i perceive you sir to be a gentleman of your wits now 'twas my turn to bow and indeed he was not wrong for it has ever been my good fortune to find a way out of a difficulty when others would stand agape like oafs and asses but he went on in his still voice but now that i see our friend the common enemy as you put it enjoyed a confederate it appears i must reconsider the circumstances in fine his wager fails i am no confederate i broke in and thus there is no necessity that he receive the penalty which i had designed as a wedding present for him he finished not appearing to heed me sir damon i have told you that i am but an onlooker said i he elevated his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders rip me said i angrily i never clapped eyes on the fellow till the quarter of an hour ere you came up and i will be damned if i should tick him off from adam did i see him again you perceive that you are rehabilitating the penalty he remarked dryly and i could see he did not credit me which made me angrier by the lord said i i have the honour to tell ye that the young muckworm rumpadded me in my chaise just as you were come up damme he did if it were not that i turned his barkers on him sir damon eyed me and then all of a sudden broke out into soft laughter as if he were greatly tickled is't so said he the lord love him for a simpleton faith i could forgive he chuckled quietly and then looked at me again still smiling you know sir what penalty menaces them that abduct or hold a ward from her guardian 'tis a guardian i have abducted from his ward said i he laughed quietly very well said he let us leave it at that and then you know sir what a fool the fool is he is no tobyman said i 'tis commensurate with his life in general said sir damon easily he is born tom fool and has two handsome dancing eyes he paused i will not maintain says he next that for happiness wisdom is necessary or even adequate i have not found it so myself nor perhaps you friend captain in that case says i repay a fool with his folly which is marriage then we are agreed said he genially i too am a bachelor and now that we are agreed on one thing captain mr he hesitated ryder said i mr ryder said he let us be agreed all along the line if i forego the penalty i will treat your worship to as damnable a fine supper and bottle as was ever served in england i interrupted and we will drink to the turtles at carshalton carshalton he says reflectively i had an idea 'twas carshalton but your pistol was persuasive well sir said i here is ewell and in a tavern that i know we shall be hospitably received and used this foul night good says he preparing to alight as the chaise came to a stop and pray bear in mind mr ryder that i am penniless and homeless damme said i heartily ye're welcome to all that's mine and that's not beggary and damme while i can keep such company i envy not the turtle with his mate at carshalton he was now in the road and he turned nor i ryder nor i he said pleasantly my lady's ring as i wheeled the mare out of the gateway into the gloom of the night the lighted windows of the inn winked on me with yellow eyes a cold sleet was falling very piercing to the flesh and i rolled my collar higher about my neck it came upon me then that i was a fool to leave that warm and comfortable tavern on such a savage night but 'twas christmas eve and seven of the clock and i was for bristol on the following day where was a doxy that i knew as pretty a parcel as ever i did see saving polly scarlet and she was in london the landlord had joined me in a bottle well laced with brandy and being of a lively and generous disposition had furnished another himself 'twas a lonely inn that stood on the border of the moor and says he that he was mightily gratified to be in company so 'twas with a full belly and a merry heart that i turned into the welter of the night 'twas rarely cold and i whistled as i went though the breath of my nostrils went up like reek now i was in the mind being amply loaded and light spirited to be amiable with the devil himself if so be he should come that way though 'twas for sure not the night for him certainly i was not thinking of rumpadding any mortal man but would have taken him to my bosom for a fellow traveller for 'tis a vulgar error to suppose that gentlemen of the road are for ever with an eye to goldfinches money is muck for us as often as not at least to such of us as maintain a proper dignity but as for dan creech and his lousy pack or that much boasted jeremy starbottle why they are no better than common cutpurses or tally thieves no to ride the high toby has its obligations as well as its privileges and on that christmas eve damme the whole world and his wife might have gone secure for me well in this humour despite of the night i rode on sometimes at a jog but mostly at a walk for the snow was heavier as i reached the moor upon the stretch of broken land it lay uneven for i suppose 'twas caught by the rough winds on that upland heath and blown into the hollows and upon the furze and thorn but the continuous spread of whiteness had absorbed the road and calypso had to feel her way mighty patiently 'twas thus we arrived at the cross roads near the middle of the moor where the ways divide 'twixt bollingham and messiter and reining in on the impulse to make sure of my path i perceived even through the blackness another figure on horseback under the sign post is't anyone says a voice pretty clear ay says i 'tis a traveller is there a village near by says he out of the dark within three miles two upon either road said i i am bound for bath says he and have met with a mishap this cursed night and began to deliver oaths as they had been sword thrusts in a duello now i can tolerate a man that has been put to sore discomfort and is enraged and as for a few mouth filling oaths why they are neither here nor there but there was something in the way of his voice manner and address that grated on me and so i answered him pretty coolly well you can take your choice of roads with an easy heart i said look ye here says he after a moment from what i catch of you through your voice my man you should be a sturdy fellow what think you of carrying a message for help to the village for a guinea piece 'twill serve you with good wine mulled ale or a doxy i'll warrant that maddened me for all my good humour to be taken for granted as a common fetch and carry and to be so addressed like a footboy by his grace i heard insolence and overbearing in his accent and i would have sworn patronage and contempt was in his face be damned says i angrily i am no lackey find your own village says i at that he uttered an oath you are impudent said he and moved his horse nearer as though he would take action but lord i was awaiting him and this muckworm would have eaten snow in two minutes had he so ventured but prudence came to him so he hesitated ye're the sort of man that is the better of the whip and the pillory says he rogue were it not for the darkness i would beat you for your insolence damme what's amiss with the darkness said i for sure i can well make out your ugly body against the snow 'tis a monstrous unsightly blackness against so much innocent whiteness he cursed me and then dug his rowels into his nag so deeply that the poor beast started and reared but that was enough for me for i hate to see a creature that is so kindly in its services so mishandled and so says i driving at him rip me you muckworm i'll give you that which will recall this moor to you deliver damn ye says i or i'll make you food for maggots and i had the barker at his head ere he knew what had happened well he made much ado but 'twas of no avail for i had the mastery from the outset and he was perforce obliged to plumb his pockets the which yielded but a score of guineas and a ring or so but that was of no consequence to me for i had no care for his money merely for his discomfiture along of his arrogance as i left him foully imprecating i threw a laughing word at him messiter says i lies on the left and bollingham to the right turn round three times my cock and choose which you will whereat i rode laughing into the darkness yet ere i did so i saw him savagely wheel into the messiter road cutting viciously at his horse as for me i rode on singing cheerfully enough for the encounter had warmed my blood and i no longer felt the cold so greatly but i had not got farther than a mile from the cross roads when i was aware in the pause of my singing of a sound near by of a voice that called on the unquiet air very faint and melancholy i reined in and listened and presently the cry came to me again from the right and so jumping off the mare i left her in the road standing obedient as she was used to do and walked gingerly in that direction i did not trust myself in that profound darkness and the treacherous snow and sure enough i was right to be careful for in a little i was plunged up to my waist in a hollow where are you i called aloud and the voice so clearly now a woman's came back i made my way to it with difficulty and soon solved the riddle here was a chaise wandered out of the road and buried in a deep drift and by the body of the carriage a poor lady in the direst state of distress and terror why madam said i are ye alone at which she broke out that her husband was gone for help as was the postilion but in different directions and that they had took the horses and that she poor delicate creature was thus solitary on a naked and solitary moor with never even a wild fowl to scream with her for company oh says i we will soon mend that madam or call me catchpole and i took hold of her ye're in a drift mistress i said i'll give ye company if ye will have it until your husband shall return and then all of a sudden it flashed upon me that her husband was he who had abused me so grossly and whom i had rumpadded phew says i to myself why here's a pretty comedy but the lady was all that occupied my thoughts just then and so i conducted her to the road and encouraged her into talk as i did so for she was in a terrible fluster what with the loneliness and the cold and the darkness now says i what you need madam is a posset of hot brandy and a warm and virtuous couch i says and with the help of my good nag here 'tis what you'll have oh sir you are very good says she tremulously you are good beyond christian seeming that tickled me pleasantly as you may think and i was the more disposed to take charge of this poor creature thus left to starve of the perishing winds of heaven it rains not clemency from december skies in this brisk isle of england so says i in a cheering voice i'll warrant you shall toast your toes and warm your stomach with victuals within the better part of an hour faith pin your hopes on me mistress and you shall not be disappointed tis not the first time dick ryder has comforted and succoured the fair there's dick's luck madam she smiled in a weak way but began to take some confidence as i could see from the new note in her voice is it far sir to shelter she asked and i told her there was an inn some two miles distant at which she plucked up her heart once more not knowing bless her folly that two miles on that wild moor and with that drift of snow was no matter for spoon fed babes but as chance had it she made the discovery pretty quickly and that through no fault or neglect of mine for i put her upon calypso as gentle a mare when needs be as ever was straddled and sure enough she was straddled now for my lady could keep no seat otherwise and so says i to her if she would play the man for the nonce we should maybe be the sooner out of our troubles 'twas then for the first time that i saw there was good blood and spirit to her for instead of crying out in protest that she could not or she would not or that she dared not says she oh think you so and over she cocks her foot with the best grace in the world and a charming genuflexion to boot i fear i trouble you greatly says she but lord with such an one duchess or doxy dame or dirty face i would have gone to the farthest verge of trouble and made no odds of it 'tis spirit that ever has appealed to me well we were no sooner astir calypso pegging slowly along with me at her mouthpiece than there comes over us a flurry of snow driving full and hard in our faces the which blinded me for the time but when i recovered the mare was gone from the road and had took a step into a hollow she staggered and plump goes the lady over her head into the drift i hauled her forth breathless as she was and all she cried out when the wind was in her again was i fear i did not hold to her properly i fear i am a bungler bless your heart no says i it would have took a king's regiment to have sat that fall you do mighty well said i and i'd wring his nose that said no to that with which i assisted her once more into the saddle what with the drift and the darkness and the squalls of snow it was an hour and more before we reached the inn which lay on the road to bollingham arrived here i rapped out the landlord who was surprised to see me returned not but what you are wise says he but when he saw the lady and heard my tale he was being a decent kindly fellow all of a bustle madam was all a wet from her sojourn in the snow to say nothing of her tumble and so she was set afore a great fire in the ingle to dry herself which she did with sincere appreciation the while the host prepared supper she sat there her hands extended drawing in deep breaths of comfort from the grateful blaze and i watched her twas the first i had seen of her face which was of a delicate beauty pink from the whipping wind and crowned with disordered hair i judged she was of a quality deemed proper in courts and she was young withal presently says she looking round at me with bright soft eyes do you think said she that my husband has reached safety why yes said i for though he be not here he may have taken the other road and be at messiter the which i knew it was likely he had done oh said she as if thinking and said no more but nearby after that supper was served and madam was set to take in company with your faithful servant by your leave not but what i have not often supped with the quality ay and made merry with them too man and woman and of all ages for we are served in our calling with strange accidents yet i will confess that to be seated there at table with her tickled me handsomely and i fell to with a will but the lady showed little appetite and had an anxious look and thought i that she was troubled for her husband but i soon made out that she was not so concerned for said i to stimulate her maybe he is supping like us in a cosy room at messiter oh said she and i saw her mind had come back from another quarter he is like to sup and be comfortable wherever he is he will emerge scatheless and there was that in her tone which was all but a sneer oh well damn the husband says i to myself i take no interest in him and i gave my attention to the lady the glow had now receded from her face leaving it pale according to what i took to be its true habit and she answered in a pleasant and engaging way with an emphasis of her gratitude for my assistance but this i pooh poohed in curt terms for i was more than repaid for my trouble by the figure she cut over against the board and the honour she did me and i was in the midst of rebuffing her thanks for the third time when the door opened from the flagged passage and a man entered he was followed by the innkeeper suave and bowing and the first thing was that madam says in an even pleasant voice so you are behind us after all charles at that i studied him the closer for it must be her husband and perhaps he that had put an affront on me and i knew for certain who he was when he spoke it seems so said he scowling at me and then why did you not wait i found you gone from the chaise it was so cold i was chilled to death she answered and this gentleman happened upon me and was so good as to offer me his services for a rescue he turned a glowering arrogant eye on me but said nothing at the moment save a demand to the innkeeper to fetch mulled wine now 'twas clear he was in ignorance of my identity and so i was emboldened to make trial of him maybe you will say with some rashness but i have ever found the boldest course is the wisest perhaps sir said i you will honour me with a share of this bottle in the meanwhile he hesitated and then lowered his eyes i thank you no sir he returned briefly and sat down to the fire to wait his ungraciousness nettled me all the more that he thus deranged the comfort of his own lady who was manifestly put about by his incivility seeing that he knew not i had rumpadded him he might have thrown thanks at me for her care even if 'twere only as you may throw coins at a beggar but not he he sat and frowned and then looked up at her the next time i pray you will have faith and patience to remain where you are set my lady says he curtly why husband she began but i broke in for i was infuriate with his grossness of manner look you sir said i would you have a tender lady bare to the snow and sour winds to await your convenience sink me i should be glad to think she was warming of her ankles what fate soever came to mine your opinion said he pompously and looking at me inquisitively is naturally of weight sir he was a full faced big nosed man with small eyes and a hard mouth but was manifestly of some dignity from his dress and style sir charles says she with a little pride in her voice you forget my plight i should have perished but for this good gentleman humph says this pig puffing out his nostrils and leaned over the fire to warm himself but cast narrow glances at me but here comes in mine host with the wine and sir charles if that was his name sits to the table and takes a draught which served to loosen his tongue these roads says he do no credit to your country my man sir they are such as we must endure says the innkeeper they are a disgrace to any country says he they are the haunt of thieves and cut throats he says and thumped on the table why i've heard of none your honour says the fellow i tell you sir he went on that no more than a mile or so from here i was stopped by a ruffian and robbed yes robbed sir and you boast of your secure roads i am a justice and will see to it when i reach london lord sir you say not so said the innkeeper and the lady called out in surprise robbed charles why what is this stopped and robbed says the man with emphasis on his words and looking from one to another of us stopped and robbed by a dastard with pistols and swords when i had been looking for a friendly voice in the night and the snow rings guineas and all he says addressing his wife i have my purse says she fumbling in her bodice with nervous fingers i will bring down the law on this wretched place he declared formidably ignoring her i will see that his majesty's processes do clean these parts of the gentry and of all who harbour them he added with suspicious beady eyes on the innkeeper nay sir there is no house on this road but what is honest says he hastily why says sir charles as importantly as if he were examining a prisoner this fellow must have come from here and no doubt was in waiting for me you cannot deny it there was none such here sir all the day says the landlord humbly there was none but honest folk ah but how mark you the difference he asked triumphantly i ask you how do you discriminate does a man wear his virtue on his nose and at that looking at his blobbed nose i chuckled to myself for i minded in no way that he was thus cross questioning the taverner lord i would not have cared two sucking straws for such as he so i broke in there is some that has an honest look said i and there's some that wants it that is so said the lady 'twere easy to tell the difference you are very confident said he sourly and maybe then you could read the faces in this room madam she glanced about her with a flush at his rudeness i think there is no question of this room she answered he said nothing but shot a glance at me and then took a draught of wine and how was it this kind gentleman happened upon you betty he asked sir 'twas a delicate voice as of a lamb bleating in the cold darkness that i heard and went for to rescue i answered him coolly oh he says and looked at the table as if thinking and whence came you he asked bluntly now it entered into my mind then for the first time that he had conceived a suspicion of me it was true that his bearing might be part of his customary gross conduct but 'twas possible that his questions were pursuing some point and so as the landlord was gone from the room i said indifferently i am from bristol and go south for taunton ho he said then you came along the road after me very like i said with the same indifference i know not which way you came as the chaise was buried deep in the drift that brings to my memory said he rising a neglected duty the postilion must take aid to rescue the carriage and he marched to the door with his heavy gait and determined mien when he was gone i looked across at the lady but she avoided my eye embarrassed i made no doubt by her husband's arrogant behaviour and now i recalled that 'twas high time for me to be on my way after this interlude and i put my hand into my pocket to bring forth a coin wherewith to discharge my reckoning and i pulled out a handful of guineas as i was picking out one i heard an exclamation and raising my eyes perceived that the lady was staring in astonishment at my hand where got you that she asked in an excitement pointing with her hand where got you that ring and then to my chagrin i saw that i had pulled out some of the jewellery i had took from sir charles that says i thinking to gain time why that the ring i gave my husband she almost whispered across the table and her eyes met mine in them suddenly arose a light of understanding and of something else commingled damme i am not ashamed to ply the high toby but there is some matters that do not concern women and which they do not understand she turned of a red glow to her neck what you she murmured faintly it was you and i like a fool had never a word but sat glum and still staring at her to look at her it would have seemed that she it was that had took the ring and been discovered oh why did you that she asked in her low voice was it that you were in need faith no said i with a laugh and never attempting to deny there's a plenty of king's pictures to my pockets but if ye will have it 'twas his voice annoyed me i thought 'twas any man's duty and right to take toll of such complacency she eyed me sadly as i hate to be eyed i can endure the devil's own temper and a scold's tongue for i have my own cure for them but tears and shining eyes and melancholy looks i cannot abide 'em so says i gruffly ye are welcome to them back i have no use for them maybe 'twill teach him a lesson in manners and that will serve whereat i turned the contents of my pocket upon the table and thrust them towards her she sat looking at the gold and the jewels for some moments in silence while i looked at her she was i'll warrant a pious good woman and though such are not generally to my taste i can appreciate ripe goodness and beauty and it irked me to think of her being bound with such a surly and unmannerly boar but presently with a start she put out her hands and began to collect the pieces with fever in her haste glancing fearfully at the door and no sooner had she disposed of them than in stalks my portentous friend with an ugly look on his phiz you come from bristol sir says he in a loud voice and maybe can explain why you set forth for taunton from this very house two hours agone by the bristol road i gave him a steady stare for it was plain to me now how he had come by his information and that he had been questioning the innkeeper about me it mattered not a rap to me for he could prove nothing against me and even if he had i would have kissed the beam if i could not have settled with that hulking dung fork so said i equably why the devil should i explain to you well to the justices if you like it better said he with an angry snort i had a notion that i recognised that voice and now i know it for certain you are the thief that made me deliver in the snow on the heath you have stolen my guineas and my jewels now he had no witnesses against me and it would have been the easiest thing in the world to have deceived him and played him off and got him into a tangle of fact and evidence and imaginings but bless me ere i could get fairly started upon the sally the poor lady darts in and shoves the fat in the fire oh charles she cried trepidantly going towards him this gentleman has preserved my life i pray you forget not that 'tis christmas eve says she 'tis the eve of our lord's birth and should teach us mercy sir charles she says poor thing a bleating as you hope for christ's compassion for yourself visit not this short coming on one that has shown himself so full of tenderness and pity the devil thinks i to myself pulling a lugubrious face she plays king's prosecutor to me what's to do stand aside says he to her sharply and glowering on me but i looked him in the phiz with a smile i was not incommoded by this silly business not i you make no denial said he restraining himself with an effort as i could see you are a ruffianly gallows bird you shall hang oh charles pleaded the poor lady in despair he has made restitution here's all that was yours rings guineas and all spare him i implore you for his kindness and consideration to me he showed me nice consideration said he with a sneer for he was now confident and a swagger we will dispose of him with as gentle a consideration madam and at that he moved to the door i doubt not to summon the landlord but i stepped in his way for i was tired of his mustard looks and arrogance rot me said i you mistake my kidney if 'tis a gentleman of the road you have to deal with you have yet to learn his quality he drew himself up while the lady looked at me breathless he was a vastly bigger man than i but i drew my toasting fork madam said i to the lady you have a great heart but it breaks itself too readily i would not have that ample heart for half the kingdom i'll warrant it troubles you here you be fretting yourself over this poor carcase which is worth no tears nor tremors and moreover can look after itself and i will swear you waste your blood and tissue on this same hulk that i must spit damn him sir says i to the man if ye will stand aside i will learn you to toast or roast as you will your toes and midriff afore this fire but if ye will not you shall taste the sawdust under the table for i have an appointment in bristol and i wait no man's pleasure you threaten me says he haughtily and pulled out his sword oh no says i 'tis but a plain statement will ye go by or go down choose ye for answer he came at me for the man was no coward and did not lack spirit and we were presently engaged in the discharge of thrusts he plied his blade not unskilfully but lord i have learned in a rough school and 'twas not long ere i was under the cully's guard and took him in the ribs he collapsed like a log and the lady uttered a scream and flying to him bent over him i dropped my point faith my lady said i 'tis no more than letting of some of that superfluous blood that animates him 'twill fetch down his proud stomach the which he needs let him bleed 'twill serve your turn also sir says she remembering me even in her trouble and confusion you were best to go fly fly 'twas not your fault he attacked you fly dear heart there was none in those parts and on that night that might aspire to stop or catch dick ryder but she knew not that the innocent i bowed to her give ye good cheer madam said i maybe i have served you better than ye think first with the cold night and second with the eclipse of this hot blood she threw me a wistful wondering and pitiful glance and then a groan drew her attention to her husband and she stooped over him tenderly at that i swung out of the door and sought my horse and as i mounted calypso says i to the innkeeper who attended me all unconscious i have stuck a point in that muckworm's shoulder says i and ye had better relieve the lady's fears but says i as i rode off if i had stuck it in his gizzard as i had a mind to do 'twould have served her better and with that i plunged into the wind and snow of the night gallows gate 'twas two o'clock of a bright mild march day that i cleared st leonard's forest and came out upon the roads at the back of horsham i was for london but chose that way by reason of a better security it promised which as it chanced was a significant piece of irony horsham a mighty quiet pretty town lay in a blaze of the sun enduring the sallies of a dusty wind and feeling hot and athirst after my long ride i pulled up at an inn and dismounted host says i when i was come in a pint of your best burgundy or canary to wash this dust adown and rip me if i will not have it laced with brandy why sir says he a cold bright day for horseback and shakes his head damme you're right says i cold i' the belly and hot in the groin here's luck to the house man and i tossed off the gallipot though the brandy barely saved exceeding thin swipes that he had the impudence to pass for wine why goodman ye'll make your fortune on this i said with a laugh and flung open the door to go out when all of a sudden i came to a silence and a pause 'tis the officers says the landlord who was at my ear gadslife 'tis the sheriff's men from lewes lewes says i slowly what be they here for why says he in a flutter there was him that was taken for a tobyman by guildford he was tried at lewes and will hang if he be fool enough to be taken let him be hanged and be damned says i carelessly when i was got upon my horse i began to go at a walk down the high street for though as was according to nature i was inquisitive about the matter i was too wary to adventure ere i was sure of my ground and this denial of unnecessary hazards as is my custom saved me from a mishap for as the procession wound along the traps and the carriage between 'em there was one of them that turned his head aside to give an order and rip me if 'twas not that muckworm traitor and canter the thief taker timothy grubbe i had an old score with timothy the which i had sworn to pay but that was not the time nor the opportunity and so i pulled in and lowered my head lest by chance his evil eye might go my way as i did so something struck on the mare's rump and looking back i saw a young man a horseback that had emerged from a side street whoa there says i cheerfully are you so blinded by march dust as not to see a gentleman when he goes by he was a slight handsome looking youth of a frank face but of a rustic appearance and he stammered out an apology why i did but jest i said heartily think no more on't particularly as 'twas my fault to have checked the mare of a sudden but to say the truth i was gaping at the grand folks yonder he stared after the traps and says he in an interested voice who be they is it my lord blackdown now this comparison of that wry necked pock faced villain grubbe to a person of quality tickled me but i answered keeping a straight face well not exactly says i not my lord but another that should stand or hang as high maybe and shall some day oh says he gazing at me a friend of yours sir he was of a ruddy colour and his mouth was habitually a little open giving him an expression of perpetual wonder and innocence so that bless you i knew him at once for what he was at heart a simple fellow of a natural kindliness and one of no experience in the world and a pretty dull wit not as you might call him a friend said i gravely but rather one that has put an affront upon me you should wipe it out sir says this innocent seriously i would allow no man to put an affront on me gad i would not why said i dryly i bide my time being if i may say so of less mustard and pepper than yourself nevertheless it shall be wiped out to the last stain gad i like that spirit says he briskly and as if it constituted a bond betwixt us he began to amble slowly at my side if there is any mischief sir says he i trust you will allow me to stand your friend here was innocence indeed yet i could have clapped him on the back for a brick of good fellowship and friendliness and relaxing my tone i turned the talk on himself you are for a journey says i he nodded and his colour rose but he frowned i am for effingham said he so am i said i at least i pass that way which was not so for i was for reading and had meant to go by guildford yet i was in no mind to risk an encounter with grubbe and his lambs who were bound for guildford if what the innkeeper said was true and the way by effingham would serve me as well as another he looked pleased and says he why we will travel in company says he with all my heart said i the traps had disappeared upon the guildford road in a mist of dust and we jogged on comfortably till we came to cross roads where we turned away for slinfold reaching that village nearby two of the clock here my companion must slake his thirst and i was nothing loth he had a gentlemanly air about him for all his rustic habit and very pleasantly if with some awkwardness offered me of a bottle you mind me said i drinking to him for i liked the fellow of a lad that i knew that was in the wars was you in the wars says he eagerly i had meant the wars of the road which indeed are as perilous and as venturesome as the high quarrels of ravening nations i served in flanders said i my father fought for his gracious majesty charles i says he quickly and took a deep wound at marston moor there was never a braver man than squire masters of rockham i'll warrant his son is his spit said i he bowed as if he were at court your servant sir says he smiling well pleased and eyed me you have seen much service sir he asked why as much as will serve mr masters said i he looked at me shyly you have my name now said he and left his question in the air you may call me ryder said i you have had your company sir he went on in a hesitating voice not always as good company as this i replied laughing i knew it said he eagerly you are captain ryder there have been those that have put that style on me i answered amused at his persistence i am glad that i have met you captain said this young fool and put his arm in mine quite affectionately i have been unhappily kept much at home and have seen less than i might of things beyond the hills not but what sussex is a fine shire he says with a sigh why it is fine if so be your home be there i replied my home is there he said and paused and again the frown wrinkled up his brow he said no more till we were in the saddle again and had gone some half a mile and then he spoke and i knew his poor brain had been playing pitch and toss with some thought captain ryder said he abruptly you have travelled far and seen much you might advise one junior to you on a matter of worldly wisdom sink me thinks i what's the boy after but says i gravely from a mutinous face you can hang your faith on me for an opinion or a blow mr masters thank you says he heartily and then thrust a hand into his bosom and rapidly stuck at me a document read that sir said he impulsively i opened it and found 'twas writ in a woman's hand and subscribed anne varley and the marrow of it was fond affection why 'twas but a common love billet he had given me of the which i have seen dozens and received very many some from persons of quality that would astonish you but what was i to do with this honest ninny and his mistress i had no nose for it and so said i handing him back his letter it has a sweet smack and 'tis pretty enough inditing ah says he quickly 'tis her nature captain 'tis her heart that speaks yet is she denied by her parents they will have none of me the more to their shame i said they aspire high says he as anne's beauty and virtues of themselves would justify yet she does love me and i her and we are of one spirit and heart see you how she loves me poor thing poor silly puss and they would persuade her to renunciation but she shall not she shall not i swear it he cried in excitement she shall be free to choose whom she will spoken like a man of temper said i approvingly you will go win her forthright i am on my journey to accomplish that now says he she has wrote in this letter as you have seen that her father dissuades her and she signs her renunciation adding sweet words of comfort that her affection will not die no never never and that she will die virgin for me say you not sir that this is beautiful conduct and say am i not right to ride forth and seize her from her unnatural parents to make her mine young gentleman said i being struck by his honest sincerity and his bubbling over were you brother to me or i to mrs anne you would have my blessing at that he glowed and his spirits having risen with this communication he babbled on the road of many things cheerfully but mostly of love and beauty and the virtues of mrs anne of effingham manor i will confess that after a time his prattle wearied me 'twas too much honey and cloyed my palate if he had known as much of the sex as has fallen to my lot he would have took another stand and sung in a lower key well 'twas late in the afternoon when we reached the hills beyond ewhurst and began to climb the rugged way to the top the wind had gone down with the sun in a flurry of gold in the west to which the eastern breeze had beat all day and over the head of pitch hill last year's heather still blazed in its decay when we had got to the windmill inn that lies packed into the side of the hill and woods there we descended for refreshment and i saw the horses stalled below for baiting now that house little and quiet perches in a lonely way in the pass of the hill and upon one side the ground falls so fast away that the eye carries over a precipitous descent towards the weald of surrey and the dim hills by the sea and this view was fading swiftly in the window under a bleak sky as masters and i ate of our dinner in the upstairs room that looked upon it he had a natural grace of mind despite the rawness of his behaviour and his sentiments emerged sometimes in a gush as when says he looking at the darkening weald i love it captain 'tis mine my home is there and god willing anne's too shall be amen said i heartily for the boy had gone to my heart absurd though he was and just on that there was a noise without the door the clank of heavy feet rang on the boards and timothy grubbe's ugly mask disfigured the room he came forward a little with a grin on his distorted features and looking from one to the other of us said he my respects captain and to this young plover that no doubt you're plucking by the lord dick ryder but i had given you up heaven sends us good fortune when we're least thinking of it masters at his word had started up who are you sir that intrudes on two gentlemen he demanded with spirit i'll have you know this is a private room get you gone softly man says grubbe in an insinuating voice but maybe i'm wrong and you're two of a colour is it an apprentice dick this brave lad that talks so bold and has such fine feathers if you do not quit said i shortly i will spit your beauty for you in two ticks dick ryder had always plenty heart said he in his jeering way dick had always a famous wit and was known as a hospitable host so i will take the liberty to invite to his sociable board some good fellows that are below to make merry we shall prove an excellent company i'll warrant masters took a step towards him now who the devil soever you may be you shall not use gentlemen so he said whipping out his blade but grubbe turned on him satirically as for you young cockchafer said he it bodes no good to find you in this company but as you seem simpleton enough i'll give you five minutes to take your leave of this gentleman of the road dick ye're a fine tobyman and you have enjoyed a brave career but your hour is struck i rose but ere i could get to him young masters had fallen on him defend yourself damn ye he said you that insult a gentleman that is my friend put up your blade curse you and he made at him with incredible energy uttering a curse grubbe thrust with his point and took the first onrush swerving it aside and ere i could intervene they were at it my young friend was impetuous and as i saw at once none too skilful and grubbe kept his temper as he always did he stood with a thin ugly smile pushing aside his opponent's blade for a moment or two until of a sudden he drew himself up and let drive very low and under the other's guard the sword rattled from masters's hand and he went down on the floor i uttered an oath by god for this you shall die you swine said i fiercely and i ran at him but being by the door he swept it open with a movement and backed into the passage the boot is on t'other leg dick says he maliciously 'tis you are doomed and closing the door sharply behind him he whistled shrilly i knew what he intended and that his men were there but i stooped over the boy's body and held my fingers to his heart 'twas dead and still i cursed grubbe and started up if i was not to be taken there was only the window looking on the deeps of the descending valley i threw back the casement and leaped over the sill grubbe should perish i swore and doubled now my oath i could have wept for that poor youth that had died to avenge my honour but my first business was my safety and i crept down as far as i might and dropped by that time the catchpoles were crowding into the room above i struck the slanting hill and fell backwards but getting to my feet which were very numb with the concussion of the fall i sped briskly into the darkness making for the woods i lay in the shelter of the woods an hour and then resolved on a circumspection 'twas not my intention to leave the mare behind if so be she had escaped grubbe and his creatures and moreover i had other designs in my head so i made my way back deviously to the inn and reconnoitred stillness hung about it and after a time i marched up to the door mighty cautiously and knocked on it the innkeeper opened it and the lamp burning in my face started as if i were the devil hush man said i is the officer gone he looked at me dubiously and trembling come said i for i knew the reputation of those parts i am from shoreham gap yonder and i was near taken for an offence against the revenue you are a smuggler said he anxiously they said you were a tobyman they will take away any decent man's name said i come i want my horse you have no fancy for preventive men i'll guess and this was true enough for he had a mine of cellars under his inn and through the roadway but your friend said he still wavering him that is dead as good a man as ever rolled a barrel said i he relaxed his grip of the door 'tis a sore business for me this night he complained nay said i for i will rid your premises of myself and friend by your leave or without it says i he seemed relieved at that and i entered the horses were safe as i discovered for grubbe must have been too full of his own prime business to make search and getting them out i made my preparations i strapped the lad's body in the stirrups so that he lay forward on the horse with his head a wagging but god deliver him his soul at rest and presently we were on the road and threading the wilderness of the black pine woods for the vale below towards london the moon was a glimmering arc across the hurtwood as i came out on the back of shere and pulling out of the long lane that gave entry to the village reined up by the white horse from the inn streamed a clamour of laughter and without the doorway and well nigh blocking it was drawn up a carriage with a coachman in his seat that struck my eyes dimly in the small light i was not for calling eyes on me with a dead man astride his horse so i moved into the yard thinking to drain a tankard of ale if no better before i took the road over the downs to effingham but i was scarce turned into the yard ere a light flung through the window peered on a face that changed all the notions in my skull 'twas grubbe leaving the horses by i went back to the front of the inn and says i to the coachman that waited there as i rapped loud on the door 'tis shrewish to night ay says he in a grumbling surly voice i would the country were in hell why so 'twill be in good time said i cheerfully and then to the man that came fetch me two quarts well laced with gin says i for to keep the chill o' the night and the fear o' death out the coachman laughed a little stoutly for he knew that this was his invitation whence come you then said i delivering him the pot that was fetched out he threw an arm out lewes said he under charge with a tobyman that was for chains yonder he nodded towards the downs and drank i cast my eyes up and the loom of the hill just t'other side of the village was black and ominous oh says i he hangs there at the top of london road says he dipping his nose again there stands the gallows where the roads cross and near the gate gallows gate said i laughing well 'twas a merry job enough ay says he but by this we might ha' been far towards london town whither most of us are already gone but 'twas not his meaning he must come back with the lewes sheriff and drink him farewell leaving a poor likely young man such as yourself to starve of cold and an empty belly here said i well i would learn such a one manners in your place and you shall have another tankard of dog's nose for your pains says i whereat i called out the innkeeper again but took care that he had my share of the gin in addition to his own by that time he was garrulous and had lost his caution so keeping him in talk a little and dragging his wits along from point to point i presently called to him come down said i and stamp your feet 'twill warm you without as the liquor within and he did as i had suggested without demur run round to the back says i and get yourself a noggin and if so be you see a gentleman on horseback there asleep why 'tis only a friend of mine that is weary of his long journey i will call you if there be occasion he hesitated a moment but i set a crown on his palm and his scruples vanished he limped into the darkness 'twas no more than two minutes later that i heard voices in the doorway and next came timothy grubbe into the night in talk with someone at which it took me but thirty seconds to whip me into the seat and pull the coachman's cloak about me so that i sat stark and black in the starlight grubbe left the man he talked with and came forward you shall drink when ye reach cobham crossway says he looking up at me and mind your ways damn ye and at that he made no more ado but humming an air he lurched into the carriage i pulled out the nags and turned their heads so that they were set for the north and then i whistled low and short a whistle i knew that the mare would heed and i trusted that she would bring her companion with her then the wheels rolled out upon the road and timothy grubbe and i were bound for london all alone as i turned up the london road that swept steeply up the downs i looked back and behind the moon shone faintly on calypso and behind her on the dead man wagging awkwardly in his stirrups i pushed the horses up the steeps of the london road as fast as might be but the ruts were still deep in mud and the carriage jolted and rocked and swayed as we went the wind came now with a little moaning sound from the bottom of the valley and the naked branches creaked above my head for that way was sunken and tangled with the thickets of nut and yew and presently i was forced to go at a foot pace so abrupt was the height the moon struck through the trees and peered on us and grubbe put his head forth of the window why go you not faster damn ye says he being much in liquor 'tis the hill your honour said i he glanced up and down what is't comes up behind says he shouting there is a noise of horses that pounds upon the road 'tis the wind says i that comes off the valley and makes play among the branches he sank back in his seat and we went forward slowly but he was presently out again screaming on the night there is a horseman behind says he what does he there 'tis a traveller your honour say i that goes no doubt by our road and is bound for london he shall be bound for hell says he and falls back again the horses wound up foot by foot and emerged now upon a space of better light i looked round and there was grubbe with his head through the window and his eyes cast backwards what fool is this says he that rides so awkwardly and drives a spare horse if he ride no better i will ask him to keep me company if he be a gentleman many gentlemen have rode along of me and have rode to the gallows tree and he chuckled harshly maybe he will ride with you to the gallows gate sir says i why crossway says he laughing loudly you have turned a wit says he and once more withdrew his head by now we were nigh to the top of the down and i could see the faint shadow of the triple beam with that i knew my journey was done and that my work must be accomplished i pulled to the horses on the rise and got down from my seat why d'ye stop rascal called grubbe in a fury but i was by the door now and had it open timothy grubbe said i ye're a damned rogue that the devil your master wants and he shall have ye he stared at me in a maze his nostrils working and then says he in a low voice so 'tis you your time has come timothy said i flinging off my cloak and i took my sword out with you worm he said never a word but stepped forth and looked about him he was sobered now as i could see from his face which had a strange look on it ye're two rascals to one dick says he slowly looking on the dead man on his horse which had come to a stop in the shadows no says i this gentleman will see fair play for us grubbe took a step backward sir says he addressing the dead man but at that moment calypso and her companion started and came into the open and the moon shone on the face of the dead grubbe uttered a cry and turned on me his teeth showed in a grin no ghost shall haunt me dick says he rather shall another ghost keep him company and his wry neck moved horridly in the wan light i pointed upwards where the tobyman hung in chains keeping his sheep by moonlight there's your destiny said i there's your doom now defend ye damn ye for i'll not prick an adder at a disadvantage he drew his blade for no man could say that timothy grubbe time server pander and traitor as he was lacked courage suddenly he sliced at me but i put out and turned off the blow if you will have it so soon said i in god's name have it and i ran upon him my third stroke went under his guard and took him in the midriff he gave vent to an oath cursed me in a torrent and struck at me weakly as he went down he was as dead as mutton almost ere he reached the ground i have never been a man of the church nor do i lay any claim to own more religion than such as to make shift by when it comes to the end no nor do i deny that i have sundry offences on my conscience some of which i have narrated in my memoirs but when it comes to a reckoning i will make bold to claim credit in that i rid the world he had encumbered of timothy grubbe the foulest ruffian that ever i did encounter in the length of my days on the roads i climbed the beam and lowered the poor tobyman and it took me but a little time to make the exchange the one i left where he had paid quittance in the peace of this earth and t'other a swinging under the light of the moon on gallows gate i have said my journey was done but that was not so there was more for me to do which was to deliver poor masters at his ladylove's and break the unhappy news and so leaving the carriage where it stood with the patient horses that were cropping the grass i mounted the mare and began to go down the long span of the downs to the north 'twas late near midnight when i reached effingham and found my way to the manor i rapped on the door leaving calypso and t'other in the shadows by the house and presently one answered to my knock what is it says she 'tis a stranger says i that has news of great import for mrs anne varley whom i beg you will call she cannot hear you said she 'tis her wedding night what said i in amazement and instantly there flowed in upon me the meaning of this damn all women save one or two thinks i and i turned to the maid again with my mind made up look you wench said i this is urgent i have an instant message that presses and if so be your mistress will bear with me a moment and hold discourse i'll warrant she shall not regret it nor you says i with a crown piece in my palm she hesitated and then maybe she will refuse says she she hath but these few hours been wed not she said i if you will tell her that i bring good news great news news that will ease her spirit and send her to her bridal bed with a happy heart at that she seemed to consent and with my coin in her hand she disappeared into the darkness of the house it must have been some ten minutes later that a light flashed in the hall and a voice called to me who is it it asked and what want you at this hour i looked at her she was of a pretty face enough rather pale of colour and with eyes that moved restlessly and measured all things lord i have known women all my life in all stations and i would have pinned no certainty on those treacherous eyes she was young too but had an air of satisfaction in herself and was in no wise embarrassed by this interview i had no mercy on her with her oaths of constancy writ in water that feigned to be tears and her false pretences madam said i civilly i hear you're wed to day to a gentleman of standing what is that to you sir she asked quickly 'tis nothing for sure said i but to a friend of mine that i value deeply 'tis much you speak of mr masters said she sharply and with discomposure sure if he be a gentleman he will not trouble me when he knows anne cried a voice from the top of the stairs anne 'twas her bridegroom calling well she should go to him in what mood she might when i had done with her he will never know says i unless he have it from yourself anne says the voice above the stairs he shall not i will not she cried angrily i will not be persecuted 'twas all a mistake i whistled and calypso emerged from the night and behind calypso was the horse with its burden an anxious look dawned in her face i am insulted says she and paused quickly edward she called and put a hand to her bosom anne my dove cried the voice where are you come child 'tis late the horses came to a stop before the door with the body in the saddle bound to the crupper what is it she cried in alarm and suddenly she shrieked out clutching at the door post it is an omen my wedding night ay says i which be your bridegroom he that calls out or he that is silent call on him and he hears not peal after peal went up now from her and the house was awake with alarm i turned away leaving her on the door step and mounted the mare as i cantered off into the night i cast a glance behind me and a group was gathered at the door and in that group lay mrs anne fallen in a swoon with the sleeping figure on the horse before her colston and coy limited printers edinburgh transcriber's note obvious printer errors have

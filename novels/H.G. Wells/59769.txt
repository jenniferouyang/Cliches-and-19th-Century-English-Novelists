bealby and the tramp vii the battle of crayminster viii how bealby explained bealby chapter i young bealby goes to shonts the cat is the offspring of a cat and the dog of a dog but butlers and ladys maids do not reproduce their kind they have other duties so their successors have to be sought among the prolific and particularly among the prolific on great estates such are gardeners but not undergardeners gamekeepers and coachmenbut not lodge people because their years are too great and their lodges too small and among those to whom this opportunity of entering service came was young bealby who was the stepson of mr darling the gardener of shonts everyone knows the glories of shonts its faade its two towers the great marble pond the terraces where the peacocks walk and the lower lake with the black and white swans the great park and the avenue the view of the river winding away across the blue country and of the shonts velasquezbut that is now in america and the shonts rubens which is in the national gallery and the shonts porcelain and the shonts past history it was a refuge for the old faith it had priests holes and secret passages and how at last the marquis had to let shonts to the laxtonsthe peptonized milk and baby soother peoplefor a long term of years it was a splendid chance for any boy to begin his knowledge of service in so great an establishment and only the natural perversity of human nature can explain the violent objection young bealby took to anything of the sort he did he said he did not want to be a servant and that he would not go and be a good boy and try his very best in that state of life to which it had pleased god to call him at shonts on the contrary he communicated these views suddenly to his mother as she was preparing a steak and kidney pie in the bright little kitchen of the gardeners cottage he came in with his hair all ruffled and his face hot and distinctly dirty and his hands in his trousers pockets in the way he had been repeatedly told not to mother he said im not going to be a stewards boy at the house anyhow not if you tell me to not till youre blue in the face so thats all about it this delivered he remained panting having no further breath left in him his mother was a thin firm woman she paused in her rolling of the dough until he had finished and then she made a strong broadening sweep of the rolling pin and remained facing him leaning forward on that implement with her head a little on one side you will do she said whatsoever your father has said you will do e isnt my father said young bealby his mother gave a snapping nod of the head expressive of extreme determination anyhow i aint going to do it said young bealby and feeling the conversation was difficult to sustain he moved towards the staircase door with a view to slamming it youll do it said his mother right enough you see whether i do said young bealby and then got in his doorslam rather hurriedly because of steps outside mr darling came in out of the sunshine a few moments later he was a large manypocketed earthywhiskered man with a cleanshaven determined mouth and he carried a large pale cucumber in his hand i tole him he said what did he say asked his wife nuthin said mr darling e says e wont said mrs darling mr darling regarded her thoughtfully for a moment i never see such a boy said mr darling whyes got to but young bealby maintained an obstinate fight against the inevitable he had no gift of lucid exposition i aint going to be a servant he said i dont see what right people have making a servant of me you got to be something said mr darling everybodys got to be something said mrs darling then let me be something else said young bealby i dessay youd like to be a gentleman said mr darling i wouldnt mind said young bealby you got to be what your opportunities give you said mr darling young bealby became breathless why shouldnt i be an engine driver he asked all oily said his mother and getting yourself killed in an accident and got to pay fines youd like to be an engine driver or a soldier ooa swaddy said mr darling decisively or the sea with that weak stummik of yours said mrs darling besides which said mr darling its been arranged for you to go up to the ouse the very first of next month and your box and everything ready young bealby became very red in the face i wont go he said very faintly you will said mr darling if i ave to take you by the collar and the slack of your breeches to get you there the heart of young bealby was a coal of fire within his breast asunassistedhe went across the dewy park up to the great house whither his box was to follow him he thought the world a rotten show he also said apparently to two does and a fawn if you think im going to stand it you know youre jollywell mistaken i do not attempt to justify his prejudice against honourable usefulness in a domestic capacity he had it perhaps there is something in the air of highbury where he had spent the past eight years of his life that leads to democratic ideals it is one of those new places where estates seem almost forgotten perhaps too there was something in the bealby strain i think he would have objected to any employment at all hitherto he had been a remarkably free boy with a considerable gusto about his freedom why should that end the little village mixed school had been a soft job for his cockney wits and for a year and a half he had been top boy why not go on being top boy instead of which under threats he had to go across the sunlit corner of the park through that slanting morning sunlight which had been so often the prelude to golden days of leafy wanderings he had to go past the corner of the laundry where he had so often played cricket with the coachmans boys already swallowed up into the working world he had to follow the laundry wall to the end of the kitchen and there where the steps go down and underground he had to say farewell to the sunlight farewell to childhood boyhood freedom he had to go down and along the stone corridor to the pantry and there he had to ask for mr mergleson he paused on the top step and looked up at the blue sky across which a hawk was slowly drifting his eyes followed the hawk out of sight beyond a cypress bough but indeed he was not thinking about the hawk he was not seeing the hawk he was struggling with a last wild impulse of his ferial nature why not sling it his ferial nature was asking why not even nowdo a bunk it would have been better for him perhaps and better for mr mergleson and better for shonts if he had yielded to the whisper of the tempter but his heart was heavy within him and he had no lunch and never a penny one can do but a very little bunk on an empty belly must was written all over him he went down the steps the passage was long and cool and at the end of it was a swing door through that and then to the left he knew one had to go past the stillroom and so to the pantry the maids were at breakfast in the stillroom with the door open the grimace he made in passing was intended rather to entertain than to insult and anyhow a chap must do something with his face and then he came to the pantry and into the presence of mr mergleson mr mergleson was in his shirtsleeves and generally dishevelled having an early cup of tea in an atmosphere full of the bleak memories of overnight he was an ample man with a large nose a vast under lip and muttonchop sidewhiskers his voice would have suited a succulent parrot he took out a gold watch from his waistcoat pocket and regarded it ten minutes past seven young man he said isnt seven oclock young bealby made no articulate answer just stand there for a minute said mr mergleson and when im at libbuty ill run through your duties and almost ostentatiously he gave himself up to the enjoyment of his cup of tea three other gentlemen in deshabille sat at table with mr mergleson they regarded young bealby with attention and the youngest a redhaired barefaced youth in shirtsleeves and a green apron was moved to a grimace that was clearly designed to echo the scowl on young bealbys features the fury that had been subdued by a momentary awe of mr mergleson revived and gathered force young bealbys face became scarlet his eyes filled with tears and his mind with the need for movement after allhe wouldnt stand it he turned round abruptly and made for the door wheren earth you going to cried mr mergleson hes shy cried the second footman steady on cried the first footman and had him by the shoulder in the doorway lemme go howled the new recruit struggling i wont be a blooming servant i wont here cried mr mergleson gesticulating with his teaspoon bring im to the end of the table there whats this about a blooming servant bealby suddenly blubbering was replaced at the end of the table may i ask whats this about a blooming servant asked mr mergleson sniff and silence did i understand you to say that you aint going to be a blooming servant young bealby yes said young bealby thomas said mr mergleson just smack is ed smack it rather ard things too rapid to relate occurred so youd bite would you said thomas ah said mr mergleson got im that one just smack is ed once more said mr mergleson and now you just stand there young man until im at libbuty to attend to you further said mr mergleson and finished his tea slowly and eloquently the second footman rubbed his shin thoughtfully if i got to smack is ed much he said ed better change into his slippers take him to is room said mr mergleson getting up see e washes the grief and grubbiness off is face in the handwash at the end of the passage and make him put on his slippers then show im ow to lay the table in the stewards room the duties to which bealby was introduced struck him as perplexingly various undesirably numerous uninteresting and difficult to remember and also he did not try to remember them very well because he wanted to do them as badly as possible and he thought that forgetting would be a good way of starting at that he was beginning at the bottom of the ladder to him it fell to wait on the upper servants and the green baize door at the top of the service staircase was the limit of his range his room was a small wedgeshaped apartment under some steps leading to the servants hall lit by a window that did not open and that gave upon the underground passage he received his instructions in a state of crumpled mutinousness but for a day his desire to be remarkably impossible was more than counterbalanced by his respect for the large able hands of the four manservants his seniors and by a disinclination to be returned too promptly to the gardens then in a tentative manner he broke two plates and got his head smacked by mr mergleson himself mr mergleson gave a staccato slap quite as powerful as thomass but otherwise different the hand of mr mergleson was large and fat and he got his effects by dash thomass was horny and lingered after that young bealby put salt in the teapot in which the housekeeper made tea but that he observed she washed out with hot water before she put in the tea it was clear that he had wasted his salt which ought to have gone into the kettle next timethe kettle beyond telling him his duties almost excessively nobody conversed with young bealby during the long hours of his first day in service at midday dinner in the servants hall he made one of the kitchenmaids giggle by pulling faces intended to be delicately suggestive of mr mergleson but that was his nearest approach to disinterested human intercourse when the hour for retirement cameget out of it go to bed you dirty little kicker said thomas weve had about enough of you for one dayyoung bealby sat for a long time on the edge of his bed weighing the possibilities of arson and poison he wished he had some poison some sort of poison with a medieval manner poison that hurts before it kills also he produced a small penny pocketbook with a glazed black cover and blue edges he headed one page of this mergleson and entered beneath it three black crosses then he opened an account to thomas who was manifestly destined to be his principal creditor bealby was not a forgiving boy at the village school they had been too busy making him a good churchman to attend to things like that there were a lot of crosses for thomas and while bealby made these sinister memoranda downstairs lady laxtonfor laxton had bought a baronetcy for twenty thousand down to the party funds and a tip to the whip over the peptonized milk flotationlady laxton a couple of floors above bealbys ruffled head mused over her approaching weekend party it was an important weekend party the lord chancellor of england was coming never before had she had so much as a member of the cabinet at shonts he was coming and do what she would she could not help but connect it with her very strong desire to see the master of shonts in the clear scarlet of a deputy lieutenant peter would look so well in that the lord chancellor was coming and to meet him and to circle about him there were lord john woodenhouse and slinker bond there were the countess of barracks and mrs rampound pilby the novelist with her husband rampound pilby there was professor timbre the philosopher and there were four smaller though quite good people who would run about very satisfactorily among the others at least she thought they would run about very satisfactorily amongst the others not imagining any evil of her cousin captain douglas all this good company in shonts filled lady laxton with a pleasant realization of progressive successes but at the same time one must confess that she felt a certain diffidence in her heart of hearts she knew she had not made this party it had happened to her how it might go on happening to her she did not know it was beyond her control she hoped very earnestly that everything would pass off well the lord chancellor was as big a guest as any she had had one must grow as one grows but stillbeing easy and friendly with him would be she knew a tremendous effort rather like being easy and friendly with an elephant she was not good at conversation the task of interesting people taxed her and puzzled her it was slinker bond the whip who had arranged the whole businessafter it must be confessed a hint from sir peter laxton had complained that the government were neglecting this part of the country they ought to show up more than they do in the county said sir peter and added almost carelessly i could easily put anybody up at shonts there were to be two select dinner parties and a large but still select sunday lunch to let in the countryside to the spectacle of the laxtons taking their new proper place at shonts it was not only the sense of her own deficiencies that troubled lady laxton there were also her husbands excesses he hadit was no use disguising itrather too much the manner of an employer he had a way of getting how could one put itconfident at dinner and mergleson seemed to delight in filling up his glass then he would contradict a good deal she felt that lord chancellors however are the sort of men one doesnt contradict then the lord chancellor was said to be interested in philosophya difficult subject she had got timbre to talk to him upon that timbre was a professor of philosophy at oxford so that was sure to be all right but she wished she knew one or two good safe things to say in philosophy herself she had long felt the need of a secretary and now she felt it more than ever if she had a secretary she could just tell him what it was she wanted to talk about and he could get her one or two of the right books and mark the best passages and she could learn it all up she fearedit was a worrying fearthat laxton would say right out and very early in the weekend that he didnt believe in philosophy he had a way of saying he didnt believe in large things like thatart philanthropy novels and so on sometimes he said i dont believe in all thisart or whatever it was she had watched peoples faces when he had said it and she had come to the conclusion that saying you dont believe in things isnt the sort of thing people say nowadays it was wrong somehow but she did not want to tell laxton directly that it was wrong he would remember if she did but he had a way of taking such things rather badly at the time she hated him to take things badly if one could invent some little hint she whispered to herself she had often wished she was better at hints she was you see a gentlewoman modest kindly her people were quite good people poor of course but she was not clever she was anything but clever and the wives of these captains of industry need to be very clever indeed if they are to escape a magnificent social isolation they get the titles and the big places and all that sort of thing people dont at all intend to isolate them but there is nevertheless an inadvertent avoidance even as she uttered these words if one could invent some little hint bealby down there less than forty feet away through the solid floor below her feet and a little to the right was wetting his stump of pencil as wet as he could in order to ensure a sufficiently emphatic fourteenth cross on the score sheet of the doomed thomas most of the other thirteen marks were done with such hard breathing emphasis that the print of them went more than halfway through that little blueedged book the arrival of the weekend guests impressed bealby at first merely as a blessed influence that withdrew the four menservants into that unknown world on the other side of the green baize door but then he learnt that it also involved the appearance of five new persons two valets and three maids for whom places had to be laid in the stewards room otherwise lady laxtons social arrangements had no more influence upon the mind of bealby than the private affairs of the emperor of china there was something going on up there beyond even his curiosity all he heard of it was a distant coming and going of vehicles and some slight talk to which he was inattentive while the coachman and grooms were having a drink in the pantryuntil these maids and valets appeared they seemed to him to appear suddenly out of nothing like slugs after rain black and rather shiny sitting about inactively and quietly consuming small matters he disliked them and they regarded him without affection or respect who cared he indicated his feeling towards them as soon as he was out of the stewards room by a gesture of the hand and nose venerable only by reason of its antiquity he had things more urgent to think about than strange valets and maids thomas had laid hands on him jeered at him inflicted shameful indignities on him and he wanted to kill thomas in some frightful manner but if possible unobtrusively if he had been a little japanese boy this would have been an entirely honourable desire it would have been bushido and all that sort of thing in the gardeners stepson however it isundesirable thomas on the other hand having remarked the red light of revenge in bealbys eye and being secretly afraid felt that his honour was concerned in not relaxing his persecutions he called him kicker and when he did not answer to that name he called him snorter bleater snooks and finally tweaked his ear then he saw fit to assume that bealby was deaf and that eartweaking was the only available method of address this led on to the convention of a sign language whereby ideas were communicated to bealby by means of painful but frequently quite ingeniously symbolical freedoms with various parts of his person also thomas affected to discover uncleanliness in bealbys head and succeeded after many difficulties in putting it into a sinkful of lukewarm water meanwhile young bealby devoted such scanty time as he could give to reflection to debating whether it is better to attack thomas suddenly with a carving knife or throw a lighted lamp the large pantry inkpot of pewter might be effective in its way he thought but he doubted whether in the event of a charge it had sufficient stopping power he was also curiously attracted by a long twopronged toastingfork that hung at the side of the pantry fireplace it had reach over all these dark thoughts and illconcealed emotions mr mergleson prevailed large yet speedy speedy yet exact parroting orders and making plump gestures performing duties and seeing that duties were performed matters came to a climax late on saturday night at the end of a trying day just before mr mergleson went round to lock up and turn out the lights thomas came into the pantry close behind bealby who greatly belated through his own inefficiency was carrying a tray of glasses from the stewards room applied an ungentle hand to his neck and ruffled up his back hair in a smart and painful manner at the same time thomas remarked burrrrh bealby stood still for a moment and then put down his tray on the table and making peculiar sounds as he did so resorted very rapidly to the toasting fork he got a prong into thomass chin at the first prod how swift are the changes of the human soul at the moment of his thrust young bealby was a primordial savage so soon as he saw this incredible piercing of thomass chinfor all the care that bealby had taken it might just as well have been thomass eyehe moved swiftly through the ages and became a simple christian child he abandoned violence and fled the fork hung for a moment from the visage of thomas like a twisted beard of brass and then rattled on the ground thomas clapped his hand to his chin and discovered blood you little he never found the right word which perhaps is just as well instead he started in pursuit of bealby bealbyin his sudden horror of his own actand thomas fled headlong into the passage and made straight for the service stairs that went up into a higher world he had little time to think thomas with a redsmeared chin appeared in pursuit thomas the avenger thomas really roused bealby shot through the green baize door and the pursuing footman pulled up only just in time not to follow him only just in time he had an instinctive instant anxious fear of great dangers he heard something a sound as though the young of some very large animal had squeaked feebly he had a glimpse of something black and whiteand large then something some glass thing smashed he steadied the green baize door which was wobbling on its brass hinges controlled his panting breath and listened a low rich voice wasejaculating it was not bealbys voice it was the voice of some substantial person being quietly but deeply angry they were the ejaculations restrained in tone but not in quality of a ripe and wellstored mindno boys thin stuff then very softly thomas pushed open the doorjust widely enough to see and as instantly let it fall back into place very gently and yet with an alert rapidity he turned about and stole down the service stairs his superior officer appeared in the passage below mr mergleson he cried i saymr mergleson whats up said mr mergleson hes gone who bealby home this almost hopefully no where up there i think he ran against somebody mr mergleson scrutinized his subordinates face for a second then he listened intently both men listened intently have to fetch him out of that said mr mergleson suddenly preparing for brisk activity thomas bent lower over the banisters the lord chancellor he whispered with white lips and a sideways gesture of his head what about im said mergleson arrested by something in the manner of thomas thomass whisper became so fine that mr mergleson drew nearer to catch it and put up a hand to his ear thomas repeated the last remark hes just through thereon the landingcursing and swearingorrible thingsmore like a mad turkey than a human being wheres bealby he must almost ave run into im said thomas after consideration but nowwhere is he thomas pantomimed infinite perplexity mr mergleson reflected and decided upon his line he came up the service staircase lifted his chin and with an air of meek officiousness went through the green door there was no one now on the landing there was nothing remarkable on the landing except a broken tumbler but halfway up the grand staircase stood the lord chancellor under one arm the great jurist carried a soda water syphon and he grasped a decanter of whisky in his hand he turned sharply at the sound of the green baize door and bent upon mr mergleson the most terrible eyebrows that ever surely adorned a legal visage he was very red in the face and savagelooking was it you he said with a threatening gesture of the decanter and his voice betrayed a noble indignation was it you who slapped me behind slapped you behind me lord slapped me behind dont i speakplainly isuch a libbuty me lord idiot i ask you a plain question with almost inconceivable alacrity mr mergleson rushed up three steps leapt forward and caught the syphon as it slipped from his lordships arm he caught it but at a price he overset and clasping it in his hands struck his lordship first with the syphon on the left shin and then butted him with a face that was still earnestly respectful in the knees his lordships legs were driven sideways so that they were no longer beneath his centre of gravity with a monosyllabic remark of a topographical nature his lordship collapsed upon mr mergleson the decanter flew out of his grasp and smashed presently with emphasis upon the landing below the syphon escaping from the wreckage of mr mergleson and drawn no doubt by a natural affinity rolled noisily from step to step in pursuit of the decanter it was a curious little procession that hurried down the great staircase of shonts that night first the whisky like a winged harbinger with the pedestrian syphon in pursuit then the great lawyer gripping the great butler by the tails of his coat and punching furiously then mr mergleson trying wildly to be respectfuleven in disaster first the lord chancellor dived over mr mergleson grappling as he passed then mr mergleson attempting explanations was pulled backwards over the lord chancellor then again the lord chancellor was for a giddy but vindictive moment uppermost a second rotation and they reached the landing bang there was a deafening report chapter ii a weekend at shonts the weekend visit is a form of entertainment peculiar to great britain it is a thing that could have been possible only in a land essentially aristocratic and mellow in which even the observance of the sabbath has become mellow at every london terminus on a saturday afternoon the outgoing trains have an unusually large proportion of first class carriages and a peculiar abundance of richlooking dressingbags provoke the covetous eye a discreet activity of valets and maids mingles with the stimulated alertness of the porters one marks celebrities in gay raiment there is an indefinable air of distinction upon platform and bookstall sometimes there are carriages reserved for especially privileged parties there are greetings and so you are coming too no this time it is shonts the place where they found the rubens who has it now through this cheerfully prosperous throng went the lord chancellor with his high nose those eyebrows of his which he seemed to be able to furl or unfurl at will and his expression of tranquil selfsufficiency he was going to shonts for his party and not for his pleasure but there was no reason why that should appear upon his face he went along preoccupied pretending to see nobody leaving to others the disadvantage of the greeting in his right hand he carried a small important bag of leather under his left arm he bore a philosophical work by doctor mactaggart three illustrated papers the fortnightly review the days times the hibbert journal punch and two blue books his lordship never quite knew the limits set to what he could carry under his arm his man candler followed therefore at a suitable distance with several papers that had already been dropped alert to retrieve any further losses at the large bookstall they passed close by mrs rampound pilby who according to her custom was feigning to be a member of the general public and was asking the clerk about her last book the lord chancellor saw rampound pilby hovering at hand and deftly failed to catch his eye he loathed the rampound pilbys he speculated for a moment what sort of people could possibly stand mrs pilbys vast pretensionseven from saturday to monday one dinner party on her right hand had glutted him for life he chose a corner seat took possession of both it and the seat opposite it in order to have somewhere to put his feet left candler to watch over and pack in his hand luggage and went high up the platform remaining there with his back to the worldrather like a bigger more aquiline napoleonin order to evade the great novelist in this he was completely successful he returned however to find candler on the verge of a personal conflict with a very fair young man in grey he was so fair as to be almost an albino except that his eyes were quick and brown he was blushing the brightest pink and speaking very quickly these two places said candler breathless with the badness of his case are engaged oh vevery well said the very fair young man with his eyebrows and moustache looking very pale by contrast have it so but do permit me to occupy the middle seat of the carriage with a residuary interest in the semigentlemans place you little know young man whom you are calling a semigentleman said candler whose speciality was grammar here he is said the young gentleman which place will you have my lord asked candler abandoning his case altogether facing said the lord chancellor slowly unfurling the eyebrows and scowling at the young man in grey then ill have the other said the very fair young man talking very glibly he spoke with a quick low voice like one who forces himself to keep going you see he said addressing the great jurist with the extreme familiarity of the courageously nervous ive gone into this sort of thing before first mind you i have a far look for a vacant corner im not the sort to spoil sport but if there isnt a vacant corner i look for traces of a semigentleman a semigentleman is one who has a soft cap and not an umbrellahis friend in the opposite seat has the umbrellaor he has an umbrella and not a soft cap or a waterproof and not a bag or a bag and not a waterproof and a half interest in a rug thats what i call a semigentleman you see the idea sort of divided beggar nothing in any way offensive sir said the lord chancellor interrupting in a voice of concentrated passion i dont care a rap what you call a semigentleman will you get out of my way just as you please said the very fair young gentleman and going a few paces from the carriage door he whistled for the boy with the papers he was bearing up bravely pink un said the very fair young gentleman almost breathlessly black and white whats all these others athenum sporting and dramatic right o andeh what do i look the sort that buys a spectator you dont know my dear boy wheres your savoir faire the lord chancellor was a philosopher and not easily perturbed his severe manner was consciously assumed and never much more than skindeep he had already furled his eyebrows and dismissed his visavis from his mind before the train started he turned over the hibbert journal and read in it with a large tolerance dimly on the outskirts of his consciousness the very fair young man hovered as a trifling annoyance as something pink and hot rustling a sheet of a discordant shade of pink as something that got in the way of his legs and whistled softly some trivial cheerful air just to show how little it cared presently very soon this vague trouble would pass out of his consciousness altogether the lord chancellor was no mere amateur of philosophy his activities in that direction were a part of his public reputation he lectured on religion and sthetics he was a fluent hegelian he spent his holidays it was understood in the absoluteat any rate in germany he would sometimes break into philosophy at dinner tables and particularly over the desert and be more luminously incomprehensible while still apparently sober than almost anyone an article in the hibbert caught and held his attention it attempted to define a new and doubtful variety of infinity you know of course that there are many sorts and species of infinity and that the absolute is just the king among infinities as the lion is king among the beasts i say said a voice coming out of the world of relativity and coughing the cough of those who break a silence you arent going to shonts are you the lord chancellor returned slowly to earth just seen your label said the very fair young man you seeim going to shonts the lord chancellor remained outwardly serene he reflected for a moment and then he fell into that snare which is more fatal to great lawyers and judges perhaps than to any other class of men the snare of the crushing repartee one had come into his head nowa beauty then we shall meet there he said in his suavest manner wellrather it would be a great pity said the lord chancellor with an effective blandness using a kind of wry smile that he employed to make things humorous it would be a great pity dont you think to anticipate that pleasure and having smiled the retort well home with his head a little on one side he resumed with large leisurely movements the reading of his hibbert journal got me there said the very fair young man belatedly looking boiled to a turn and after a period of restlessness settled down to an impatient perusal of black and white theres a whole blessed weekend of course the young man remarked presently without looking up from his paper and apparently pursuing some obscure meditations a vague uneasiness crept into the lord chancellors mind as he continued to appear to peruse out of what train of thought could such a remark arise his weakness for crushing retort had a little betrayed him it was however only when he found himself upon the platform of chelsome which as everyone knows is the station for shonts and discovered mr and mrs rampound pilby upon the platform looking extraordinarily like a national monument and its custodian that the lord chancellor began to realize that he was in the grip of fate and that the service he was doing his party by weekending with the laxtons was likely to be not simply joyless but disagreeable well anyhow he had mactaggart and he could always work in his own room by the end of dinner the lord chancellor was almost at the end of his large but clumsy endurance he kept his eyebrows furled only by the most strenuous relaxation of his muscles and within he was a sea of silent blasphemies all sorts of little things had accumulated he exercised an unusual temperance with the port and old brandy his host pressed upon him feeling that he dared not relax lest his rage had its way with him the cigars were quite intelligent at any rate and he smoked and listened with a faintly perceptible disdain to the conversation of the other men at any rate mrs rampound pilby was out of the room the talk had arisen out of a duologue that had preceded the departure of the ladies a duologue of timbres about apparitions and the reality of the future life sir peter laxton released from the eyes of his wife was at liberty to say he did not believe in all this stuff it was just thought transference and fancy and all that sort of thing his declaration did not arrest the flow of feeble instances and experiences into which such talk invariably degenerates his lordship remained carelessly attentive his eyebrows unfurled but drooping his cigar upward at an acute angle he contributed no anecdotes content now and then to express himself compactly by some brief sentence of pure hegelianmuch as a mahometan might spit why come to that they say shonts is haunted said sir peter i suppose we could have a ghost here in no time if i chose to take it on rare place for a ghost too the very fair young man of the train had got a name now and was captain douglas when he was not blushing too brightly he was rather good looking he was a distant cousin of lady laxtons he impressed the lord chancellor as unabashed he engaged people in conversation with a cheerful familiarity that excluded only the lord chancellor and even at the lord chancellor he looked ever and again he pricked up his ears at the mention of ghosts and afterwards when the lord chancellor came to think things over it seemed to him that he had caught a curious glance of the captains bright little brown eye what sort of ghost sir peter chains eh no nothing of that sort it seems i dont know much about it i wasnt sufficiently interested no sort of spook that bangs about and does you a mischief whats its name plundergeist poltergeist the lord chancellor supplied carelessly in the pause runs its hand over your hair in the dark taps your shoulder all nonsense but we dont tell the servants sort of thing i dont believe in easily explainedwhat with panelling and secret passages and priests holes and all that priests holes douglas was excited where they hid perfect rabbit warren theres one going out from the drawingroom alcove quite a good room in its way but you knowa note of wrath crept into sir peters voicethey didnt treat me fairly about these priests holes i ought to have had a sketch and a plan of these priests holes when a chap is given possession of a place he ought to be given possession well i dont know where half of them are myself thats not possession else we might refurnish them and do them up a bit i guess theyre pretty musty captain douglas spoke with his eye on the lord chancellor sure there isnt a murdered priest in the place sir peter he asked nothing of the sort said sir peter i dont believe in these priests holes half of em never had priests in em its all pretty tidy rot i expectcome to the bottom of it the conversation did not get away from ghosts and secret passages until the men went to the drawingroom if it seemed likely to do so captain douglas pulled it back he seemed to delight in these silly particulars the sillier they were the more he was delighted the lord chancellor was a little preoccupied by one of those irrational suspicions that will sometimes afflict the most intelligent of men why did douglas want to know all the particulars about the shonts ghosts why every now and then did he glance with that odd expression at ones facea glance half appealing and half amused amused it was a strange fancy but the lord chancellor could almost have sworn that the young man was laughing at him at dinner he had had that feeling one has at times of being talked about he had glanced along the table to discover the captain and a rather plain woman that idiot timbres wife she probably was with their heads together looking up at him quite definitely and both manifestly pleased by something douglas was telling her what was it douglas had said in the train something like a threat but the exact words had slipped the lord chancellors memory the lord chancellors preoccupation was just sufficient to make him a little unwary he drifted into grappling distance of mrs rampound pilby her voice caught him like a lasso and drew him in well and how is lord moggeridge now she asked what on earth is one to say to such an impertinence she was always like that she spoke to a man of the calibre of lord bacon as though she was speaking to a schoolboy home for the holidays she had an invincible air of knowing all through everybody it gave rather confidence to her work than charm to her manner do you still go on with your philosophy she said no shouted the lord chancellor losing all selfcontrol for the moment and waving his eyebrows about madly no i go off with it for your vacations ah lord moggeridge how i envy you great lawyers your long vacations inever get a vacation always we poor authors are pursued by our creations sometimes its typescript sometimes its proofs not that i really complain of proofs i confess to a weakness for proofs sometimes alas its criticism such undiscerning criticism the lord chancellor began to think very swiftly of some tremendous lie that would enable him to escape at once without incivility from lady laxtons drawingroom then he perceived that mrs rampound pilby was asking him is that the captain douglas or his brother whos in love with the actress woman the lord chancellor made no answer what he thought was great silly idiot how should i know i think it must be the onethe one who had to leave portsmouth in disgrace because of the ragging scandal he did nothing there they say but organize practical jokes some of them were quite subtle practical jokes hes a cousin of our hostess that perhaps accounts for his presence the lord chancellors comment betrayed the drift of his thoughts hed better not try that sort of thing on here he said i abominateclowning drawingroom did not last very long even lady laxton could not miss the manifest gloom of her principal guest and after the goodnights and barley water and lemonade on the great landing sir peter led lord moggeridge by the armhe hated being led by the arminto the small but still spacious apartment that was called the study the lord chancellor was now very thirsty he was not used to abstinence of any sort but sir peters way of suggesting a drink roused such a fury of resentment in him that he refused tersely and conclusively there was nobody else in the study but captain douglas who seemed to hesitate upon the verge of some familiar address and lord woodenhouse who was thirsty too and held a vast tumbler of whisky and soda with a tinkle of ice in it on his knee in a way annoying to a parched man the lord chancellor helped himself to a cigar and assumed the middle of the fireplace with an air of contentment but he could feel the selfcontrol running out of the heels of his boots sir peter after a quite unsuccessful invasion of his own hearthrugthe lord chancellor stood like a rocksecured the big armchair stuck his feet out towards his distinguished guest and resumed a talk that he had been holding with lord woodenhouse about firearms mergleson had as usual been too attentive to his masters glass and the fine edge was off sir peters deference i always have carried firearms he said and i always shall used properly they are a great protection even in the country how are you to know who youre going to run up againstanywhen but you might shoot and hit something said douglas properly used i saidproperly used whipping out a revolver and shooting at a man thats not properly used almost as bad as pointing it at himwhich is pretty certain to make him fly straight at you if hes got an ounce of pluck but i said properly used and i mean properly used the lord chancellor tried to think about that article on infinities while appearing to listen to this fools talk he despised revolvers armed with such eyebrows as his it was natural for him to despise revolvers now ive got some nice little barkers upstairs said sir peter id almost welcome a burglar just to try them if you shoot a burglar said lord woodenhouse abruptly with a gust of that illtemper that was frequent at shonts towards bedtime when hes not attacking you its murder sir peter held up an offensively pacifying hand i know that he said you neednt tell me that he raised his voice a little to increase his already excessive accentuations i said properly used a yawn took the lord chancellor unawares and he caught it dexterously with his hand then he saw douglas hastily pull at his little blond moustache to conceal a smilegrinning ape what was there to smile at the man had been smiling all the evening up to something now let me tell you said sir peter let me tell you the proper way to use a revolver you whip it out and instantly let fly at the ground you should never let anyone see a revolver ever before they hear itsee you let fly at the ground first off and the concussion stuns them it doesnt stun you you expect it they dont see there you arefive shots left master of the situation i think sir peter ill bid you goodnight said the lord chancellor allowing his eye to rest for one covetous moment on the decanter and struggling with the devil of pride sir peter made a gesture of extreme friendliness from his chair expressive of the lord chancellors freedom to do whatever he pleased at shonts i may perhaps tell you a little story that happened once in morocco my eyes wont keep open any longer said captain douglas suddenly with a whirl of his knuckles into his sockets and stood up lord woodenhouse stood up too you see said sir peter standing also but sticking to his subject and his hearer this was when i was younger than i am now you must understand and i wasnt married just mooching about a bit between business and pleasure under such circumstances one goes into parts of a foreign town where one wouldnt go if one was older and wiser captain douglas left sir peter and woodenhouse to it he emerged on the landing and selected one of the lighted candlesticks upon the table lord he whispered he grimaced in soliloquy and then perceived the lord chancellor regarding him with suspicion and disfavour from the ascending staircase he attempted ease for the first time since the train incident he addressed lord moggeridge i gather my lorddont believe in ghosts he said no sir said the lord chancellor i dont they wont trouble me tonight they wont trouble any of us fine old house anyhow said captain douglas the lord chancellor disdained to reply he went on his way upstairs when the lord chancellor sat down before the thoughtful fire in the fine old panelled room assigned to him he perceived that he was too disturbed to sleep this was going to be an infernal weekend the worst weekend he had ever had mrs rampound pilby maddened him timbre who was a pragmatistwhich stands in the same relation to a hegelian that a small dog does to a large catexasperated him he loathed laxton detested rampound pilby and fearedas far as he was capable of fearing anythingcaptain douglas there was no refuge no soul in the house to whom he could turn for consolation and protection from these others slinker bond could talk only of the affairs of the party and the lord chancellor being lord chancellor had long since lost any interest in the affairs of the party woodenhouse could talk of nothing the women were astonishingly negligible there were practically no pretty women there ought always to be pretty young women for a lord chancellor pretty young women who can at least seem to listen and he was atrociously thirsty his room was supplied only with waterstuff you use to clean your teethand nothing else no good thinking about it he decided that the best thing he could do to compose himself before turning in would be to sit down at the writingtable and write a few sheets of hegelianabout that infinity article in the hibbert there is indeed no better consolation for a troubled mind than the hegelian exercises they lift it aboveeverything he took off his coat and sat down to this beautiful amusement but he had scarcely written a page before his thirst became a torment he kept thinking of that great tumbler woodenhouse had heldsparkling golden cooland stimulating what he wanted was a good stiff whisky and a cigar one of laxtons cigars the only good thing in his entertainment so far and then philosophy even as a student he had been a worker of the teutonic typenever abstemious he thought of ringing and demanding these comforts and then it occurred to him that it was a little late to ring for things why not fetch them from the study himself he opened his door and looked out upon the great staircase it was a fine piece of work that staircase low broad dignified there seemed to be nobody about the lights were still on he listened for a little while and then put on his coat and went with a soft swiftness that was still quite dignified downstairs to the study the study redolent of sir peter he made his modest collection lord moggeridge came nearer to satisfaction as he emerged from the study that night at shonts than at any other moment during this illadvised weekend in his pocket were four thoroughly good cigars in one hand he held a cut glass decanter of whisky in the other a capacious tumbler under his arm with that confidence in the unlimited portative power of his arm that nothing could shake he had tucked the syphon his soul rested upon the edge of tranquillity like a bird that has escaped the fowler he was already composing his next sentence about that new variety of infinity then something struck him from behind and impelled him forward a couple of paces it was something hairy something in the nature he thought afterwards of a worn broom and also there were two other things softer and a little higher on each side then it was he made that noise like the young of some large animal he dropped the glass in a hasty attempt to save the syphon what in the name of heaven he cried and found himself alone captain douglas the thought leapt to his mind but indeed it was not captain douglas it was bealby bealby in panic flight from thomas and how was bealby to know that this large richly laden man was the lord chancellor of england never before had bealby seen anyone in evening dress except a butler and so he supposed this was just some larger finer kind of butler that they kept upstairs some larger finer kind of butler blocking the path of escape bealby had taken in the situation with the rapidity of a hunted animal the massive form blocked the door to the left in the playground of the village school bealby had been preminent for his dodging he moved as quickly as a lizard his little hands his head poised with the skill of a practised butter came against that mighty back and then bealby had dodged into the study but it seemed to lord moggeridge staggering over his broken glass and circling about defensively that this fearful indignity could come only from captain douglas foolery blup blup sham poltergeist imbeciles he said as much believing that this young man and possibly confederates were within hearing he said as muchhotly he went on to remark of an unphilosophical tendency about captain douglas generally and about army officers practical joking laxtons hospitalities shonts thomas you will remember heard him nothing came of it no answer not a word of apology at last in a great dudgeon and with a kind of wariness about his back the lord chancellor with things more spoilt for him than ever went on his way upstairs when the green baize door opened behind him he turned like a shot and a large foolishfaced butler appeared lord moggeridge with a sceptrelike motion of the decanter very quietly and firmly asked him a simple question and then then the lunatic must needs leap up three stairs and dive suddenly and upsettingly at his legs lord moggeridge was paralyzed with amazement his legs were struck from under him he uttered one brief topographical cry to sir peter unfortunately it sounded like help for a few seconds the impressions that rushed upon lord moggeridge were too rapid for adequate examination he had a compelling fancy to kill butlers things culminated in a pistol shot and then he found himself sitting on the landing beside a disgracefully dishevelled manservant and his host was running downstairs to them with a revolver in his hand on occasion lord moggeridge could produce a tremendous voice he did so now for a moment he stared panting at sir peter and then emphasized by a pointing finger came the voice never had it been so charged with emotion what does this mean you sir he shouted what does this mean it was exactly what sir peter had intended to say explanations are detestable things and anyhow it isnt right to address your host as you sir throughout the evening the persuasion had grown in lady laxtons mind that all was not going well with the lord chancellor it was impossible to believe he was enjoying himself but she did not know how to give things a turn for the better clever women would have known but she was so convinced she was not clever that she did not even try thing after thing had gone wrong how was she to know that there were two sorts of philosophyquite different she had thought philosophy was philosophy but it seemed that there were these two sorts if not more a round large sort that talked about the absolute and was scornfully superior and rather irascible and a jabbypointed sort that called people tender or tough and was generally much too familiar to bring them together was just mixing trouble there ought to be little books for hostesses explaining these things then it was extraordinary that the lord chancellor who was so tremendously large and clever wouldnt go and talk to mrs rampound pilby who was also so tremendously large and clever repeatedly lady laxton had tried to get them into touch with one another until at last the lord chancellor had said distinctly and deliberately when she had suggested his going across to the eminent writer god forbid her dream of a large clever duologue that she could afterwards recall with pleasure was altogether shattered she thought the lord chancellor uncommonly hard to please these werent the only people for him why couldnt he chat party secrets with slinker bond or say things to lord woodenhouse you could say anything you liked to lord woodenhouse or talk with mr timbre mrs timbre had given him an excellent opening she had asked wasnt it a dreadful anxiety always to have the great seal to mind he had simply grunted and then why did he keep on looking so dangerously at captain douglas perhaps tomorrow things would take a turn for the better one can at least be hopeful even if one is not clever one can be that from such thoughts as these it was that this unhappy hostess was roused by a sound of smashing glass a rumpus and a pistol shot she stood up she laid her hand on her heart she said oh and gripped her dressingtable for support after a long time and when it seemed that it was now nothing more than a hubbub of voices in which her husbands could be distinguished clearly she crept out very softly upon the upper landing she perceived her cousin captain douglas looking extremely fair and frail and untrustworthy in a much too gorgeous kimono dressinggown of embroidered japanese silk i can assure you my lord he was saying in a strange highpitched deliberate voice onmywordofhonourasasoldier that i know absolutely nothing about it sure it wasnt all imagination my lord sir peter asked with his inevitable infelicity she decided to lean over the balustrading and ask very quietly and clearly lord moggeridge please is anything the matter all human beings are egotists but there is no egotism to compare with the egotism of the very young bealby was so much the centre of his world that he was incapable of any interpretation of this shouting and uproar this smashing of decanters and firing of pistol shots except in reference to himself he supposed it to be a hue and cry he supposed that he was being huntedhunted by a pack of great butlers hounded on by the irreparably injured thomas the thought of upstairs gentlefolks passed quite out of his mind he snatched up a faked syrian dagger that lay in the capacity of a paper knife on the study table concealed himself under the chintz valance of a sofa adjusted its rumpled skirts neatly and awaited the issue of events for a time events did not issue they remained talking noisily upon the great staircase bealby could not hear what was said but most of what was said appeared to be flat contradiction perchance whispered bealby to himself gathering courage perchance we have eluded them a breathing space at last a womans voice mingled with the others and seemed a little to assuage them then it seemed to bealby that they were dispersing to beat the house for him goodnight again then said someone that puzzled him but he decided it was a blind he remained very very still he heard a clicking in the apartmentthe blue parlour it was calledbetween the study and the diningroom electric light then some one came into the study bealbys eye was as close to the ground as he could get it he was breathless he moved his head with an immense circumspection the valance was translucent but not transparent below it there was a crack of vision a strip of carpet the castors of chairs among these things he perceived feetnot ankles it did not go up to that but just feet large flattish feet a pair they stood still and bealbys hand lighted on the hilt of his dagger the person above the feet seemed to be surveying the room or reflecting drunk old fools either drunk or mad thats about the truth of it said a voice mergleson angry but parroty and unmistakable the feet went across to the table and there were faint sounds of refreshment discreetly administered then a moment of profound stillness ah said the voice at last a voice renewed then the feet went to the passage door halted in the doorway there was a double click the lights went out bealby was in absolute darkness then a distant door closed and silence followed upon the dark mr mergleson descended to a pantry ablaze with curiosity the lord chancellors going dotty said mr mergleson replying to the inevitable question thats whats up i tried to save the blessed syphon said mr mergleson pursuing his narrative and e sprang on me like a leppard i suppose e thought i wanted to take it away from im ed broke a glass already owi dont know there it was lying on the landing eres where e bit my and said mr mergleson a curious little sideissue occurred to thomas wheres young kicker all this time he asked lord said mr mergleson all them other things they clean drove im out of my ed i suppose es up there hiding somewhere he paused his eye consulted the eye of thomas es got behind a curtain or something said mr mergleson queer where e can ave got to said mr mergleson cant be bothered about im said mr mergleson i expect hell sneak down to is room when things are quiet said thomas after reflection no good going and looking for im now said mr mergleson things upstairsthey got to settle down but in the small hours mr mergleson awakened and thought of bealby and wondered whether he was in bed this became so great an uneasiness that about the hour of dawn he got up and went along the passage to bealbys compartment bealby was not there and his bed had not been slept in that sinister sense of gathering misfortunes which comes to all of us at times in the small hours was so strong in the mind of mr mergleson that he went on and told thomas of this disconcerting fact thomas woke with difficulty and rather crossly but sat up at last alive to the gravity of mr merglesons mood if es found hiding about upstairs after all this upset said mr mergleson and left the rest of the sentence to a sympathetic imagination now its light said mr mergleson after a slight pause i think we better just go round and ave a look for im both of us so thomas clad himself provisionally and the two manservants went upstairs very softly and began a series of furtive sweeping movementsvery much in the spirit of lord kitcheners historical sweeping movements in the transvaalthrough the stately old rooms in which bealby must be lurking man is the most restless of animals there is an incessant urgency in his nature he never knows when he is well off and so it was that bealbys comparative security under the sofa became presently too irksome to be endured he seemed to himself to stay there for ages but as a matter of fact he stayed there only twenty minutes then with eyes tempered to the darkness he first struck out an alert attentive head then crept out and remained for the space of half a minute on all fours surveying the indistinct blacknesses about him then he knelt up then he stood up then with arms extended and cautious steps he began an exploration of the apartment the passion for exploration grows with what it feeds upon presently bealby was feeling his way into the blue parlour and then round by its shuttered and curtained windows to the diningroom his head was now full of the idea of some shelter more permanent less pervious to housemaids than that sofa he knew enough now of domestic routines to know that upstairs in the early morning was much routed by housemaids he found many perplexing turns and corners and finally got into the diningroom fireplace where it was very dark and kicked against some fireirons that made his heart beat fast for a time then groping on past it he found in the darkness what few people could have found in the day the stud that released the panel that hid the opening of the way that led to the priest hole he felt the thing open and halted perplexed in that corner there wasnt a ray of light for a long time he was trying to think what this opening could be and then he concluded it was some sort of back way from downstairs well anyhow it was all exploring with an extreme gingerliness he got himself through the panel he closed it almost completely behind him careful investigation brought him to the view that he was in a narrow passage of brick or stone that came in a score of paces to a spiral staircase going both up and down up this he went and presently breathed cool night air and had a glimpse of stars through a narrow slitlike window almost blocked by ivy thenwhat was very disagreeablesomething scampered when bealbys heart recovered he went on up again he came to the priest hole a capacious cell six feet square with a bench bed and a little table and chair it had a small door upon the stairs that was open and a niche cupboard here he remained for a time then restlessness made him explore a cramped passage he had to crawl along it for some yards that came presently into a curious space with wood on one side and stone on the other then ahead most blessed thing he saw light he went blundering toward it and then stopped appalled from the other side of this wooden wall to the right of him had come a voice come in said the voice a rich masculine voice that seemed scarcely two yards away bealby became rigid then after a long interval he movedas softly as he could the voice soliloquized bealby listened intently and then when all was still again crept forward two paces more towards the gleam it was a peephole the unseen speaker was walking about bealby listened and the sound of his beating heart mingled with the pad pad of slippered footsteps then with a brilliant effort his eye was at the chink all was still again for a time he was perplexed by what he saw a large pink shining dome against a deep greenish grey background at the base of the dome was a kind of interrupted hedge brown and leafless then he realized that he was looking at the top of a head and two enormous eyebrows the rest was hidden nature surprised bealby into a penetrating sniff now said the occupant of the room and suddenly he was standing upbealby saw a long hairy neck sticking out of a dressinggownand walking to the side of the room i wont stand it said the great voice i wont stand it apes foolery then the lord chancellor began rapping at the panelling about his apartment hollow it all sounds hollow only after a long interval did he resume his writing all night long that rat behind the wainscot troubled the lord chancellor whenever he spoke whenever he moved about it was still whenever he composed himself to write it began to rustle and blunder again and again it sniffedan annoying kind of sniff at last the lord chancellor gave up his philosophical relaxation and went to bed turned out the lights and attempted sleep but this only intensified his sense of an uneasy sniffing presence close to him when the light was out it seemed to him that this thing whatever it was instantly came into the room and set the floor creaking and snapping a thing perpetually attempting something and perpetually thwarted the lord chancellor did not sleep a wink the first feeble infiltration of day found him sitting up in bed wearily wrathful and now surely someone was going along the passage outside a great desire to hurt somebody very much seized upon the lord chancellor perhaps he might hurt that dismal farceur upon the landing no doubt it was douglas sneaking back to his own room after the nights efforts the lord chancellor slipped on his dressinggown of purple silk very softly indeed did he open his bedroom door and very warily peep out he heard the soft pad of feet upon the staircase he crept across the broad passage to the beautiful old balustrading down below he saw merglesonmergleson againin a shameful deshabillegoing like a snake like a slinking cat like an assassin into the door of the study rage filled the great mans soul gathering up the skirts of his dressinggown he started in a swift yet noiseless pursuit he followed mergleson through the little parlour and into the diningroom and then he saw it all there was a panel open and mergleson very cautiously going in of course they had got at him through the priest hole they had been playing on his nerves all night they had been doing itno doubt in relays the whole house was in this conspiracy with his eyebrows spread like the wings of a fighting cock the lord chancellor in five vast noiseless strides had crossed the intervening space and gripped the butler by his collarless shirt as he was disappearing it was like a hawk striking a sparrow mergleson felt himself clutched glanced over his shoulder and seeing that fierce familiar face again close to his own pitiless vindictive lost all sense of human dignity and yelled like a lost soul sir peter laxton was awakened from an uneasy sleep by the opening of the dressingroom door that connected his room with his wifes he sat up astonished and stared at her white face its pallor exaggerated by the cold light of dawn peter she said im sure theres something more going on something more going on somethingshouting and swearing you dont mean she nodded the lord chancellor she said in an awestricken whisper hes at it again downstairs in the diningroom sir peter seemed disposed at first to receive this quite passively then he flashed into extravagant wrath im damned he cried jumping violently out of bed if im going to stand this not if he was a hundred lord chancellors hes turning the place into a bally lunatic asylum onceone might excuse but to start in again whats that they both stood still listening faintly yet quite distinctly came the agonized cry of some imperfectly educated personelp here wheres my trousers cried sir peter hes murdering mergleson there isnt a moment to lose until sir peter returned lady laxton sat quite still just as he had left her on his bed aghast she could not even pray the sun had still to rise the room was full of that cold weak inky light light without warmth knowledge without faith existence without courage that creeps in before the day she waited in such a mood women have waited for massacre downstairs a raucous shouting she thought of her happy childhood upon the yorkshire wolds before the idea of weekend parties had entered her mind the heather the little birds kind things a tear ran down her cheek then sir peter stood before her again alive still but breathless and greatly ruffled she put her hands to her heart she would be brave yes she said tell me hes as mad as a hatter said sir peter she nodded for more she knew that has hekilled anyone she whispered he looked uncommonly like trying said sir peter she nodded her lips tightly compressed says douglas will either have to leave the house or he does butdouglas i know but he wont hear a word but why douglas i tell you hes as mad as a hatter got persecution mania people tapping and bells ringing under his pillow all nightthat sort of idea and furious i tell youhe frightened me he was awful hes given mergleson a black eye hit him you know with his fist caught him in the passage to the priest holehow they got there i dont knowand went for him like a madman but what has douglas done i know i asked him but he wont listen hes just off his head says douglas has got the whole household trying to work a ghost on him i tell youhes off his nut husband and wife looked at each other of course if douglas didnt mind just going off to oblige me said sir peter at last it might calm him he explained you see its all so infernally awkward is he back in his room yes waiting for me to decide about douglas walking up and down for a little while their minds remained prostrate and inactive id been so looking forward to the lunch she said with a joyless smile the county she could not go on you know said sir peter one thingill see to it myself i wont have him have a single drop of liquor more if we have to search his room what i shall say to him at breakfast she said i dont know sir peter reflected theres no earthly reason why you should be brought into it at all your line is to know nothing about it show him you know nothing about it ask himask him if hes had a good night chapter iii the wanderers never had the gracious eastward face of shonts looked more beautiful than it did on the morning of the lord chancellors visit it glowed as translucent as amber lit by flames its two towers were pillars of pale gold it looked over its slopes and parapets upon a great valley of mistbarred freshness through which the distant river shone like a snake of light the southwest faade was still in the shadow and the ivy hung from it darkly greener than the greenest green the stainedglass windows of the old chapel reflected the sunrise as though lamps were burning inside along the terrace a pensive peacock trailed his sheathed splendours through the dew amidst the ivy was a fuss of birds and presently there was pushed out from amidst the ivy at the foot of the eastward tower a little brownish buff thing that seemed as natural there as a squirrel or a rabbit it was a heada ruffled human head it remained still for a moment contemplating the calm spaciousness of terrace and garden and countryside then it emerged further and rotated and surveyed the house above it its expression was one of alert caution its natural freshness and innocence were a little marred by an enormous transverse smudge a barsinister of smut and the elfin delicacy of the left ear was festooned with a cobwebprobably a genuine antique it was the face of bealby he was considering the advisability of leaving shontsfor good presently his decision was made his hands and shoulders appeared following his head and then a dusty but undamaged bealby was running swiftly towards the corner of the shrubbery he crouched lest at any moment that pursuing pack of butlers should see him and give tongue in another moment he was hidden from the house altogether and rustling his way through a thicket of budding rhododendra after those dirty passages the morning air was wonderfully sweetbut just a trifle hungry grazing deer saw bealby fly across the park stared at him for a time with great gentle unintelligent eyes and went on feeding they saw him stop ever and again he was snatching at mushrooms that he devoured forthwith as he sped on on the edge of the beechwoods he paused and glanced back at shonts then his eyes rested for a moment on the clump of trees through which one saw a scrap of the head gardeners cottage a bit of the garden wall a physiognomist might have detected a certain lack of selfconfidence in bealbys eyes but his spirit was not to be quelled slowly joylessly perhaps but with a grave determination he raised his hand in that prehistoric gesture of the hand and face by which youth since ever there was youth has asserted the integrity of its soul against established and predominant things ketch me said bealby bealby left shonts about halfpast four in the morning he went westward because he liked the company of his shadow and was amused at first by its vast length by halfpast eight he had covered ten miles and he was rather bored by his shadow he had eaten nine raw mushrooms two green apples and a quantity of unripe blackberries none of these things seemed quite at home in him and he had discovered himself to be wearing slippers they were stout carpet slippers but still they were slippersand the road was telling on them at the ninth mile the left one began to give on the outer seam he got over a stile into a path that ran through the corner of a wood and there he met a smell of frying bacon that turned his very soul to gastric juice he stopped short and sniffed the airand the air itself was sizzling oh krikey said bealby manifestly to the spirit of the world this is a bit too strong i wasnt thinking much before then he saw something bright yellow and bulky just over the hedge from this it was that the sound of frying came he went to the hedge making no effort to conceal himself outside a great yellow caravan with dainty little windows stood a largish dark woman in a deerstalker hat a short brown skirt a large white apron and spatterdashes among other things frying bacon and potatoes in a frying pan she was very red in the face and the frying pan was spitting at her as frying pans do at a timid cook quite mechanically bealby scrambled through the hedge and drew nearer this divine smell the woman scrutinized him for a moment and then blinking and averting her face went on with her cookery bealby came quite close to her and remained noting the bits of potato that swam about in the pan the jolly curling of the rashers the dancing of the bubbles the hymning splash and splutter of the happy fat if it should ever fall to my lot to be cooked may i be fried in potatoes and butter may i be fried with potatoes and good butter made from the milk of the cow god send i am spared boiling the prison of the pot the rattling lid the evil darkness the greasy water i suppose said the lady prodding with her fork at the bacon i suppose you call yourself a boy yes miss said bealby have you ever fried i could miss like this better just lay hold of this handlefor its scorching the skin off my face i am she seemed to think for a moment and added entirely in silence bealby grasped that exquisite smell by the handle he took the fork from her hand and put his hungry eager nose over the seething mess it wasnt only bacon there were onions onions giving itan edge it cut to the quick of appetite he could have wept with the intensity of his sensations a voice almost as delicious as the smell came out of the caravan window behind bealbys head judy cried the voice herei meanits here i am said the lady in the deerstalker judyyou didnt take my stockings for your own by any chance the lady in the deerstalker gave way to delighted horror sssh mavourneen she criedshe was one of that large class of amiable women who are more irish than they need betheres a boy here there was indeed an almost obsequiously industrious and obliging boy an hour later he was no longer a boy but the boy and three friendly women were regarding him with a merited approval he had done the frying renewed a waning fire with remarkable skill and dispatch reboiled a neglected kettle in the shortest possible time laid almost without direction a simple meal very exactly set out campstools and cleaned the frying pan marvellously hardly had they taken their portions of that appetizing savouriness than he had whipped off with that implement gone behind the caravan busied himself there and returned with the panglittering bright himself if possible brighter one cheek indeed shone with an animated glow but wasnt there some of the bacon and stuff left asked the lady in the deerstalker i didnt think it was wanted miss said bealby so i cleared it up he met understanding in her eye he questioned her expression maynt i wash up for you miss he asked to relieve the tension he washed up swiftly and cleanly he had never been able to wash up to mr merglesons satisfaction before but now he did everything mr mergleson had ever told him he asked where to put the things away and he put them away then he asked politely if there was anything else he could do for them questioned he said he liked doing things you havent said the lady in the deerstalker a taste for cleaning boots bealby declared he had surely said a voice that bealby adored tis an angel from heaven he had a taste for cleaning boots this was an extraordinary thing for bealby to say but a great change had come to him in the last halfhour he was violently anxious to do things any sort of things servile things for a particular person he was in love the owner of the beautiful voice had come out of the caravan she had stood for a moment in the doorway before descending the steps to the ground and the soul of bealby had bowed down before her in instant submission never had he seen anything so lovely her straight slender body was sheathed in blue fair hair a little tinged with red poured gloriously back from her broad forehead and she had the sweetest eyes in the world one hand lifted her dress from her feet the other rested on the lintel of the caravan door she looked at him and smiled so for two years she had looked and smiled across the footlights to the bealby in mankind she had smiled now on her entrance out of habit she took the effect upon bealby as a foregone conclusion then she had looked to make sure that everything was ready before she descended how good it smells judy she had said ive had a helper said the woman who wore spats that time the blueeyed lady had smiled at him quite definitely the third member of the party had appeared unobserved the irradiations of the beautiful lady had obscured her bealby discovered her about she was bareheaded she wore a simple grey dress with a norfolk jacket and she had a pretty clear white profile under black hair she answered to the name of winnie the beautiful lady was madeleine they made little obscure jokes with each other and praised the morning ardently this is the best place of all said madeleine all night said winnie not a single mosquito none of these three ladies made any attempt to conceal the sincerity of their hunger or their appreciation of bealbys assistance how good a thing is appreciation here he was doing with joy and pride and an eager excellence the very services he had done so badly under the cuffings of mergleson and thomas and now bealby having been regarded with approval for some moments and discussed in tantalizing undertones was called upon to explain himself boy said the lady in the deerstalker who was evidently the leader and still more evidently the spokeswoman of the party come here yes miss he put down the boot he was cleaning on the caravan step in the first place know by these presents i am a married woman yes miss and miss is not a seemly mode of address for me no miss i mean bealby hung for a moment and by the happiest of accidents a scrap of his instruction at shonts came up in his mind no he said yourladyship a great light shone on the spokeswomans face not yet my child she said not yet he hasnt done his duty by me i ama simple mum bealby was intelligently silent sayyes mum yes mum said bealby and everybody laughed very agreeably and now said the lady taking pleasure in her words know by these presentsby the bye what is your name bealby scarcely hesitated dick maltravers mum he said and almost added the dauntless daredevil of the diamondfields horse which was the second title dick will do said the lady who was called judy and added suddenly and very amusingly you may keep the rest these were the sort of people bealby liked the right sort well dick we want to know have you ever been in service it was sudden but bealby was equal to it only for a day or two missi mean mumjust to be useful were you useful bealby tried to think whether he had been and could recall nothing but the face of thomas with the fork hanging from it i did my best mum he said impartially and all that is over yes mum and youre at home again and out of employment yes mum do you live near here noleastways not very far with your father stepfather mum im a norfan well how would you like to come with us for a few days and help with things sevenandsixpence a week bealbys face was eloquent would your stepfather object bealby considered i dont think he would he said youd better go round and ask him isupposeyes he said and get a few things things mum collars and things you neednt bring a great box for such a little while yes mum he hovered rather undecidedly better run along now our man and horse will be coming presently we shant be able to wait for you long bealby assumed a sudden briskness and departed at the gate of the field he hesitated almost imperceptibly and then directed his face to the sabbath stillness of the village perplexity corrugated his features the stepfathers permission presented no difficulties but it was more difficult about the luggage a voice called after him yes mum he said attentive and hopeful perhapssomehowthey wouldnt want luggage youll want boots youll have to walk by the caravan you know youll want some good stout boots all right mum he said with a sorrowful break in his voice he waited a few moments but nothing more came he went onvery slowly he had forgotten about the boots that defeated him it is hard to be refused admission to paradise for the want of a handbag and a pair of walkingboots bealby was by no means certain that he was going back to that caravan he wanted to do so quite painfully but hed just look a fool going back without boots andnothing on earth would reconcile him to the idea of looking a fool in the eyes of that beautiful woman in blue dick he whispered to himself despondently daredevil dick a more miserablelooking face you never set eyes on its all up with your little schemes dick my boy you must get a bagand nothing on earth will get you a bag he paid little heed to the village through which he wandered he knew there were no bags there chance rather than any volition of his own guided him down a side path that led to the nearly dry bed of a little rivulet and there he sat down on some weedy grass under a group of willows it was an untidy place that needed all the sunshine of the morning to be tolerable one of those places where stinging nettles take heart and people throw old kettles broken gallipots jaded gravel grass cuttings rusty rubbish old boots for a time bealbys eyes rested on the objects with an entire lack of interest then he was reminded of his not so very remote childhood when he had found an old boot and made it into a castle presently he got up and walked across to the rubbish heap and surveyed its treasures with a quickened intelligence he picked up a widowed boot and weighed it in his hand he dropped it abruptly turned about and hurried back into the village street he had ideas two ideas one for the luggage and one for the boots if only he could manage it hope beat his great pinions in the heart of bealby sunday the shops were shut yes that was a fresh obstacle hed forgotten that the publichouse stood bashfully open the shy uninviting openness of sunday morning before closing time but publichouses alas at all hours are forbidden to little boys and besides he wasnt likely to get what he wanted in a publichouse he wanted a shop a general shop and here before him was the general shopand its door ajar his desire carried him over the threshold the sabbatical shutters made the place dark and cool and the smell of bacon and cheese and chandleries the very spirit of grocery calm and unhurried was cool and sabbatical too as if it sat there for the day in its best clothes and a pleasant woman was talking over the counter to a thin and worried one who carried a bundle their intercourse had a flavour of emergency and they both stopped abruptly at the appearance of bealby his desire his craving was now so great that it had altogether subdued the natural wiriness of his appearance he looked meek he looked good he was swimming in propitiation and tender with respect he produced an effect of being much smaller he had got nice eyes his movements were refined and his manners perfect not doing business today my boy said the pleasant woman oh please m he said from his heart sunday you know oh please m if you could just give me a nold sheet of paper m please what for asked the pleasant woman just to wrap something up m she reflected and natural goodness had its way with her a nice big bit said the woman please m would you like it brown oh please m and you got some string only cottony stuff said bealby disembowelling a trouser pocket wiv knots but i dessay i can manage youd better have a bit of good string with it my dear said the pleasant woman whose generosity was now fairly on the run then you can do your parcel up nice and tidy the white horse was already in the shafts of the caravan and william a deaf and clumsy man of uncertain age and a vast sharp nosiness was lifting in the basket of breakfast gear and grumbling in undertones at the wickedness and unfairness of travelling on sunday when bealby returned to gladden three waiting women ah said the inconspicuous lady i knew hed come look at his poor little precious parsivel said the actress regarded as luggage it was rather pitiful a knobby brown paper parcel about the sizeto be perfectly frankof a tin can two old boots and some grass very carefully folded and tied upand carried gingerly but the lady in the deerstalker began and then paused dick she said as he came nearer wheres your boots oh please mum said the dauntless one they was away being mended my stepfather thought perhaps you wouldnt mind if i didnt have boots he said perhaps i might be able to get some more boots out of my salary the lady in the deerstalker looked alarmingly uncertain and bealby controlled infinite distresses havent you got a mother dick asked the beautiful voice suddenly its owner abounded in such spasmodic curiosities shelast year matricide is a painful business at any time and just as you see in spite of every effort you have made the jolliest lark in the world slipping out of your reach and the sweet voice so sorry for him so sorry bealby suddenly veiled his face with his elbow and gave way to honourable tears a simultaneous desire to make him happy help him to forget his loss possessed three women thatll be all right dick said the lady in the deerstalker patting his shoulder well get you some boots tomorrow and today you must sit up beside william and spare your feet youll have to go to the inns with him its wonderful the elasticity of youth said the inconspicuous lady five minutes later to see that boy now youd never imagine hed had a sorrow in the world now get up there said the lady who was the leader we shall walk across the fields and join you later you understand where you are to wait for us william she came nearer and shouted you understand william william nodded ambiguously ent a vool he said the ladies departed youll be all right dick cried the actress kindly he sat up where he had been put trying to look as orphan dick as possible after all that had occurred do you know the wind on the heathhave you lived the gypsy life have you spoken wanderers yourselves with romany chi and romany chal on the windswept moors at home or abroad have you tramped the broad highways and at close of day pitched your tent near a running stream and cooked your supper by starlight over a fire of pinewood do you know the dreamless sleep of the wanderer at peace with himself and all the world for most of us the answer to these questions of the amateur camping club is in the negative yet every year the call of the road the borrovian glamour draws away a certain small number of the imaginative from the grosser comforts of a complex civilization takes them out into tents and caravans and intimate communion with nature and incidentally with various ingenious appliances designed to meet the needs of cooking in a breeze it is an adventure to which high spirits and great expectations must be brought it is an experience in proximity which few friendships surviveand altogether very great fun the life of breezy freedom resolves itself in practice chiefly into washing up and an anxious search for permission to camp one learns how rich and fruitful our world can be in bystanders and how easy it is to forget essential groceries the heart of the joy of it lies in its perfect detachment there you are in the morning sunlight under the trees that overhang the road going whither you will everything you need you have your van creaks along at your side you are outside inns outside houses a home a community an imperium in imperio at any moment you may draw out of the traffic upon the wayside grass and say hereuntil the owner catches us at itis home at any timesubject to the complaisance of william and your being able to find himyou may inspan and go onward the world is all before you you taste the complete yet leisurely insouciance of the snail and two of those three ladies had other satisfactions to supplement their pleasures they both adored madeleine philips she was not only perfectly sweet and lovely but she was known to be so she had that most potent charm for women prestige they had got her all to themselves they could show now how false is the old idea that there is no friendship nor conversation among women they were full of wit and pretty things for one another and snatches of song in between and they were free too from their menfolk they were doing without them dr bowles the husband of the lady in the deerstalker was away in ireland and mr geedge the lord of the inconspicuous woman was golfing at sandwich and madeleine philips it was understood was only too glad to shake herself free from the crowd of admirers that hovered about her like wasps about honey yet after three days each one had thoughts about the need of helpfulness and more particularly about washingup that were better left unspoken that were indeed conspicuously unspoken beneath their merry give and take like a black and silent river flowing beneath a bridge of ivory and each of them had a curious feeling in the midst of all this fresh free behaviour as though the others were not listening sufficiently as though something of the effect of them was being wasted madeleines smiles became rarer at times she was almost impassive and judy preserved nearly all her wit and verbal fireworks for the times when they passed through villages mrs geedge was less visibly affected she had thoughts of writing a book about it all telling in the gayest most provocative way full of the quietest quaintest humour just how jolly they had been menfolk would read it this kept a little thin smile upon her lips as an audience william was tough stuff he pretended deafness he never looked he did not want to look he seemed always to be holding his nose in front of his face to prevent his observationas men pray into their hats at church but once judy bowles overheard a phrase or so in his private soliloquy pack o wimmin william was saying dratted petticoats dang em thats what i say to um dang em as a matter of fact he just fell short of saying it to them but his manner said it you begin to see how acceptable an addition was young bealby to this company he was not only helpful immensely helpful in things material a vigorous and at first a careful washerup an energetic bootpolisher a most serviceable cleaner and tidier of things but he was also belief and support undisguisedly he thought the caravan the loveliest thing going and its three mistresses the most wonderful of people his alert eyes followed them about full of an unstinted admiration and interest he pricked his ears when judy opened her mouth he handed things to mrs geedge he made no secret about madeleine when she spoke to him he lost his breath he reddened and was embarrassed they went across the fields saying that he was the luckiest of finds it was fortunate his people had been so ready to spare him judy said boys were a race very cruelly maligned see how willing he was mrs geedge said there was something elfin about bealbys little face madeleine smiled at the thought of his quaint artlessness she knew quite clearly that hed die for her there was a little pause as the ladies moved away then william spat and spoke in a note of irrational bitterness brasted voolery said william and then loudly and fiercely cam up yode runt you at these words the white horse started into a convulsive irregular redistribution of its feet the caravan strained and quivered into motion and bealbys wanderings as a caravanner began for a time william spoke no more and bealby scarcely regarded him the light of strange fortunes and deep enthusiasm was in bealbys eyes one thing said william they dont ave the sense to lock anythink upwhatever bealbys attention was recalled to the existence of his companion williams face was one of those faces that give one at first the impression of a solitary and very conceited nose the other features are entirely subordinated to that salient effect one sees them later his eyes were small and uneven his mouth apparently toothless thinlipped and crumpled with the upper lip falling over the other in a manner suggestive of a meagre firmness mixed with appetite when he spoke he made a faint slobbering sound everyfink he said behind there he became confidential i been in there i larked about wiv their fings they got some choclate he said lusciously oo fine all sorts of fings he did not seem to expect any reply from bealby we going far before we meet em asked bealby williams deafness became apparent his mind was preoccupied by other ideas one wicked eye came close to bealbys face we going to ave a bit of choclate he said in a wet desirous voice he pointed his thumb over his shoulder at the door you get it said william with reassuring nods and the mouth much pursed and very oblique bealby shook his head its in a little dror under er place where she sleeps bealbys headshake became more emphatic yus i tell you said william no said bealby choclate i tell you said william and ran the tongue of appetite round the rim of his toothless mouth dont want choclate said bealby thinking of a large lump of it go on said william nobody wont see you go it said william youre afraid said william here ill go said william losing selfcontrol you just old these reins bealby took the reins william got up and opened the door of the caravan then bealby realized his moral responsibilityand leaving the reins clutched william firmly by his baggy nether garments they were elderly garments much sat upon dont be a vool said william struggling leago my slack something partially gave way and williams head came round to deal with bealby what you mean pullin my cloes orf me thathe investigated take me a nour to sew up i aint going to steal shouted bealby into the ear of william nobody arst you to steal nor you neither said bealby the caravan bumped heavily against a low garden wall skidded a little and came to rest william sat down suddenly the white horse after a period of confusion with its legs tried the flavour of some overhanging lilac branches and was content gimme those reins said william you be the brastedest young vool sittin ere said william presently chewin our teeth when we might be eatin choclate i ent got no use for you said william blowed if i ave then the thought of his injuries returned to him id make you sew em up yourself darned if i wountony youd go running the brasted needle into me nours work there isby the feel of it morn nour goddobe done too all i got ill give you sumpfin you little beace fore i done wi you i wouldnt steal er choclates said young bealby not if i was starving eh shouted william steal shouted bealby ill steal ye fore i done with ye said william tearin my cloes for me oh cam up yold runt we dont want you to stop and lissen cam up i tell you they found the ladies rather it seemed by accident than design waiting upon a sandy common rich with purple heather and bordered by woods of fir and spruce they had been waiting some time and it was clear that the sight of the yellow caravan relieved an accumulated anxiety bealby rejoiced to see them his soul glowed with the pride of chocolate resisted and william overcome he resolved to distinguish himself over the preparation of the midday meal it was a pleasant little island of green they chose for their midday pitch a little patch of emerald turf amidst the purple a patch already doomed to removal as a bare oblong and a pile of rolledup turfs witnessed this pile and a little bank of heather and bramble promised shelter from the breeze and down the hill a hundred yards away was a spring and a builtup pool this spot lay perhaps fifty yards away from the high road and one reached it along a rutty track which had been made by the turf cutters and overhead was the glorious sky of an english summer with great clouds like sunlit whitesailed ships the constable sky the white horse was hobbled and turned out to pasture among the heather and william was sent off to get congenial provender at the nearest public house william shouted mrs bowles as he departed shouting confidentially into his ear get your clothes mended eh said william mend your clothes yah e did that said william viciously with a movement of selfprotection and so went nobody watched him go almost sternly they set to work upon the luncheon preparation as william receded william mrs bowles remarked as she bustled with the patent cooker putting it up wrong way round so that afterwards it collapsed williamtakes offence sometimes i think he takes offence almost too often did you have any difficulty with him dick it wasnt anything miss said bealby meekly bealby was wonderful with the firelighting and except that he cracked a plate in warming it quite admirable as a cook he burnt his fingers twiceand liked doing it he ate his portion with instinctive modesty on the other side of the caravan and he washed upas mr mergleson had always instructed him to do mrs bowles showed him how to clean knives and forks by sticking them into the turf a little to his surprise these ladies lit and smoked cigarettes they sat about and talked perplexingly clever stuff then he had to get water from the neighbouring brook and boil the kettle for an early tea madeleine produced a charmingly bound little book and read in it the other two professed themselves anxious for the view from a neighbouring hill they produced their sensible spiked walking sticks such as one does not see in england they seemed full of energy you go madeleine had said while i and dick stay here and make tea ive walked enough today so bealby happy to the pitch of ecstacy first explored the wonderful interior of the caravanthere was a dresser a stove letdown chairs and tables and all manner of thingsand then nursed the kettle to the singing stage on the patent cooker while the beautiful lady reclined close at hand on a rug dick she said he had forgotten he was dick dick he remembered his personality with a start yes miss he knelt up with a handful of twigs in his hand and regarded her well dick she said he remained in flushed adoration there was a little pause and the lady smiled at him an unaffected smile what are you going to be dick when you grow up i dont know miss ive wondered what would you like to be something abroad somethingso that you could see things a soldier or a sailor miss a sailor sees nothing but the sea id rather be a sailor than a common soldier miss youd like to be an officer yes missonly one of my very best friends is an officer she said a little irrelevantly it seemed to bealby id be a norficer like a shot said bealby if i ad arf a chance miss officers nowadays she said have to be very brave able men i know miss said bealby modestly the fire required attention for a little while the lady turned over on her elbow what do you think you are likely to be dick she asked he didnt know what sort of man is your stepfather bealby looked at her he isnt much he said what is he bealby hadnt the slightest intention of being the son of a gardener es a lawwriter what in that village e as to stay there for is ealth miss he said every summer is ealth is very preprecocious miss he fed his fire with a few judiciously administered twigs what was your own father dick with that she opened a secret door in bealbys imagination all stepchildren have those dreams with him they were so frequent and vivid that they had long since become a kind of second truth he coloured a little and answered with scarcely an interval for reflection e passed as maltravers he said wasnt that his name i dont rightly know miss there was always something kep from me my mother used to say artie she used to say theres things that some day you must know things that concern you things about your farver but poor as we are now and struggling not yet some day you shall know trulywho you are that was ow she said it miss and she died before she told you he had almost forgotten that he had killed his mother that very morning yes miss he said she smiled at him and something in her smile made him blush hotly for a moment he could have believed she understood and indeed she did understand and it amused her to find this boy doingwhat she herself had done at timeswhat indeed she felt it was still in her to do she felt that most delicate of sympathies the sympathy of one rather overimaginative person for another but her next question dispelled his doubt of her though it left him red and hot she asked it with a convincing simplicity have you any idea dick have you any guess or suspicion i mean who it is you really are i wish i had miss he said i suppose it doesnt matter reallybut one cant help wondering how often he had wondered in his lonely wanderings through that dear city of daydreams where all the people one knows look out of windows as one passes and the roads are paved with pride how often had he decided and changed and decided again now suddenly a realization of intrusion shattered this conversation a third person stood over the little encampment smiling mysteriously and waving a cleek in a slow hieratic manner through the air de licious lill corn said the newcomer in tones of benediction he met their enquiring eyes with a luxurious smile licious he said and remained swaying insecurely and failing to express some imperfectly apprehended deep meaning by short peculiar movements of the cleek he was obviously a golfer astray from some adjacent courseand he had lunched mighty join you he said and then very distinctly in a full large voice miss malleleine philps there are the penalties of a public and popular life hes drunk the lady whispered get him to go away dick i cant endure drunken men she stood up and bealby stood up he advanced in front of her slowly with his nose in the air extraordinarily like a small terrier smelling at a strange dog i said mighty join you the golfer repeated his voice was richly excessive he was a big heavy man with a shortcropped moustache a great deal of neck and dewlap and a solemn expression prup ber introzuze mself he remarked he tried to indicate himself by waving his hand towards himself but finally abandoned the attempt as impossible ma goo sochl poshishun he said bealby had a disconcerting sense of retreating footsteps behind him he glanced over his shoulder and saw miss philips standing at the foot of the steps that led up to the fastnesses of the caravan dick she cried with a sharp note of alarm in her voice get rid of that man a moment after bealby heard the door shut and a sound of a key in its lock he concealed his true feelings by putting his arms akimbo sticking his legs wider apart and contemplating the task before him with his head a little on one side he was upheld by the thought that the yellow caravan had a window looking upon him the newcomer seemed to consider the ceremony of introduction completed i done care for goff he said almost vaingloriously he waved his cleek to express his preference natua he said with a satisfaction that bordered on fatuity he prepared to come down from the little turfy crest on which he stood to the encampment ere said bealby this is private the golfer indicated by solemn movements of the cleek that this was understood but that other considerations overrode it youyou got to go cried bealby in a breathless squeak you get out of here the golfer waved an arm as who should say you do not understand but i forgive you and continued to advance towards the fire and then bealby at the end of his tact commenced hostilities he did so because he felt he had to do something and he did not know what else to do wan nothin but frenly conversation sushus custmry webred peel the golfer was saying and then a large fragment of turf hit him in the neck burst all about him and stopped him abruptly he remained for some lengthy moments too astonished for words he was not only greatly surprised but he chose to appear even more surprised than he was in spite of the brownblack mould upon his cheek and brow and a slight displacement of his cap he achieved a sort of dignity he came slowly to a focus upon bealby who stood by the turf pile grasping a second missile the cleek was extended sceptrewise replace thedivot you go orf said bealby ill chuck it if you dont i tell you fair replace thedivot roared the golfer again in a voice of extraordinary power youyou go said bealby am i task you third time reshpectroos replace the divot it struck him fully in the face he seemed to emerge through the mould he was blinking but still dignified thawas intentional he said he seemed to gather himself together then suddenly and with a surprising nimbleness he discharged himself at bealby he came with astonishing swiftness he got within a foot of him well it was for bealby that he had learnt to dodge in the village playground he went down under the golfers arm and away round the end of the stack and the golfer with his force spent in concussion remained for a time clinging to the turf pile and apparently trying to remember how he got there then he was reminded of recent occurrences by a shrill small voice from the other side of the stack you gow away said the voice cant you see youre annoying a lady you gow away nowishnoy anyone pease wall wirl but this was subterfuge he meant to catch that boy suddenly and rather brilliantly he turned the flank of the turf pile and only a couple of loose turfs at the foot of the heap upset his calculations he found himself on all fours on ground from which it was difficult to rise but he did not lose heart boyhicscow he said and became for a second rush a nimble quadruped again he got quite astonishingly near to bealby and then in an instant was on his feet and running across the encampment after him he succeeded in kicking over the kettle and the patent cooker without any injury to himself or loss of pace and succumbed only to the sharp turn behind the end of the caravan and the steps he hadnt somehow thought of the steps so he went down rather heavily but now the spirit of a fine man was roused regardless of the scream from inside that had followed his collapse he was up and in pursuit almost instantly bealby only escaped the swiftness of his rush by jumping the shafts and going away across the front of the caravan to the turf pile again the golfer tried to jump the shafts too but he was not equal to that he did in a manner jump but it was almost as much diving as jumping and there was something in it almost like the curvetting of a great horse when bealby turned at the crash the golfer was already on all fours again and trying very busily to crawl out between the shaft and the front wheel he would have been more successful in doing this if he had not begun by putting his arm through the wheel as it was he was trying to do too much he was trying to crawl out at two points at once and getting very rapidly annoyed at his inability to do so the caravan was shifting slowly forward it was manifest to bealby that getting this man to go was likely to be a much more lengthy business than he had supposed he surveyed the situation for a moment and then realizing the entanglement of his opponent he seized a campstool by one leg went round by the steps and attacked the prostrate enemy from the rear with effectual but inconclusive fury he hammered steady on young man said a voice and he was seized from behind he turnedto discover himself in the grip of a second golfer another bealby fought in a fury of fear he bit an armrather too tweedy to feel muchand got in a couple of shinnersalas that they were only slippered shinnersbefore he was overpowered a cuffed crumpled disarmed and panting bealby found himself watching the careful extraction of the first golfer from the front wheel two friends assisted that gentleman with a reproachful gentleness and his repeated statements that he was all right seemed to reassure them greatly altogether there were now four golfers in the field counting the pioneer he was after this devil of a boy said the one who held bealby yes but how did he get here asked the man who was gripping bealby feel better now said the third helping the first comer to his uncertain feet let me have your cleek o man you wont want your cleek across the heather lifting their heads a little came mrs bowles and mrs geedge returning from their walk they were wondering whoever their visitors could be and then like music after a dispute came madeleine philips a beautiful bluerobed thing coming slowly with a kind of wonder on her face out of the caravan and down the steps instinctively everybody turned to her the drunkard with a gesture released himself from his supporter and stood erect his cap was replaced upon himobliquely his cleek had been secured i heard a noise said madeleine lifting her pretty chin and speaking in her sweetest tones she looked her enquiries she surveyed the three sober men with a practised eye she chose the tallest a fair seriouslooking young man standing conveniently at the drunkards elbow will you please take your friend away she said indicating the offender with her beautiful white hand simly he said in a slightly subdued voice simly coring everybody tried for a moment to understand him look here old man youve got no business here said the fair young man youd better come back to the club house the drunken man stuck to his statement simly coring he said a little louder i think said a little brighteyed man with a very cheerful yellow vest i think hes apologizing i hope so the drunken man nodded his head that among other matters the tall young man took his arm but he insisted on his point simly coring he said with emphasis ififdone wan me to cor notome nottot mean say nottot tattome nottotome orny waysayin notome no wish trude no wish all well then you see youd better come away i ars youare you tome missmiss pips he appealed to miss philips if youd answer him said the tall young man no sir she said with great dignity and the pretty chin higher than ever i am not at home nuthin more t say then said the drunken man and with a sudden stoicism he turned away come he said submitting to support simly orny arfnoon cor he said generally and permitted himself to be led off orny frenly cor for some time he was audible as he receded explaining in a rather condescending voice the extreme social correctness of his behaviour just for a moment or so there was a slight tussle due to his desire to return and leave cards he was afterwards seen to be distributing a small handful of visiting cards amidst the heather with his free arm rather in the manner of a paper chasebut much more gracefully then decently and in order he was taken out of sight bealby had been unostentatiously released by his captor as soon as miss philips appeared and the two remaining golfers now addressed themselves to the three ladies in regret and explanation the man who had held bealby was an aquiline greyclad person with a cascade moustache and wrinkled eyes and for some obscure reason he seemed to be amused the little man in the yellow vest however was quite earnest and serious enough to make up for him he was one of those little freshcoloured men whose faces stick forward openly he had open projecting eyes an open mouth his cheeks were frank to the pitch of ostentation his cap was thrust back from his exceptionally open forehead he had a chest and a stomach there too he held out he would have held out anything his legs leant forward from the feet it was evidently impossible for a man of his nature to be anything but clean shaved our fault entirely he said ought to have looked after him cant say how sorry and ashamed we are cant say how sorry we are he caused you any inconvenience of course said mrs bowles our boyservant ought not to have pelted him he didnt exactly pelt him dear said madeleine well anyhow our friend ought not to have been off his chain it was our affair to look after him and we didnt you see the open young man went on with the air of lucid explanation hes our worst player and he got round in a hundred and twentyseven and beatsomebody andits upset him its not a bit of good disguising that weve been letting him drink we have to begin with we encouraged him we oughtnt to have let him go but we thought a walk alone might do him good and some of us were a bit off him fed up rather you see hed been singing would go on singing he went on to propitiations anything the club can do to show how we regret if you would like to pitchlater on in our rough beyond the pinewoods youd find it safe and secluded custodianmost civil man get you water or anything you wanted especially after all that has happened bealby took no further part in these concluding politenesses he had a curious feeling in his mind that perhaps he had not managed this affair quite so well as he might have done he ought to have been more tactful like more persuasive he was a fool to have started chucking well well he picked up the overturned kettle and went off down the hill to get water what had she thought of him in the meantime one can at least boil kettles one consequence of this little incident of the rejoicing golfer was that the three ladies were no longer content to dismiss william and bealby at nightfall and sleep unprotected in the caravan and this time their pitch was a lonely one with only the golf club house within call they were inclined even to distrust the golf club so it was decided to his great satisfaction that bealby should have a certain sleeping sack mrs bowles had brought with her and that he should sleep therein between the wheels this sleeping sack was to have been a great feature of the expedition but when it came to the test judy could not use it she had not anticipated that feeling of extreme publicity the open air gives one at first it was like having all the world in ones bedroom every night she had relapsed into the caravan bealby did not mind what they did with him so long as it meant sleeping he had had a long day of it he undressed sketchily and wriggled into the nice woolly bag and lay for a moment listening to the soft bumpings that were going on overhead she was there he had the instinctive confidence of our sex in women and here were three of them he had a vague idea of getting out of his bag again and kissing the underside of the van that held this dear beautiful creature he didnt such a lot of things had happened that dayand the day before he had been going without intermission it seemed now for endless hours he thought of trees roads dewwet grass fryingpans pursuing packs of gigantic butlers hopelessly at faultno doubt they were hunting nowchinks and crannies tactless missiles flying bursting missiles it was vain to recall he stared for a few seconds through the wheel spokes at the dancing crackling fire of pinecones which it had been his last duty to replenish stared and blinked much as a little dog might do and then he had slipped away altogether into the world of dreams in the morning he was extraordinarily hard to wake is it after sleeping all day yed be cried judy bowles who was always at her most irish about breakfast time chapter iv the unobtrusive parting monday was a happy day for bealby the caravan did seventeen miles and came to rest at last in a sloping field outside a cheerful little village set about a green on which was a long tent professing to be a theatre at the first stoppingplace that possessed a general shop mrs bowles bought bealby a pair of boots then she had a bright idea got any pocket money dick she asked she gave him half a crown that is to say she gave him two shillings and sixpence or five sixpences or thirty penniesaccording as you choose to look at itin one large undivided shining coin even if he had not been in love here surely was incentive to a generous nature to help and do distinguished services he dashed about doing things the little accident on sunday had warned him to be careful of the plates and the only flaw upon a perfect days service was the dropping of an egg on its way to the frying pan for supper it remained where it fell and there presently he gave it a quiet burial there was nothing else to be done with it all day long at intervals miss philips smiled at him and made him do little services for her and in the evening after the custom of her great profession when it keeps holiday she insisted on going to the play she said it would be the loveliest fun she went with mrs bowles because mrs geedge wanted to sit quietly in the caravan and write down a few little things while they were still fresh in her mind and it wasnt in the part of madeleine philips not to insist that both william and bealby must go too she gave them each a shillingthough the prices were sixpence threepence twopence and a pennyand bealby saw his first real play it was called brothers in blood or the gentleman ranker there was a posterwhich was only very slightly justified by the performanceof a man in khaki with a bandaged head proposing to sell his life dearly over a fallen comrade one went to the play through an open and damaged field gate and across trampled turf outside the tent were two paraffin flares illuminating the poster and a small cluster of the impecunious young within on grass that was worn and bleached were benches a gathering audience a piano played by an offhand lady and a drop scene displaying the grand canal venice the grand canal was infested by a crowded multitude of zealous and excessive reflections of the palaces above and by peculiar crescentic black boats floating entirely out of water and having no reflections at all the offhand lady gave a broad impression of the wedding march in lohengrin and the back seats assisted by a sort of gastric vocalization called humming and by whistling between the teeth madeleine philips evidently found it tremendous fun even before the curtain rose and thenillusion the scenery was ridiculous it waved about the actors and actresses were surely the most pitiful of their tribe and every invention in the play impossible but the imagination of bealby like the loving kindness of god made no difficulties it rose and met and embraced and gave life to all these things it was a confused story in the play everybody was more or less somebody else all the way through and it got more confused in bealbys mind but it was clear from the outset that there was vile work afoot nets spread and sweet simple people wronged and never were sweet and simple people quite so sweet and simple there was the wrongful brother who was weak and wicked and the rightful brother who was vindictively almost viciously good and there was an ingrained villain who was a baronet a man who wore a frock coat and a silk hat and carried gloves and a stick in every scene and upon all occasionsthat sort of man he looked askance always there was a dear simple girl with a vast sweet smile who was loved according to their natures by the wrongful and the rightful brother and a large wicked redclad lipbiting woman whose passions made the crazy little stage quiver there was a comic butlervery different stuff from old merglesonwho wore an evening coat and plaid trousers and nearly choked bealby why werent all butlers like that funny and there were constant denunciations always there were denunciations going on or denunciations impending that took bealby particularly never surely in all the world were bad people so steadily and thoroughly scolded and told what everybody hissed them bealby hissed them and when they were told what he applauded and yet they kept on with their wickedness to the very curtain they retiredaskance to the end foiled but pursuing a time will come they said there was a moment in the distresses of the heroine when bealby dashed aside a tear and then at last most wonderfully it all came right the company lined up and hoped that bealby was satisfied bealby wished he had more hands his heart seemed to fill his body oh prime prime and out he came into the sympathetic night but he was no longer a trivial bealby his soul was purged he was a strong and silent man ready to explode into generous repartee or nerve himself for high endeavour he slipped off in the opposite direction from the caravan because he wanted to be alone for a time and feel he did not want to jar upon a sphere of glorious illusion that had blown up in his mind like a bubble he was quite sure that he had been wronged not to be wronged is to forego the first privilege of goodness he had been deeply wronged by a plotall those butlers were in the plot or why should they have chased himhe was much older than he really was it had been kept from him and in truth he was a rightful earl earl shonts he whispered and indeed why not and madeleine too had been wronged she had been reduced to wander in this uncomfortable caravan this gipsy queen she had been brought to it by villains the same villains who had wronged bealby out he went into the night the kindly consenting summer night where there is nothing to be seen or heard that will contradict these delicious wonderful persuasions he was so full of these dreams that he strayed far away along the dark country lanes and had at last the utmost difficulty in finding his way back to the caravan and when ultimately he got back after hours and hours of heroic existence it did not even seem that they had missed him it did not seem that he had been away half an hour tuesday was not so happy a day for bealby as monday its shadows began when mrs bowles asked him in a friendly tone when it was cleancollar day he was unready with his answer and dont you ever use a hair brush dick she asked im sure now theres one in your parcel i do use it sometimes mum he admitted and ive never detected you with a toothbrush yet though that perhaps is extreme and dicksoap i think youd better be letting me give you a cake of soap id be very much obliged mum i hardly dare hint dick at a clean handkerchief such things are known if you wouldnt mindwhen ive got the breakfast things done mum the thing worried him all through breakfast he had not expectedpersonalities from mrs bowles more particularly personalities of this kind he felt he had to think hard he affected modesty after he had cleared away breakfast and carried off his little bundle to a point in the stream which was masked from the encampment by willows with him he also brought that cake of soap he began by washing his handkerchief which was bad policy because that left him no dry towel but his jacket he ought he perceived to have secured a dishcloth or a newspaper this he must remember on the next occasion he did over his hands and the more exposed parts of his face with soap and jacket then he took off and examined his collar it certainly was pretty bad why cried mrs bowles when he returned thats still the same collar they all seem tove got crumpled m said bealby but are they all as dirty i ad some blacking in my parcel said bealby and it got loose mum ill have to get another collar when we come to a shop it was a financial sacrifice but it was the only way and when they came to the shop bealby secured a very nice collar indeed high with pointed turndown corners so that it cut his neck all round jabbed him under the chin and gave him a proud upcast carriage of the head that led to his treading upon and very completely destroying a stray plate while preparing lunch but it was more of a mans collar he felt than anything he had ever worn before and it cost sixpence halfpenny six dee and a half i should have mentioned that while washing up the breakfast things he had already broken the handle off one of the breakfast cups both these accidents deepened the cloud upon his day and then there was the trouble of william william having meditated upon the differences between them for a day had now invented an activity as bealby sat beside him behind the white horse he was suddenly and frightfully pinched gee one wanted to yelp choclate said william through his teeth and very very savagely now then after william had done that twice bealby preferred to walk beside the caravan thereupon william whipped up the white horse and broke records and made all the crockery sing together and forced the pace until he was spoken to by mrs bowles it was upon a bealby thus depressed and worried that the rumour of impending menfolk came it began after the party had stopped for letters at a village post office there were not only letters but a telegram that mrs bowles read with her spats far apart and her head on one side yed like to know about it she said waggishly to miss philips and you just shant she then went into her letters youve got some news said mrs geedge i have that said mrs bowles and not a word more could they get from her ill keep my news no longer said mrs bowles lighting her cigarette after lunch as bealby hovered about clearing away the banana skins and suchlike vestiges of dessert tomorrow night as ever is if so be we get to winthorpesutbury therell be men among us but toms not coming said mrs geedge he asked tim to tell me to tell you and youve kept it these two hours judy for your own good and peace of mind but now the murthers out come they will your man and my man pretending to a pity because they cant do without us but like the selfindulgent monsters they are they must needs stop at some grand hotel redlake he calls it the royal on the hill above winthorpesutbury the royal the very name describes it cant you see the lounge girls with its white cane chairs and saddlebacks no other hotel it seems is good enough for them and we if you please are asked to go in and havewhat does the man call itthe comforts of decencyand let the caravan rest for a bit tim promised me i should run wild as long as i chose said mrs geedge looking anything but wild theyre after thinking weve had enough of it said mrs bowles it sounds like that sure id go on like this for ever said judy tis the man and the house and all of it that oppresses me vans for women lets not go to winthorpesutbury said madeleine the first word of sense bealby had heard ah said mrs bowles archly who knows but what therell be a man for you some sort of man anyhow bealby thought that a most improper remark i want no man ah why do you say ah like that because i mean ah like that meaning just that miss philips eyed mrs bowles and mrs bowles eyed miss philips judy she said youve got something up your sleeve where its perfectly comfortable said mrs bowles and then quite maddeningly she remarked will you be after washing up presently dick and looked at him with a roguish quiet over her cigarette it was necessary to disabuse her mind at once of the idea that he had been listening he took up the last few plates and went off to the washing place by the stream all the rest of that conversation had to be lost except that as he came back for the hudsons soap he heard miss philips say keep your old men ill just console myself with dick my dears making such a mystery to which mrs bowles replied darkly she little knows a kind of consolation was to be got from that but what was it she little knew the menfolk when they came were nothing so terrific to the sight as bealby had expected and thank heaven there were only two of them and each assigned something he perceived was said about someone else he couldnt quite catch what but if there was to have been someone else at any rate there now wasnt professor bowles was animated and mr geedge was gracefully cold they kissed their wives but not offensively and there was a chattering pause while bealby walked on beside the caravan they were on the bare road that runs along the high ridge above winthorpesutbury and the men had walked to meet them from some hotel or otherbealby wasnt clear about thatby the golf links judy was the life and soul of the encounter and all for asking the men what they meant by intruding upon three independent women who surealive could very well do without them professor bowles took her pretty calmly and seemed on the whole to admire her professor bowles was a compact little man wearing spectacles with alternative glasses partly curved partly flat he was hairy and dressed in that sort of soft tweedy stuff that ravels outhe seemed to have been sitting among thornsand baggy knickerbockers with straps and very thick stockings and very sensible open air in fact quite mountainous boots and yet though he was short and stout and active he had a kind of authority about him and it was clear that for all her persuasiveness his wife merely ran over him like a creeper without making any great difference to him ive found he said the perfect place for your encampment she had been making suggestions and presently he left the ladies and came hurrying after the caravan to take control he was evidently a very controlling person here you get down he said to william that poor beasts got enough to pull without you and when william mumbled he said hey in such a shout that william for ever after held his peace where dyou come from you boy you he asked suddenly and bealby looked to mrs bowles to explain great silly collar youve got said the professor interrupting her reply boy like this ought to wear a wool shirt dirty too take it off boy its choking you dont you feel it then he went on to make trouble about the tackle william had rigged to contain the white horse this harness makes me sick said professor bowles its worse than italy ah he cried and suddenly darted off across the turf going inelegantly and very rapidly with peculiar motions of the head and neck as he brought first the flat and then the curved surface of his glasses into play finally he dived into the turf remained scrabbling on all fours for a moment or so became almost still for the fraction of a minute and then got up and returned to his wife holding in an exquisite manner something that struggled between his finger and his thumb thats the third today he said triumphantly they swarm here its a migration then he resumed his penetrating criticism of the caravan outfit that boy he said suddenly with his glasses oblique hasnt taken off his collar yet bealby revealed the modest secrets of his neck and pocketed the collar mr geedge did not appear to observe bealby he was a man of the superaquiline type with a nose like a rudder he held his face as if it was a hatchet in a procession and walked with the dignity of a man of honour you could see at once he was a man of honour inflexibly invincibly he was a man of honour you felt that anywhen in a fire in an earthquake in a railway accident when other people would be running about and doing things he would have remaineda man of honour it was his pride rather than his vanity to be mistaken for sir edward grey he now walked along with miss philips and his wife behind the disputing bowleses and discoursed in deep sonorous tones about the healthiness of healthy places and the stifling feeling one had in towns when there was no air the professor was remarkably active when at last the point he had chosen for the encampment was reached bealby was told to look alive twice and william was assigned to his genus and species the mans an absolute idiot was the way the professor put it william just shot a glance at him over his nose the place certainly commanded a wonderful view it was a turfy bank protected from the north and south by bushes of yew and the beechbordered edge of a chalk pit it was close beside the road a road which went steeply down the hill into winthorpesutbury with that intrepid decision peculiar to the hillroads of the south of england it looked indeed as though you could throw the rinse of your teacups into the winthorpesutbury street as if you could jump and impale yourself upon the church spire the hills bellied out east and west and carried hangers and then swept round to the west in a long level succession of projections a perspective that merged at last with the general horizon of hilly bluenesses amidst which professor bowles insisted upon a sapphire glimpse of sea the channel said professor bowles as though that made it easier for them only mr geedge refused to see even that mitigated version of the sea there was something perhaps bluish and level but he was evidently not going to admit it was sea until he had paddled in it and tested it in every way known to him good lord cried the professor whats the man doing now william stopped the struggles and confidential discouragements he was bestowing upon the white horse and waited for a more definite reproach putting the caravan alongside to the sun do you think it will ever get cool again and think of the blaze of the sunsetthrough the glass of that door william spluttered if i putn tother waygoo runnin down thill like said william imbecile cried the professor put something under the wheels here he careered about and produced great grey fragments of a perished yew tree now then he said head up hill william did his best oh not like that here you bealby assisted with obsequious enthusiasm it was some time before the caravan was adjusted to the complete satisfaction of the professor but at last it was done and the end door gaped at the whole prospect of the weald with the steps hanging out idiotically like a tongue the hind wheels were stayed up very cleverly by lumps of chalk and chunks of yew living and dead and certainly the effect of it was altogether taller and better and then the preparations for the midday cooking began the professor was full of acute ideas about camping and cooking and gave bealby a lively but instructive time there was no stream handy but william was sent off to the hotel to fetch a garden watercart that the professor with infinite foresight had arranged should be ready the geedges held aloof from these preparationsthey were unassuming people miss philips concentrated her attention upon the wealdit seemed to bealby a little discontentedlyas if it was unworthy of herand mrs bowles hovered smoking cigarettes over her husbands activities acting great amusement you see it pleases me to get himself busy she said youll end a camper yet darlint and us in the hotel the professor answered nothing but seemed to plunge deeper into practicality under the urgency of professor bowles bealby stumbled and broke a glass jar of marmalade over some fried potatoes but otherwise did well as a cooks assistant once things were a little interrupted by the professor going off to catch a cricket but whether it was the right sort of cricket or not he failed to get it and then with three loud reportsfor a moment bealby thought the mad butlers from shonts were upon him with firearmscaptain douglas arrived and got off his motor bicycle and left it by the roadside his machine accounted for his delay for those were the early days of motor bicycles it also accounted for a black smudge under one of his bright little eyes he was fair and flushed dressed in oilskins and a helmetshaped cap and great gauntlets that made him in spite of the smudge look strange and brave and handsome like a crusaderonly that he was clad in oilskin and not steel and his moustache was smaller than those crusaders wore and when he came across the turf to the encampment mrs bowles and mrs geedge both set up a cry of aah and miss philips turned an accusing face upon those two ladies bealby knelt with a bunch of knives and forks in his hand laying the cloth for lunch and when he saw captain douglas approaching miss philips he perceived clearly that that lady had already forgotten her lowly adorer and his little heart was smitten with desolation this man was arrayed like a chivalrous god and how was a poor bealby whose very collar his one little circlet of manhood had been reft from him how was he to compete with this tremendousness in that hour the ambition for mechanism the passion for leather and oilskin was sown in bealbys heart i told you not to come near me for a month said madeleine but her face was radiant these motor bicyclesvery difficult to control said captain douglas and all the little goldenwhite hairs upon his sunlit cheek glittered in the sun and besides said mrs bowles its all nonsense the professor was in a state of arrested administration the three others were frankly audience to a clearly understood scene you ought to be in france im not in france i sent you into exile for a month and she held out a hand for the captain to kiss he kissed it someday somewhere it was written in the book of destiny bealby should also kiss hands it was a lovely thing to do month its been years said the captain years and years then you ought to have come back before she replied and the captain had no answer ready when william arrived with the watercart he brought also further proofs of the professors organizing ability he brought various bottles of wine red burgundy and sparkling hock two bottles of cider and peculiar and meritorious waters he brought tinned things for hors duvre he brought some luscious pears when he had a moment with bealby behind the caravan he repeated thrice in tones of hopeless sorrow theyll eat um all i knows theyll eat um all and then plumbing a deeper deep of woe ef they dont theyll count um ode gogglesll bag um es a bagger e is it was the brightest of luncheons that was eaten that day in the sunshine and spaciousness above winthorpesutbury everyone was gay and even the lovetorn bealby who might well have sunk into depression and lethargy was galvanized into an activity that was almost cheerful by flashes from the professors glasses they talked of this and that bealby hadnt much time to attend though the laughter that followed various sallies from judy bowles was very tantalizing and it had come to the pears before his attention wasnt so much caught as felled by the word shonts it was as if the sky had suddenly changed to vermilion all these people were talking of shonts went there said captain douglas in perfect good faith wanted to fill up lucys little party one doesnt go to shonts nowadays for idle pleasure and theni get ordered out of the house absolutely told to go this man had been at shonts that was on sunday morning said mrs geedge on sunday morning said mrs bowles suddenly we were almost within sight of shonts this man had been at shonts even at the time when bealby was there early on sunday morning told to go i was fairly flabbergasted what the deuce is a man to do wheres he to go sunday one doesnt go to places sunday morning there id been sleeping like a lamb all night and suddenly in came laxton and said look here you know he said youve got to oblige me and pack your bag and go now why said i because youve driven the lord chancellor stark staring mad but how asked the professor almost angrily how i dont see it why should he ask you to go i dont know cried captain douglas yes but said the professor protesting against the unreasonableness of mankind id had a word or two with him in the train nothing to speak of about occupying two corner seatsalways strikes me as a cads trickbut on my honour i didnt rub it in and then he got it into his head we were laughing at him at dinnerwe were a bit but only the sort of thing one says about anyoneway he works his eyebrows and all thatand then he thought i was ragging him i dont rag people got it so strongly he made a row that night said id made a ghost slap him on his back hang itwhat can you say to a thing like that in my room all the time you suffer for the sins of your brother said mrs bowles heavens cried the captain i never thought of that perhaps he mistook me he reflected for a moment and continued his narrative then in the night you know he heard noises they always do said the professor nodding confirmation couldnt sleep a sure sign said the professor and finally he sallied out in the early morning caught the butler in one of the secret passages how did the butler get into the secret passage going round i suppose part of his duties anyhow he gave the poor beggar an awful doingawfulbrutalblack eyeall that sort of thing man much too respectful to hit back finally declared id been getting up a kind of ragsquaring the servants to help and so forth laxton i fancy half believed it awkward thing you know having it said about that you ragged the lord chancellor makes a man seem a sort of mischievous idiot injures a man then going away you see seems a kind of admission why did you go lucy said the captain compactly hysterics shonts would have burst he added if i hadnt gone madeleine was helpful but youll have to do something further she said what is one to do squealed the captain the sooner you get the lord chancellor certified a lunatic said the professor soundly the better for your professional prospects he went on pretty bad after id gone youve heard two letters i picked em up at wheatley post office this morning you know he hadnt done with that butler actually got out of his place and scruffed the poor devil at lunch shook him like a rat she says said the man wasnt giving him anything to drinknice story eh anyhow he scruffed him until things got broken i had it all from minnie timbreyou know used to be minnie flax he shot a propitiating glance at madeleine used to be neighbours of ours you know in the old time half the people she says didnt know what was happening thought the butler was apoplectic and that old moggeridge was helping him stand up taking off his collar it was laxton thought of saying it was a fit told everybody she says had to tell em something i suppose but she saw better and she thinks a good many others did laxton ran em both out of the room nice scene for shonts eh thundering awkward for poor lucy not the sort of thing the county expected has her both ways cant go to a house where the lord chancellor goes mad one alternative cant go to a house where the butler has fits thats the other see the dilemma ive got a letter from lucy too its herehe struggledsee eight sheetspencil no joke for a man to read that and she writes worse than any decent selfrespecting illiterate woman has a right to do quivers like writing in a train cant read half of it but shes got something about a boy on her mind mad about a boy have i taken away a boy theyve lost a boy took him in my luggage i suppose shed better write to the lord chancellor likely as not he met him in some odd corner and flew at him smashed him to atoms dispersed him anyhow theyve lost a boy he protested to the world i cant go hunting lost boys for lucy ive done enough coming away as i did mrs bowles held out an arresting cigarette what sort of boy was lost she asked i dont know some little beast of a boy i daresay shed only imagined it whole thing been too much for her read that over again said mrs bowles about losing a boy weve found one that little chap we found that boyshe glanced over her shoulder but bealby was nowhere to be seenon sunday morning near shonts he strayed into us like a lost kitten but i thought you said you knew his father judy objected the professor didnt verify said mrs bowles shortly and then to captain douglas read over again what lady laxton says about him captain douglas struggled with the difficulties of his cousins handwriting everybody drew together over the fragments of the dessert with an eager curiosity and helped to weigh lady laxtons rather dishevelled phrases well call the principal witness said mrs bowles at last warming to the business dick diick dick the professor got up and strolled round behind the caravan then he returned no boy there he heard said mrs bowles in a large whisper and making round wondereyes she says said douglas that the chances are hes got into the secret passages the professor strolled out to the road and looked up it and then down upon the roofs of winthorpesutbury no he said hes mizzled hes only gone away for a bit said mrs geedge he does sometimes after lunch hell come back to wash up hes probably taking a snooze among the yew bushes before facing the labours of washing up said mrs bowles he cant have mizzled you see in there he cant by any chance have taken his luggage she got up and clamberedwith a little difficulty because of its piledup position into the caravan its all right she called out of the door his little parsivel is still here her head disappeared again i dont think hed go away like this said madeleine after all what is there for him to go toeven if he is lady laxtons missing boy i dont believe he heard a word of it said mrs geedge mrs bowles reappeared with a curiouslooking brown paper parcel in her hand she descended carefully she sat down by the fire and held the parcel on her knees she regarded it and her companions waggishly and lit a fresh cigarette our link with dick she said with the cigarette in her mouth she felt the parcel she poised the parcel she looked at it more and more waggishly i wonder she said her expression became so waggish that her husband knew she was committed to behaviour of the utmost ungentlemanliness he had long ceased to attempt restraint in these moods she put her head on one side and tore open the corner of the parcel just a little way a tin can she said in a stage whisper she enlarged the opening blades of grass she said the professor tried to regard it humorously even if you have ceased to be decent you can still be frank i think now my dear you might just straightforwardly undo the parcel she did twelve unsympathetic eyes surveyed the evidences of bealbys utter poverty hes coming cried madeleine suddenly judy repacked hastily but it was a false alarm i said hed mizzled said the professor and without washing up wailed madeleine i couldnt have thought it of him but bealby had not mizzled although he was conspicuously not in evidence about the camp there was neither sight nor sound of him for all the time they sat about the vestiges of their meal they talked of him and of topics arising out of him and whether the captain should telegraph to lady laxton boy practically found id rather just find him said the captain and anyhow until we get hold of him we dont know its her particular boy then they talked of washingup and how detestable it was and suddenly the two husbands seeing their advantage renewed their proposals that the caravanners should put up at the golflinks hotel and have baths and the comforts of civilization for a night or soand anyhow walk thither for tea and as william had now returnedhe was sitting on the turf afar off smoking a nastylooking short clay pipethey rose up and departed but captain douglas and miss philips for some reason did not go off exactly with the others but strayed apart straying away more and more into a kind of solitude first the four married people and then the two lovers disappeared over the crest of the downs for a time except for its distant sentinel the caravan seemed absolutely deserted and then a clump of bramble against the wall of the old chalk pit became agitated and a small rueful disillusioned whitesmeared little bealby crept back into the visible universe again his heart was very heavy the time had come to go and he did not want to go he had loved the caravan he had adored madeleine he would go but he would go beautifullytouchingly he would wash up before he went he would make everything tidy he would leave behind him a sense of irreparable loss with a mournful precision he set about this undertaking if mergleson could have seen mergleson would have been amazed he made everything look wonderfully tidy then in the place where she had sat lying on her rug he found her favourite book a small volume of swinburnes poems very beautifully bound captain douglas had given it to her bealby handled it with a kind of reverence so luxurious it was so unlike the books in bealbys world so altogether of her quality strange forces prompted him for a time he hesitated then decision came with a rush he selected a page drew the stump of a pencil from his pocket wetted it very wet and breathing hard began to write that traditional message farewell remember art bealby to this he made an original addition i washt up before i went then he remembered that so far as this caravan went he was not art bealby at all he renewed the wetness of his pencil and drew black lines athwart the name of art bealby until it was quite unreadable then across this again and pressing still deeper so that the subsequent pages reechoed it he wrote these singular words ed rightful earl shonts then he was ashamed and largely obliterated this by still more forcible strokes finally above it all plainly and nakedly he wrote dick maltravers he put down the book with a sigh and stood up everything was beautifully in order but could he not do something yet there came to him the idea of wreathing the entire camping place with boughs of yew it would look lovelyand significant he set to work at first he toiled zealously but yew is tough to get and soon his hands were painful he cast about for some easier way and saw beneath the hind wheels of the caravan great green boughsone particularly a splendid long branch it seemed to him that it would be possible to withdraw this branch from the great heap of sticks and stones that stayed up the hind wheels of the caravan it seemed to him that that was so he was mistaken but that was his idea he set to work to do it it was rather more difficult to manage than he had supposed there were unexpected ramifications wider resistances indeed the thing seemed rooted bealby was a resolute youngster at bottom he warmed to his task he tugged harder and harder how various is the quality of humanity about bealby there was ever an imaginative touch he was capable of romance of gallantries of devotion william was of a grosser clay slave of his appetites a materialist such men as william drive one to believe in born inferiors in the existence of a lower sort in the natural inequality of men while bealby was busy at his little gentle task of reparation a task foolish perhaps and not too ably conceived but at any rate morally gracious william had no thought in the world but the satisfaction of those appetites that the consensus of all mankind has definitely relegated to the lower category and which heaven has relegated to the lower regions of our frame he came now slinking towards the vestiges of the caravanners picnic and no one skilled in the interpretation of the human physiognomy could have failed to read the significance of the tongue tip that drifted over his thin oblique lips he came so softly towards the encampment that bealby did not note him partly william thought of remnants of food but chiefly he was intent to drain the bottles bealby had stuck them all neatly in a row a little way up the hill there was a cider bottle with some heeltaps of cider william drank that then there was nearly half a bottle of hock and william drank that then there were the drainings of the burgundy and apollinaris it was all drink to william and after he had drained each bottle william winked at the watching angels and licked his lips and patted the lower centres of his being with a shameless base approval then fired by alcohol robbed of his last vestiges of selfcontrol his thoughts turned to the delicious chocolates that were stored in a daintily beribboned box in the little drawers beneath the sleeping bunk of miss philips there was a new brightness in his eye a spot of pink in either cheek with an expression of the lowest cunning he reconnoitred bealby bealby was busy about something at the back end of the caravan tugging at something with swift stealthy movements of an entirely graceless sort william got up into the front of the caravan just for a moment he hesitated before going in he craned his neck to look round the side at the unconscious bealby wrinkled the vast nose into an unpleasant grimace and thena crouching figure of appetitehe crept inside here they were he laid his hand in the drawer halted listening what was that suddenly the caravan swayed he stumbled and fear crept into his craven soul the caravan lurched it was moving its hind wheels came to the ground with a crash he took a step doorward and was pitched sideways and thrown upon his knees then he was hurled against the dresser and hit by a falling plate a cup fell and smashed and the caravan seemed to leap and bound through the little window he had a glimpse of yew bushes hurrying upward the caravan was going down hill lummy said william clutching at the bunks to hold himself upright caarnt be that drink said william aspread and aghast he attempted the door crikey here hold in my shin tis thut brasted vool of a boy said william illustration the caravan party soon came to its decision they would stay the night in the hotel and so as soon as they had had some tea they decided to go back and make william bring the caravan and all the ladies things round to the hotel with characteristic eagerness professor bowles led the way and so it was professor bowles who first saw the release of the caravan he barked one short sharp bark whup he cried and very quickly whatstheboydoing then quite a different style of noise with the mouth open whahoop then he set off running very fast down towards the caravan waving his arms and shouting as he ran yaaps you idiot yaaps the others were less promptly active down the slope they saw bealby a little struggling active bealby tugging away at a yew branch until the caravan swayed with his efforts and thenthen there was a movement as though the thing tossed its head and reared and a smash as the heap of stuff that stayed up its hind wheels collapsed it plunged like a horse with a dog at its heels it lurched sideways and then with an air of quiet deliberation started down the grass slope to the road and winthorpesutbury professor bowles sped in pursuit like the wind and mrs bowles after a gasping moment set off after her lord her face round and resolute mr geedge followed at a more dignified pace making the only really sound suggestion that was offered on the occasion hue stop it cried mr geedge for all the world like his great prototype at the balkan conference and then like a large languid pair of scissors he began to run mrs geedge after some indefinite moments decided to see the humour of it all and followed after her lord in a fluttering rush emitting careful little musical giggles as she ran giggles that she had learnt long ago from a beloved schoolfellow captain douglas and miss philips were some way behind the others and the situation had already developed considerably before they grasped what was happening then obeying the instincts of a soldier the captain came charging to support the others and miss madeleine philips after some wasted gestures realized that nobody was looking at her and sat down quietly on the turf until this paralyzing state of affairs should cease the caravan remained the centre of interest without either indecent haste or any complete pause it pursued its way down the road towards the tranquil village below except for the rumbling of its wheels and an occasional concussion it made very little sound once or twice there was a faint sound of breaking crockery from its interior and once the phantom of an angry yell but that was all there was an effect of discovered personality about the thing this vehicle which had hitherto been content to play a background part a yellow patch amidst the scenery was now revealing an individuality it was purposeful and touched with a suggestion of playfulness at once kindly and human it had its thoughtful instants its phases of quick decision yet never once did it altogether lose a certain mellow dignity there was nothing servile about it never for a moment for example did it betray its blind obedience to gravitation it was rather as if it and gravitation were going hand in hand it came out into the road butted into the bank swept round meditated for a full second and then shafts foremost headed downhill going quietly faster and faster and swaying from bank to bank the shafts went before it like arms held out it had a qualityas if it were a favourite elephant running to a beloved master from whom it had been overlong separated or a slightly intoxicated and altogether happy yellow guineapig making for some coveted food at a considerable distance followed professor bowles a miracle of compact energy running so fast that he seemed only to touch the ground at very rare intervals and then dispersedly in their order and according to their natures the others there was fortunately very little on the road there was a perambulator containing twins whose little girl guardian was so fortunate as to be high up on the bank gathering blackberries a ditcher ditching a hawker lost in thought his cart drawn by a poor little black screw of a pony and loaded with the cheap flawed crockery that is so popular among the poor a dog asleep in the middle of the village street amidst this choice of objects the caravan displayed a whimsical humanity it reduced the children in the perambulator to tears but passed it might have reduced them to a sort of redcurrant jelly it lurched heavily towards the ditcher and spared him it chased the hawker up the bank it whipped off a wheel from the cart of crockery which after an interval of astonishment fell like a vast objurgation and then it directed its course with a grim intentness towards the dog it just missed the dog he woke up not a moment too soon he fled with a yelp of dismay and then the caravan careered on a dozen yards further lost energy andthe only really undignified thing in its whole careerstood on its head in a wide wet ditch it did this with just the slightest lapse into emphasis there it was as if it gave a gruntand perhaps there was the faintest suggestion of william in that gruntand then it became quite still for a time the caravan seemed finished and done its steps hung from its upper end like the tongue of a tired dog except for a few minute noises as though it was scratching itself inside it was as inanimate as death itself but up the hill road the twins were weeping the hawker and the ditcher were saying raucous things the hawkers pony had backed into the ditch and was taking illadvised steps for which it was afterwards to be sorry amidst his stockintrade and professor bowles mrs bowles mr geedge captain douglas and mrs geedge were runningrunningone heard the various patter of their feet and then came signs of life at the upward door of the caravan a hand an arm an active investigating leg seeking a hold a large nose a small intent vicious eye in factwilliam william maddened professor bowles had reached the caravan with a startling agility he clambered up by the wheels and step and confronted the unfortunate driver it was an occasion for mutual sympathy rather than anger but the professor was hasty efficient and unsympathetic with the lower classes and williams was an illregulated temperament you consummate ass began professor bowles when william heard professor bowles say this incontinently he smote him in the face and when professor bowles was smitten in the face he grappled instantly and very bravely and resolutely with william for a moment they struggled fearfully they seemed to be endowed instantaneously with innumerable legs and then suddenly they fell through the door of the caravan into the interior their limbs seemed to whirl for a wonderful instant and then they were swallowed up the smash was tremendous you would not have thought there was nearly so much in the caravan still left to get broken a healing silence at length smothered noises of still inadequate adjustment within the village population in a state of scared delight appeared at a score of points and converged upon the catastrophe sounds of renewed dissension between william and the professor inside the rearing yellow bulk promised further interests and added an element of mystery to this manifest disaster as bealby still grasping his great branch of yew watched these events a sense of human futility invaded his youthful mind for the first time he realized the gulf between intention and result he had meant so well he perceived it would be impossible to explain the thought of even attempting to explain things to professor bowles was repellent to him he looked about him with round despairful eyes he selected a direction which seemed to promise the maximum of concealment with the minimum of conversational possibility and in that direction and without needless delay he set off eager to turn over an entirely fresh page in his destiny as soon as possible to get away the idea possessed all his being from the crest of the downs a sweet voice floated after his retreating form and never overtook him diick then presently miss philips arose to her feet gathered her skirts in her hand and with her delicious chin raised and an expression of countenance that was almost businesslike descended towards the gathering audience below she wore wideflowing skirts and came down the hill in artemesian strides it was high time that somebody looked at her chapter v the seeking of bealby on the same monday evening that witnessed bealbys first experience of the theatre mr mergleson the house steward of shonts walked slowly and thoughtfully across the corner of the park between the laundry and the gardens his face was much recovered from the accidents of his collision with the lord chancellor resort to raw meat in the kitchen had checked the development of his injuries and only a few contusions in the side of his face were more than faintly traceable and suffering had on the whole rather ennobled than depressed his bearing he had a black eye but it was not he felt a common black eye it came from high quarters and through no fault of mr merglesons own he carried it well it was a fruit of duty rather than the outcome of wanton pleasureseeking or misdirected passion he found mr darling in profound meditation over some peach trees against the wall they were not doing so well as they ought to do and mr darling was engaged in wondering why good evening mr darling said mr mergleson mr darling ceased rather slowly to wonder and turned to his friend good evening mr mergleson he said i dont quite like the look of these here peaches blowed if i do mr mergleson glanced at the peaches and then came to the matter that was nearest his heart you avent i suppose seen anything of your stepson these last two days mr darling naturally not said mr darling putting his head on one side and regarding his interlocutor naturally notive left that to you mr mergleson well thats whats awkward said mr mergleson and then with a forced easiness you see i aint seen im either no no i lost sight of im mr mergleson appeared to reflectlate on sattiday night ows that mr mergleson mr mergleson considered the difficulties of lucid explanation we missed im said mr mergleson simply regarding the wellweeded garden path with a calculating expression and then lifting his eyes to mr darlings with an air of great candour and we continue to miss him well said mr darling thats rum yes said mr mergleson its decidedly rum said mr darling we thought e might be iding from is work or cut off ome you didnt send down to ask we was too busy with the weekend people on the ole we thought if e ad cut ome on the ole e wasnt a very serious loss e

surveying the garden i arf expected e might and i arf expected e mightnt said mr mergleson with the air of one who had anticipated mr darlings answer but hesitated to admit as much the two gentlemen paused for some seconds and regarded each other searchingly wheres e got to said mr darling well said mr mergleson putting his hands where the tails of his short jacket would have been if it hadnt been short and looking extraordinarily like a parrot in its more thoughtful moods to tell you the truth mr darling ive ad a dream about imand it worries me i got a sort of ideer of im as being in one of them secret passages iding away there was a guest well i say it with all respec but anyone might ave id from im smorning soon as the weekend ad cleared up and gone ome me and thomas went through

somewhere where e cant get out ive eard tell theres walledup dungeons they say said mr darling theres underground passages to the abbey ruinsthree good mile away orkward said mr mergleson drat is eyes

like a fox lord ow e walloped im for it mistake to ave a boy in so young said mr mergleson its all very awkward said mr darling surveying every aspect of the case you see is mother sets a most estrordinary value on im most estrordinary i dont know whether she oughtnt to be told said mr mergleson i was thinking of that mr darling was not the sort of man to meet trouble halfway he shook his head at that not yet mr mergleson i dont think yet not until everythings been tried i dont think theres any need to give her needless distressnone whatever if you dont mind i think ill come up tonightnineish sayand ave a talk to you and thomas about ita quiet talk best to begin with a quiet talk its a dashed rum go and me and you we got to think it out a bit thats what i think said mr mergleson with unconcealed relief at mr darlings friendliness thats exactly the light mr darling in which it appears to me because you seeif es all right and in the ouse why doesnt e come for is vittels in the pantry that evening the question of telling someone was discussed further it was discussed over a number of glasses of mr merglesons beer for following a sound tradition mr mergleson brewed at shonts and sometimes he brewed well and sometimes he brewed ill and sometimes he brewed weak and sometimes he brewed strong and there was no monotony in the cups at shonts this was sturdy stuff and suited mr darlings mood and ever and again with an authors natural weakness and an affectation of abstraction mr mergleson took the jug out empty and brought it back foaming henry the second footman was disposed to a forced hopefulness so as not to spoil the evening but thomas was sympathetic and distressed the redhaired youth made cigarettes with a little machine licked them and offered them to the others saying little as became him etiquette deprived him of an uninvited beer and mr merglesons inattention completed what etiquette began i cant bear to think of the poor little beggar stuck head foremost into some cobwebby cranny blowed if i can said thomas getting help from the jug he was an interesting kid said thomas in a tone that was frankly obituary he didnt like his work one could see that but he was livelyand i tried to help him along all i could when i wasnt too busy myself there was something sensitive about him said thomas mr mergleson sat with his arms loosely thrown out over the table what we got to do is to tell someone he said i dont see ow i can put off telling er ladyshipafter tomorrow morning and theneaven elp us course i got to tell my missis said mr darling and poured in a preoccupied way some running over well go through them passages again now before we go to bed said mr mergleson far as we can but theres oles and chinks ony a boy could get through i got to tell the missis said mr darling thats whats worrying me as the evening wore on there was a tendency on the part of mr darling to make this the refrain of his discourse he sought advice owd you tell the missis he asked mr mergleson and emptied a glass to control his impatience before mr mergleson replied i shall tell er ladyship just simply the fact i shall say your ladyship heres my boy gone and we dont know where and as she arsts me questions so shall i give particulars mr darling reflected and then shook his head slowly owd ju tell the missis he asked thomas glad i havent got to said thomas poor little beggar yes but ow would you tell er mr darling said varying the accent very carefully id go to er and id pat her back and id say bear up see and when she asked what for id just tell her what forgradual like you dont know the missis said mr darling henry owd ju tell er let er find out said henry wimmin do mr darling reflected and decided that too was unworkable owd you he asked with an air of desperation of the redhaired youth the redhaired youth remained for a moment with his tongue extended licking the gum of a cigarette paper and his eyes on mr darling then he finished the cigarette slowly giving his mind very carefully to the question he had been honoured with i think he said in a low serious voice i should say just simply maryor susanor whatever her name is tilda supplied mr darling tilda i should say the lord gave and the lord ath taken away tildaes gone somethin like that the redhaired boy cleared his throat he was rather touched by his own simple eloquence mr darling reflected on this with profound satisfaction for some moments then he broke out almost querulously yes but brast himwheres e gone anyhow said mr darling i aint going to tell er not till the morning i aint going to lose my nights rest if i have lost my stepson nohow mr mergleson i must say i dont think i ever ave tasted better beer never itsits famous beer he had some more on his way back through the moonlight to the gardens mr darling was still unsettled as to the exact way of breaking things to his wife he had come out from the house a little ruffled because of mr merglesons opposition to a rather good idea of his that he should go about the house and holler for im a bit hed know my voice you see ladyship wouldnt mind very likely sleep by now but the moonlight dispelled his irritation how was he to tell his wife he tried various methods to the listening moon there was for example the offhand newsy way you know tha boy yours then a pause for the reply then es toley dispeared only there are difficulties about the word totally or the distressed impersonal manner drefle thing happend drefle thing tha poo lill chap artietoley dispeared totally again or the personal intimate note dunno wha youll say tme tilda when you hear whattogottasay thurly bad news seems they los our artie up thereclean los im cant fine im nowhere tall or the authoritative kindly tildayou go control yourself go show whad you made of our boyeshiclos then he addressed the park at large with a sudden despair don care wha i say shell blame it on to me i know er after that the enormous pathos of the situation got hold of him poor lill chap he said poor lill fell and shed a few natural tears loved im jessis mione son as the circumambient night made no reply he repeated the remark in a louder almost domineering tone he spent some time trying to climb the garden wall because the door did not seem to be in the usual place have to enquire about that in the morning difficult to see everything is all right when one is so bereaved but finally he came on the door round a corner he told his wife merely that he intended to have a peaceful night and took off his boots in a defiant and intermittent manner the morning would be soon enough she looked at him pretty hard and he looked at her ever and again but she never made a guess at it bed so soon as the weekenders had dispersed and sir peter had gone off to london to attend to various matters affecting the peptonizing of milk and the distribution of baby soothers about the habitable globe lady laxton went back to bed and remained in bed until midday on tuesday nothing short of complete rest and the utmost kindness from her maid would she felt save her from a nervous breakdown of the most serious description the festival had been stormy to the end sir peters illadvised attempts to deprive lord moggeridge of alcohol had led to a painful struggle at lunch and this had been followed by a still more unpleasant scene between host and guest in the afternoon this is an occasion for tact sir peter had said and had gone off to tackle the lord chancellor leaving his wife to the direst best founded apprehensions for sir peters tact was a thing by itself a mixture of misconception recrimination and familiarity that was rarely well received she had had to explain to the sunday dinner party that his lordship had been called away suddenly something connected with the great seal lady laxton had whispered in a discreet mysterious whisper one or two simple hearers were left with the persuasion that the great seal had been taken suddenly unwelland probably in a slightly indelicate manner thomas had to paint merglesons eye with greasepaint left over from some private theatricals it had been a patchedup affair altogether and before she retired to bed that night lady laxton had given way to her accumulated tensions and wept there was no reason whatever why to wind up the day sir peter should have stayed in her room for an hour saying what he thought of lord moggeridge she felt she knew quite well enough what he thought of lord moggeridge and on these occasions he always used a number of words that she did her best to believe as a delicately brought up woman were unfamiliar to her ears so on monday as soon as the guests had gone she went to bed again and stayed there trying as a good woman should to prevent herself thinking of what the neighbours could be thinkingand sayingof the whole affair by studying a new and very circumstantial pamphlet by bishop fowle on social evils turning over the moving illustrations of some recent antivivisection literature and rereading the accounts in the morning papers of a colliery disaster in the north of england to such women as lady laxton brought up in an atmosphere of refinement that is almost colourless and living a life troubled only by small social conflicts and the minor violence of sir peter blameless to the point of complete uneventfulness and secure and comfortable to the point of tedium there is something amounting to fascination in the wickedness and sufferings of more normally situated people there is a real attraction and solace in the thought of pain and stress and as her access to any other accounts of vice and suffering was restricted she kept herself closely in touch with the more explicit literature of the various movements for human moralization that distinguish our age and responded eagerly and generously to such painful catastrophes as enliven it the counterfoils of her cheque book witnessed to her gratitude for these vicarious sensations she figured herself to herself in her day dreams as a calm and white and shining intervention checking and reproving amusements of an undesirable nature and earning the tearful blessings of the mangled byproducts of industrial enterprise there is a curious craving for entire reality in the feminine composition and there were times when in spite of these feasts of particulars she wished she could come just a little nearer to the heady dreadfulnesses of life than simply writing a cheque against it she would have liked to have actually seen the votaries of evil blench and repent before her contributions to have herself unstrapped and revived and pitied some doomed and chloroformed victim of the socalled scientist to have herself participated in the stretcher and the hospital and humanity made marvellous by enlistment under the redcross badge but sir peters ideals of womanhood were higher than his language and he would not let her soil her refinement with any vision of the pain and evil in the world sort of woman they want up there is a trained nurse he used to say when she broached the possibility of going to some famine or disaster you dont want to go prying old girl she suffered she felt from repressed heroism if ever she was to shine in disaster that disaster she felt must come to her she might not go to meet it and so you realize how deeply it stirred her how it brightened her and uplifted her to learn from mr merglesons halting statements that perhaps that probably that almost certainly a painful and tragical thing was happening even now within the walls of shonts that there was urgent necessity for actionif anguish was to be witnessed before it had ended and life saved she clasped her hands she surveyed her large servitor with agonized greengrey eyes something must be done at once she said everything possible must be done poor little mite of course my lady e may ave run away oh no she cried he hasnt run away he hasnt run away how can you be so wicked mergleson of course he hasnt run away hes there now and its too dreadful she became suddenly very firm and masterful the mornings colliery tragedy inspired her imagination we must get pickaxes she said we must organize search parties not a moment is to be lost merglesonnot a moment get the men in off the roads get everyone you can and not a moment was lost the road men were actually at work in shonts before their proper dinnerhour was over they did quite a lot of things that afternoon every passage attainable from the diningroom opening was explored and where these passages gave off chinks and crannies they were opened up with a vigour which lady laxton had greatly stimulated by an encouraging presence and liberal doses of whisky through their efforts a fine new opening was made into the library from the wall near the window a hole big enough for a man to fall through because one did and a great piece of stonework was thrown down from the queen elizabeth tower exposing the upper portion of the secret passage to the light of day lady laxton herself and the head housemaid went round the panelling with a hammer and a chisel and called out are you there and attempted an opening wherever it sounded hollow the sweep was sent for to go up the old chimneys outside the present flues meanwhile mr darling had been set with several of his men to dig for discover pick up and lay open the underground passage or disused drain whichever it was that was known to run from the corner of the laundry towards the old icehouse and that was supposed to reach to the abbey ruins after some bold exploratory excavations this channel was located and a report sent at once to lady laxton it was this and the new and alarming scar on the queen elizabeth tower that brought mr beaulieu plummer posthaste from the estate office up to the house mr beaulieu plummer was the marquis of cranberrys estate agent a man of great natural tact and charged among other duties with the task of seeing that the laxtons did not make away with shonts during the period of their tenancy he was a sound compact little man rarely out of extreme riding breeches and gaiters and he wore glasses that now glittered with astonishment as he approached lady laxton and her band of spade workers at his approach mr darling attempted to become invisible but he was unable to do so lady laxton mr beaulieu plummer appealed may i ask oh mr beaulieu plummer im so glad youve come a little boysuffocating i can hardly bear it suffocating cried mr beaulieu plummer where and was in a confused manner told he asked a number of questions that lady laxton found very tiresome but how did she know the boy was in the secret passage of course she knew was it likely she would do all this if she didnt know but mightnt he have run away how could he when he was in the secret passages but why not first scour the countryside by which time he would be smothered and starved and dead they parted with a mutual loss of esteem and mr beaulieu plummer looking very serious indeed ran as fast as he could straight to the village telegraphoffice or to be more exact he walked until he thought himself out of sight of lady laxton and then he took to his heels and ran he sat for some time in the parlour post office spoiling telegraph forms and composing telegrams to sir peter laxton and lord cranberry he got these off at last and then drawn by an irresistible fascination went back to the park and watched from afar the signs of fresh activities on the part of lady laxton he saw men coming from the direction of the stables with large rakes with these they dragged the ornamental waters then a man with a pickaxe appeared against the skyline and crossed the roof in the direction of the clock tower bound upon some unknown but probably highly destructive mission then he saw lady laxton going off to the gardens she was going to console mrs darling in her trouble this she did through nearly an hour and a half and on the whole it seemed well to mr beaulieu plummer that so she should be occupied it was striking five when a telegraph boy on a bicycle came up from the village with a telegram from sir peter laxton stop all proceedings absolutely it said until i get to you lady laxtons lips tightened at the message she was back from much weeping with mrs darling and altogether finely strung here she felt was one of those supreme occasions when a woman must assert herself a matter of life or death she wired in reply and to show herself how completely she overrode such dictation as this she sent mr mergleson down to the village publichouse with orders to engage anyone he could find there for an evenings work on an extraordinarily liberal overtime scale after taking this step the spirit of lady laxton quailed she went and sat in her own room and quivered she quivered but she clenched her delicate fist she would go through with it come what might she would go on with the excavation all night if necessary but at the same time she began a little to regret that she had not taken earlier steps to demonstrate the improbability of bealby having simply run away she set to work to repair this omission she wrote off to the superintendent of police in the neighbouring town to the nearest police magistrate and then on the off chance to various of her weekend guests including captain douglas if it was true that he had organized the annoyance of the lord chancellor and though she still rejected that view she did now begin to regard it as a permissible hypothesis then he might also know something about the mystery of this boys disappearance each letter she wrote she wrote with greater fatigue and haste than its predecessor and more illegibly sir peter arrived long after dark he cut across the corner of the park to save time and fell into one of the trenches that mr darling had opened this added greatly to the clat with which he came into the hall lady laxton withstood him for five minutes and then returned abruptly to her bedroom and locked herself in leaving the control of the operations in his hands if hes not in the house said sir peter all this is thunderin foolery and if hes in the house hes dead if hes dead hell smell in a bit and thenll be the time to look for him somethin to go upon instead of all this blind hacking the place about no wonder theyre threatenin proceedings upon captain douglas lady laxtons letter was destined to have a very distracting effect because as he came to think it over as he came to put her partly illegible allusions to secret passages and a missing boy side by side with his memories of lord moggeridges accusations and the general mystery of his expulsion from shonts it became more and more evident to him that he had here something remarkably like a clue something that might serve to lift the black suspicion of irreverence and levity from his military reputation and he had already got to the point of suggesting to miss philips that he ought to follow up and secure bealby forthwith before ever they came over the hill crest to witness the disaster to the caravan captain douglas it must be understood was a young man at war within himself he had been very nicely brought up firstly in a charming english home then in a preparatory school for selected young gentlemen then in a good set at eton then at sandhurst where the internal trouble had begun to manifest itself afterwards the bistershires there were three main strands in the composition of captain douglas in the first place and what was peculiarly his own quality was the keenest interest in the why of things and the how of things and the general mechanism of things he was fond of clocks curious about engines eager for science he had a quick brain and nimble hands he read jules verne and liked to think about going to the stars and making flying machines and submarinesin those days when everybody knew quite certainly that such things were impossible his brain teemed with larval ideas that only needed air and light to become active fullfledged ideas there he excelled most of us in the next place but this second strand was just a strand that most young men have he had a natural keen interest in the other half of humanity he thought them lovely interesting wonderful and they filled him with warm curiosities and set his imagination cutting the prettiest capers and in the third place and there again he was ordinarily human he wanted to be liked admired approved well thought of and so constituted he had passed through the educational influence of that english home that preparatory school the good set at eton the sandhurst discipline the bistershire mess now the educational influence of the english home the preparatory school the good set at eton and sandhurst in those daysthough sandhurst has altered a little sincewas all to develop that third chief strand of his being to the complete suppression of the others to make him look well and unobtrusive dress well and unobtrusively behave well and unobtrusively carry himself well play games reasonably well do nothing else well and in the best possible form and the two brothers douglas who were really very much alike did honestly do their best to be such plain and simple gentlemen as our country demands taking pretentious established things seriously and not being odd or intelligentin spite of those insurgent strands but the strands were in them below the surface the disturbing impulses worked and at last forced their way out in one captain douglas as mrs rampound pilby told the lord chancellor the suppressed ingenuity broke out in disconcerting mystifications and practical jokes that led to a severance from portsmouth in the other the pentup passions came out before the other ingredients in an uncontrollable devotion to the obvious and challenging femininity of miss madeleine philips his training had made him proof against ordinary women deaf as it were to their charms but sheshe had penetrated and impulsive forces that have been pent upgo with a bang when they go the first strand in the composition of captain douglas has still to be accounted for the sinister strain of intelligence and inventiveness and lively curiosity on that he had kept a warier hold so far that had not been noted against him he had his motor bicycle it is true at a time when motor bicycles were on the verge of the caddish to that extent a watchful eye might have found him suspicious that was all that showed i wish i could add it was all that there was but other thingsother things were going on nobody knew about them but they were going on more and more he read books not decent fiction not official biographies about other fellows fathers and all the old anecdotes brought up to date and so on but books with ideasyou know philosophy social philosophy scientific stuff all that rot the sort of stuff they read in mechanics institutes he thought he could have controlled it but he did not attempt to control it he tried to think he knew perfectly well that it wasnt good form but a vicious attraction drew him on he used to sit in his bedroomstudy at sandhurst with the door locked and write down on a bit of paper what he really believed and why he would cut all sorts of things to do this he would questionthings no properly trained english gentleman ever questions andhe experimented this you know was long before the french and american aviators it was long before the coming of that emphatic lead from abroad without which no wellbred english mind permits itself to stir in the darkest secrecy he used to make little models of cane and paper and elastic in the hope that somehow he would find out something about flying flyingthat dream he used to go off by himself to lonely places and climb up as high as he could and send these things fluttering earthward he used to moon over them and muse about them if anyone came upon him suddenly while he was doing these things he would sit on his model or pretend it didnt belong to him or clap it into his pocket whichever was most convenient and assume the vacuous expression of a wellbred gentleman at leisureand so far nobody had caught him but it was a dangerous practice and finally and this now is the worst and last thing to tell of his eccentricities he was keenly interested in the science of his profession and intensely ambitious he thoughtthough it wasnt his business to think the business of a junior officer is to obey and look a credit to his regimentthat the military science of the british army was not nearly so bright as it ought to be and that if big trouble came there might be considerable scope for an inventive man who had done what he could to keep abreast with foreign work and a considerable weeding out of generals whose promotion had been determined entirely by their seniority amiability and unruffled connubial felicity he thought that the field artillery would be found outthere was no good in making a fuss about it beforehandthat no end of neglected dodges would have to be picked up from the enemy that the transport was feeble and a health serviceother than surgery and ambulancean unknown idea but he saw no remedy but experience so he worked hard in secret he worked almost as hard as some confounded foreigner might have done in the belief that after the first horrid smashup there might be a chance to do things outwardly of course he was sedulously all right but he could not quite hide the stir in his mind it broke out upon his surface in a chattering activity of incompleted sentences which he tried to keep as decently silly as he could he had done his utmost hitherto to escape the observation of the powers that were his infatuation for madeleine philips had at any rate distracted censorious attention from these deeper infamies and now here was a crisis in his life through some idiotic entanglement manifestly connected with this missing boy he had got tarred by his brothers brush and was under grave suspicion for liveliness and disrespect the thing might be his professional ruin and he loved the suppressed possibilities of his work beyond measure it was a thing to make him absentminded even in the company of madeleine not only were the first and second strands in the composition of captain douglas in conflict with all his appearances and pretensions but they were also in conflict with one another he was full of that concealed resolve to do and serve and accomplish great things in the world that was surely purpose enough to hide behind an easygoing unpretending gentlemanliness but he was also tremendously attracted by madeleine philips more particularly when she was not there a beautiful woman may be the inspiration of a great career this however he was beginning to find was not the case with himself he had believed it at first and written as much and said as much and said it very variously and gracefully but becoming more and more distinctly clear to his intelligence was the fact that the very reverse was the case miss madeleine philips was making it very manifest to captain douglas that she herself was a career that a lover with any other career in view need notas the advertisements sayapply and the time she took up the distress of being with her and the distress of not being with her she was such a proud and lovely and entrancing and distressing being to remember and such a vain and difficult thing to be with she knew clearly that she was made for love for she had made herself for love and she went through life like its empress with all mankind and numerous women at her feet and she had an ideal of the lover who should win her which was like a oleographic copy of a laszlo portrait of douglas greatly magnified he was to rise rapidly to great things he was to be a conqueror and administrator while attending exclusively to her and incidentally she would gather desperate homage from all other men of mark and these attentions would be an added glory to her love for him at first captain douglas had been quite prepared to satisfy all these requirements he had met her at shorncliffe for her people were quite good military people and he had worshipped his way straight to her feet he had made the most delightfully simple and delicate love to her he had given up his secret vice of thinking for the writing of quite surprisingly clever loveletters and the little white paper models had ceased for a time to flutter in lonely places and then the thought of his career returned to him from a new aspect as something he might lay at her feet and once it had returned to him it remained with him some day he said and it may not be so very long some of those scientific chaps will invent flying then the army will have to take it up you know i should love she said to soar through the air he talked one day of going on active service how would it affect them if he had to do so it was a necessary part of a soldiers lot but i should come too she said i should come with you it might not be altogether convenient he said for already he had learnt that madeleine philips usually travelled with quite a large number of trunks and considerable impressiveness of course she said it would be splendid how could i let you go alone you would be the great general and i should be with you always not always very comfortable he suggested silly boyi shouldnt mind that how little you know me any hardship a womanif she isnt a nurse i should come dressed as a man i would be your groom he tried to think of her dressed as a man but nothing on earth could get his imagination any further than a vision of her dressed as a principal boy she was so delightfully and valiantly not virile her hair would have flowed her body would have moved a richly fluent femininityvisible through any disguise that was in the opening stage of the controversy between their careers in those days they were both acutely in love with each other their friends thought the spectacle quite beautiful they went together so well admirers fluttered with the pride of participation asked them for weekends together those theatrical weekends that begin on sunday morning and end on monday afternoon she confided widely and when at last there was something like a rupture it became the concern of a large circle of friends the particulars of the breach were differently stated it would seem that looking ahead he had announced his intention of seeing the french army manuvres just when it seemed probable that she would be out of an engagement but i ought to see what they are doing he said theyre going to try those new dirigibles then should she come he wanted to whisk about it wouldnt be any fun for her they might get landed at nightfall in any old hole and besides people would talk especially as it was in france one could do unconventional things in england one couldnt in france atmosphere was different for a time after that halting explanation she maintained a silence then she spoke in a voice of deep feeling she perceived she said that he wanted his freedom she would be the last person to hold a reluctant lover to her side he might goto any manuvres he might go if he wished round the world he might go away from her for ever she would not detain him cripple him hamper a career she had once been assured she inspired the unfortunate man torn between his love and his profession protested that he hadnt meant that then what had he meant he realized he had meant something remarkably like it and he found great difficulty in expressing these fine distinctions she banished him from her presence for a month said he might go to his manuvreswith her blessing as for herself that was her own affair some day perhaps he might know more of the heart of a woman she choked back tearsvery beautifully and military science suddenly became a trivial matter but she was firm he wanted to go he must go for a month anyhow he went sadly into this opening breach rushed friends it was the inestimable triumph of judy bowles to get there first to begin with madeleine confided in her and then availing herself of the privilege of a distant cousinship she commanded douglas to tea in her knightsbridge flat and had a good straight talk with him she liked good straight talks with honest young men about their love affairs it was almost the only form of flirtation that the professor who was a fierce tough undiscriminating man upon the essentials of matrimony permitted her and there was something peculiarly gratifying about douglass complexion under her guidance he was induced to declare that he could not live without madeleine that her love was the heart of his life without it he was nothing and with it he could conquer the world judy permitted herself great protestations on behalf of madeleine and douglas was worked up to the pitch of kissing her intervening hand he had little silvery hairs she saw all over his temples and he was such a simple perplexed dear it was a rich deep beautiful afternoon for judy and then in a very obvious way judy who was already deeply in love with the idea of a caravan tour and the wind on the heath and the gipsy life and the open road and all the rest of it worked this charming little love difficulty into her scheme utilized her reluctant husband to arrange for the coming of douglas confided in mrs geedge and douglas went off with his perplexities he gave up all thought of france weekended at shonts instead to his own grave injury returned to london unexpectedly by a sunday train packed for france and started he reached rheims on monday afternoon and then the image of madeleine which always became more beautiful and mysterious and commanding with every mile he put between them would not let him go on he made unconvincing excuses to the daily excess military expert with whom he was to have seen things theres a woman in it my boy and youre a fool to go said the daily excess man but of course youll go and i for one dont blame you he hurried back to london and was at judys trystingplace even as judy had anticipated and when he saw madeleine standing in the sunlight pleased and proud and glorious with a smile in her eyes and trembling on her lips with a strand or so of her beautiful hair and a streamer or so of delightful blue fluttering in the wind about her gracious form it seemed to him for the moment that leaving the manuvres and coming back to england was quite a right and almost a magnificent thing to do this meeting was no exception to their other meetings the coming to her was a crescendo of poetical desire the sight of her a climax and thenan accumulation of irritations he had thought being with her would be pure delight and as they went over the down straying after the bowles and the geedges towards the redlake hotel he already found himself rather urgently asking her to marry him and being annoyed by what he regarded as her evasiveness he walked along with the restrained movement of a decent englishman he seemed as it were to gesticulate only through his clenched teeth and she floated beside him in a wonderful blue dress that with a wonderful foresight she had planned for breezy uplands on the basis of botticellis primavera he was urging her to marry him soon he needed her he could not live in peace without her it was not at all what he had come to say he could not recollect that he had come to say anything but now that he was with her it was the only thing he could find to say to her but my dearest boy she said how are we to marry what is to become of your career and my career ive left my career cried captain douglas with the first clear note of irritation in his voice oh dont let us quarrel she cried dont let us talk of all those distant things let us be happy let us enjoy just this lovely day and the sunshine and the freshness and the beauty because you know we are snatching these days we have so few days together eacheach must be a gem look dear how the breeze sweeps through these tall dry stems that stick up everywherelow broad ripples she was a perfect work of art abolishing time and obligations for a time they walked in silence then captain douglas said all very wellbeauty and all thatbut a fellow likes to know where he is she did not answer immediately and then she said i believe you are angry because you have come away from france not a bit of it said the captain stoutly id come away from anywhere to be with you i wonder she said wellhavent i i wonder if you ever are with me ohi know you want me i know you desire me but the real thing the happinesslove what is anything to loveanything at all in this strain they continued until their footsteps led them through the shelter of a group of beeches and there the gallant captain sought expression in deeds he kissed her hands he sought her lips she resisted softly no she said only if you love me with all your heart then suddenly wonderfully conqueringly she yielded him her lips oh she sighed presently if only you understood and leaving speech at that enigma she kissed again but you see now how difficult it was under these mystically loving conditions to introduce the idea of a prompt examination and dispatch of bealby already these days were consecrated and then you see bealby vanishedgoing seaward even the crash of the caravan disaster did little to change the atmosphere in spite of a certain energetic quality in the professors direction of the situationhe was a little embittered because his thumb was sprained and his knee bruised rather badly and he had a slight abrasion over one ear and william had bitten his calfthe general disposition was to treat the affair hilariously nobody seemed really hurt except williamthe professor was not so much hurt as annoyedand williams injuries though striking were all superficial a sprained jaw and grazes and bruises and little things like that everybody was heartened up to the idea of damages to be paid for and neither the internal injuries to the caravan nor the hawkers estimate of his stockintrade proved to be as great as one might reasonably have expected before sunset the caravan was safely housed in the winthorpesutbury public house william had found a congenial corner in the bar parlour where his account of an inside view of the catastrophe and his views upon professor bowles were much appreciated the hawker had made a bit extra by carting all the luggage to the redlake royal hotel and the caravanners and their menfolk had loitered harmoniously back to this refuge madeleine had walked along the road beside captain douglas and his motor bicycle which he had picked up at the now desolate encampment it only remains she said for that thing to get broken but i may want it he said no she said heaven has poured us together and now he has smashed the vessels at least he has smashed one of the vessels and looklike a great shield there is the moon its the harvest moon isnt it no said the captain with his poetry running away with him its the lovers moon its like a benediction rising over our meeting and it was certainly far too much like a benediction for the captain to talk about bealby that night was a perfect night for lovers a night flooded with a kindly radiance so that the warm mystery of the centre of life seemed to lurk in every shadow and hearts throbbed instead of beating and eyes were stars after dinner every one found wraps and slipped out into the moonlight the geedges vanished like moths the professor made no secret that judy was transfigured for him night works these miracles the only other visitors there a brace of couples resorted to the boats upon the little lake two enormous waiters removing the coffee cups from the small tables upon the verandah heard madeleines beautiful voice for a little while and then it was stilled the morning found captain douglas in a state of reaction he was anxious to explain quite clearly to madeleine just how necessary it was that he should go in search of bealby forthwith he was beginning to realize now just what a chance in the form of bealby had slipped through his fingers he had dropped bealby and now the thing to do was to pick up bealby again before he was altogether lost her professional life unfortunately had given miss philips the habit of never rising before midday and the captain had to pass the time as well as he could until the opportunity for his explanation came a fellow couldnt go off without an explanation he passed the time with professor bowles upon the golf links the professor was a firstrate player and an unselfish one he wanted all other players to be as good as himself he would spare no pains to make them so if he saw them committing any of the many errors into which golfers fall he would tell them of it and tell them why it was an error and insist upon showing them just how to avoid it in future he would point out any want of judgment and not confine himself as so many professional golf teachers do merely to the stroke after a time he found it necessary to hint to the captain that nowadays a military man must accustom himself to selfcontrol the captain kept pishing and tushing and presently it was only too evident swearing softly his play got jerky his strokes were forcible without any real strength once he missed the globe altogether and several times he sliced badly the eyes under his light eyelashes were wicked little things he remembered that he had always detested golf and the professor he had always detested the professor and his caddie at least he would have always detested his caddie if he had known him long enough his caddie was one of those maddening boys with no expression at all it didnt matter what he did or failed to do there was the silly idiot with his stuffed face unmoved really of course overjoyedbut apparently unmoved why did i play it that way the captain repeated oh because i like to play it that way well said the professor it isnt a recognized way anyhow then came a moment of evil pleasures hed sliced old bowles had sliced for once in a while hed muffed something always teaching others and here he was slicing why sometimes the captain didnt slice hed get out of that neatly enough luck hed get the hole yet what a bore it all was why couldnt madeleine get up at a decent hour to see a fellow why must she lie in bed when she wasnt acting if she had got up all this wouldnt have happened the shame of it here he was an ablebodied capable man in the prime of life and the morning of a day playing this blockheads game yesblockheads game you play the like said the professor rather said the captain and addressed himself to his stroke thats not your ball said the professor similar position said the captain you know you might win this hole said the professor who cares said the captain under his breath and putted extravagantly that saves me said the professor and went down from a distance of twelve yards the captain full of an irrational resentment did his best to halve the hole and failed you ought to put in a week at nothing but putting said the professor it would save you at least a stroke a hole ive noticed that on almost every green if i havent beaten you before i pull up in the putting the captain pretended not to hear and said a lot of rococo things inside himself it was madeleine who had got him in for this game a beautiful healthy girl ought to get up in the mornings mornings and beautiful healthy girls are all the same thing really she ought to be dewypositively dewy there she must be lying warm and beautiful in bedlike catherine the great or somebody of that sort no it wasnt right all very luxurious and so on but not right she ought to have understood that he was bound to fall a prey to the professor if she didnt get up golf here he was neglecting his career hanging about on these beastly links all the sound men away there in franceit didnt do to think of itand he was playing this retired tradesmans consolation beastly the professors legs looked from behind the uglier a mans legs are the better he plays golf its almost a law thats what it was a retired tradesmans consolation a decent british soldier has no more business to be playing golf than he has to be dressing dolls its a game at once worthless and exasperating if a man isnt perfectly fit he cannot play golf and when he is perfectly fit he ought to be doing a mans work in the world if ever anything deserved the name of vice if ever anything was pure unforgivable dissipation surely golf was that thing and meanwhile that boy was getting more and more start anyone with a haporth of sense would have been up at five and after that bratmight have had him bagged and safe and back to lunch ass one was at times youre here sir said the caddie the captain perceived he was in a nasty place open green ahead but with some tumbled country near at hand and to the left a rusty old gravel pit furze at the sides water at the bottom nasty attractive hole of a place sort of thing one gets into he must pull himself together for this after all having undertaken to play a game one must play the game if he hit the infernal thing that is to say the ball if he hit the ball so that if it didnt go straight it would go to the right ratherclear of the hedge it wouldnt be so bad to the right difficult to manage best thing was to think hard of the green ahead a long way aheadwith just the slightest deflection to the right now thenheels well down club up a good swing keep your eye on the ball keep your eye on the ball keep your eye on the ball just where you mean to hit itfar below there and a little to the rightand dont worry rap in the pond i think sir the water would have splashed if it had gone in the pond said the professor it must be over there in the wet sand you hit it pretty hard i thought search the caddie looked as though he didnt care whether he found it or not he ought to be interested it was his profession not just his game but nowadays everybody had this horrid disposition towards slacking a tired generation we are the world is too much with us too much to think about too much to do madeleines army manuvres angry lawyers lost boyslet alone such exhausting foolery as this game got it sir said the caddie where here sir up in the bush sir it was resting in the branches of a bush two yards above the slippery bank i doubt if you can play it said the professor but it will be interesting to try the captain scrutinized the position i can play it he said youll slip im afraid said the professor they were both right captain douglas drove his feet into the steep slope of rusty sand below the bush held his iron a little short and wiped the ball up and over and as he found afterwards out of the rough all eyes followed the ball except his the professor made sounds of friendly encouragement but the captain was goinggoing he was on all fours he scrabbled handfuls of prickly gorse of wet sand his feet his ankles his calves slid into the pond how much more no hed reached the bottom he proceeded to get out again as well as he could not so easy the bottom of the pond sucked at him when at last he rejoined the other three his hands were sandy red his knees were sandy red his feet were of clay but his face was like the face of a little child like the face of a little fair child after it has been boiled red in its bath and then dusted over with white powder his ears were the colour of roses lancaster roses and his eyes too had something of the angry wonder of a little child distressed i was afraid youd slip into the pond said the professor i didnt said the captain i just got in to see how deep it was and cool my feeti hate warm feet he lost that hole but he felt a better golfer now his anger he thought was warming him up so that he would presently begin to make strokes by instinct and do remarkable things unawares after all there is something in the phrase getting ones blood up if only the professor wouldnt dally so with his ball and let ones blood get down again tapthe professors ball went soaring now for it the captain addressed himself to his task altered his plans rather hastily smote and topped the ball the least one could expect was a sympathetic silence but the professor thought fit to improve the occasion youll never drive said the professor youll never drive with that irritable jerk in the middle of the stroke you might just as well smack the ball without raising your club if you think the captain lost his selfcontrol altogether look here he said if you think that i care a single rap about how i hit the ball if you think that i really want to win and do well at this beastly silly elderly childish game he paused on the verge of ungentlemanly language if a things worth doing at all said the professor after a pause for reflection its worth doing well then it isnt worth doing at all as this hole gives you the gameif you dont mind the captains hot moods were so rapid that already he was acutely ashamed of himself o certainly if you wish it said the professor with a gesture the professor indicated the altered situation to the respectful caddies and the two gentlemen turned their faces towards the hotel for a time they walked side by side in silence the caddies following with hushed expressions splendid weather for the french manuvres said the captain presently in an offhand tone that is to say if they are getting this weather at present there are a series of high pressure systems over the whole of europe north of the alps said the professor it is as near set fair as europe can be fine weather for tramps and wanderers said the captain after a further interval theres a drawback to everything said the professor but its very lovely weather they got back to the hotel about halfpast eleven and the captain went and had an unpleasant time with one of the tyres of his motor bicycle which had got down in the night in replacing the tyre he pinched the top of one of his fingers rather badly then he got the ordnance map of the district and sat at a green table in the open air in front of the hotel windows and speculated on the probable flight of bealby he had been last seen going south by east that way lay the sea and all boy fugitives go naturally for the sea he tried to throw himself into the fugitives mind and work out just exactly the course bealby must take to the sea for a time he found this quite an absorbing occupation bealby probably had no money or very little money therefore he would have to beg or steal he wouldnt go to the workhouse because he wouldnt know about the workhouse respectable poor people never know anything about the workhouse and the chances were he would be both too honest and too timid to steal hed beg hed beg at front doors because of dogs and things and hed probably go along a high road hed be more likely to beg from houses than from passersby because a door is at first glance less formidable than a pedestrian and more accustomed to being addressed and hed try isolated cottages rather than the village street doors an isolated wayside cottage is so much more confidential hed ask for foodnot money all that seemed pretty sound now this road on the mapinto it he was bound to fall and along it he would go begging no other no in the fine weather hed sleep out and hed goten twelve fourteenthirteen thirteen miles a day so now he ought to be about here and tonighthere tomorrow at the same pacehere but suppose he got a lift hed only get a slow lift if he got one at all it wouldnt make much difference in the calculation so if tomorrow one started and went on to these cross roads marked inn just about twentysix miles it must be by the scale and beat round it one ought to get something in the way of tidings of mr bealby was there any reason why bealby shouldnt go on south by east and seaward none and now there remained nothing to do but to explain all this clearly to madeleine and why didnt she come down why didnt she come down but when one got bealby what would one do with him wring the truth out of himhalf by threats and half by persuasion suppose after all he hadnt any connexion with the upsetting of lord moggeridge he had suppose he hadnt he had he had he had and when one had the truth whisk the boy right up to london and confront the lord chancellor with the facts but suppose he wouldnt be confronted with the facts he was a touchy old sinner for a time captain douglas balked at this difficulty then suddenly there came into his head the tall figure the long moustaches of that kindly popular figure his adopted uncle lord chickney suppose he took the boy straight to uncle chickney told him the whole story even the lord chancellor would scarcely refuse ten minutes to general lord chickney the clearer the plans of captain douglas grew the more anxious he became to put them before madeleineclearly and convincingly because first he had to catch his boy presently as captain douglas fretted at the continued eclipse of madeleine his thumb went into his waistcoat pocket and found a piece of paper he drew it out and looked at it it was a little piece of stiff notepaper cut into the shape of a curved v rather after the fashion of a soaring bird it must have been there for months he looked at it his carewrinkled brow relaxed he glanced over his shoulder at the house and then held this little scrap high over his head and let go it descended with a slanting flight curving round to the left and then came about and swept down to the ground to the right now why did it go like that as if it changed its mind he tried it again same result suppose the curvature of the wings was a little greater would it make a more acute or a less acute angle he did not know try it he felt in his pocket for a piece of paper found lady laxtons letter produced a stout pair of nail scissors in a sheath from a waistcoat pocket selected a good clear sheet and set himself to cut out his improved v as he did so his eyes were on v number one on the ground it would be interesting to see if this thing turned about to the left again if in fact it would go on zigzagging it ought he felt to do so but to test that one ought to release it from some higher point so as to give it a longer flight stand on the chair not in front of the whole rotten hotel and there was a beastly looking man in a green apron coming out of the housethe sort of man who looks at you he might come up and watch these fellows are equal to anything of that sort captain douglas replaced his scissors and scraps in his pockets leaned back with an affectation of boredom got up lit a cigarettesort of thing the man in the green apron would think all rightand strolled off towards a clump of beech trees beyond which were bushes and a depression there perhaps one might be free from observation just try these things for a bit that point about the angle was a curious one it made one feel ones ignorance not to know that the ideal king has a careworn look he rules he has to do things but the ideal queen is radiant happiness tall and sweetly dignified simply she has to be things and when at last towards midday queen madeleine dispelled the clouds of the morning and came shining back into the world that waited outside her door she was full of thankfulness for herself and for the empire that was given her she knew she was a delicious and wonderful thing she knew she was well done her hands the soft folds of her dress as she held it up the sweep of her hair from her forehead pleased her she lifted her chin but not too high for the almost unenvious homage in the eyes of the housemaid on the staircase her descent was well timed for the lunch gathering of the hotel guests there was ahhere she comes at last and there was her own particular court out upon the verandah before the entrance geedge and the professor and mrs bowlesand mrs geedge coming across the lawnand the lover she came on down and out into the sunshine she betrayed no surprise the others met her with flattering greetings that she returned smilingly but the lover he was not there it was as if the curtain had gone up on almost empty stalls he ought to have been worked up and waiting tremendously he ought to have spent the morning in writing a poem to her or in writing a delightful poetical love letter she could carry away and read or in wandering alone and thinking about her he ought to be feeling now like the end of a vigil he ought to be standing now a little in the background and with that pleasant flush of his upon his face and that shy subdued reluctant look that was so infinitely more flattering than any boldness of admiration and then she would go towards him for she was a giving type and hold out both hands to him and he as though he couldnt help it in spite of all his british reserve would take one and hesitatewhich made it all the more markedand kiss it instead of which he was just not there no visible disappointment dashed her bravery she knew that at the slightest flicker judy and mrs geedge would guess and that anyhow the men would guess nothing ive rested she said ive rested delightfully what have you all been doing judy told of great conversations mr geedge had been looking for trout in the stream mrs geedge with a thin little smile said she had been making a few notes andshe added the word with deliberationobservations and professor bowles said he had had a round of golf with the captain and he lost asked madeleine hes careless in his drive and impatient at the greens said the professor modestly and then he vanished said the professor recognizing the true orientation of her interest there was a little pause and mrs geedge said you know and stopped short interrogative looks focussed upon her its so odd she said curiosity increased i suppose one ought not to say said mrs geedge and yetwhy shouldnt one exactly said professor bowles and every one drew a little nearer to mrs geedge one cant help being amused she said it was soextraordinary is it something about the captain asked madeleine yes you seehe didnt see me is heis he writing poetry madeleine was much entertained and relieved at the thought that would account for everything the poor dear he hadnt been able to find some rhyme but one gathered from the mysterious airs of mrs geedge that he was not writing poetry you see she said i was lying out there among the bushes just jotting down a few little thingsand he came by and he went down into the hollow out of sight and what do you think he is doing youd never guess hes been at it for twenty minutes they didnt guess hes playing with little bits of paperoh like a kitten plays with dead leaves he throws them upand they flutter to the groundand then he pounces on them but said madeleine and then very brightly lets go and see she was amazed she couldnt understand she hid it under a light playfulness that threatened to become distraught even when presently after a very careful stalking of the dell under the guidance of mrs geedge with the others in support she came in sight of him she still found him incredible there was her lover her devoted lover standing on the top bar of a fence his legs wide apart and his body balanced with difficulty and in his fingers poised high was a little scrap of paper this was the man who should have been waiting in the hall with feverish anxiety his fingers released the little model and down it went drifting he seemed to be thinking of nothing else in the world she might never have been born some noise some rustle caught his ear he turned his head quickly guiltily and saw her and her companions and then he crowned her astonishment no lovelight leapt to his eyes he uttered no cry of joy instead he clutched wildly at the air shouted oh damn and came down with a complicated inelegance on all fours upon the ground he was angry with herangry she could see that he was extremely angry so it was that the incompatibilities of man and woman arose again in the just recovering love dream of madeleine philips but now the discord was far more evident than it had been at the first breach suddenly her dear lover her flatterer her worshipper had become a strange averted man he scrabbled up two of his paper scraps before he came towards her still with no lovelight in his eyes he kissed her hand as if it was a matter of course and said almost immediately ive been hoping for you all the endless morning ive had to amuse myself as best i can his tone was resentful he spoke as if he had a claim upon herupon her attentions as if it wasnt entirely upon his side that obligations lay she resolved that shouldnt deter her from being charming and all through the lunch she was as charming as she could be and under such treatment that rebellious ruffled quality vanished from his manner vanished so completely that she could wonder if it had really been evident at any time the alert servitor returned she was only too pleased to forget the disappointment of her descent and forgive him and it was with a puzzled incredulity that she presently saw his difficult expression returning it was an odd little knitting of the brows a faint absentmindedness a filming of the brightness of his worship he was just perceptibly indifferent to the charmed and charming things she was saying it seemed best to her to open the question herself is there something on your mind dot dot was his old school nickname well nonot exactly on my mind but its a bother of course theres that confounded boy were you trying some sort of divination about him with those pieces of paper no that was different that wasjust something else but you see that boy probably clear up the whole of the moggeridge botherand you know it is a bother might turn out beastly awkward it was extraordinarily difficult to express he wanted so much to stay with her and he wanted so much to go but all reason all that was expressible all that found vent in words and definite suggestions was on the side of an immediate pursuit of bealby so that it seemed to her he wanted and intended to go much more definitely than he actually did that divergence of purpose flawed a beautiful afternoon cast chill shadows of silence over their talk arrested endearments she was irritated about six oclock she urged him to go she did not mind anyhow she had things to see to letters to write and she left him with an effect of leaving him for ever he went and overhauled his motor bicycle thoroughly and then an aching dread of separation from her arrested him dinner the late june sunset and the moon seemed to bring them together again almost harmoniously he was able to suggest that he should get up very early the next morning pursue and capture bealby and return for lunch youd get up at dawn she cried but how perfectly splendid the midsummer dawn must be then she had an inspiration dot she cried i will get up at dawn also and come with you yes but as you say he cannot be more than thirteen miles away wed catch him warm in his little bed somewhere and the freshness the dewy freshness and she laughed her beautiful laugh and said it would be such fun entering as she supposed into his secret desires and making the most perfect of reconciliations they were to have tea first which she would prepare with the caravan lamp and kettle mrs geedge would hand it over to her she broke into song a hunting we will goooh she sang a hunting we will go but she could not conquer the churlish underside of the captains nature even by such efforts she threw a glamour of vigour and fun over the adventure but some cold streak in his composition was insisting all the time that as a boy hunt the attempt failed various little delays in her preparations prevented a start before halfpast seven he let that weigh with him and when sometimes she clapped her hands and ranand she ran like a deer and sometimes she sang he said something about going at an even pace at a quarter past one mrs geedge observed them returning they were walking abreast and about six feet apart they bore themselves grimly after the manner of those who have delivered ultimata and they conversed no more in the afternoon madeleine kept her own room exhausted and captain douglas sought opportunities of speaking to her in vain his face expressed distress and perplexity with momentary lapses into wrathful resolution and he evaded judy and her leading questions and talked about the weather with geedge he declined a proposal of the professors to go round the links with especial reference to his neglected putting you ought to you know said the professor about halfpast three and without any publication of his intention captain douglas departed upon his motor bicycle madeleine did not reappear until dinnertime and then she was clad in lace and gaiety that impressed the naturally very good observation of mrs geedge as unreal the captain a confusion of motives that was as it were a mind returning to chaos started he had seen tears in her eyes just for one instant but certainly they were tears tears of vexation or sorrow which is the worse thing for a lover to arouse grief or resentment but this boy must be caught because if he was not caught a perpetually developing story of imbecile practical joking upon eminent and influential persons would eat like a cancer into the captains career and if his career was spoilt what sort of thing would he be as a lover not to mention that he might never get a chance then to try flying for military purposes so anyhow anyhow this boy must be caught but quickly for womens hearts are tender they will not stand exposure to hardship there is a kind of unreasonableness natural to goddesses unhappily this was an expedition needing wariness deliberation and one brought to it a feverish hurry to get back there must be selfcontrol there must be patience such occasions try the soldierly quality of a man it added nothing to the captains selfcontrol that after he had travelled ten miles he found he had forgotten his quite indispensable map and had to return for it then he was seized again with doubts about his inductions and went over them again sitting by the roadside there must be patience he went on at a pace of thirtyfive miles an hour to the inn he had marked upon his map as bealbys limit for the second evening it was a beastly little inn it stewed tea for the captain atrociously and it knew nothing of bealby in the adjacent cottages also they had never heard of bealby captain douglas revised his deductions for the third time and came to the conclusion that he had not made a proper allowance for wednesday afternoon then there was all thursday and the longer lengthening part of friday he might have done thirty miles or more already and he might have crossed this cornerinconspicuously suppose he hadnt after all come along this road he had a momentary vision of madeleine with eyes brightly tearful you left me for a wild goose chase he fancied her saying one must stick to ones job a soldier more particularly must stick to his job consider balaclava he decided to go on along this road and try the incidental cottages that his reasoning led him to suppose were the most likely places at which bealby would ask for food it was a business demanding patience and politeness so a number of cottagers for the greater part they were elderly women past the fiercer rush and hurry of life grandmothers and ancient dames or wives at leisure with their children away at the council schools had a caller that afternoon cottages are such lonely places in the daytime that even district visitors and canvassers are godsends and only tramps ill received captain douglas ranked high in the scale of visitors there was something about him his fairness a certain handsomeness his quick colour his active speech which interested women at all times and now an indefinable flow of romantic excitement conveyed itself to his interlocutors he encountered the utmost civility everywhere doors at first tentatively ajar opened wider at the sight of him and there was a kindly disposition to enter into his troubles lengthily and deliberately people listened attentively to his demands and before they testified to bealbys sustained absence from their perception they would for the most part ask numerous questions in return they wanted to hear the captains story the reason for his research the relationship between himself and the boy they wanted to feel something of the sentiment of the thing after that was the season for negative facts perhaps when everything was stated they might be able to conjure up what he wanted he was asked in to have tea twice for he looked not only pink and dusty but dry and one old lady said that years ago she had lost just such a boy as bealby seemed to beah not in the way you have lost himand she wept poor old dear and was only comforted after she had told the captain three touching but extremely lengthy and detailed anecdotes of bealbys vanished prototype fellow cannot rush away you know still all this sort of thing accumulating means a confounded lot of delay and then there was a deaf old man a very very tiresome deaf old man who said at first he had seen bealby after all the old fellow was deaf the sunset found the captain on a breezy common forty miles away from the redlake royal hotel and by this time he knew that fugitive boys cannot be trusted to follow the lines even of the soundest inductions this business meant a search should he pelt back to redlake and start again more thoroughly on the morrow a moment of temptation if he did he knew she wouldnt let him go no no he must make a sweeping movement through the country to the left trying up and down the roads that roughly speaking radiated from redlake between the twentyfifth and the thirtyfifth milestone it was night and high moonlight when at last the captain reached crayminster that little old town decayed to a village in the crays valley he was hungry dispirited quite unsuccessful and here he resolved to eat and rest for the night he would have a meal for by this time he was ravenous and then go and talk in the bar or the tap about bealby until he had eaten he felt he could not endure the sound of his own voice repeating what had already become a tiresome stereotyped formula you havent i suppose seen or heard anything during the last two days of a small boylittle chap of about thirteenwandering about hes a sturdy resolute little fellow with a high colour short wiry hair rather dark the white hart at crayminster after some negotiations produced mutton cutlets and australian hock as he sat at his meal in the small ambiguous respectable diningroom of the innadorned with framed and glazed beer advertisements crinkled paper fringes and insincere sporting printshe became aware of a murmurous confabulation going on in the bar parlour it must certainly he felt be the bar parlour he could not hear distinctly and yet it seemed to him that the conversational style of crayminster was abnormally rich in expletive and the tone was odd it had a steadfast quality of commination he brushed off a crumb from his jacket lit a cigarette and stepped across the passage to put his hopeless questions the talk ceased abruptly at his appearance it was one of those deeptoned bar parlours that are so infinitely more pleasant to the eye than the tawdry decorations of the genteel accommodation it was brown with a trimming of green paper hops and it had a mirror and glass shelves sustaining bottles and tankards six or seven individuals were sitting about the room they had a numerous effect there was a man in very light floury tweeds with a floury bloom on his face and hair and an anxious depressed expression he was clearly a baker he sat forward as though he nursed something precious under the table next him was a respectablelooking regularfeatured fair man with a large head and a ruddyfaced butcherlike individual smoked a clay pipe by the side of the fireplace a further individual with an alert intrusive look might have been a grocers assistant associating above himself evening said the captain evening said the man with the large hand guardedly the captain came to the hearthrug with an affectation of ease i suppose he began that you havent any of you seen anything of a small boy wandering about hes a little chap about thirteen sturdy resolutelooking little fellow with a high colour short wiry hair rather dark he stopped short arrested by the excited movements of the butchers pipe and by the changed expressions of the rest of the company wewe seen im the man with the big head managed to say at last we seen im all right said a voice out of the darkness beyond the range of the lamp the baker with the melancholy expression interjected i dont care if i dont ever see im again ah said the captain astonished to find himself suddenly beyond hoping on a hot fresh scent now all thats very interesting where did you see him thunderin vicious little varmint said the butcher owdacious mr benshaw said the voice from the shadows es arter im now with a shot gun loaded up wi oats ell pepper im if e gets im bill will you bet your at and serve im jolly well right tew i doubt said the baker i doubt if ill ever get my stummiknot thoroughly proper again its a blow ive ad e give me a blow oh mr orrocks could i trouble you for another thimbleful of brandy just a thimbleful neat it eases the ache chapter vi bealby and the tramp bealby was loth to leave the caravan party even when by his own gross negligence it had ceased to be a caravan party he made off regretfully along the crest of the hills through bushes of yew and box until the clamour of the disaster was no longer in his ears then he halted for a time and stood sorrowing and listening and then turned up by a fence along the border of a plantation and so came into a little overhung road his ideas of his immediate future were vague in the extreme he was a receptive expectation since his departure from the gardeners cottage circumstances had handed him on they had been interesting but unstable circumstances he supposed they would still hand him on so far as he had any definite view about his intentions it was that he was running away to sea and that he was getting hungry it was also he presently discovered getting dark very gently and steadily and the overhung road after some tortuosities expired suddenly upon the bosom of a great grey empty common with distant mysterious hedges it seemed high time to bealby that something happened of a comforting nature always hitherto something or someone had come to his help when the world grew dark and cold and given him supper and put him or sent him to bed even when he had passed a night in the interstices of shonts he had known there was a bed at quite a little distance under the stairs if only that loud voice hadnt shouted curses whenever he moved he would have gone to it but as he went across this common in the gloaming it became apparent that this amiable routine was to be broken for the first time he realized the world could be a homeless world and it had become very still disagreeably still and full of ambiguous shadows that common was not only an unsheltered place he felt but an unfriendly place and he hurried to a gate at the further end he kept glancing to the right and to the left it would be pleasanter when he had got through that gate and shut it after him in england there are no grey wolves yet at times one thinks of wolves grey wolves the colour of twilight and running noiselessly almost noiselessly at the side of their prey for quite a long time before they close in on it in england i say there are no grey wolves wolves were extinguished in the reign of edward the third it was in the histories and since then no free wolf has trod the soil of england only menagerie captives of course there may be escaped wolves now the gatesharp through it and slam it behind you and a little brisk run and so into this plantation that slopes down hill this is a sort of path vague but it must be a path let us hope it is a path what was that among the trees it stopped surely it stopped as bealby stopped pump pump of course that was ones heart nothing there just fancy wolves live in the open they do not come into woods like this and besides there are no wolves and if one shoutseven if it is but a phantom voice one produces they go away they are cowardly thingsreally such as there arent and there is the power of the human eye which is why they stalk you and watch you and evade you when you look and creep and creep and creep behind you turn sharply nothing how this stuff rustled under the feet in woods at twilight with innumerable things darting from trees and eyes watching you everywhere it would be pleasanter if one could walk without making quite such a row presently surely bealby told himself he would come out on a high road and meet other people and say goodnight as they passed jolly other people they would be answering goodnight he was now going at a moistening trot it was getting darker and he stumbled against things when you tumble down wolves leap not of course that there are any wolves it was stupid to keep thinking of wolves in this way think of something else think of things beginning with a b beautiful things boys beads butterflies bears the mind stuck at bears are there such things as long grey bears ugh almost endless noiseless bears it grew darker until at last the trees were black the night was swallowing up the flying bealby and he had a preposterous persuasion that it had teeth and would begin at the back of his legs hi cried bealby weakly hailing the glow of the fire out of the darkness of the woods above the man by the fire peered at the sound he had been listening to the stumbling footsteps for some time and he answered nothing in another minute bealby had struggled through the hedge into the visible world and stood regarding the man by the fire the phantom wolves had fled beyond sirius but bealbys face was pale still from the terrors of the pursuit and altogether he looked a smallish sort of small boy lost said the man by the fire couldnt find my way said bealby anyone with you no the man reflected tired bit come and sit down by the fire and rest yourself i wont urt you he added as bealby hesitated so far in his limited experience bealby had never seen a human countenance lit from behind by a flickering red flame the effect he found remarkable rather than pleasing it gave this stranger the most active and unstable countenance bealby had ever seen the nose seemed to be in active oscillation between pug and roman the eyes jumped out of black caves and then went back into them the more permanent features appeared to be a vast triangle of neck and chin the tramp would have impressed bealby as altogether inhuman if it had not been for the smell of cooking he diffused there were onions in it and turnips and peppermouthwatering constituents testimonials to virtue he was making a stew in an old can that he had slung on a cross stick over a brisk fire of twigs that he was constantly replenishing i wont urt you darn you he repeated come and sit down on these leaves here for a bit and tell me all abart it bealby did as he was desired i got lost he said feeling too exhausted to tell a good story the tramp examined more closely became less pyrotechnic he had a large loose mouth a confused massive nose much long fair hair a broad chin with a promising beard and spotsa lot of spots his eyes looked out of deep sockets and they were sharp little eyes he was a lean man his hands were large and long and they kept on with the feeding of the fire as he sat and talked to bealby once or twice he leant forward and smelt the pot judiciously but all the time the little eyes watched bealby very closely lose yer collar said the tramp bealby felt for his collar i took it orf he said come far over there said bealby where over there what place dont know the name of it then it aint your ome no youve run away said the man praps i ave said bealby praps you ave why praps you ave whats the good of telling lies abart it whend you start monday said bealby the tramp reflected had abart enough of it dunno said bealby truthfully like some soup yes ow much i could do with a lot said bealby ah yah i didnt mean that i meant ow much for some ow much will you pay for a nice nice arf can of soup i aint a darn charity see tuppence said bealby the tramp shook his head slowly from side to side and took out the battered iron spoon he was using to stir the stuff and tasted the soup lusciously it wasjolly good soup and there were potatoes in it thrippence said bealby ow much you got asked the tramp bealby hesitated perceptibly sixpence he said weakly its sixpence said the tramp pay up ow big a can asked bealby the tramp felt about in the darkness behind him and produced an empty can with a jagged mouth that had once contained the label witnessedi quote i do not justifydeep sea salmon that he said and this chunk of bread right enough you will do it said bealby do i look a swindle cried the tramp and suddenly a lump of the abundant hair fell over one eye in a singularly threatening manner bealby handed over the sixpence without further discussion ill treat you fairly you see said the tramp after he had spat on and pocketed the sixpence and he did as much he decided that the soup was ready to be served and he served it with care bealby began at once theres a nextry onion said the tramp throwing one over it didnt cost me much and i gives it you for nothin thats all right eh heres ealth bealby consumed his soup and bread meekly with one eye upon his host he would he decided eat all he could and then sit a little while and then get this tramp to tell him the way toanywhere else and the tramp wiped soup out of his can with gobbets of bread very earnestly and meditated sagely on bealby you better pal in with me matey for a bit he said at last you cant go nowhere elsenot tonight couldnt i walk perhaps to a town or sumpthing these woods aint safe ow dyou mean ever eard tell of a gurrilliasort of big black monkey thing yes said bealby faintly theres been one loose abart ereoh week or more fact and if you wasnt a grown up man quite and going along in the dark welle might say something to you of course e wouldnt do nothing where there was a fire or a manbut a little chap like you i wouldnt like to let you do it strewth i wouldnt its risky course i dont want to keep you there it is you go if you like but id rather you didnt onest whered he come from asked bealby mnagery said the tramp e very near bit through the fist of a chap that tried to stop im said the tramp bealby after weighing tramp and gorilla very carefully in his mind decided he wouldnt and drew closer to the firebut not too closeand the conversation deepened it was a long and rambling conversation and the tramp displayed himself at times as quite an amiable person it was a discourse varied by interrogations and as a thread of departure and return it dealt with the life of the road and with life at large andlife and with matters of must and may sometimes and more particularly at first bealby felt as though a ferocious beast lurked in the tramp and peeped out through the fallen hank of hair and might leap out upon him and sometimes he felt the tramp was large and fine and gay and amusing more particularly when he lifted his voice and his bristling chin and ever and again the talker became a nasty creature and a disgusting creature and his redlit face was an ugly creeping approach that made bealby recoil and then again he was strong and wise so the unstable needle of a boys moral compass spins the tramp used strange terms he spoke of the deputy and the dosshouse of the spike and padding the hoof of screevers and tarts and coppers narks to these words bealby attached such meanings as he could and so the things of which the tramp talked floated unsurely into his mind and again and again he had to readjust and revise his interpretations and through these dim and fluctuating veils a new side of life dawned upon his consciousness a side that was strange and lawless and dirtyin every way dirtyand dreadful andattractive that was the queer thing about it that attraction it had humour for all its squalor and repulsiveness it was lit by defiance and laughter bitter laughter perhaps but laughter it had a gaiety that mr mergleson for example did not possess it had a penetration like the penetrating quality of onions or acids or asaftida that made the memory of mr darling insipid the tramp assumed from the outset that bealby had done something and run away and some mysterious etiquette prevented his asking directly what was the nature of his offence but he made a number of insidious soundings and he assumed that bealby was taking to the life of the road and that until good cause to the contrary appeared they were to remain together its a tough life he said but it has its points and you got a toughish look about you he talked of roads and the quality of roads and countryside this was a good countryside it wasnt overdone and there was no great hostility to wanderers and sleeping out some roadsthe london to brighton for example if a chap struck a match somebody came running but here unless you went pulling the haystacks about too much they left you alone and they werent such dead nuts on their pheasants and one had a chance of an empty cowshed if ive spotted a shed or anything with a roof to it i stay out said the tramp even if its raining cats and dogs otherwise its the dossouse or the spike its the rain is the worst thinggetting wet you havent been wet yet not if you only started monday wetwith a chilly wind to drive it gaw i been blown out of a holly hedge you would think thered be protection in a holly hedge spikes the last thing said the tramp id rather go baregutted to a dossouse anywhen gawyouve not ad your first taste of the spike yet but it wasnt heaven in the dosshouses he spoke of several of the landladies in strange but it would seem unflattering terms and theres always such a blamed lot of washing going on in a dossouse always washing they are one chaps washing is socks and anothers washing is shirt making a steam drying it disgustin carnt see what they want with it all barnd to git dirty again he discoursed of spikes that is to say of workhouses and of masters and then he said with revolting yet alluring adjectives theres the bath thats the worst side of it said the tramp owever it doesnt always rain and if it doesnt rain well you can keep yourself dry he came back to the pleasanter aspects of the nomadic life he was all for the outdoor style aint we comfortable ere he asked he sketched out the simple larcenies that had contributed and given zest to the evenings meal but it seemed there were also dosshouses that had the agreeable side never been in one he said but where you been sleeping since monday bealby described the caravan in phrases that seemed suddenly thin and anmic to his ears you hit it lucky said the tramp if a chaps a kid he strikes all sorts of luck of that sort now ef i come up against three ladies travellin in a vanthink theyd arst me in not it he dwelt with manifest envy on the situation and the possibilities of the situation for some time you aint dangerous he said thats where you get in he consoled himself by anecdotes of remarkable good fortunes of a kindred description apparently he sometimes travelled in the company of a lady named izzy bernersa fair scorcher been a regular slapup circus actress and there was also good old susan it was a little difficult for bealby to see the point of some of these flashes by a tendency on the part of the tramp while his thoughts turned on these matters to adopt a staccato style of speech punctuated by brief darkly significant guffaws there grew in the mind of bealby a vision of the dosshouse as a large crowded place lit by a great central fire with much cooking afoot and much jawing and disputing going on and then me and izzy sailed in the fire sank the darkness of the woods seemed to creep nearer the moonlight pierced the trees only in long beams that seemed to point steadfastly at unseen things it made patches of ashen light that looked like watching faces under the tramps direction bealby skirmished round and got sticks and fed the fire until the darkness and thoughts of a possible gorilla were driven back for some yards and the tramp pronounced the blaze a fair treat he had made a kind of bed of leaves which he now invited bealby to extend and share and lying feet to the fire he continued his discourse he talked of stealing and cheating by various endearing names he made these enterprises seem adventurous and facetious there was it seemed a peculiar sort of happy find one came upon called a flat that it was not only entertaining but obligatory to swindle he made fraud seem so smart and bright at times that bealby found it difficult to keep a firm grasp on the fact that it wasfraud bealby lay upon the leaves close up to the prone body of the tramp and his mind and his standards became confused the tramps body was a dark but protecting ridge on one side of him he could not see the fire beyond his toes but its flickerings were reflected by the tree stems about them and made perplexing sudden movements that at times caught his attention and made him raise his head to watch them against the terrors of the night the tramp had become humanity the species the moral basis his voice was full of consolation his topics made one forget the watchful silent circumambient bealbys first distrusts faded he began to think the tramp a fine brotherly generous fellow he was also growing accustomed to a faint somethingshall i call it an olfactory barthat had hitherto kept them apart the monologue ceased to devote itself to the elucidation of bealby the tramp was lying on his back with his fingers interlaced beneath his head and talking not so much to his companion as to the stars and the universe at large his theme was no longer the wandering life simply but the wandering life as he had led it and the spiritedness with which he had led it and the real and admirable quality of himself it was that soliloquy of consolation which is the secret preservative of innumerable lives he wanted to make it perfectly clear that he was a tramp by choice he also wanted to make it clear that he was a tramp and no better because of the wicked folly of those he had trusted and the evil devices of enemies in the world that contained those figures of spirit isopel berners and susan there was also it seemed a bad and spiritless person the tramps wife who had done him many passive injuries it was clear she did not appreciate her blessings she had been much to blame anybodys opinion is better than er usbands said the tramp always as been bealby had a sudden memory of mr darling saying exactly the same thing of his mother shes the sort said the tramp what would rather go to a meetin than a music all shed rather drop a shilling down a crack than spend it on anything decent if there was a choice of jobs going shed ask which ad the lowest pay and the longest hours and shed choose that shed feel safer she was born scared when there wasnt anything else to do shed stop at ome and scrub the floors gaw it made a chap want to put the darn pail over er ed sos shed get enough of it i dont hold with all this crawling through life and saying please said the tramp i say its my world just as much as its your world you may have your orses and carriages your ouses and country places and all that and you may think gawd sent me to run abart and work for you but i dont see bealby saw i seek my satisfactions just as you seek your satisfactions and if you want to get me to work youve jolly well got to make me i dont choose to work i choose to keep on my own and a bit loose and take my chance where i find it you got to take your chances in this world sometimes they come bad and sometimes they come good and very often you cant tell which it is when they ave come then he fell questioning bealby again and then he talked of the immediate future he was beating for the seaside always something doing he said you got to keep your eye on for cops those seaside benches theyre ot on trampsgive you a month for begging soon as look at youbut theres flats dropping sixpences thick as flies on a sore orse you want a there for all sorts of jobs youre just the chap for it matey saw it soons ever i set eyes on you he made projects finally he became more personal and very flattering now you and me he said suddenly shifting himself quite close to bealby were going to be downright pals ive took a liking to you me and you are going to pal together see he breathed into bealbys face and laid a hand on his knee and squeezed it and bealby on the whole felt honoured by his protection in the unsympathetic light of a bright and pushful morning the tramp was shorn of much of his overnight glamour it became manifest that he was not merely offensively unshaven but extravagantly dirty it was not ordinary rural dirt during the last few days he must have had dealings of an intimate nature with coal he was taciturn and irritable he declared that this sleeping out would be the death of him and the breakfast was only too manifestly wanting in the comforts of a refined home he seemed a little less embittered after breakfast he became even faintly genial but he remained unpleasing a distaste for the tramp arose in bealbys mind and as he walked on behind his guide and friend he revolved schemes of unobtrusive detachment far be it from me to accuse bealby of ingratitude but it is true that that same disinclination which made him a disloyal assistant to mr mergleson was now affecting his comradeship with the tramp and he was deceitful he allowed the tramp to build projects in the confidence of his continued adhesion he did not warn him of the defection he meditated but on the other hand bealby had acquired from his mother an effective horror of stealing and one must admit since the tramp admitted it that the man stole and another little matter had at the same time estranged bealby from the tramp and linked the two of them together the attentive reader will know that bealby had exactly two shillings and twopencehalfpenny when he came down out of the woods to the fireside he had mrs bowles halfcrown and the balance of madeleine philips theatre shilling minus sixpence halfpenny for a collar and sixpence he had given the tramp for the soup overnight but all this balance was now in the pocket of the tramp money talks and the tramp had heard it he had not taken it away from bealby but he had obtained it in this manner we two are pals he said and one of us had better be treasurer thats me i know the ropes better so hand over what you got there matey and after he had pointed out that a refusal might lead to bealbys evisceration the transfer occurred bealby was searched kindly but firmly it seemed to the tramp that this trouble had now blown over completely little did he suspect the rebellious and treacherous thoughts that seethed in the head of his companion little did he suppose that his personal appearance his manners his ethical flavournay even his physical flavourwere being judged in a spirit entirely unamiable it seemed to him that he had obtained youthful and subservient companionship companionship that would be equally agreeable and useful he had adopted a course that he imagined would cement the ties between them he reckoned not with ingratitude if anyone arsts you who i am call me uncle he said he walked along a little in advance sticking his toes out right and left in a peculiar wide pace that characterized his walk and revolving schemes for the happiness and profit of the day to begin withgreat draughts of beer then tobacco later perhaps a little bread and cheese for bealby you cant come in ere he said at the first public house youre under age me boy it aint my doing matey its erbert samuel you blame im e dont objec to you going to work for any other mr samuel there may appen to be abart or anything of that sort thats good for you that is but es most particular you shouldnt go into a public ouse so you just wait abart outside ere ill ave my eye on you you going to spend my money asked bealby im going to ration the party said the tramp youyou got no right to spend my money said bealby iang itill get you some acid drops said the tramp in tones of remonstrance i tell you blame youits erbert samuel i cant elp it i cant fight against the lor you havent any right to spend my money said bealby downt cut up crusty ow can i elp it ill tell a policeman you gimme back my money and lemme go the tramp considered the social atmosphere it did not contain a policeman it contained nothing but a peaceful kindly corner public house a sleeping dog and the back of an elderly man digging the tramp approached bealby in a confidential manner oos going to believe you he said and besides ow did you come by it moreover i aint going to spend your money i got money of my own ere see and suddenly before the dazzled eyes of bealby he held and instantly withdrew three shillings and two coppers that seemed familiar he had had a shilling of his own bealby waited outside the tramp emerged in a highly genial mood with acid drops and a short clay pipe going strong ere he said to bealby with just the faintest flavour of magnificence over the teethheld pipe and handed over not only the acid drops but a virgin short clay fill he said proffering the tobacco its yours jus much as its mine ber not let erbert samuel see you though thats all es got a lor abart it bealby held his pipe in his clenched hand he had already smokedonce he remembered it quite vividly still although it had happened six months ago yet he hated not using that tobacco no he said ill smoke later the tramp replaced the screw of red virginia in his pocket with the air of one who has done the gentlemanly thing they went on their way an illassorted couple all day bealby chafed at the tie and saw the security in the tramps pocket vanish they lunched on bread and cheese and then the tramp had a good sustaining drink of beer for both of them and after that they came to a common where it seemed agreeable to repose and after a due meed of repose in a secluded hollow among the gorse the tramp produced a pack of exceedingly greasy cards and taught bealby to play euchre apparently the tramp had no distinctive pockets in his tail coat the whole lining was one capacious pocket various knobs and bulges indicated his cooking tin his feeding tin a turnip and other unknown properties at first they played for love and then they played for the balance in the tramps pocket and by the time bealby had learnt euchre thoroughly that balance belonged to the tramp but he was very generous about it and said they would go on sharing just as they had done and then he became confidential he scratched about in the bagginess of his garment and drew out a little dark blade of stuff like a flint implement regarded it gravely for a moment and held it out to bealby guess what this is bealby gave it up smell it it smelt very nasty one familiar smell indeed there was with a paradoxical sanitary quality that he did not quite identify but that was a mere basis for a complex reek of acquisitions what is it said bealby soap but whats it for i thought youd arst that whats soap usually for washing said bealby guessing wildly the tramp shook his head making a foam he corrected thats what i has my fits with see i shoves a bit in my mouth and down i goes and i rolls about making a sort of moaning sound why i been given brandy oftenneat brandy it isnt always a certnothings absolutely a cert ive ad some letdowns once i was bit by a nasty little dogthat brought me to pretty quickand once i ad an old gentleman go through my pockets poor chap e ses very likely es destitoot lets see if es got anything id got all sorts of things i didnt want im prying about but i didnt come to sharp enough to stop im got me into trouble that did its an old lay said the tramp but its astonishing ow itll go in a quiet village sort of amuses em or dropping suddenly in front of a bicycle party lot of them old tricks are the best tricks and there aint many of em billy bridget dont know thats where youre lucky to ave met me matey billy bridgets a ard man to starve and i know the ropes i know what you can do and what you cant do and i got a feeling for a policemansame as some people ave for cats id know if one was idden in the room he expanded into anecdotes and the story of various encounters in which he shone it was amusing and it took bealby on his weak side wasnt he the champion dodger of the chelsome playground the tide of talk ebbed well said the tramp time we was up and doing they went along shady lanes and across an open park and they skirted a breezy common from which they could see the sea and among other things that the tramp said was this time we began to forage a bit he turned his large observant nose to the right of him and the left throughout the afternoon the tramp discoursed upon the rights and wrongs of property in a way that bealby found very novel and unsettling the tramp seemed to have his ideas about owning and stealing arranged quite differently from those of bealby never before had bealby thought it possible to have them arranged in any other than the way he knew but the tramp contrived to make most possession seem unrighteous and honesty a code devised by those who have for those who havent theyve just got old of it he said they want to keep it to themselves do i look as though id stole much of anybodys it isnt me got old of this land and sticking up my notice boards to keep everybody off it isnt me spends my days and nights scheming ow i can get old of more and more of the stuff i dont envy it em said the tramp some as one taste and some another but when it comes to making all this fuss because a chap who isnt a schemer elps imself to a mthfulwell its rot its them makes the rules of the game and nobody ever arst me to play it i dont blame em mind you me and you might very well do the same but brast me if i see where the sense of my keeping the rules comes in this world ought to be a share out gawd meant it to be a share out and me and youwe been done out of our share that justifies us it isnt right to steal said bealby it isnt right to stealcertainly it isnt rightbut its universal heres a chap here over this fence ask im where e got is land stealing what you call stealing matey i call restitootion you aint probably never even eard of socialism ive eard of socialists right enough dont believe in gawd and avent no morality dont you believe it whyarf the socialists are parsons what im saying is socialismpractically im a socialist i know all abart socialism there isnt nothing you can tell me abart socialism whyfor three weeks i was one of these here antisocialist speakers paid for it and i tell you there aint such a thing as property left its all a blooming old pinch lords commons judges all of them theyre just a crew of brasted old fences and the lawyers getting in the stuff then you talk to me of stealing stealing the tramps contempt and his intense way of saying stealing were very unsettling to a sensitive mind they bought some tea and grease in a village shop and the tramp made tea in his old tin with great dexterity and then they gnawed bread on which two ounces of margarine had been generously distributed live like fighting cocks we do said the tramp wiping out his simple cuisine with the draggedout end of his shirt sleeve and if im not very much mistaken well sleep tonight on a nice bit of hay but these anticipations were upset by a sudden temptation and instead of a starry summer comfort the two were destined to spend a night of suffering and remorse a green lane lured them off the road and after some windings led them past a field of wirenetted enclosures containing a number of perfect and conceitedlooking hens close beside a little cottage a vegetable garden and some new elaborate outhouses it was manifestly a poultry farm and something about it gave the tramp the conviction that it had been left that nobody was at home these realizations are instinctive they leap to the mind he knew it and an ambition to know further what was in the cottage came with the knowledge but it seemed to him desirable that the work of exploration should be done by bealby he had thought of dogs and it seemed to him that bealby might be unembarrassed by that idea so he put the thing to bealby lets have a look round ere he said you go in and see whats abart there was some difference of opinion i dont ask you to take anything said the tramp nobody wont catch you i tell you nobody wont catch you i tell you there aint nobody here to catch you just for the fun of seeing in ill go up by them outhouses and ill see nobody comes aint afraid to go up a garden path are you i tell you i dont want you to steal you aint got much guts to funk a thing like that ill be abt too thought youd be the very chap for a bit of scarting thought boy scarts was all the go nowadays well if you aint afraid youd do it well why didnt you say youd do it at the beginning bealby went through the hedge and up a grass track between poultry runs made a cautious inspection of the outhouses and then approached the cottage everything was still he thought it more plausible to go to the door than peep into the window he rapped then after an interval of stillness he lifted the latch opened the door and peered into the room it was a pleasantly furnished room and before the empty summer fireplace a very old white man was sitting in a chintzcovered armchair lost it would seem in painful thought he had a peculiar grey shrunken look his eyes were closed a bony hand with the shiny texture of alabaster gripped the chair arm there was something about him that held bealby quite still for a moment and this old gentleman behaved very oddly his body seemed to crumple into his chair his hands slipped down from the arms his head nodded forwards and his mouth and eyes seemed to open together and he made a snoring sound for a moment bealby remained rigidly agape and then a violent desire to rejoin the tramp carried him back through the hen runs he tried to describe what he had seen asleep with his mouth open said the tramp well that aint anything so wonderful you got anything thats what i want to know did anyone ever see such a boy ere ill go you keep a look out here said the tramp but there was something about that old man in there something so strange and alien to bealby that he could not remain alone in the falling twilight he followed the cautious advances of the tramp towards the house from the corner by the outhouses he saw the tramp go and peer in at the open door he remained for some time peering his head hidden from bealby then he went in bealby had an extraordinary desire that somebody else would come his soul cried out for help against some vaguely apprehended terror and in the very moment of his wish came its fulfilment he saw advancing up the garden path a tall woman in a blue serge dress hatless and hurrying and carrying a little packageit was medicinein her hand and with her came a big black dog at the sight of bealby the dog came forward barking and bealby after a moments hesitation turned and fled the dog was quick but bealby was quicker he went up the netting of a hen run and gave the dog no more than an ineffectual snap at his heels and then dashing from the cottage door came the tramp under one arm was a brassbound workbox and in the other was a candlestick and some smaller articles he did not instantly grasp the situation of his treed companion he was too anxious to escape the tall woman and then with a yelp of dismay he discovered himself between woman and dog all too late he sought to emulate bealby the workbox slipped from under his arm the rest of his plunder fell from him for an uneasy moment he was clinging to the side of the swaying hen run and then it had caved in and the dog had got him the dog bit desisted and then finding itself confronted by two men retreated bealby and the tramp rolled and scrambled over the other side of the collapsed netting into a parallel track and were halfway to the hedge before the dogbut this time in a less vehement fashionresumed his attack he did not close with them again and at the hedge he halted altogether and remained hacking the gloaming with his rage the woman it seemed had gone into the house leaving the tramps scattered loot upon the field of battle this means mizzle said the tramp leading the way at a trot bealby saw no other course but to follow he had a feeling as though the world had turned against him he did not dare to think what he was nevertheless thinking of the events of these crowded ten minutes he felt he had touched something dreadful that the twilight was full of accusations he feared and hated the tramp now but he perceived something had linked them as they had not been linked before whatever it was they shared it they fled through the night it seemed to bealby for interminable hours at last when they were worn out and footsore they crept through a gate and found an uncomfortable cowering place in the corner of a field as they went they talked but little but the tramp kept up a constant muttering to himself he was troubled by the thought of hydrophobia i know ill ave it he said i know ill get it bealby after a time ceased to listen to his companion his mind was preoccupied he could think of nothing but that very white man in the chair and the strange manner of his movement was e awake when you saw im he asked at last awakewho that old man for a moment or so the tramp said nothing e wasnt awake you young silly he said at last butwasnt he whydont you know ed croakedpopped off the ooksvery moment you saw im for a moment bealbys voice failed him then he said quite faintly you meanhed was dead didnt you know said the tramp gaw what a kid you are in that manner it was bealby first saw a dead man never before had he seen anyone dead and after that for all the night the old white man pursued him with strange slowlyopening eyes and a head on one side and his mouth suddenly and absurdly agape all night long that white figure presided over seas of dark dismay it seemed always to be there and yet bealby thought of a score of other painful things for the first time in his life he asked himself where am i going what am i drifting to the world beneath the old mans dominance was a world of prisons bealby believed he was a burglar and behind the darkness he imagined the outraged law already seeking him and the terrors of his associate reinforced his own he tried to think what he should do in the morning he dreaded the dawn profoundly but he could not collect his thoughts because of the tramps incessant lapses into grumbling lamentation bealby knew he had to get away from the tramp but now he was too weary and alarmed to think of running away as a possible expedient and besides there was the matter of his money and beyond the range of the tramps voice there were darknesses which tonight at least might hold inconceivable forms of lurking evil but could he not appeal to the law to save him repent was there not something called turning kings evidence the moon was no comfort that night across it there passed with incredible slowness a number of jagged little black clouds blacker than any clouds bealby had ever seen before they were like velvet palls lined with snowy fur there was no end to them and one at last most horribly gaped slowly and opened a mouth at intervals there would be uncomfortable movements and the voice of the tramp came out of the darkness beside bealby lamenting his approaching fate and discoursingsometimes with violent expressionson watchdogs i know i shall ave idrophobia said the tramp ive always ad a disposition to idrophobia always a dread of waterand now its got me think of itkeeping a beast to set at a uman being wheres the brotherhood of it wheres the law and the humanity getting a animal to set at a brother man and a poisoned animal a animal with death in his teeth and a orrible death too wheres the sense and brotherhood gaw when i felt is teeth coming through my trsers dogs oughtnt to be allowed theyre a noosance in the towns and a danger in the country they oughtnt to be allowed anywherenot till every blessed uman being as got three square meals a day then if you like keep a dog and see es a clean dog gaw if id been a bit quicker up that en roost i ought to ave landed im a kick its a mans duty to urt a dog when e sees a dog e ought to urt im its a natural atred if dogs were what they ought to be if dogs understood ow theyre situated there wouldnt be a dog go for a man ever and if one did theyd shoot im after this if ever i get a chance to land a dog a oner with a stone ill land im one i been too sorft with dogs towards dawn bealby slept uneasily to be awakened by the loud snorting curiosity of three lively young horses he sat up in a blinding sunshine and saw the tramp looking very filthy and contorted sleeping with his mouth wide open and an expression of dismay and despair on his face bealby took his chance to steal away next morning while the tramp was engaged in artificial epilepsy i feel like fits this morning said the tramp i could do it well i want a bit of human kindness again after that brasted dog i expect soon ill ave the foam all right withat any soap they marked down a little cottage before which a benevolentlooking spectacled old gentleman in a large straw hat and a thin alpaca jacket was engaged in budding roses then they retired to prepare the tramp handed over to bealby various compromising possessions which might embarrass an afflicted person under the searching hands of charity there was for example the piece of soap after he had taken sufficient for his immediate needs there was ninepence in money there were the pack of cards with which they had played euchre a key or so and some wires much assorted string three tins a large piece of bread the end of a composite candle a box of sulphur matches list slippers a pair of gloves a clasp knife sundry grey rags they all seemed to have the distinctive flavour of the tramp if you do a bunk with these said the tramp by gawd he drew his finger across his throat kings evidence bealby from a safe distance watched the beginnings of the fit and it impressed him as a thoroughly nasty kind of fit he saw the elderly gentleman hurry out of the cottage and stand for a moment looking over his little green garden gate surveying the sufferings of the tramp with an expression of intense yet discreet commiseration then suddenly he was struck by an idea he darted in among his rose bushes and reappeared with a big wateringcan and an enormous syringe still keeping the gate between himself and the sufferer he loaded his syringe very carefully and deliberately bealby would have liked to have seen more but he felt his moment had come another instant and it might be gone again very softly he dropped from the gate on which he was sitting and made off like a running partridge along the hedge of the field just for a moment did he haltat a strange sharp yelp that came from the direction of the little cottage then his purpose of flight resumed its control of him he would strike across country for two or three miles then make for the nearest police station and give himself up loud voices was that the tramp murdering the benevolent old gentleman in the straw hat or was it the benevolent old gentleman in the straw hat murdering the tramp no time to question onward onward the tramps cans rattled in his pocket he drew one out hesitated a moment and flung it away and then sent its two companions after it he found his police station upon the road between someport and crayminster a little peaceful rural station a mere sunny cottage with a blue and white label and a notice board covered with belated bills about the stealing of pheasants eggs and another bill it was headed missing and the next most conspicuous words were reward and the next arthur bealby he was fascinated so swift so terribly swift is the law already they knew of his burglary of his callous participation in the robbing of a dead man already the sleuths were upon his trail so surely did his conscience strike to this conclusion that even the carelessly worded offer of a reward that followed his description conveyed no different intimation to his mind to whomsoever will bring him back to lady laxton at shonts near chelsmore so it ran and out of pocket expenses and even as bealby read this terrible document the door of the police station opened and a very big pink young policeman came out and stood regarding the world in a friendly selfapproving manner he had innocent happy blue eyes thus far he had had much to do with order and little with crime and his rosebud mouth would have fallen open had not discipline already closed it and set upon it the beginnings of a resolute expression that accorded ill with the rest of his open freshness and when he had surveyed the sky and the distant hills and the little rose bushes that occupied the leisure of the force his eyes fell upon bealby indecision has ruined more men than wickedness and when one has slept rough and eaten nothing and one is conscious of a marred unclean appearance it is hard to face ones situations what bealby had intended to do was to go right up to a policeman and say to him simply and frankly i want to turn kings evidence please i was in that burglary where there was a dead old man and a workbox and a woman and a dog i was led astray by a bad character and i did not mean to do it and really it was him that did it and not me but now his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth he felt he could not speak could not go through with it his heart had gone down into his feet perhaps he had caught the tramps constitutional aversion to the police he affected not to see the observant figure in the doorway he assumed a slack careless bearing like one who reads by chance idly he lifted his eyebrows to express unconcern he pursed his mouth to whistle but no whistle came he stuck his hands into his pockets pulled up his feet as one pulls up plants by the roots and strolled away he quickened his stroll as he supposed by imperceptible degrees he glanced back and saw that the young policeman had come out of the station and was reading the notice and as the young policeman read he looked ever and again at bealby like one who checks off items bealby quickened his pace and then doing his best to suggest by the movements of his back a more boyish levity quite unconnected with the law he broke into a trot then presently he dropped back into a walking pace pretended to see something in the hedge stopped and took a sidelong look at the young policeman he was coming along with earnest strides every movement of his suggested a stealthy hurry bealby trotted and then becoming almost frank about it ran he took to his heels from the first it was not really an urgent chase it was a stalking rather than a hunt because the young policeman was too young and shy and lacking in confidence really to run after a boy without any definite warrant for doing so when anyone came along he would drop into a smart walk and pretend not to be looking at bealby but just going somewhere briskly and after two miles of it he desisted and stood for a time watching a heap of mangold wurzel directly and the disappearance of bealby obliquely and then when bealby was quite out of sight he turned back thoughtfully towards his proper place on the whole he considered he was well out of it he might have made a fool of himself and yetfive pounds reward chapter vii the battle of crayminster bealby was beginning to realize that running away from ones situation and setting up for oneself is not so easy and simple a thing as it had appeared during those first days with the caravan three things he perceived had arisen to pursue him two that followed in the daylight the law and the tramp and a third that came back at twilight the terror of the darkness and within there was a hollow faintness for the afternoon was far advanced and he was extremely hungry he had dozed away the early afternoon in the weedy corner of a wood but for his hunger i think he would have avoided crayminster within a mile of that place he had come upon the missing notice again stuck to the end of a barn he had passed it askance and then with a sudden inspiration returned and tore it down somehow with the daylight his idea of turning kings evidence against the tramp had weakened he no longer felt sure mustnt one wait and be asked first to turn kings evidence suppose they said he had merely confessed the crayminster street had a picturesque nutritious look halfway down it was the white hart with cyclist club signs on its walls and geraniums over a white porch and beyond a house being built and already at the roofing pitch to the right was a bakers shop diffusing a delicious suggestion of buns and cake and to the left a little comfortable sweetstuff window and a glimpse of tables and a board teas tea he resolved to break into his ninepence boldly and generously very likely they would boil him an egg for a penny or so yet on the other hand if he just had three or four buns soft new buns he hovered towards the bakers shop and stopped short that bill was in the window he wheeled about sharply and went into the sweetstuff shop and found a table with a white cloth and a motherly little woman in a large cap tea he could have an egg and some thick bread and butter and a cup of tea for fivepence he sat down respectfully to await her preparations but he was uneasy he knew quite well that she would ask him questions for that he was prepared he said he was walking from his home in london to someport to save the fare but youre so dirty said the motherly little woman i sent my luggage by post mam and i lost my way and didnt get it and i dont much mind mam if you dont not washing all that he thought he did quite neatly but he wished there was not that bill in the bakers window opposite and he wished he hadnt quite such a hunted feeling a faint claustrophobia affected him he felt the shop might be a trap he would be glad to get into the open again was there a way out behind if for example a policeman blocked the door he hovered to the entrance while his egg was boiling and then when he saw a large fat baker surveying the world with an afternoon placidity upon his face he went back and sat by the table he wondered if the baker had noted him he had finished his egg he was drinking his tea with appreciative noises when he discovered that the baker had noted him bealbys eyes at first inanely open above the tilting tea cup were suddenly riveted on something that was going on in the bakers window from where he sat he could see that detestable bill and then slowly feeling about for it he beheld a hand and a floury sleeve the bill was drawn up and vanished and then behind a glass shelf of fancy bread and a glass shelf of buns something pink and indistinct began to move jerkily it was a human face and it was trying to peer into the little refreshment shop that sheltered bealby bealbys soul went faint he had one inadequate idea might i go out he said by your back way there isnt a back way said the motherly little woman theres a yard if i might said bealby and was out in it no way at all high walls on every side he was back like a shot in the shop and now the baker was halfway across the road fivepence said bealby and gave the little old woman sixpence here she cried take your penny he did not wait he darted out of the door the baker was all over the way of escape he extended arms that seemed abnormally long and with a weak cry bealby found himself trapped trapped but not hopelessly he knew how to do it he had done it in milder forms before but now he did it with all his being under the diaphragm of the baker smote bealbys hard little head and instantly he was away running up the quiet sunny street man when he assumed the erect attitude made a hostage of his belly it is a proverb among the pastoral berbers of the atlas mountains that the man who extends his arms in front of an angry ram is a fool it seemed probable to bealby that he would get away up the street the baker was engaged in elaborately falling backward making the most of sitting down in the road and the wind had been knocked out of him so that he could not shout he emitted stop him in large whispers away ahead there were only three builders men sitting under the wall beyond the white hart consuming tea out of their tea cans but the boy who was trimming the top of the tall privet hedge outside the doctors saw the assault of the baker and incontinently uttered the shout that the baker could not also he fell off his steps with great alacrity and started in pursuit of bealby a young man from anywhereperhaps the grocers shopalso started for bealby but the workmen were slow to rise to the occasion bealby could have got past them and then abruptly at the foot of the street ahead the tramp came into view a battered disconcerting figure his strawcoloured hat which had recently been wetted and dried in the sun was a swaying mop the sight of bealby seemed to rouse him from some disagreeable meditations he grasped the situation with a terrible quickness regardless of the wisdom of the pastoral berbers he extended his arms and stood prepared to intercept bealby thought at the rate of a hundred thoughts to the minute he darted sideways and was up the ladder and among the beams and rafters of the unfinished roof before the pursuit had more than begun here come off that cried the foreman builder only now joining in the hunt with any sincerity he came across the road while bealby regarded him wickedly from the rafters above then as the good man made to ascend bealby got him neatly on the hat it was a bowler hat with a tile this checked the advance there was a disposition to draw a little off and look up at bealby one of the younger builders from the opposite sidewalk got him very neatly in the ribs with a stone but two other shots went wide and bealby shifted to a more covered position behind the chimney stack from here however he had a much less effective command of the ladder and he perceived that his tenure of the new house was not likely to be a long one below men parleyed who is e asked the foreman builder whered e come from es a brasted little thief said the tramp es one of the wust characters on the road the baker was recovering his voice now theres a reward out for im he said and e butted me in the stummick ow much reward asked the foreman builder five pound for the man who catches him ere cried the foreman builder in an arresting voice to the tramp just stand away from that ladder whatever else bealby might or might not be one thing was very clear about him and that was that he was a fugitive and the instinct of humanity is to pursue fugitives man is a hunting animal enquiry into the justice of a case is an altogether later accretion to his complex nature and that is why whatever you are or whatever you do you should never let people get you on the run there is a joy in the mere fact of hunting the sight of a scarlet coat and a hound will brighten a whole village and now crayminster was rousing itself like a sleeper who wakes to sunshine and gay music people were looking out of windows and coming out of shops a policeman appeared and heard the bakers simple story a brisk hatless young man in a white apron and with a pencil behind his ear became prominent bealby peeping over the ridge of the roof looked a thoroughly dirty and unpleasant little creature to all these people the only spark of human sympathy for him below was in the heart of the little old woman in the cap who had given him his breakfast she surveyed the roof of the new house from the door of her shop she hoped bealby wouldnt hurt himself up there and she held his penny change clutched in her hand in her apron pocket with a vague idea that perhaps presently if he ran past she could very quickly give it him considerable delay in delivering the assault on the house was caused by the foremans insistence that he alone should ascend the ladder to capture bealby he was one of those regularfeatured men with large heads who seem to have inflexible backbones he was large and fair and full with a sweetish chest voice and in all his movements authoritative and deliberate whenever he made to ascend he discovered that people were straying into his building and he had to stop and direct his men how to order them off inside his large head he was trying to arrange everybody to cut off bealbys line of retreat without risking that anybody but himself should capture the fugitive it was none too easy and it knitted his brows meanwhile bealby was able to reconnoitre the adjacent properties and to conceive plans for a possible line of escape he also got a few tiles handy against when the rush up the ladder came at the same time two of the younger workmen were investigating the possibility of getting at him from inside the house there was still no staircase but there were ways of clambering they had heard about the reward and they knew that they must do this before the foreman realized their purpose and this a little retarded them in their pockets they had a number of stones ammunition in reserve if it came again to throwing bealby was no longer fatigued nor depressed anxiety for the future was lost in the excitement of the present and his heart told him that come what might getting on to the roof was an extraordinarily good dodge and if only he could bring off a certain jump he had in mind there were other dodges in the village street an informal assembly of leading citizens a little recovered now from their first nervousness about flying tiles discussed the problem of bealby there was mumby the draper and vegetarian with the bass voice and the big black beard he advocated the fire engine he was one of the volunteer fire brigade and never so happy as when he was wearing his helmet he had come out of his shop at the shouting schocks the butcher and his boy were also in the street schockss yard with its heap of manure and fodder bounded the new house on the left rymell the vet emerged from the billiard room of the white hart and with his head a little on one side was watching bealby and replying attentively to the baker who was asking him a number of questions that struck him as irrelevant all the white hart people were in the street i suppose mr rymell said the baker theres a mort of dangerous things in a mans belly round about is stummick tiles said mr rymell loose bricks it wouldnt do if he started dropping those i was saying mr rymell said the baker after a pause for digestion is a man likely to be injured badly by a blaw in his stummick mr rymell stared at him for a moment with unresponsive eyes more likely to get you in the head he said and then here whats that fool of a carpenter going to do the tramp was hovering on the outskirts of the group of besiegers vindictive but dispirited he had been brought to from his fit and given a shilling by the old gentleman but he was dreadfully wet between his shirthe wore a shirt under three waistcoats and a coatand his skin because the old gentlemans method of revival had been to syringe him suddenly with cold water it had made him weep with astonishment and misery now he saw no advantage in claiming bealby publicly his part he felt was rather a waiting one what he had to say to bealby could be best said without the assistance of a third person and he wanted to understand more of this talk about a reward if there was a reward out for bealby thats not a bad dodge said rymell changing his opinion of the foreman suddenly as that individual began his ascent of the ladder with a bricklayers hod carried shieldwise above his head he went up with difficulty and slowly because of the extreme care he took to keep his head protected but no tiles came bealby had discovered a more dangerous attack developing inside the house and was already in retreat down the other side of the building he did a leap that might have hurt him badly taking off from the corner of the house and jumping a good twelve feet on to a big heap of straw in the butchers yard he came down on all fours and felt a little jarred for an instant and then he was up again and had scrambled up by a heap of manure to the top of the butchers wall he was over that and into maccullums yard next door before anyone in the front of the new house had realized that he was in flight then one of the two workmen who had been coming up inside the house saw him from the oblong opening that was some day to be the upstairs bedroom window and gave tongue it was thirty seconds later and after bealby had vanished from the butchers wall that the foreman still clinging to his hod appeared over the ridge of the roof at the workmans shout the policeman who with the preventive disposition of his profession had hitherto been stopping anyone from coming into the unfinished house turned about and ran out into its brick and plaster and timberlittered backyard whereupon the crowd in the street realizing that the quarry had gone away and no longer restrained came pouring partly through the house and partly round through the butchers gate into his yard bealby had had a check he had relied upon the tarred felt roof of the mushroom shed of maccullum the tailor and breechesmaker to get him to the wall that gave upon mr benshaws strawberry fields and he had not seen from his roof above the ramshackle glazed outhouse which maccullum called his workroom and in which four industrious tailors were working in an easy dishabille the roof of the shed was the merest tarred touchwood it had perished as felt long ago it collapsed under bealby he went down into a confusion of mushrooms and mushroombed he blundered out trailing mushrooms and spawn and rich matter he had a ninefoot wall to negotiate and only escaped by a hairsbreadth from the clutch of a little redslippered man who came dashing out from the workroom but by a happy use of the top of the dustbin he did just get away over the wall in time and the redslippered tailor who was not good at walls was left struggling to imitate an ascent that had looked easy enough until he came to try it for a moment the little tailor struggled alone and then both maccullums little domain and the butchers yard next door and the little patch of space behind the new house were violently injected with a crowd of active people all confusedly on the bealby trail someone he never knew who gave the little tailor a legup and then his red slippers twinkled over the wall and he was leading the hunt into the market gardens of mr benshaw a collarless colleague in list slippers and conspicuous braces followed the policeman after he had completed the wreck of mr maccullums mushroom shed came next and then mr maccullum with no sense of times and seasons anxious to have a discussion at once upon the question of this damage mr maccullum was out of breath and he never got further with this projected conversation than here this he repeated several times as opportunity seemed to offer the remaining tailors got to the top of the wall more sedately with the help of the maccullum kitchen steps and dropped mr schocks followed breathing hard and then a fresh jet of humanity came squirting into the gardens through a gap in the fence at the back of the building site this was led by the young workman who had first seen bealby go away hard behind him came rymell the vet the grocers assistant the doctors pageboy and less briskly the baker then the tramp then mumby and schockss boy then a number of other people the seeking of bealby had assumed the dimensions of a hue and cry the foreman with the large head and the upright back was still on the new roof he was greatly distressed at the turn things had taken and shouted his claims to a major share in the capture of bealby mixed with his opinions of bealby and a good deal of mere swearing to a sunny but unsympathetic sky mr benshaw was a small holder a sturdy english yeoman of the new school he was an antisocialist a selfhelper an independentspirited man he had a steadily growing banking account and a plain but sterile wife and he was dark in complexion and so erect in his bearing as to seem a little to lean forward usually he wore a sort of grey gamekeepers suit with brown gaiters except on sundays when the coat was black he was addicted to bowler hats that accorded ill with his large grave greycoloured face and he was altogether a very sound strong man his bowler hats did but accentuate that he had no time for vanities even the vanity of dressing consistently he went into the nearest shop and just bought the cheapest hat he could and so he got hats designed for the youthful and giddy hats with flighty crowns and flippant bows and amorous brims that undulated attractively to set off flushed and foolish young faces it made his unrelenting face look rather like the puritans under the stuart monarchy he was a horticulturist rather than a farmer he had begun his career in cheap lodgings with a field of early potatoes and cabbages supplemented by employment but with increased prosperity his area of cultivation had extended and his methods intensified he now grew considerable quantities of strawberries raspberries celery seakale asparagus early peas late peas and onions and consumed more stable manure than any other cultivator within ten miles of crayminster he was beginning to send cut flowers to london he had half an acre of glass and he was rapidly extending it he had built himself a cottage on lines of austere economy and a bonylooking dwelling house for some of his men he also owned a number of useful sheds of which tar and corrugated iron were conspicuous features his home was furnished with the utmost respectability and notably joyless even in a countryside where gaiety is regarded as an impossible quality in furniture he was already in a small local way a mortgagee good fortune had not turned the head of mr benshaw nor robbed him of the feeling that he was a particularly deserving person entitled to a preferential treatment from a country which in his plain unsparing way he felt that he enriched in many ways he thought that the country was careless of his needs and in none more careless than in the laws relating to trespass across his dominions ran three footpaths and one of these led to the public elementary school that he should have to maintain this latterand if he did not keep it in good order the children spread out and made parallel tracks among his cultivationsseemed to him a thing almost intolerably unjust he mended it with cinders acetylene refuse which he believed and hoped to be thoroughly bad for boots and a peculiarly slimy chalky clay and he put on a board at each end keep to the footpaths trespassers will be prosecuted by order which he painted himself to save expense when he was confined indoors by the influenza still more unjust it would be he felt for him to spend money upon effective fencing and he could find no fencing cheap enough and ugly enough and painful enough and impossible enough to express his feelings in the matter every day the children streamed to and fro marking how his fruits ripened and his produce became more esculent and other people pursued these tracks many mr benshaw was convinced went to and fro through his orderly crops who had no business whatever no honest business to pass that way either he concluded they did it to annoy him or they did it to injure him this continual invasion aroused in mr benshaw all that stern anger against unrighteousness latent in our race which more than any other single force has made america and the empire what they are today once already he had been robbeda raid upon his raspberriesand he felt convinced that at any time he might be robbed again he had made representations to the local authority to get the footpath closed but in vain they defended themselves with the paltry excuse that the children would then have to go nearly a mile round to the school it was not only the tyranny of these footpaths that offended mr benshaws highly developed sense of individual liberty all round his rather straggling dominions his neighbours displayed an ungenerous indisposition to maintain their fences to his satisfaction in one or two places in abandonment of his clear rights in the matter he had at his own expense supplemented these lax defences with light barbed wire defences but it was not a very satisfactory sort of barbed wire he wanted barbed wire with extra spurs like a fighting cock he wanted barbed wire that would start out after nightfall and attack passersby this boundary trouble was universal in a way it was worse than the footpaths which after all only affected the cage fields where his strawberries grew except for the yard and garden walls of maccullum and schocks and that side there was not really a satisfactory foot of enclosure all round mr benshaw on the one side rats and peoples dogs and scratching cats came in on the other side rabbits the rabbits were intolerable and recently there had been a rise of nearly thirty per cent in the price of wire netting mr benshaw wanted to hurt rabbits he did not want simply to kill them he wanted so to kill them as to put the fear of death into the burrows he wanted to kill them so that scared little furry survivors with their tails as white as ghosts would go lolloping home and say i say you chaps wed better shift out of this were up against a strong determined man i have made this lengthy statement of mr benshaws economic and moral difficulties in order that the reader should understand the peculiar tension that already existed upon this side of crayminster it has been necessary to do so now because in a few seconds there will be no further opportunity for such preparations there had been trouble i may add very hastily about the shooting of mr benshaws gun a shower of small shot had fallen out of the twilight upon the umbrella and basket of old mrs frobisher and only a week ago an unsympathetic bench after a hearing of over an hour and in the face of overwhelming evidence had refused to convict little lucy mumby aged eleven of stealing fruit from mr benshaws fields she had been caught redhanded at the very moment that bealby was butting the baker in the stomach mr benshaw was just emerging from his austere cottage after a wholesome but inexpensive high tea in which he had finished up two leftover cold sausages and he was considering very deeply the financial side of a furious black fence that he had at last decided should pen in the school children from further depredations it should be of splintery tarred deal and high with wellpointed tops studded with sharp nails and he believed that by making the path only two feet wide a real saving of ground for cultivation might be made and a very considerable discomfort for the public arranged to compensate for his initial expense the thought of a narrow lane which would in winter be characterized by an excessive slimness and from which there would be no lateral escape was pleasing to a mind by no means absolutely restricted to considerations of pounds shillings and pence in his hand after his custom he carried a hoe on the handle of which feet were marked so that it was available not only for destroying the casual weed but also for purposes of measurement with this he now checked his estimate and found that here he would reclaim as much as three feet of trodden waste here a full two absorbed in these calculations he heeded little the growth of a certain clamour from the backs of the houses bordering on the high street it did not appear to concern him and mr benshaw made it almost ostentatiously his rule to mind his own business his eyes remained fixed on the lumpy dusty sunbaked track that with an intelligent foresight he saw already transformed into a deterrent slough of despond for the young then quite suddenly the shouting took on a new note he glanced over his shoulder almost involuntarily and discovered that after all this uproar was his business amazingly his business his mouth assumed a cromwellian fierceness his grip tightened on his hoe that anyone should dare but it was impossible his dominions were being invaded with a peculiar boldness and violence ahead of everyone else and running with wild wavings of the arms across his strawberries was a small and very dirty little boy he impressed mr benshaw merely as a pioneer some thirty yards behind him was a little collarless shortsleeved man in red slippers running with great effrontery and behind him another still more denuded lunatic also in list slippers and with bracesbraces of inconceivable levity and then wiggs the policeman hotly followed by mr maccullum then more distraught tailors and schocks the butcher but a louder shout heralded the main attack and mr benshaw turned his eyesalready they were slightly bloodshot eyesto the right and saw pouring through the broken hedge a disorderly crowd rymell whom he had counted his friend the grocers assistant the doctors boy some strangersmumby at the sight of mumby mr benshaw leapt at a conclusion he saw it all the whole place was rising against him they were asserting some infernal new rightofway mumbymumby had got them to do it all the fruits of fifteen years of toil all the care and accumulation of mr benshaws prime were to be trampled and torn to please a drapers spite sturdy yeoman as mr benshaw was he resolved instantly to fight for his liberties one moment he paused to blow the powerful police whistle he carried in his pocket and then rushed forward in the direction of the hated mumby the leader of trespassers the parent and abetter and defender of the criminal lucy he took the hurrying panting man almost unawares and with one wild sweep of the hoe felled him to the earth then he staggered about and smote again but not quite in time to get the head of mr rymell this whistle he carried was part of a systematic campaign he had developed against trespassers and fruit stealers he and each of his assistants carried one and at the first shrill noteit was his ruleeveryone seized on every weapon that was handy and ran to pursue and capture all his assistants were extraordinarily prompt in responding to these alarms which were often the only break in long days of strenuous and strenuously directed toil so now with an astonishing promptitude and animated faces men appeared from sheds and greenhouses and distant patches of culture hastening to the assistance of their dour employer it says much for the amiable relations that existed between employers and employed in those days before syndicalism became the creed of the younger workers that they did hurry to his assistance but many rapid things were to happen before they came into action for first a strange excitement seized upon the tramp a fantastic delusive sense of social rehabilitation took possession of his soul here he was pitted against a formidable hoewielding man who for some inscrutable reason was resolved to cover the retreat of bealby and all the world it seemed was with the tramp and against this hoewielder all the tremendous forces of human society against which the tramp had struggled for so many years whose power he knew and feared as only the outlaw can had suddenly come into line with him across the strawberries to the right there was even a policeman hastening to join the majority a policeman closely followed by a tradesman of the blackest most respectable quality the tramp had a vision of himself as a respectable man heroically leading respectable people against outcasts he dashed the lank hair from his eyes waved his arms laterally and then with a loud strange cry flung himself towards mr benshaw two pairs of superimposed coattails flapped behind him and then the hoe whistled through the air and the tramp fell to the ground like a sack but now schockss boy had grasped his opportunity he had been working discreetly round behind mr benshaw and as the hoe smote he leapt upon that heros back and seized him about the neck with both arms and bore him staggering to the ground and rymell equally quick and used to the tackling of formidable creatures had snatched and twisted away the hoe and grappled mr benshaw almost before he was down the first of mr benshaws helpers to reach the fray found the issue decided his master held down conclusively and a growing circle trampling down a wide area of strawberry plants about the panting group mr mumby more frightened than hurt was already sitting up but the tramp with a glowing wound upon his cheekbone and an expression of astonishment in his face lay low and pawed the earth what dyou mean gasped mr rymell hitting people about with that hoe what dyou mean groaned mr benshaw running across my strawberries we were going after that boy pounds and pounds worth of damage mischief and wickedness mumby mr rymell suddenly realizing the true values of the situation released mr benshaws hands and knelt up look here mr benshaw he said you seem to be under the impression we are trespassing mr benshaw struggling into a sitting position was understood to enquire with some heat what mr rymell called it schockss boy picked up the hat with the erotic brim and handed it to the horticulturist silently and respectfully we were not trespassing said mr rymell we were following up that boy he was trespassing if you like by the byewhere is the boy has anyone caught him at the question attention which had been focussed upon mr benshaw and his hoe came round across the field in the direction of the sunlit half acre of glass the little tailor was visible standing gingerly and picking up his red slippers for the third timethey would come off in that loose good soil everybody else had left the trail to concentrate on mr benshawand bealby bealby was out of sight he had escaped clean got away what boy asked mr benshaw ferocious little beast whos fought us like a rat been committing all sorts of crimes about the country five pounds reward for him fruit stealing asked mr benshaw yes said mr rymell chancing it mr benshaw reflected slowly his eyes surveyed his trampled crops gooo lord he cried look at those strawberries his voice gathered violence and that lout there he said whyhes lying on them thats the brute who went for me you got him a pretty tidy one side the head said maccullum the tramp rolled over on some fresh strawberries and groaned pitifully hes hurt said mr mumby the tramp flopped and lay still get some water said rymell standing up at the word water the tramp started convulsively rolled over and sat up with a dazed expression no water he said weakly no more water and then catching mr benshaws eye he got rather quickly to his feet everybody who wasnt already standing was getting up and everyone now was rather carefully getting himself off any strawberry plant he had chanced to find himself smashing in the excitement of the occasion thats the man that started in on me said mr benshaw whats he doing here who is he who are you my man what business have you to be careering over this field asked mr rymell i was only elping said the tramp nice help said mr benshaw i thought that boy was a thief or something and so you made a rush at me i didnt exactlysiri thought you was elping im you be off anyhow said mr benshaw whatever you thought yes you be off said mr rymell thats the way my man said mr benshaw we havent any jobs for you the sooner we have you out of it the better for everyone get right on to the path and keep it and with a desolating sense of exclusion the tramp withdrew theres pounds and pounds worth of damage here said mr benshaw this jobll cost me a pretty penny look at them berries there why they aint fit for jam and all done by one confounded boy an evil light came into mr benshaws eyes you leave him to me and my chaps if hes gone up among those sheds therewell settle with him anyhow theres no reason why my fruit should be trampled worse than it has been fruit stealer you say he is they live on the country this time of year said mr mumby and catch them doing a days work picking said mr benshaw i know the sort theres a reward of five pounds for im already said the baker you perceive how humanitarian motives may sometimes defeat their own end and how little lady laxtons wellintentioned handbills were serving to rescue bealby instead they were turning him into a scared and hunted animal in spite of its manifest impossibility he was convinced that the reward and this pursuit had to do with his burglary of the poultry farm and that his capture would be but the preliminary to prison trial and sentence his one remaining idea was to get away but his escape across the market gardens had left him so blown and spent that he was obliged to hide up for a time in this perilous neighbourhood before going on he saw a disusedlooking shed in the lowest corner of the gardens behind the greenhouses and by doubling sharply along a hedge he got to it unseen it was not disusednothing in mr benshaws possession ever was absolutely disused but it was filled with horticultural lumber with old calcium carbide tins with broken wheelbarrows and damaged ladders awaiting repair with some ragged wheeling planks and surplus rolls of roofing felt at the back were some unhinged shed doors leaning against the wall and between them bealby tucked himself neatly and became still glad of any respite from the chase he would wait for twilight and then get away across the meadows at the back and then gohe didnt know whither and now he had no confidence in the wild world any more a qualm of homesickness for the compact little gardeners cottage at shonts came to bealby why as a matter of fact wasnt he there now he ought to have tried more at shonts he ought to have minded what they told him and not have taken up a toasting fork against thomas then he wouldnt now have been a hunted burglar with a reward of five pounds on his head and nothing in his pocket but threepence and a pack of greasy playing cards a box of sulphur matches and various objectionable sundries none of which were properly his own if only he could have his time over again such wholesome reflections occupied his thoughts until the onset of the dusk stirred him to departure he crept out of his hidingplace and stretched his limbs which had got very stiff and was on the point of reconnoitring from the door of the shed when he became aware of stealthy footsteps outside with the quickness of an animal he shot back into his hidingplace the footsteps had halted for a long time it seemed the unseen waited listening had he heard bealby then someone fumbled with the door of the shed it opened and there was a long pause of cautious inspection then the unknown had shuffled into the shed and sat down on a heap of matting gaw said a voice the tramps if ever i struck a lefthanded mascot it was that boy said the tramp the little swine for the better part of two minutes he went on from this mild beginning to a descriptive elaboration of bealby for the first time in his life bealby learnt how unfavourable was the impression he might leave on a fellow creatures mind took even my matches cried the tramp and tried this statement over with variations first that old fool with his syringe the tramps voice rose in angry protest heres a chap dying epilepsy on your doorstep and all you can do is to squirt cold water at him cold water why you might kill a man doing that and then say youd thoughtd bring im rnd bring im rnd you be jolly glad i didnt stash your silly face in you misbegotten old fool whats a shilling for wetting a man to is skin wet through i was running inside my shirtdripping and then the blooming boy clears i dont know what boys are coming to cried the tramp these board schools it is gets old of everything e can and bunks gaw if i get my ands on im ill show im ill for some time the tramp revelled in the details for the most part crudely surgical of his vengeance upon bealby then theres that dog bite ow do i know ow thats going to turn t if i get idrophobia blowed if i dont bite some of em idrophobia screaming and foaming nice death for a manmy time o life bark i shall bark and bite and this is your world said the tramp this is the world you put people into and expect em to be appy id like to bite that doughfaced fool with the silly at id enjoy biting im id spit it out but id bite it right enough wiping abt with is o gaw get off my ground be orf with you slash e ought to be shut up wheres the justice of it shouted the tramp wheres the right and the sense of it what ave i done that i should always get the under side why should i be stuck on the under side of everything theres worse men than me in all sorts of positions judges there are orrible kerecters ministers and people ive read abt em in the papers its we tramps are the scapegoats somebodys got to suffer so as the police can show a face gaw some of these days ill do something ill do something youll drive me too far with it i tell you he stopped suddenly and listened bealby had creaked gaw what can one do said the tramp after a long interval and then complaining more gently the tramp began to feel about to make his simple preparations for the night unt me out of this i expect said the tramp and many sleeping in feather beds that aint fit to old a candle to me not a hordinary farthing candle the subsequent hour or so was an interval of tedious tension for bealby after vast spaces of time he was suddenly aware of three vertical threads of light he stared at them with mysterious awe until he realized that they were just the moonshine streaming through the cracks of the shed the tramp tossed and muttered in his sleep footsteps yesfootsteps then voices they were coming along by the edge of the field and coming and talking very discreetly ugh said the tramp and then softly whats that then he too became noiselessly attentive bealby could hear his own heart beating the men were now close outside the shed he wouldnt go in there said mr benshaws voice he wouldnt dare anyhow well go up by the glass first ill let him have the whole barrelful of oats if i get a glimpse of him if hed gone away theyd have caught him in the road the footsteps receded there came a cautious rustling on the part of the tramp and then his feet padded softly to the door of the shed he struggled to open it and then with a jerk got it open a few inches a great bar of moonlight leapt and lay still across the floor of the shed bealby advanced his head cautiously until he could see the black obscure indications of the tramps back as he peeped out now whispered the tramp and opened the door wider then he ducked his head down and darted out of sight leaving the door open behind him bealby questioned whether he should follow he came out a few steps and then went back at a shout from away up the garden there he goes shouted a voice in the shadow of the hedge look out jimbangand a yelp stand away ive got another barrel bang then silence for a time and then the footsteps coming back that ought to teach him said mr benshaw first time i got him fair and i think i peppered him a bit the second couldnt see very well but i heard him yell he wont forget that in a hurry not him theres nothing like oats for fruit stealers jim just shut that door will you thats where he was hiding it seemed a vast time to bealby before he ventured out into the summer moonlight and a very pitiful and outcast little bealby he felt himself to be he was beginning to realize what it means to go beyond the narrow securities of human society he had no friends no friends at all he caught at and arrested a sob of selfpity perhaps after all it was not so late as bealby had supposed there were still lights in some of the houses and he had the privilege of seeing mr benshaw going to bed with pensive deliberation mr benshaw wore a flannel nightshirt and said quite a lengthy prayer before extinguishing his candle then suddenly bealby turned nervously and made off through the hedge a dog had barked at first there were nearly a dozen lighted windows in crayminster they went out one by one he hung for a long time with a passionate earnestness on the sole surviving one but that too went at last he could have wept when at last it winked out he came down into the marshy flats by the river but he did not like the way in which the water sucked and swirled in the vague moonlight also he suddenly discovered a great white horse standing quite still in the misty grass not thirty yards away so he went up to and crossed the high road and wandered up the hillside towards the allotments which attracted him by reason of the sociability of the numerous tool sheds in a hedge near at hand a young rabbit squealed sharply and was stilled why then something like a short snake scrabbled by very fast through the grass then he thought he saw the tramp stalking him noiselessly behind some currant bushes that went on for some time but came to nothing then nothing pursued him nothing at all the gap the void came after him the bodiless the faceless the formless these are evil hunters in the night what a cold still watching thing moonlight can be he thought he would like to get his back against something solid and found near one of the sheds a little heap of litter he sat down against good tarred boards assured at least that whatever came must come in front whatever he did he was resolved he would not shut his eyes that would be fatal he awoke in broad daylight amidst a cheerful uproar of birds and then again flight and pursuit were resumed as bealby went up the hill away from crayminster he saw a man standing over a spade and watching his retreat and when he looked back again presently this man was following it was lady laxtons five pound reward had done the thing for him he was half minded to surrender and have done with it but jail he knew was a dreadful thing of stone and darkness he would make one last effort so he beat along the edge of a plantation and then crossed it and forced his way through some gorse and came upon a sunken road that crossed the hill in a gorselined cutting he struggled down the steep bank at its foot regardless of him unaware of him a man sat beside a motor bicycle with his fists gripped tight and his head downcast swearing a county map was crumpled in his hand damn he cried and flung the map to the ground and kicked it and put his foot on it bealby slipped came down the bank with a run and found himself in the road within a couple of yards of the blond features and angry eyes of captain douglas when he saw the captain and perceived himself recognized he flopped downa done and finished bealby he had arrived just in time to interrupt the captain in a wild and reprehensible fit of passion the captain imagined it was a secret fit of passion he thought he was quite alone and that no one could hear him or see him so he had let himself shout and stamp to work off the nervous tensions that tormented him beyond endurance in the direst sense of the words the captain was in love with madeleine he was in love quite beyond the bounds set by refined and decorous people to this dangerous passion the primordial savage that lurks in so many of us was uppermost in him he was not in love with her prettily or delicately he was in love with her violently and vehemently he wanted to be with her he wanted to be close to her he wanted to possess her and nobody else to approach her he was so inflamed now that no other interest in life had any importance except as it aided or interfered with this desire he had forced himself in spite of this fever in his blood to leave her to pursue bealby and now he was regretting this firmness furiously he had expected to catch bealby overnight and bring him back to the hotel in triumph but bealby had been elusive there she was away there hurt and indignantneglected a laggard in love cried the captain a dastard in war godi run away from everything first i leave the manuvres then her unstable as water thou shalt not prevail water what does the confounded boy matter what does he matter and there she is alone shell flirtnaturally shell flirt dont i deserve it havent i asked for it just the one little time we might have had together i fling it in her face you fool you laggard you dastard and heres this map a breathing moment how the devil cried the captain am i to find the little beast on this map and twice hes been within reach of my hand no decision cried the captain no instant grip what good is a soldier without it what good is any man who will not leap at opportunity i ought to have chased out last night after that fool and his oats then i might have had a chance chuck it chuck the whole thing go back to her kneel to her kiss her compel her and what sort of reception am i likely to get he crumpled the flapping map in his fist and then suddenly out of nowhere bealby came rolling down to his feet a dishevelled and earthy bealby but bealby good lord cried the captain starting to his feet and holding the map like a sword sheath what do you want for a second bealby was a silent spectacle of misery oooh i want my breckfuss he burst out at last reduced to tears are you young bealby asked the captain seizing him by the shoulder theyre after me cried bealby if they catch me theyll put me in prison where they dont give you anything it wasnt me did itand i avent had anything to eatnot since yesterday the captain came rapidly to a decision there should be no more faltering he saw his way clear before him he would actlike a whistling sword here jump up behind he said hold on tight to me for a time there was a more than napoleonic swiftness in the captains movements when bealbys pursuer came up to the hedge that looks down into the sunken road there was no bealby no captain nothing but a torn and dishevelled county map an almost imperceptible odour of petrol and a faint soundlike a distant mowing machineand the motor bicycle was a mile away on the road to beckinstone eight miles eight rather sickening miles bealby did to beckinstone in eleven minutes and there in a little coffee house he was given breakfast with eggs and bacon and marmalade prime and his spirit was restored to him while the captain raided a bicycle and repairing shop and negotiated the hire of an experienced but fairly comfortable wickerwork trailer and so to london through the morning sunshine leaving tramps pursuers policemen handbills bakers market gardeners terrors of the darkness and everything upon the road behindand further behind and remote and insignificantand so to the vanishing point some few words of explanation the captain had vouchsafed and that was all dont be afraid about it he said dont be in the least bit afraid you tell them about it just simply and truthfully exactly what you did exactly how you got into it and out of it and all about it youre going to take me up to a magistrate sir im going to take you up to the lord chancellor himself and then they wont do anything nothing at all bealby you trust me all youve got to do is to tell the simple truth it was pretty rough going in the trailer but very exciting if you gripped the sides very hard and sat quite tight nothing very much happened and also there was a strap across your chest and you went past everything there wasnt a thing on the road the captain didnt pass lowing deeply with his great horn when they seemed likely to block his passage and as for the burglary and everything it would all be settled the captain also found that ride to london exhilarating at least he was no longer hanging about he was getting to something he would be able to go back to herand all his being now yearned to go back to herwith things achieved with successes to show hed found the boy he would go straight to dear old uncle chickney and uncle chickney would put things right with moggeridge the boy would bear his testimony moggeridge would be convinced and all would be well again he might be back with madeleine that evening he would go back to her and she would see the wisdom and energy of all he had done and she would lift that dear chin of hers and smile that dear smile of hers and hold out her hand to be kissed and the lights and reflections would play on that strong soft neck of hers they buzzed along stretches of common and stretches of straightedged meadowland by woods and orchards by pleasant inns and slumbering villages and the gates and lodges of country houses these latter grew more numerous and presently they skirted a town and then more road more villages and at last signs of a nearness to london more frequent houses more frequent inns hoardings and advertisements an asphalted sidewalk lamps a gasworks laundries a stretch of suburban villadom a suburban railway station a suburbanized old town an omnibus the head of a tramline a stretch of public common thick with noticeboards a broad pavement somethingorother parade with a row of shops london chapter viii how bealby explained lord chickney was only slightly older than lord moggeridge but he had not worn nearly so well his hearing was not good though he would never admit it and the loss of several teeth greatly affected his articulation one might generalize and say that neither physically nor mentally do soldiers wear so well as lawyers the army ages men sooner than the law and philosophy it exposes them more freely to germs which undermine and destroy and it shelters them more completely from thought which stimulates and preserves a lawyer must keep his law highly polished and uptodate or he hears of it within a fortnight a general never realizes he is out of training and behind the times until disaster is accomplished since the magnificent retreat from bondysatina in eightyseven and his five weeks defence of barrowgast with the subsequent operations the abilities of lord chickney had never been exercised seriously at all but there was a certain simplicity of manner and a tall drooping grizzled oldveteran picturesqueness about him that kept him distinguished he was easy to recognize on public occasions on account of his long moustaches and so he got pointed out when greater men were ignored the autograph collectors adored him every morning he would spend half an hour writing autographs and the habit was so strong in him that on sundays when there was no london post and autograph writing would have been wrong anyhow he filled the time in copying out the epistle and gospel for the day and he liked to be well in the foreground of public affairsif possible wearing his decorations after the autographs he would work sometimes for hours for various patriotic societies and more particularly for those which would impose compulsory training upon every man woman and child in the country he even belonged to a society for drilling the butchers ponies and training big dogs as scouts he did not understand how a country could be happy unless every city was fortified and every citizen wore sidearms and the slightest error in his dietary led to the most hideous nightmares of the channel tunnel or reduced estimates and a land enslaved he wrote and toiled for these societies but he could not speak for them on account of his teeth for he had one peculiar weakness he had faced death in many forms but he had never faced a dentist the thought of dentists gave him just the same sick horror as the thought of invasion he was a man of blameless private life a widower and childless in later years he had come to believe that he had once been very deeply in love with his cousin susan who had married a rather careless husband named douglas both she and douglas were dead now but he maintained a touching affection for her two lively rather than satisfying sons he called them his nephews and by the continuous attrition of affection he had become their recognized uncle he was glad when they came to him in their scrapes and he liked to be seen about with them in public places they regarded him with considerable confidence and respect and an affection that they sometimes blamed themselves for as not quite warm enough for his merits but there is a kind of injustice about affection he was really gratified when he got a wire from the less discreditable of these two bright young relations saying sorely in need of your advice hope to bring difficulties to you today at twelve he concluded very naturally that the boy had come to some crisis in his unfortunate entanglement with madeleine philips and he was flattered by the trustfulness that brought the matter to him he resolved to be delicate but wily honourable strictly honourable but steadily patiently separative he paced his spacious study with his usual mornings work neglected and rehearsed little sentences in his mind that might be effective in the approaching interview there would probably be emotion he would pat the lad on his shoulder and be himself a little emotional i understand my boy he would say i understand dont forget my boy that ive been a young man too he would be emotional he would be sympathetic but also he must be a man of the world sort of thing that wont do you know my boy sort of thing that people will not stand a soldiers wife has to be a soldiers wife and nothing else your business is to serve the king notnot some celebrity lovely no doubt i dont deny the charm of herbut on the hoardings my boy now dont you thinkdont you thinktheres some nice pure girl somewhere sweet as violets new as the dawn and ready to be yours a girl i mean a maiden fancy free nothow shall i put ita woman of the world wonderful i admitbut seasoned public my dear dear boy i knew your mother when she was a girl a sweet pure girla thing of dewy freshness ah well i remember her all these years my boynothing its difficult tears stood in his brave old blue eyes as he elaborated such phrases he went up and down mumbling them through the defective teeth and the long moustache and waving an eloquent hand when lord chickneys thoughts had once started in any direction it was difficult to turn them aside no doubt that concealed and repudiated deafness helped his natural perplexity of mind truth comes to some of us as a still small voice but lord chickney needed shouting and prods and douglas did not get to him until he was finishing lunch moreover it was the weakness of captain douglas to talk in jerky fragments and undertones rather than clearly and fully in the american fashion tell me all about it my boy said lord chickney tell me all about it dont apologize for your clothes i understand motor bicycle and just come up but have you had any lunch eric alan unclenot eric my brother is eric well i called him alan tell me all about it tell me what has happened what are you thinking of doing just put the positions before me to tell you the truth ive been worrying over this business for some time didnt know youd heard of it uncle he cant have talked about it already anyhowyou see all the awkwardness of the situation they say the old chaps a thundering spiteful old devil when hes rousedand theres no doubt he was roused tremendously lord chickney was not listening very attentively indeed he was also talking not clear to me there was another man in it he was saying that makes it more complicated my boy makes the row acuter old fellow eh who they came to a pause at the same moment you speak so indistinctly complained lord chickney who did you say i thought you understood lord moggeridge lord lord moggeridge my dear boy but how i thought you understood uncle he doesnt want to marry her tut never why the man must be sixty if hes a day captain douglas regarded his distinguished uncle for a moment with distressed eyes then he came nearer raised his voice and spoke more deliberately i dont know whether you quite understand uncle i am talking about this affair at shonts last weekend my dear boy theres no need for you to shout if only you dont mumble and clip your wordsand turn head over heels with your ideas just tell me about it plainly who is shonts one of those liberal peers i seem to have heard the name shonts uncle is the house the laxtons have you knowlucy little lucy i remember her curls all down her back married the milkman but how does she come in alan the storys gettingcomplicated but thats the worst of these infernal affairsthey always do get complicated tangled skeins oh what a tangled web we weave when first we venture to deceive and now like a sensible man you want to get out of it captain douglas was bright pink with the effort to control himself and keep perfectly plain and straightforward his hair had become like tow and little beads of perspiration stood upon his forehead i spent last weekend at shonts he said lord moggeridge also there weekending got it into his head that i was pulling his leg naturally my boy if he goes philandering at his time of life what else can he expect it wasnt philandering fine distinctions fine distinctions go onanyhow he got it into his head that i was playing practical jokes upon him confused me with eric it led to a rather firstclass row i had to get out of the house nothing else to do he brought all sorts of accusations captain douglas stopped short his uncle was no longer attending to him they had drifted to the window of the study and the general was staring with an excitement and intelligence that grew visibly at the spectacle of bealby and the trailer outside for bealby had been left in the trailer and he was sitting as good as gold waiting for the next step in his vindication from the dark charge of burglary he was very travelworn and the trailer was timeworn as well as travelworn and both contrasted with the efficient neatness and newness of the motor bicycle in front the contrast had attracted the attention of a tall policeman who was standing in a state of elucidatory meditation regarding bealby bealby was not regarding the policeman he had the utmost confidence in captain douglas he felt sure that he would presently be purged of all the horror of that dead old man and of the brief unpremeditated plunge into crime but still for the present at any rate he did not feel equal to staring a policeman out of countenance from the window the policeman very largely obscured bealby whenever hearts are simple there lurks romance age cannot wither nor custom stale her infinite diversity suddenly out of your low kindly diplomacies your sane manoftheworld intentions leaps the imagination like a rocket flying from such safe securities bang into the sky so it happened to the old general he became deaf to everything but the appearances before him the world was jewelled with dazzling and delightful possibilities his face was lit by a glow of genuine romantic excitement he grasped his nephews arm he pointed his grizzled cheeks flushed that isnt he asked with something verging upon admiration in his voice and manner a certain lady in disguise it became clear to captain douglas that if ever he was to get to lord moggeridge that day he must take his uncle firmly in hand without even attempting not to appear to shout he cried that is a little boy that is my witness it is most important that i should get him to lord moggeridge to tell his story what story cried the old commander pulling at his moustache and still eyeing bealby suspiciously it took exactly half an hour to get lord chickney from that enquiry to the telephone and even then he was still far from clear about the matter in hand captain douglas got in most of the facts but he could not eliminate an idea that it all had to do with madeleine whenever he tried to say clearly that she was entirely outside the question the general patted his shoulder and looked very wise and kind and said my dear boy i quite understand i quite understand never mention a lady no so they started at last rather foggilyso far as things of the mind went though the sun that day was brilliantand because of engine trouble in port street the generals hansom reached tenby little street first and he got in a good five minutes preparing the lord chancellor tactfully and carefully before the bicycle and its trailer came upon the scene candler had been packing that morning with unusual solicitude for a weekend at tulliver abbey his master had returned from the catastrophe of shonts fatigued and visibly aged and extraordinarily cross and candler looked to tulliver abbey to restore him to his former self nothing must be forgotten there must be no little hitches everything from first to last must go on oiled wheels or it was clear his lordship might develop a desperate hostility to these excursions excursions which candler found singularly refreshing and entertaining during the stresses of the session tulliver abbey was as good a house as shonts was bad lady checksammington ruled with the softness of velvet and the strength of steel over a household of admirably efficient domestics and there would be the best of people there mr evesham perhaps the loopers lady privet andreas doria and mr pernambuco great silken mellow personages and diamondlike individualities amidst whom lord moggeridges mind would be restfully active and his comfort quite secure and as far as possible candler wanted to get the books and papers his master needed into the trunk or the small valise that habit of catching up everything at the last moment and putting it under his arm and the consequent need for alert picking up meant friction and nervous wear and tear for both master and man lord moggeridge rose at halfpast tenhe had been kept late overnight by a heated discussion at the aristotelianand breakfasted lightly upon a chop and coffee then something ruffled him something that came with the letters candler could not quite make out what it was but he suspected another pamphlet by dr schiller it could not be the chop because lord moggeridge was always wonderfully successful with chops candler looked through the envelopes and letters afterwards and found nothing diagnostic and then he observed a copy of mind torn across and lying in the wastepaper basket when i went out of the room said candler discreetly examining this very likely its that there schiller after all but in this candler was mistaken what had disturbed the lord chancellor was a coarsely disrespectful article on the absolute by a cambridge rhodes scholar written in that flighty facetious strain that spreads now like a pestilence over modern philosophical discussion does the absolute on lord moggeridges own showing mean anything more than an eloquent oiliness uniformly distributed through space and so on pretty bad lord moggeridge early in life had deliberately acquired a quite exceptional power of mental selfcontrol he took his perturbed mind now and threw it forcibly into the consideration of a case upon which he had reserved judgment he was to catch the at paddington and at two he was smoking a cigar after a temperate lunch and reading over the notes of this judgment it was then that the telephone bell became audible and candler came in to inform him that lord chickney was anxious to see him at once upon a matter of some slight importance slight importance asked lord moggeridge some slight importance my lord some slight is lordship my lord mumbles rather now is back teeth ave gone said candler but so i understand im these apologetic assertive phrases annoy me candler said lord moggeridge over his shoulder you see he turned round and spoke very clearly either the matter is of importance or it is not of importance a thing must either be or not be i wish you would managewhen you get messages on the telephone but i suppose that is asking too much will you explain to him candler when we start andask him candlerask him what sort of matter it is candler returned after some parleying so far as i can make is lordship out my lord e says e wants to set you right about something my lord he says something about a little misapprehension these diminutives candler kill sense does he say what sortwhat sortof little misapprehension he says somethingim sorry my lord but its about shonts me lord then i dont want to hear about it said lord moggeridge there was a pause the lord chancellor resumed his reading with a deliberate obviousness the butler hovered im sorry my lord but i cant think exactly what i ought to say to is lordship my lord tell himtell him that i do not wish to hear anything more about shonts for ever simply candler hesitated and went out shutting the door carefully lest any fragment of his halting rendering of this message to lord chickney should reach his masters ears lord moggeridges powers of mental control were i say very greathe could dismiss subjects from his mind absolutely in a few instants he had completely forgotten shonts and was making notes with a silvercased pencil on the margins of his draft judgment he became aware that candler had returned is lordship lord chickney my lord is very persistent my lord es rung up twice e says now that e makes a personal matter of it come what may e says e wishes to speak for two minutes to your lordship over the telephone my lord e vouchsafes no further information lord moggeridge meditated over the end of his third after lunch cigar his man watched the end of his left eyebrow as an engineer might watch a steam gauge there were no signs of an explosion he must come candler his lordship said at last oh candler my lord put the bags and things in a conspicuous position in the hall candler change yourself and see that you look thoroughly like trains and in fact have everything ready prominently ready candler then once more lord moggeridge concentrated his mind to him there presently entered lord chickney lord chickney had been twice round the world and he had seen many strange and dusky peoples and many remarkable customs and peculiar prejudices which he had never failed to despise but he had never completely shaken off the county family ideas in which he had been brought up he believed that there was an incurable difference in spirit between quite good people like himself and men from down below like moggeridge who was the son of an exeter chorister he believed that these men from nowhere always cherished the profoundest respect for the real thing like himself that they were greedy for association and gratified by notice and so for the life of him he could not approach lord moggeridge without a faint sense of condescension he saluted him as my dear lord moggeridge wrung his hand with effusion and asked him kind almost districtvisiting questions about his younger brother and the aspect of his house and you are just off i see for a weekend these amenities the lord chancellor acknowledged by faint gruntings and an almost imperceptible movement of his eyebrows there was a matter he said some little matter on which you want to consult me well said lord chickney and rubbed his chin yes yes there was a little matter a little trouble of an urgent nature yes yes exactly just a little complicated you know not quite simple the dear old soldiers manner became almost seductive one of these difficult little affairs where one has to remember that one is a man of the world you know a little complication about a lady known to you both but one must make concessions one must understand the boy has a witness things are not as you supposed them to be lord moggeridge had a clean conscience about ladies he drew out his watch and looked at itaggressively he kept it in his hand during his subsequent remarks i must confess he declared i have not the remotest idea if you will be so good as to beelementary what is it all about you see i knew the lads mother said lord chickney in fact he became insanely confidentialunder happier circumstancesdont misunderstand me moggeridge i mean no evilbut he might have been my son i feel for him like a son when presently captain douglas a little heated from his engine trouble came into the roomhe had left bealby with candler in the hallit was instantly manifest to him that the work of preparation had been inadequately performed one minute more my dear alan cried lord chickney lord moggeridge with eyebrows waving and watch in hand was of a different opinion he addressed himself to captain douglas there isnt a minute more he said what is all thisthis philoprogenitive rigmarole about why have you come to me my cab is outside now all this about ladies and witnesseswhat is it perfectly simple my lord you imagine that i played practical jokes upon you at shonts i didnt i have a witness the attack upon you downstairs the noise in your room have i any guarantee its the stewards boy from shonts your man outside knows him saw him in the stewards room he made the trouble for youand me and then he ran away just caught him not exchanged thirty words with him half a dozen questions settle everything then youll knownothing for you but the utmost respect lord moggeridge pressed his lips together and resisted conviction in consideration interpolated lord chickney feelings of an old fellow old soldier boy means no harm with the rudeness of one sorely tried the lord chancellor thrust the old general aside oh he said oh and then to captain douglas one minute wheres your witness the captain opened a door bealby found himself bundled into the presence of two celebrated men tell him said captain douglas and look sharp about it tell me plainly cried the lord chancellor and bequick he put such a point on quick that it made bealby jump tell him said the general more gently dont be afraid well began bealby after one accumulating pause it was im told me to do it e said you go in there the captain would have interrupted but the lord chancellor restrained him by a magnificent gesture of the hand holding the watch he told you to do it he said i knew he did now listen he told you practically to go in and do anything you could yessir woe took possession of bealby i didnt do any arm to the ole gentleman but who told you cried the captain who told you lord moggeridge annihilated him with arm and eyebrows he held bealby fascinated by a pointing finger dont do more than answer the questions i have thirty seconds more he told you to go in he made you go in at the earliest possible opportunity you got away i jest nipped out enough and now sir how dare you come here without even a plausible lie how dare you after your intolerable tomfoolery at shonts confront me again with fresh tomfoolery how dare you drag in your gallant and venerable uncle in this last preposterousi suppose you would call itlark i suppose you had prepared that little wretch with some fine story little you know of false witness at the first question he breaks down he does not even begin his lie he at least knows the difference between my standards and yours candler candler candler appeared thesethese gentlemen are going is everything ready the cab is at the door mlord the usual cab captain douglas made one last desperate effort sir he said my lord the lord chancellor turned upon him with a face that he sought to keep calm though the eyebrows waved and streamed like black smoke in a gale captain douglas he said you are probably not aware of the demands upon the time and patience of a public servant in such a position as mine you see the world no doubt as a vastly entertaining fabric upon which you can embroider youryour facetious arrangements well it is not so it is real it is earnest you may sneer at the simplicity of an old man but what i tell you of life is true comic effect is not believe me its goal and you sir you sir you impress me as an intolerably foolish flippant and unnecessary young man flippant unnecessary foolish as he said these words candler approached him with a dust coat of a peculiar fineness and dignity and he uttered the last words over his protruded chest while candler assisted his arms into his sleeves my lord said captain douglas again but his resolution was deserting him no said the lord chancellor leaning forward in a minatory manner while candler pulled down the tail of his jacket and adjusted the collar of his overcoat uncle said captain douglas no said the general with the curt decision of a soldier and turned exactly ninety degrees away from him you little know how you have hurt me alan you little know i couldnt have imagined it the douglas strain false witnessand insult i am sorry my dear moggeridge beyond measure i quite understandyou are as much a victim as myself quite a more foolish attempti am sorry to be in this hurry oh you damned little fool said the captain and advanced a step towards the perplexed and shrinking bealby you imbecile little trickster what do you mean by it i didnt mean anything then suddenly the thought of madeleine sweet and overpowering came into the head of this distraught young man he had risked losing her he had slighted and insulted her and here he wasentangled here he was in a position of nearly inconceivable foolishness about to assault a dirty and silly little boy in the presence of the lord chancellor and uncle chickney the world he felt was lost and not well lost and she was lost too even now while he pursued these follies she might be consoling her wounded pride he perceived that love is the supreme thing in life he perceived that he who divides his purposes scatters his life to the four winds of heaven a vehement resolve to cut the whole of this bealby business pounced upon him in that moment he ceased to care for reputation for appearances for the resentment of lord moggeridge or the good intentions of uncle chickney he turned he rushed out of the room he escaped by unparalleled gymnastics the worst consequences of an encounter with the lord chancellors bag which the underbutler had placed rather tactlessly between the doors crossed the wide and dignified hall and in another moment had his engine going and was struggling to mount his machine in the street without his face expressed an almost apoplectic concentration he narrowly missed the noses of a pair of horses in the carriage of lady beach mandarin made an extraordinary curve to spare a fishmongers tricycle shaved the front and completely destroyed the gesture of that eminent actor manager mr pomegranate who was crossing the road in his usual inadvertent fashion and then he was popping and throbbing and banging round the corner and on his way back to the lovely and irresistible woman who was exerting so disastrous an influence upon his career the captain fled from london in the utmost fury and to the general danger of the public his heart was full of wicked blasphemies shoutings and selfreproaches but outwardly he seemed only pinkly intent and as he crossed an open breezy common and passed by a milestone bearing this inscription to london thirteen miles his hind tyre burst conclusively with a massive report in every life there are crucial moments turning points and not infrequently it is just such a thing as this a report a sudden waking in the night a flash upon the road to damascus that marks and precipitates the accumulating new vehemence is not concentration the headlong violence of the captain had been no expression of a singleminded purpose of a soul all gathered together to an end far less a pursuit had it been than a flight a flight from his own dissensions and nownow he was held after he had attempted a few plausible repairs and found the tyre obdurate after he had addressed illchosen remonstrances to some unnamed hearer after he had walked some way along the road and back in an indecision about repair shops in some neighbouring town the last dregs of his resistance were spent he perceived that he was in the presence of a lesson he sat down by the roadside some twenty feet from the disabled motor bicycle and impotent for further effort frankly admitted himself overtaken he had not reckoned with punctures the pursuing questions came clambering upon him and would no longer be denied who he was and what he was and how he was and the meaning of this rare bate he had been in and all those deep questions that are so systematically neglected in the haste and excitement of modern life in short for the first time in many headlong days he asked himself simply and plainly what he thought he was up to certain things became clear and so minutely and exactly clear that it was incredible that they had ever for a moment been obscure of course bealby had been a perfectly honest little boy under some sort of misconception and of course he ought to have been carefully coached and prepared and rehearsed before he was put before the lord chancellor this was so manifest now that the captain stared aghast at his own inconceivable negligence but the mischief was done nothing now would ever propitiate moggeridge nothing now would ever reconcile uncle chickney that wassettled but what was not settled was the amazing disorder of his own mind why had he been so negligent what had come over his mind in the last few weeks and this sudden strange illumination of the captains mind went so far as perceiving that the really important concern for him was not the accidents of shonts but this epilepsy of his own will why now was he rushing back to madeleine why he did not love her he knew he did not love her on the whole more than anything else he resented her but he was excited about her he was so excited that these other muddles fluctuations follies came as a natural consequence from that out of this excitement came those wild floods of angry energy that made him career about like some damned cracker said the captain for instance he asked himself now what am i going for if i go back shell probably behave like an offended queen doesnt seem to understand anything that does not focus on herself wants a sort of limelight lover she relies upon exciting me she relies upon exciting everyoneshes just a woman specialized for excitement and after meditating through a profound minute upon this judgment the captain pronounced these two epochmaking words i wont the captains mind was now in a state of almost violent lucidity this sex stuff he said first i kept it under too tight and now ive let it rip too loose ive been just a distracted fool with my head swimming with meetings and embraces andfrills he produced some long impending generalizations not a mans work this lover business dancing about in a world of petticoats and powder puffs and attentions and jealousies rotten game played off against some other man ill be hanged if i am have to put women in their places make a hash of everything if we dont then for a time the captain meditated in silence and chewed his knuckle his face darkened to a scowl he swore as though some thought twisted and tormented him let some other man get her think of her with some other man i dont care he said when obviously he did theres other women in the world a mana man mustnt care for that its this or that said the captain anyhow suddenly the captains mind was made up and done he arose to his feet and his face was firm and tranquil and now nearer pallor than pink he left his bicycle and trailer by the wayside even as christian left his burden he asked a passing nursegirl the way to the nearest railway station and thither he went incidentally and because the opportunity offered he called in upon a cyclists repair shop and committed his abandoned machinery to its keeping he went straight to london changed at his flat dined at his club and caught the night train for francefor france and whatever was left of the grand manuvres he wrote a letter to madeleine from the est train next day using their customary endearments avoiding any discussion of their relations and describing the scenery of the seine valley and the characteristics of rouen in a few vivid and masterly phrases if shes worth having shell understand said the captain but he knew perfectly well she would not understand mrs geedge noted this letter among the others and afterwards she was much exercised by madeleines behaviour for suddenly that lady became extraordinarily gay and joyous in her bearing singing snatches of song and bubbling over with suggestions for larks and picnics and wild excursions she patted mr geedge on the shoulder and ran her arm through the arm of professor bowles both gentlemen received these familiarities with a gawky coyness that mrs geedge found contemptible and moreover madeleine drew several shy strangers into their circle she invited the management to a happy participation her great idea was a moonlight picnic well have a great campfire and afterwards well dancethis very night but wouldnt it be better tomorrow tonight tomorrow perhaps captain douglas may be back again and hes so good at all these things mrs geedge knew better because she had seen the french stamp on the letter but she meant to get to the bottom of this business and thus it was she said this ive sent him back to his soldiering said madeleine serenely he has better things to do for some moments after the unceremonious departure of captain douglas from the presence of lord moggeridge it did not occur to anyone it did not occur even to bealby that the captain had left his witness behind him the general and the lord chancellor moved into the hall and bealby under the sway of a swift compelling gesture from candler followed modestly the same current swept them all out into the portico and while the underbutler whistled up a hansom for the general the lord chancellor with a dignity that was at once polite and rapid and candler gravely protective and little reproving departed bealby slowly apprehending their desertion regarded the world of london with perplexity and dismay candler had gone the last of the gentlemen was going the underbutler bealby felt was no friend underbutlers never are lord chickney in the very act of entering his cab had his coattail tugged he looked enquiringly please sir theres me said bealby lord chickney reflected well he said the spirit of bealby was now greatly abased his face and voice betrayed him on the verge of tears i want to go ome to shonts sir well my boy go omego home i mean to shonts es gone sir said bealby lord chickney was a goodhearted man and he knew that a certain public kindliness and disregard of appearances looks far better and is infinitely more popular than a punctilious dignity he took bealby to waterloo in his hansom got him a third class ticket to chelsome tipped a porter to see him safely into his train and dismissed him in the most fatherly manner it was well after teatime bealby felt as he came once more within the boundaries of the shonts estate it was a wiser and a graver bealby who returned from this week of miscellaneous adventure he did not clearly understand all that had happened to him in particular he was puzzled by the extreme annoyance and sudden departure of captain douglas from the presence of lord moggeridge but his general impression was that he had been in great peril of dire punishment and that he had been rather hastily and ignominiously reprieved the nice old gentleman with the long grey moustaches had dismissed him to the train at last with a quality of benediction but bealby understood now better than he had done before that adventures do not always turn out well for the boy hero and that the social system has a number of dangerous and disagreeable holes at the bottom he had reached the beginnings of wisdom he was glad he had got away from the tramp and still gladder that he had got away from crayminster he was sorry that he would never see the beautiful lady again and perplexed and perplexed and also he was interested in the probability of his mother having toast for tea it must he felt be a long time after teatime quite late he had weighed the advisability of returning quietly to his windowless bedroom under the stairs putting on his little green apron and emerging with a dutiful sangfroid as if nothing had happened on the one hand or of going to the gardens on the other but teawith eatablesseemed more probable at the gardens he was deflected from the direct route across the park by a long deep trench that someone had made and abandoned since the previous sunday morning he wondered what it was for it was certainly very ugly and as he came out by the trees and got the full effect of the faade he detected a strangely bandaged quality about shonts it was as if shonts had recently been in a fight and got a black eye then he saw the reason for this one tower was swathed in scaffolding he wondered what could have happened to the tower then his own troubles resumed their sway he was so fortunate as not to meet his father in the gardens and he entered the house so meekly that his mother did not look up from the cashmere she was sewing she was sitting at the table sewing some newly dyed black cashmere he was astonished at her extreme pallor and the drooping resignation of her pose mother he said and she looked up convulsively and stared stared with bright round astonished eyes im sorry mother iavent been quite a good stewardsroom boy mother if i could ave another go mother he halted for a moment astonished that she said nothing but

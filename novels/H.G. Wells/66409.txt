remarkable case of davidsons eyes i the transitory mental aberration of sidney davidson remarkable enough in itself is still more remarkable if wades explanation is to be credited it sets one dreaming of the oddest possibilities of inter communication in the future of spending an intercalary five minutes on the other side of the world or being watched in our most secret operations by unsuspected eyes it happened that i was the immediate witness of davidsons seizure and so it falls naturally to me to put the story upon paper when i say that i was the immediate witness of his seizure i mean that i was the first on the scene the thing happened at the harlow technical college just beyond the highgate archway he was alone in the larger laboratory when the thing happened i was in a smaller room where the balances are writing up some notes the thunderstorm had completely upset my work of course it was just after one of the louder peals that i thought i heard some glass smash in the other room i stopped writing and turned round to listen for a moment i heard nothing the hail was playing the devils tattoo on the corrugated zinc of the roof then came another sound a smash no doubt of it this time something heavy had been knocked off the bench i jumped up at once and went and opened the door leading into the big laboratory i was surprised to hear a queer sort of laugh and saw davidson standing unsteadily in the middle of the room with a dazzled look on his face my first impression was that he was drunk he did not notice me he was clawing out at something invisible a yard in front of his face he put out his hand slowly rather hesitatingly and then clutched nothing whats come to it he said he held up his hands to his face fingers spread out great scott he said the thing happened three or four years ago when every one swore by that personage then he began raising his feet clumsily as though he had expected to find them glued to the floor davidson cried i whats the matter with you he turned round in my direction and looked about for me he looked over me and at me and on either side of me without the slightest sign of seeing me waves he said and a remarkably neat schooner id swear that was bellows voice hallo he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice i thought he was up to some foolery then i saw littered about his feet the shattered remains of the best of our electrometers whats up man said i youve smashed the electrometer bellows again said he friends left if my hands are gone something about electrometers which way are you bellows he suddenly came staggering towards me the damned stuff cuts like butter he said he walked straight into the bench and recoiled none so buttery that he said and stood swaying i felt scared davidson said i what on earths come over you he looked round him in every direction i could swear that was bellows why dont you show yourself like a man bellows it occurred to me that he must be suddenly struck blind i walked round the table and laid my hand upon his arm i never saw a man more startled in my life he jumped away from me and came round into an attitude of self defence his face fairly distorted with terror good god he cried what was that its i bellows confound it davidson he jumped when i answered him and stared how can i express it right through me he began talking not to me but to himself here in broad daylight on a clear beach not a place to hide in he looked about him wildly here im off he suddenly turned and ran headlong into the big electro magnet so violently that as we found afterwards he bruised his shoulder and jawbone cruelly at that he stepped back a pace and cried out with almost a whimper what in heavens name has come over me he stood blanched with terror and trembling violently with his right arm clutching his left where that had collided with the magnet by that time i was excited and fairly scared davidson said i dont be afraid he was startled at my voice but not so excessively as before i repeated my words in as clear and as firm a tone as i could assume bellows he said is that you cant you see its me he laughed i cant even see its myself where the devil are we here said i in the laboratory the laboratory he answered in a puzzled tone and put his hand to his forehead i was in the laboratory till that flash came but im hanged if im there now what ship is that theres no ship said i do be sensible old chap no ship he repeated and seemed to forget my denial forthwith i suppose said he slowly were both dead but the rummy part is i feel just as though i still had a body dont get used to it all at once i suppose the old shop was struck by lightning i suppose jolly quick thing bellows eh dont talk nonsense youre very much alive you are in the laboratory blundering about youve just smashed a new electrometer i dont envy you when boyce arrives he stared away from me towards the diagrams of cryohydrates i must be deaf said he theyve fired a gun for there goes the puff of smoke and i never heard a sound i put my hand on his arm again and this time he was less alarmed we seem to have a sort of invisible bodies said he by jove theres a boat coming round the headland its very much like the old life after all in a different climate i shook his arm davidson i cried wake up ii it was just then that boyce came in so soon as he spoke davidson exclaimed old boyce dead too what a lark i hastened to explain that davidson was in a kind of somnambulistic trance boyce was interested at once we both did all we could to rouse the fellow out of his extraordinary state he answered our questions and asked us some of his own but his attention seemed distracted by his hallucination about a beach and a ship he kept interpolating observations concerning some boat and the davits and sails filling with the wind it made one feel queer in the dusky laboratory to hear him saying such things he was blind and helpless we had to walk him down the passage one at each elbow to boyces private room and while boyce talked to him there and humoured him about this ship idea i went along the corridor and asked old wade to come and look at him the voice of our dean sobered him a little but not very much he asked where his hands were and why he had to walk about up to his waist in the ground wade thought over him a long time you know how he knits his brows and then made him feel the couch guiding his hands to it thats a couch said wade the couch in the private room of professor boyce horsehair stuffing davidson felt about and puzzled over it and answered presently that he could feel it all right but he couldnt see it what do you see asked wade davidson said he could see nothing but a lot of sand and broken up shells wade gave him some other things to feel telling him what they were and watching him keenly the ship is almost hull down said davidson presently apropos of nothing never mind the ship said wade listen to me davidson do you know what hallucination means rather said davidson well everything you see is hallucinatory bishop berkeley said davidson dont mistake me said wade you are alive and in this room of boyces but something has happened to your eyes you cannot see you can feel and hear but not see do you follow me it seems to me that i see too much davidson rubbed his knuckles into his eyes well he said thats all dont let it perplex you bellows here and i will take you home in a cab wait a bit davidson thought help me to sit down said he presently and now im sorry to trouble you but will you tell me all that over again wade repeated it very patiently davidson shut his eyes and pressed his hands upon his forehead yes said he its quite right now my eyes are shut i know youre right thats you bellows sitting by me on the couch im in england again and were in the dark then he opened his eyes and there said he is the sun just rising and the yards of the ship and a tumbled sea and a couple of birds flying i never saw anything so real and im sitting up to my neck in a bank of sand he bent forward and covered his face with his hands then he opened his eyes again dark sea and sunrise and yet im sitting on a sofa in old boyces room god help me iii that was the beginning for three weeks this strange affection of davidsons eyes continued unabated it was far worse than being blind he was absolutely helpless and had to be fed like a newly hatched bird and led about and undressed if he attempted to move he fell over things or struck himself against walls or doors after a day or so he got used to hearing our voices without seeing us and willingly admitted he was at home and that wade was right in what he told him my sister to whom he was engaged insisted on coming to see him and would sit for hours every day while he talked about this beach of his holding her hand seemed to comfort him immensely he explained that when we left the college and drove home he lived in hampstead village it appeared to him as if we drove right through a sandhill it was perfectly black until he emerged again and through rocks and trees and solid obstacles and when he was taken to his own room it made him giddy and almost frantic with the fear of falling because going upstairs seemed to lift him thirty or forty feet above the rocks of his imaginary island he kept saying he should smash all the eggs the end was that he had to be taken down into his fathers consulting room and laid upon a couch that stood there he described the island as being a bleak kind of place on the whole with very little vegetation except some peaty stuff and a lot of bare rock there were multitudes of penguins and they made the rocks white and disagreeable to see the sea was often rough and once there was a thunderstorm and he lay and shouted at the silent flashes once or twice seals pulled up on the beach but only on the first two or three days he said it was very funny the way in which the penguins used to waddle right through him and how he seemed to lie among them without disturbing them i remember one odd thing and that was when he wanted very badly to smoke we put a pipe in his hands he almost poked his eye out with it and lit it but he couldnt taste anything ive since found its the same with me i dont know if its the usual case that i cannot enjoy tobacco at all unless i can see the smoke but the queerest part of his vision came when wade sent him out in a bath chair to get fresh air the davidsons hired a chair and got that deaf and obstinate dependant of theirs widgery to attend to it widgerys ideas of healthy expeditions were peculiar my sister who had been to the dogs home met them in camden town towards kings cross widgery trotting along complacently and davidson evidently most distressed trying in his feeble blind way to attract widgerys attention he positively wept when my sister spoke to him oh get me out of this horrible darkness he said feeling for her hand i must get out of it or i shall die he was quite incapable of explaining what was the matter but my sister decided he must go home and presently as they went uphill towards hampstead the horror seemed to drop from him he said it was good to see the stars again though it was then about noon and a blazing day it seemed he told me afterwards as if i was being carried irresistibly towards the water i was not very much alarmed at first of course it was night there a lovely night of course i asked for that struck me as odd of course said he its always night there when it is day here well we went right into the water which was calm and shining under the moonlight just a broad swell that seemed to grow broader and flatter as i came down into it the surface glistened just like a skin it might have been empty space underneath for all i could tell to the contrary very slowly for i rode slanting into it the water crept up to my eyes then i went under and the skin seemed to break and heal again about my eyes the moon gave a jump up in the sky and grew green and dim and fish faintly glowing came darting round me and things that seemed made of luminous glass and i passed through a tangle of seaweeds that shone with an oily lustre and so i drove down into the sea and the stars went out one by one and the moon grew greener and darker and the seaweed became a luminous purple red it was all very faint and mysterious and everything seemed to quiver and all the while i could hear the wheels of the bath chair creaking and the footsteps of people going by and a man in the distance selling the special pall mall i kept sinking down deeper and deeper into the water it became inky black about me not a ray from above came down into that darkness and the phosphorescent things grew brighter and brighter the snaky branches of the deeper weeds flickered like the flames of spirit lamps but after a time there were no more weeds the fishes came staring and gaping towards me and into me and through me i never imagined such fishes before they had lines of fire along the sides of them as though they had been outlined with a luminous pencil and there was a ghastly thing swimming backwards with a lot of twining arms and then i saw coming very slowly towards me through the gloom a hazy mass of light that resolved itself as it drew nearer into multitudes of fishes struggling and darting round something that drifted i drove on straight towards it and presently i saw in the midst of the tumult and by the light of the fish a bit of splintered spar looming over me and a dark hull tilting over and some glowing phosphorescent forms that were shaken and writhed as the fish bit at them then it was i began to try to attract widgerys attention a horror came upon me ugh i should have driven right into those half eaten things if your sister had not come they had great holes in them bellows and never mind but it was ghastly iv for three weeks davidson remained in this singular state seeing what at the time we imagined was an altogether phantasmal world and stone blind to the world around him then one tuesday when i called i met old davidson in the passage he can see his thumb the old gentleman said in a perfect transport he was struggling into his overcoat he can see his thumb bellows he said with the tears in his eyes the lad will be all right yet i rushed in to davidson he was holding up a little book before his face and looking at it and laughing in a weak kind of way its amazing said he theres a kind of patch come there he pointed with his finger im on the rocks as usual and the penguins are staggering and flapping about as usual and theres been a whale showing every now and then but its got too dark now to make him out but put something there and i see it i do see it its very dim and broken in places but i see it all the same like a faint spectre of itself i found it out this morning while they were dressing me its like a hole in this infernal phantom world just put your hand by mine no not there ah yes i see it the base of your thumb and a bit of cuff it looks like the ghost of a bit of your hand sticking out of the darkling sky just by it theres a group of stars like a cross coming out from that time davidson began to mend his account of the change like his account of the vision was oddly convincing over patches of his field of vision the phantom world grew fainter grew transparent as it were and through these translucent gaps he began to see dimly the real world about him the patches grew in size and number ran together and spread until only here and there were blind spots left upon his eyes he was able to get up and steer himself about feed himself once more read smoke and behave like an ordinary citizen again at first it was very confusing for him to have these two pictures overlapping each other like the changing views of a lantern but in a little while he began to distinguish the real from the illusory at first he was unfeignedly glad and seemed only too anxious to complete his cure by taking exercise and tonics but as that odd island of his began to fade away from him he became queerly interested in it he wanted particularly to go down in the deep sea again and would spend half his time wandering about the low lying parts of london trying to find the water logged wreck he had seen drifting the glare of real daylight very soon impressed him so vividly as to blot out everything of his shadowy world but of a night time in a darkened room he could still see the white splashed rocks of the island and the clumsy penguins staggering to and fro but even these grew fainter and fainter and at last soon after he married my sister he saw them for the last time v and now to tell of the queerest thing of all about two years after his cure i dined with the davidsons and after dinner a man named atkins called in he is a lieutenant in the royal navy and a pleasant talkative man he was on friendly terms with my brother in law and was soon on friendly terms with me it came out that he was engaged to davidsons cousin and incidentally he took out a kind of pocket photograph case to show us a new rendering of his fiance and by the by said he heres the old fulmar davidson looked at it casually then suddenly his face lit up good heavens said he i could almost swear what said atkins that i had seen that ship before dont see how you can have she hasnt been out of the south seas for six years and before then but began davidson and then yes thats the ship i dreamt of im sure thats the ship i dreamt of she was standing off an island that swarmed with penguins and she fired a gun good lord said atkins who had now heard the particulars of the seizure how the deuce could you dream that and then bit by bit it came out that on the very day davidson was seized hms fulmar had actually been off a little rock to the south of antipodes island a boat had landed overnight to get penguins eggs had been delayed and a thunderstorm drifting up the boats crew had waited until the morning before rejoining the ship atkins had been one of them and he corroborated word for word the descriptions davidson had given of the island and the boat there is not the slightest doubt in any of our minds that davidson has really seen the place in some unaccountable way while he moved hither and thither in london his sight moved hither and thither in a manner that corresponded about this distant island how is absolutely a mystery that completes the remarkable story of davidsons eyes its perhaps the best authenticated case in existence of real vision at a distance explanation there is none forthcoming except what professor wade has thrown out but his explanation invokes the fourth dimension and a dissertation on theoretical kinds of space to talk of there being a kink in space seems mere nonsense to me it may be because i am no mathematician when i said that nothing would alter the fact that the place is eight thousand miles away he answered that two points might be a yard away on a sheet of paper and yet be brought together by bending the paper round the reader may grasp his argument but i certainly do not his idea seems to be that davidson stooping between the poles of the big electro magnet had some extraordinary twist given to his retinal elements through the sudden change in the field of force due to the lightning he thinks as a consequence of this that it may be possible to live visually in one part of the world while one lives bodily in another he has even made some experiments in support of his views but so far he had simply succeeded in blinding a few dogs i believe that is the net result of his work though i have not seen him for some weeks latterly i have been so busy with my work in connection with the saint pancras installation that i have had little opportunity of calling to see him but the whole of his theory seems fantastic to me the facts concerning davidson stand on an altogether different footing and i can testify personally to the accuracy of every detail i have given the moth probably you have heard of hapley not w t hapley the son but the celebrated hapley the hapley of periplaneta hapliia hapley the entomologist if so you know at least of the great feud between hapley and professor pawkins though certain of its consequences may be new to you for those who have not a word or two of explanation is necessary which the idle reader may go over with a glancing eye if his indolence so incline him it is amazing how very widely diffused is the ignorance of such really important matters as this hapley pawkins feud those epoch making controversies again that have convulsed the geological society are i verily believe almost entirely unknown outside the fellowship of that body i have heard men of fair general education even refer to the great scenes at these meetings as vestry meeting squabbles yet the great hate of the english and scotch geologists has lasted now half a century and has left deep and abundant marks upon the body of the science and this hapley pawkins business though perhaps a more personal affair stirred passions as profound if not profounder your common man has no conception of the zeal that animates a scientific investigator the fury of contradiction you can arouse in him it is the odium theologicum in a new form there are men for instance who would gladly burn professor ray lankester at smithfield for his treatment of the mollusca in the encyclopdia that fantastic extension of the cephalopods to cover the pteropods but i wander from hapley and pawkins it began years and years ago with a revision of the microlepidoptera whatever these may be by pawkins in which he extinguished a new species created by hapley hapley who was always quarrelsome replied by a stinging impeachment of the entire classification of pawkins pawkins in his rejoinder suggested that hapleys microscope was as defective as his power of observation and called him an irresponsible meddler hapley was not a professor at that time hapley in his retort spoke of blundering collectors and described as if inadvertently pawkins revision as a miracle of ineptitude it was war to the knife however it would scarcely interest the reader to detail how these two great men quarrelled and how the split between them widened until from the microlepidoptera they were at war upon every open question in entomology there were memorable occasions at times the royal entomological society meetings resembled nothing so much as the chamber of deputies on the whole i fancy pawkins was nearer the truth than hapley but hapley was skilful with his rhetoric had a turn for ridicule rare in a scientific man was endowed with vast energy and had a fine sense of injury in the matter of the extinguished species while pawkins was a man of dull presence prosy of speech in shape not unlike a water barrel over conscientious with testimonials and suspected of jobbing museum appointments so the young men gathered round hapley and applauded him it was a long struggle vicious from the beginning and growing at last to pitiless antagonism the successive turns of fortune now an advantage to one side and now to another now hapley tormented by some success of pawkins and now pawkins outshone by hapley belong rather to the history of entomology than to this story but in pawkins whose health had been bad for some time published some work upon the mesoblast of the deaths head moth what the mesoblast of the deaths head moth may be does not matter a rap in this story but the work was far below his usual standard and gave hapley an opening he had coveted for years he must have worked night and day to make the most of his advantage in an elaborate critique he rent pawkins to tatters one can fancy the mans disordered black hair and his queer dark eyes flashing as he went for his antagonist and pawkins made a reply halting ineffectual with painful gaps of silence and yet malignant there was no mistaking his will to wound hapley nor his incapacity to do it but few of those who heard him i was absent from that meeting realised how ill the man was hapley got his opponent down and meant to finish him he followed with a simply brutal attack upon pawkins in the form of a paper upon the development of moths in general a paper showing evidence of a most extraordinary amount of mental labour and yet couched in a violently controversial tone violent as it was an editorial note witnesses that it was modified it must have covered pawkins with shame and confusion of face it left no loophole it was murderous in argument and utterly contemptuous in tone an awful thing for the declining years of a mans career the world of entomologists waited breathlessly for the rejoinder from pawkins he would try one for pawkins had always been game but when it came it surprised them for the rejoinder of pawkins was to catch influenza proceed to pneumonia and die it was perhaps as effectual a reply as he could make under the circumstances and largely turned the current of feeling against hapley the very people who had most gleefully cheered on those gladiators became serious at the consequence there could be no reasonable doubt the fret of the defeat had contributed to the death of pawkins there was a limit even to scientific controversy said serious people another crushing attack was already in the press and appeared on the day before the funeral i dont think hapley exerted himself to stop it people remembered how hapley had hounded down his rival and forgot that rivals defects scathing satire reads ill over fresh mould the thing provoked comment in the daily papers this it was that made me think that you had probably heard of hapley and this controversy but as i have already remarked scientific workers live very much in a world of their own half the people i dare say who go along piccadilly to the academy every year could not tell you where the learned societies abide many even think that research is a kind of happy family cage in which all kinds of men lie down together in peace in his private thoughts hapley could not forgive pawkins for dying in the first place it was a mean dodge to escape the absolute pulverisation hapley had in hand for him and in the second it left hapleys mind with a queer gap in it for twenty years he had worked hard sometimes far into the night and seven days a week with microscope scalpel collecting net and pen and almost entirely with reference to pawkins the european reputation he had won had come as an incident in that great antipathy he had gradually worked up to a climax in this last controversy it had killed pawkins but it had also thrown hapley out of gear so to speak and his doctor advised him to give up work for a time and rest so hapley went down into a quiet village in kent and thought day and night of pawkins and good things it was now impossible to say about him at last hapley began to realise in what direction the pre occupation tended he determined to make a fight for it and started by trying to read novels but he could not get his mind off pawkins white in the face and making his last speech every sentence a beautiful opening for hapley he turned to fiction and found it had no grip on him he read the island nights entertainments until his sense of causation was shocked beyond endurance by the bottle imp then he went to kipling and found he proved nothing besides being irreverent and vulgar these scientific people have their limitations then unhappily he tried besants inner house and the opening chapter set his mind upon learned societies and pawkins at once so hapley turned to chess and found it a little more soothing he soon mastered the moves and the chief gambits and commoner closing positions and began to beat the vicar but then the cylindrical contours of the opposite king began to resemble pawkins standing up and gasping ineffectually against check mate and hapley decided to give up chess perhaps the study of some new branch of science would after all be better diversion the best rest is change of occupation hapley determined to plunge at diatoms and had one of his smaller microscopes and halibuts monograph sent down from london he thought that perhaps if he could get up a vigorous quarrel with halibut he might be able to begin life afresh and forget pawkins and very soon he was hard at work in his habitual strenuous fashion at these microscopic denizens of the wayside pool it was on the third day of the diatoms that hapley became aware of a novel addition to the local fauna he was working late at the microscope and the only light in the room was the brilliant little lamp with the special form of green shade like all experienced microscopists he kept both eyes open it is the only way to avoid excessive fatigue one eye was over the instrument and bright and distinct before that was the circular field of the microscope across which a brown diatom was slowly moving with the other eye hapley saw as it were without seeing he was only dimly conscious of the brass side of the instrument the illuminated part of the table cloth a sheet of notepaper the foot of the lamp and the darkened room beyond suddenly his attention drifted from one eye to the other the table cloth was of the material called tapestry by shopmen and rather brightly coloured the pattern was in gold with a small amount of crimson and pale blue upon a grayish ground at one point the pattern seemed displaced and there was a vibrating movement of the colours at this point hapley suddenly moved his head back and looked with both eyes his mouth fell open with astonishment it was a large moth or butterfly its wings spread in butterfly fashion it was strange it should be in the room at all for the windows were closed strange that it should not have attracted his attention when fluttering to its present position strange that it should match the table cloth stranger far that to him hapley the great entomologist it was altogether unknown there was no delusion it was crawling slowly towards the foot of the lamp new genus by heavens and in england said hapley staring then he suddenly thought of pawkins nothing would have maddened pawkins more and pawkins was dead something about the head and body of the insect became singularly suggestive of pawkins just as the chess king had been confound pawkins said hapley but i must catch this and looking round him for some means of capturing the moth he rose slowly out of his chair suddenly the insect rose struck the edge of the lamp shade hapley heard the ping and vanished into the shadow in a moment hapley had whipped off the shade so that the whole room was illuminated the thing had disappeared but soon his practised eye detected it upon the wall paper near the door he went towards it poising the lamp shade for capture before he was within striking distance however it had risen and was fluttering round the room after the fashion of its kind it flew with sudden starts and turns seeming to vanish here and reappear there once hapley struck and missed then again the third time he hit his microscope the instrument swayed struck and overturned the lamp and fell noisily upon the floor the lamp turned over on the table and very luckily went out hapley was left in the dark with a start he felt the strange moth blunder into his face it was maddening he had no lights if he opened the door of the room the thing would get away in the darkness he saw pawkins quite distinctly laughing at him pawkins had ever an oily laugh he swore furiously and stamped his foot on the floor there was a timid rapping at the door then it opened perhaps a foot and very slowly the alarmed face of the landlady appeared behind a pink candle flame she wore a night cap over her gray hair and had some purple garment over her shoulders what was that fearful smash she said has anything the strange moth appeared fluttering about the chink of the door shut that door said hapley and suddenly rushed at her the door slammed hastily hapley was left alone in the dark then in the pause he heard his landlady scuttle upstairs lock her door and drag something heavy across the room and put against it it became evident to hapley that his conduct and appearance had been strange and alarming confound the moth and pawkins however it was a pity to lose the moth now he felt his way into the hall and found the matches after sending his hat down upon the floor with a noise like a drum with the lighted candle he returned to the sitting room no moth was to be seen yet once for a moment it seemed that the thing was fluttering round his head hapley very suddenly decided to give up the moth and go to bed but he was excited all night long his sleep was broken by dreams of the moth pawkins and his landlady twice in the night he turned out and soused his head in cold water one thing was very clear to him his landlady could not possibly understand about the strange moth especially as he had failed to catch it no one but an entomologist would understand quite how he felt she was probably frightened at his behaviour and yet he failed to see how he could explain it he decided to say nothing further about the events of last night after breakfast he saw her in her garden and decided to go out and talk to reassure her he talked to her about beans and potatoes bees caterpillars and the price of fruit she replied in her usual manner but she looked at him a little suspiciously and kept walking as he walked so that there was always a bed of flowers or a row of beans or something of the sort between them after a while he began to feel singularly irritated at this and to conceal his vexation went indoors and presently went out for a walk the moth or butterfly trailing an odd flavour of pawkins with it kept coming into that walk though he did his best to keep his mind off it once he saw it quite distinctly with its wings flattened out upon the old stone wall that runs along the west edge of the park but going up to it he found it was only two lumps of gray and yellow lichen this said hapley is the reverse of mimicry instead of a butterfly looking like a stone here is a stone looking like a butterfly once something hovered and fluttered round his head but by an effort of will he drove that impression out of his mind again in the afternoon hapley called upon the vicar and argued with him upon theological questions they sat in the little arbour covered with brier and smoked as they wrangled look at that moth said hapley suddenly pointing to the edge of the wooden table where said the vicar you dont see a moth on the edge of the table there said hapley certainly not said the vicar hapley was thunderstruck he gasped the vicar was staring at him clearly the man saw nothing the eye of faith is no better than the eye of science said hapley awkwardly i dont see your point said the vicar thinking it was part of the argument that night hapley found the moth crawling over his counterpane he sat on the edge of the bed in his shirt sleeves and reasoned with himself was it pure hallucination he knew he was slipping and he battled for his sanity with the same silent energy he had formerly displayed against pawkins so persistent is mental habit that he felt as if it were still a struggle with pawkins he was well versed in psychology he knew that such visual illusions do come as a result of mental strain but the point was he did not only see the moth he had heard it when it touched the edge of the lamp shade and afterwards when it hit against the wall and he had felt it strike his face in the dark he looked at it it was not at all dreamlike but perfectly clear and solid looking in the candle light he saw the hairy body and the short feathery antenn the jointed legs even a place where the down was rubbed from the wing he suddenly felt angry with himself for being afraid of a little insect his landlady had got the servant to sleep with her that night because she was afraid to be alone in addition she had locked the door and put the chest of drawers against it they listened and talked in whispers after they had gone to bed but nothing occurred to alarm them about eleven they had ventured to put the candle out and had both dozed off to sleep they woke up with a start and sat up in bed listening in the darkness then they heard slippered feet going to and fro in hapleys room a chair was overturned and there was a violent dab at the wall then a china mantel ornament smashed upon the fender suddenly the door of the room opened and they heard him upon the landing they clung to one another listening he seemed to be dancing upon the staircase now he would go down three or four steps quickly then up again then hurry down into the hall they heard the umbrella stand go over and the fanlight break then the bolt shot and the chain rattled he was opening the door they hurried to the window it was a dim gray night an almost unbroken sheet of watery cloud was sweeping across the moon and the hedge and trees in front of the house were black against the pale roadway they saw hapley looking like a ghost in his shirt and white trousers running to and fro in the road and beating the air now he would stop now he would dart very rapidly at something invisible now he would move upon it with stealthy strides at last he went out of sight up the road towards the down then while they argued who should go down and lock the door he returned he was walking very fast and he came straight into the house closed the door carefully and went quietly up to his bedroom then everything was silent mrs colville said hapley calling down the staircase next morning i hope i did not alarm you last night you may well ask that said mrs colville the fact is i am a sleep walker and the last two nights i have been without my sleeping mixture there is nothing to be alarmed about really i am sorry i made such an ass of myself i will go over the down to shoreham and get some stuff to make me sleep soundly i ought to have done that yesterday but half way over the down by the chalk pits the moth came upon hapley again he went on trying to keep his mind upon chess problems but it was no good the thing fluttered into his face and he struck at it with his hat in self defence then rage the old rage the rage he had so often felt against pawkins came upon him again he went on leaping and striking at the eddying insect suddenly he trod on nothing and fell headlong there was a gap in his sensations and hapley found himself sitting on the heap of flints in front of the opening of the chalk pits with a leg twisted back under him the strange moth was still fluttering round his head he struck at it with his hand and turning his head saw two men approaching him one was the village doctor it occurred to hapley that this was lucky then it came into his mind with extraordinary vividness that no one would ever be able to see the strange moth except himself and that it behoved him to keep silent about it late that night however after his broken leg was set he was feverish and forgot his self restraint he was lying flat on his bed and he began to run his eyes round the room to see if the moth was still about he tried not to do this but it was no good he soon caught sight of the thing resting close to his hand by the nightlight on the green table cloth the wings quivered with a sudden wave of anger he smote at it with his fist and the nurse woke up with a shriek he had missed it that moth he said and then it was fancy nothing all the time he could see quite clearly the insect going round the cornice and darting across the room and he could also see that the nurse saw nothing of it and looked at him strangely he must keep himself in hand he knew he was a lost man if he did not keep himself in hand but as the night waned the fever grew upon him and the very dread he had of seeing the moth made him see it about five just as the dawn was gray he tried to get out of bed and catch it though his leg was afire with pain the nurse had to struggle with him on account of this they tied him down to the bed at this the moth grew bolder and once he felt it settle in his hair then because he struck out violently with his arms they tied these also at this the moth came and crawled over his face and hapley wept swore screamed prayed for them to take it off him unavailingly the doctor was a blockhead a just qualified general practitioner and quite ignorant of mental science he simply said there was no moth had he possessed the wit he might still perhaps have saved hapley from his fate by entering into his delusion and covering his face with gauze as he prayed might be done but as i say the doctor was a blockhead and until the leg was healed hapley was kept tied to his bed and with the imaginary moth crawling over him it never left him while he was awake and it grew to a monster in his dreams while he was awake he longed for sleep and from sleep he awoke screaming so now hapley is spending the remainder of his days in a padded room worried by a moth that no one else can see the asylum doctor calls it hallucination but hapley when he is in his easier mood and can talk says it is the ghost of pawkins and consequently a unique specimen and well worth the trouble of catching footnotes remarks on a recent revision of microlepidoptera quart journ entomological soc rejoinder to certain remarks etc ibid further remarks etc ibid the story of the late mr elvesham i set this story down not expecting it will be believed but if possible to prepare a way of escape for the next victim he perhaps may profit by my misfortune my own case i know is hopeless and i am now in some measure prepared to meet my fate my name is edward george eden i was born at trentham in staffordshire my father being employed in the gardens there i lost my mother when i was three years old and my father when i was five my uncle george eden then adopting me as his own son he was a single man self educated and well known in birmingham as an enterprising journalist he educated me generously fired my ambition to succeed in the world and at his death which happened four years ago left me his entire fortune a matter of about five hundred pounds after all outgoing charges were paid i was then eighteen he advised me in his will to expend the money in completing my education i had already chosen the profession of medicine and through his posthumous generosity and my good fortune in a scholarship competition i became a medical student at university college london at the time of the beginning of my story i lodged at a university street in a little upper room very shabbily furnished and draughty overlooking the back of shoolbreds premises i used this little room both to live in and sleep in because i was anxious to eke out my means to the very last shillingsworth i was taking a pair of shoes to be mended at a shop in the tottenham court road when i first encountered the little old man with the yellow face with whom my life has now become so inextricably entangled he was standing on the kerb and staring at the number on the door in a doubtful way as i opened it his eyes they were dull gray eyes and reddish under the rims fell to my face and his countenance immediately assumed an expression of corrugated amiability you come he said apt to the moment i had forgotten the number of your house how do you do mr eden i was a little astonished at his familiar address for i had never set eyes on the man before i was a little annoyed too at his catching me with my boots under my arm he noticed my lack of cordiality wonder who the deuce i am eh a friend let me assure you i have seen you before though you havent seen me is there anywhere where i can talk to you i hesitated the shabbiness of my room upstairs was not a matter for every stranger perhaps said i we might walk down the street im unfortunately prevented my gesture explained the sentence before i had spoken it the very thing he said and faced this way and then that the street which way shall we go i slipped my boots down in the passage look here he said abruptly this business of mine is a rigmarole come and lunch with me mr eden im an old man a very old man and not good at explanations and what with my piping voice and the clatter of the traffic he laid a persuasive skinny hand that trembled a little upon my arm i was not so old that an old man might not treat me to a lunch yet at the same time i was not altogether pleased by this abrupt invitation i had rather i began but i had rather he said catching me up and a certain civility is surely due to my gray hairs and so i consented and went with him he took me to blavitiskis i had to walk slowly to accommodate myself to his paces and over such a lunch as i had never tasted before he fended off my leading question and i took a better note of his appearance his clean shaven face was lean and wrinkled his shrivelled lips fell over a set of false teeth and his white hair was thin and rather long he seemed small to me though indeed most people seemed small to me and his shoulders were rounded and bent and watching him i could not help but observe that he too was taking note of me running his eyes with a curious touch of greed in them over me from my broad shoulders to my sun tanned hands and up to my freckled face again and now said he as we lit our cigarettes i must tell you of the business in hand i must tell you then that i am an old man a very old man he paused momentarily and it happens that i have money that i must presently be leaving and never a child have i to leave it to i thought of the confidence trick and resolved i would be on the alert for the vestiges of my five hundred pounds he proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness and the trouble he had to find a proper disposition of his money i have weighed this plan and that plan charities institutions and scholarships and libraries and i have come to this conclusion at last he fixed his eyes on my face that i will find some young fellow ambitious pure minded and poor healthy in body and healthy in mind and in short make him my heir give him all that i have he repeated give him all that i have so that he will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and struggle in which his sympathies have been educated to freedom and influence i tried to seem disinterested with a transparent hypocrisy i said and you want my help my professional services maybe to find that person he smiled and looked at me over his cigarette and i laughed at his quiet exposure of my modest pretence what a career such a man might have he said it fills me with envy to think how i have accumulated that another man may spend but there are conditions of course burdens to be imposed he must for instance take my name you cannot expect everything without some return and i must go into all the circumstances of his life before i can accept him he must be sound i must know his heredity how his parents and grandparents died have the strictest inquiries made into his private morals this modified my secret congratulations a little and do i understand said i that i yes he said almost fiercely you you i answered never a word my imagination was dancing wildly my innate scepticism was useless to modify its transports there was not a particle of gratitude in my mind i did not know what to say nor how to say it but why me in particular i said at last he had chanced to hear of me from professor haslar he said as a typically sound and sane young man and he wished as far as possible to leave his money where health and integrity were assured that was my first meeting with the little old man he was mysterious about himself he would not give his name yet he said and after i had answered some questions of his he left me at the blavitiski portal i noticed that he drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket when it came to paying for the lunch his insistence upon bodily health was curious in accordance with an arrangement we had made i applied that day for a life policy in the loyal insurance company for a large sum and i was exhaustively overhauled by the medical advisers of that company in the subsequent week even that did not satisfy him and he insisted i must be re examined by the great doctor henderson it was friday in whitsun week before he came to a decision he called me down quite late in the evening nearly nine it was from cramming chemical equations for my preliminary scientific examination he was standing in the passage under the feeble gas lamp and his face was a grotesque interplay of shadows he seemed more bowed than when i had first seen him and his cheeks had sunk in a little his voice shook with emotion everything is satisfactory mr eden he said everything is quite quite satisfactory and this night of all nights you must dine with me and celebrate your accession he was interrupted by a cough you wont have long to wait either he said wiping his handkerchief across his lips and gripping my hand with his long bony claw that was disengaged certainly not very long to wait we went into the street and called a cab i remember every incident of that drive vividly the swift easy motion the vivid contrast of gas and oil and electric light the crowds of people in the streets the place in regent street to which we went and the sumptuous dinner we were served with there i was disconcerted at first by the well dressed waiters glances at my rough clothes bothered by the stones of the olives but as the champagne warmed my blood my confidence revived at first the old man talked of himself he had already told me his name in the cab he was egbert elvesham the great philosopher whose name i had known since i was a lad at school it seemed incredible to me that this man whose intelligence had so early dominated mine this great abstraction should suddenly realise itself as this decrepit familiar figure i dare say every young fellow who has suddenly fallen among celebrities has felt something of my disappointment he told me now of the future that the feeble streams of his life would presently leave dry for me houses copyrights investments i had never suspected that philosophers were so rich he watched me drink and eat with a touch of envy what a capacity for living you have he said and then with a sigh a sigh of relief i could have thought it it will not be long ay said i my head swimming now with champagne i have a future perhaps of a passing agreeable sort thanks to you i shall now have the honour of your name but you have a past such a past as is worth all my future he shook his head and smiled as i thought with half sad appreciation of my flattering admiration that future he said would you in truth change it the waiter came with liqueurs you will not perhaps mind taking my name taking my position but would you indeed willingly take my years with your achievements said i gallantly he smiled again kummel both he said to the waiter and turned his attention to a little paper packet he had taken from his pocket this hour said he this after dinner hour is the hour of small things here is a scrap of my unpublished wisdom he opened the packet with his shaking yellow fingers and showed a little pinkish powder on the paper this said he well you must guess what it is but kummel put but a dash of this powder in it is himmel his large grayish eyes watched mine with an inscrutable expression it was a bit of a shock to me to find this great teacher gave his mind to the flavour of liqueurs however i feigned an interest in his weakness for i was drunk enough for such small sycophancy he parted the powder between the little glasses and rising suddenly with a strange unexpected dignity held out his hand towards me i imitated his action and the glasses rang to a quick succession said he and raised his glass towards his lips not that i said hastily not that he paused with the liqueur at the level of his chin and his eyes blazing into mine to a long life said i he hesitated to a long life said he with a sudden bark of laughter and with eyes fixed on one another we tilted the little glasses his eyes looked straight into mine and as i drained the stuff off i felt a curiously intense sensation the first touch of it set my brain in a furious tumult i seemed to feel an actual physical stirring in my skull and a seething humming filled my ears i did not notice the flavour in my mouth the aroma that filled my throat i saw only the gray intensity of his gaze that burnt into mine the draught the mental confusion the noise and stirring in my head seemed to last an interminable time curious vague impressions of half forgotten things danced and vanished on the edge of my consciousness at last he broke the spell with a sudden explosive sigh he put down his glass well he said its glorious said i though i had not tasted the stuff my head was spinning i sat down my brain was chaos then my perception grew clear and minute as though i saw things in a concave mirror his manner seemed to have changed into something nervous and hasty he pulled out his watch and grimaced at it eleven seven and to night i must seven twenty five waterloo i must go at once he called for the bill and struggled with his coat officious waiters came to our assistance in another moment i was wishing him good bye over the apron of a cab and still with an absurd feeling of minute distinctness as though how can i express it i not only saw but felt through an inverted opera glass that stuff he said he put his hand to his forehead i ought not to have given it to you it will make your head split to morrow wait a minute here he handed me out a little flat thing like a seidlitz powder take that in water as you are going to bed the other thing was a drug not till youre ready to go to bed mind it will clear your head thats all one more shake futurus i gripped his shrivelled claw good bye he said and by the droop of his eyelids i judged he too was a little under the influence of that brain twisting cordial he recollected something else with a start felt in his breast pocket and produced another packet this time a cylinder the size and shape of a shaving stick here said he id almost forgotten dont open this until i come to morrow but take it now it was so heavy that i wellnigh dropped it all ri said i and he grinned at me through the cab window as the cabman flicked his horse into wakefulness it was a white packet he had given me with red seals at either end and along its edge if this isnt money said i its platinum or lead i stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket and with a whirling brain walked home through the regent street loiterers and the dark back streets beyond portland road i remember the sensations of that walk very vividly strange as they were i was still so far myself that i could notice my strange mental state and wonder whether this stuff i had had was opium a drug beyond my experience it is hard now to describe the peculiarity of my mental strangeness mental doubling vaguely expresses it as i was walking up regent street i found in my mind a queer persuasion that it was waterloo station and had an odd impulse to get into the polytechnic as a man might get into a train i put a knuckle in my eye and it was regent street how can i express it you see a skilful actor looking quietly at you he pulls a grimace and lo another person is it too extravagant if i tell you that it seemed to me as if regent street had for the moment done that then being persuaded it was regent street again i was oddly muddled about some fantastic reminiscences that cropped up thirty years ago thought i it was here that i quarrelled with my brother then i burst out laughing to the astonishment and encouragement of a group of night prowlers thirty years ago i did not exist and never in my life had i boasted a brother the stuff was surely liquid folly for the poignant regret for that lost brother still clung to me along portland road the madness took another turn i began to recall vanished shops and to compare the street with what it used to be confused troubled thinking is comprehensible enough after the drink i had taken but what puzzled me were these curiously vivid phantasm memories that had crept into my mind and not only the memories that had crept in but also the memories that had slipped out i stopped opposite stevenss the natural history dealers and cudgelled my brains to think what he had to do with me a bus went by and sounded exactly like the rumbling of a train i seemed to be dipping into some dark remote pit for the recollection of course said i at last he has promised me three frogs to morrow odd i should have forgotten do they still show children dissolving views in those i remember one view would begin like a faint ghost and grow and oust another in just that way it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sensations was struggling with those of my ordinary self i went on through euston road to tottenham court road puzzled and a little frightened and scarcely noticed the unusual way i was taking for commonly i used to cut through the intervening network of back streets i turned into university street to discover that i had forgotten my number only by a strong effort did i recall a and even then it seemed to me that it was a thing some forgotten person had told me i tried to steady my mind by recalling the incidents of the dinner and for the life of me i could conjure up no picture of my hosts face i saw him only as a shadowy outline as one might see oneself reflected in a window through which one was looking in his place however i had a curious exterior vision of myself sitting at a table flushed bright eyed and talkative i must take this other powder said i this is getting impossible i tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle and the matches and had a doubt of which landing my room might be on im drunk i said thats certain and blundered needlessly on the staircase to sustain the proposition at the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar what rot i said and stared about me i seemed to bring myself back by the effort and the odd phantasmal quality passed into the concrete familiar there was the old glass still with my notes on the albumens stuck in the corner of the frame my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the floor and yet it was not so real after all i felt an idiotic persuasion trying to creep into my mind as it were that i was in a railway carriage in a train just stopping that i was peering out of the window at some unknown station i gripped the bed rail firmly to reassure myself its clairvoyance perhaps i said i must write to the psychical research society i put the rouleau on my dressing table sat on my bed and began to take off my boots it was as if the picture of my present sensations was painted over some other picture that was trying to show through curse it said i my wits are going or am i in two places at once half undressed i tossed the powder into a glass and drank it off it effervesced and became a fluorescent amber colour before i was in bed my mind was already tranquillised i felt the pillow at my cheek and thereupon i must have fallen asleep i awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange beasts and found myself lying on my back probably every one knows that dismal emotional dream from which one escapes awake indeed but strangely cowed there was a curious taste in my mouth a tired feeling in my limbs a sense of cutaneous discomfort i lay with my head motionless on my pillow expecting that my feeling of strangeness and terror would pass away and that i should then doze off again to sleep but instead of that my uncanny sensations increased at first i could perceive nothing wrong about me there was a faint light in the room so faint that it was the very next thing to darkness and the furniture stood out in it as vague blots of absolute darkness i stared with my eyes just over the bedclothes it came into my mind that some one had entered the room to rob me of my rouleau of money but after lying for some moments breathing regularly to simulate sleep i realised this was mere fancy nevertheless the uneasy assurance of something wrong kept fast hold of me with an effort i raised my head from the pillow and peered about me at the dark what it was i could not conceive i looked at the dim shapes around me the greater and lesser darknesses that indicated curtains table fireplace bookshelves and so forth then i began to perceive something unfamiliar in the forms of the darkness had the bed turned round yonder should be the bookshelves and something shrouded and pallid rose there something that would not answer to the bookshelves however i looked at it it was far too big to be my shirt thrown on a chair overcoming a childish terror i threw back the bedclothes and thrust my leg out of bed instead of coming out of my truckle bed upon the floor i found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mattress i made another step as it were and sat up on the edge of the bed by the side of my bed should be the candle and the matches upon the broken chair i put out my hand and touched nothing i waved my hand in the darkness and it came against some heavy hanging soft and thick in texture which gave a rustling noise at my touch i grasped this and pulled it it appeared to be a curtain suspended over the head of my bed i was now thoroughly awake and beginning to realise that i was in a strange room i was puzzled i tried to recall the overnight circumstances and i found them now curiously enough vivid in my memory the supper my reception of the little packages my wonder whether i was intoxicated my slow undressing the coolness to my flushed face of my pillow i felt a sudden distrust was that last night or the night before at any rate this room was strange to me and i could not imagine how i had got into it the dim pallid outline was growing paler and i perceived it was a window with the dark shape of an oval toilet glass against the weak intimation of the dawn that filtered through the blind i stood up and was surprised by a curious feeling of weakness and unsteadiness with trembling hands outstretched i walked slowly towards the window getting nevertheless a bruise on the knee from a chair by the way i fumbled round the glass which was large with handsome brass sconces to find the blind cord i could not find any by chance i took hold of the tassel and with the click of a spring the blind ran up i found myself looking out upon a scene that was altogether strange to me the night was overcast and through the flocculent gray of the heaped clouds there filtered a faint half light of dawn just at the edge of the sky the cloud canopy had a blood red rim below everything was dark and indistinct dim hills in the distance a vague mass of buildings running up into pinnacles trees like spilt ink and below the window a tracery of black bushes and pale gray paths it was so unfamiliar that for the moment i thought myself still dreaming i felt the toilet table it appeared to be made of some polished wood and was rather elaborately furnished there were little cut glass bottles and a brush upon it there was also a queer little object horse shoe shape it felt with smooth hard projections lying in a saucer i could find no matches nor candlestick i turned my eyes to the room again now the blind was up faint spectres of its furnishing came out of the darkness there was a huge curtained bed and the fireplace at its foot had a large white mantel with something of the shimmer of marble i leant against the toilet table shut my eyes and opened them again and tried to think the whole thing was far too real for dreaming i was inclined to imagine there was still some hiatus in my memory as a consequence of my draught of that strange liqueur that i had come into my inheritance perhaps and suddenly lost my recollection of everything since my good fortune had been announced perhaps if i waited a little things would be clearer to me again yet my dinner with old elvesham was now singularly vivid and recent the champagne the observant waiters the powder and the liqueurs i could have staked my soul it all happened a few hours ago and then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so terrible to me that i shiver now to think of that moment i spoke aloud i said how the devil did i get here and the voice was not my own it was not my own it was thin the articulation was slurred the resonance of my facial bones was different then to reassure myself i ran one hand over the other and felt loose folds of skin the bony laxity of age surely i said in that horrible voice that had somehow established itself in my throat surely this thing is a dream almost as quickly as if i did it involuntarily i thrust my fingers into my mouth my teeth had gone my finger tips ran on the flaccid surface of an even row of shrivelled gums i was sick with dismay and disgust i felt then a passionate desire to see myself to realise at once in its full horror the ghastly change that had come upon me i tottered to the mantel and felt along it for matches as i did so a barking cough sprang up in my throat and i clutched the thick flannel nightdress i found about me there were no matches there and i suddenly realised that my extremities were cold sniffing and coughing whimpering a little perhaps i fumbled back to bed it is surely a dream i whispered to myself as i clambered back surely a dream it was a senile repetition i pulled the bedclothes over my shoulders over my ears i thrust my withered hand under the pillow and determined to compose myself to sleep of course it was a dream in the morning the dream would be over and i should wake up strong and vigorous again to my youth and studies i shut my eyes breathed regularly and finding myself wakeful began to count slowly through the powers of three but the thing i desired would not come i could not get to sleep and the persuasion of the inexorable reality of the change that had happened to me grew steadily presently i found myself with my eyes wide open the powers of three forgotten and my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled gums i was indeed suddenly and abruptly an old man i had in some unaccountable manner fallen through my life and come to old age in some way i had been cheated of all the best of my life of love of struggle of strength and hope i grovelled into the pillow and tried to persuade myself that such hallucination was possible imperceptibly steadily the dawn grew clearer at last despairing of further sleep i sat up in bed and looked about me a chill twilight rendered the whole chamber visible it was spacious and well furnished better furnished than any room i had ever slept in before a candle and matches became dimly visible upon a little pedestal in a recess i threw back the bedclothes and shivering with the rawness of the early morning albeit it was summer time i got out and lit the candle then trembling horribly so that the extinguisher rattled on its spike i tottered to the glass and saw elveshams face it was none the less horrible because i had already dimly feared as much he had already seemed physically weak and pitiful to me but seen now dressed only in a course flannel nightdress that fell apart and showed the stringy neck seen now as my own body i cannot describe its desolate decrepitude the hollow cheeks the straggling tail of dirty gray hair the rheumy bleared eyes the quivering shrivelled lips the lower displaying a gleam of the pink interior lining and those horrible dark gums showing you who are mind and body together at your natural years cannot imagine what this fiendish imprisonment meant to me to be young and full of the desire and energy of youth and to be caught and presently to be crushed in this tottering ruin of a body but i wander from the course of my story for some time i must have been stunned at this change that had come upon me it was daylight when i did so far gather myself together as to think in some inexplicable way i had been changed though how short of magic the thing had been done i could not say and as i thought the diabolical ingenuity of elvesham came home to me it seemed plain to me that as i found myself in his so he must be in possession of my body of my strength that is and my future but how to prove it then as i thought the thing became so incredible even to me that my mind reeled and i had to pinch myself to feel my toothless gums to see myself in the glass and touch the things about me before i could steady myself to face the facts again was all life hallucination was i indeed elvesham and he me had i been dreaming of eden overnight was there any eden but if i was elvesham i should remember where i was on the previous morning the name of the town in which i lived what happened before the dream began i struggled with my thoughts i recalled the queer doubleness of my memories overnight but now my mind was clear not the ghost of any memories but those proper to eden could i raise this way lies insanity i cried in my piping voice i staggered to my feet dragged my feeble heavy limbs to the washhand stand and plunged my gray head into a basin of cold water then towelling myself i tried again it was no good i felt beyond all question that i was indeed eden not elvesham but eden in elveshams body had i been a man of any other age i might have given myself up to my fate as one enchanted but in these sceptical days miracles do not pass current here was some trick of psychology what a drug and a steady stare could do a drug and a steady stare or some similar treatment could surely undo men have lost their memories before but to exchange memories as one does umbrellas i laughed alas not a healthy laugh but a wheezing senile titter i could have fancied old elvesham laughing at my plight and a gust of petulant anger unusual to me swept across my feelings i began dressing eagerly in the clothes i found lying about on the floor and only realised when i was dressed that it was an evening suit i had assumed i opened the wardrobe and found some more ordinary clothes a pair of plaid trousers and an old fashioned dressing gown i put a venerable smoking cap on my venerable head and coughing a little from my exertions tottered out upon the landing it was then perhaps a quarter to six and the blinds were closely drawn and the house quite silent the landing was a spacious one a broad richly carpeted staircase went down into the darkness of the hall below and before me a door ajar showed me a writing desk a revolving bookcase the back of a study chair and a fine array of bound books shelf upon shelf my study i mumbled and walked across the landing then at the sound of my voice a thought struck me and i went back to the bedroom and put in the set of false teeth they slipped in with the ease of old habit thats better said i gnashing them and so returned to the study the drawers of the writing desk were locked its revolving top was also locked i could see no indications of the keys and there were none in the pockets of my trousers i shuffled back at once to the bedroom and went through the dress suit and afterwards the pockets of all the garments i could find i was very eager and one might have imagined that burglars had been at work to see my room when i had done not only were there no keys to be found but not a coin nor a scrap of paper save only the receipted bill of the overnight dinner a curious weariness asserted itself i sat down and stared at the garments flung here and there their pockets turned inside out my first frenzy had already flickered out every moment i was beginning to realise the immense intelligence of the plans of my enemy to see more and more clearly the hopelessness of my position with an effort i rose and hurried hobbling into the study again on the staircase was a housemaid pulling up the blinds she stared i think at the expression of my face i shut the door of the study behind me and seizing a poker began an attack upon the desk that is how they found me the cover of the desk was split the lock smashed the letters torn out of the pigeon holes and tossed about the room in my senile rage i had flung about the pens and other such light stationery and overturned the ink moreover a large vase upon the mantel had got broken i do not know how i could find no cheque book no money no indications of the slightest use for the recovery of my body i was battering madly at the drawers when the butler backed by two women servants intruded upon me that simply is the story of my change no one will believe my frantic assertions i am treated as one demented and even at this moment i am under restraint but i am sane absolutely sane and to prove it i have sat down to write this story minutely as the things happened to me i appeal to the reader whether there is any trace of insanity in the style or method of the story he has been reading i am a young man locked away in an old mans body but the clear fact is incredible to every one naturally i appear demented to those who will not believe this naturally i do not know the names of my secretaries of the doctors who come to see me of my servants and neighbours of this town wherever it is where i find myself naturally i lose myself in my own house and suffer inconveniences of every sort naturally i ask the oddest questions naturally i weep and cry out and have paroxysms of despair i have no money and no cheque book the bank will not recognise my signature for i suppose that allowing for the feeble muscles i now have my handwriting is still edens these people about me will not let me go to the bank personally it seems indeed that there is no bank in this town and that i have an account in some part of london it seems that elvesham kept the name of his solicitor secret from all his household i can ascertain nothing elvesham was of course a profound student of mental science and all my declarations of the facts of the case merely confirm the theory that my insanity is the outcome of overmuch brooding upon psychology dreams of the personal identity indeed two days ago i was a healthy youngster with all life before me now i am a furious old man unkempt and desperate and miserable prowling about a great luxurious strange house watched feared and avoided as a lunatic by every one about me and in london is elvesham beginning life again in a vigorous body and with all the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of threescore and ten he has stolen my life what has happened i do not clearly know in the study are volumes of manuscript notes referring chiefly to the psychology of memory and parts of what may be either calculations or ciphers in symbols absolutely strange to me in some passages there are indications that he was also occupied with the philosophy of mathematics i take it he has transferred the whole of his memories the accumulation that makes up his personality from this old withered brain of his to mine and similarly that he has transferred mine to his discarded tenement practically that is he has changed bodies but how such a change may be possible is without the range of my philosophy i have been a materialist for all my thinking life but here suddenly is a clear case of mans detachability from matter one desperate experiment i am about to try i sit writing here before putting the matter to issue this morning with the help of a table knife that i had secreted at breakfast i succeeded in breaking open a fairly obvious secret drawer in this wrecked writing desk i discovered nothing save a little green glass phial containing a white powder round the neck of the phial was a label and thereon was written this one word release this may be is most probably poison i can understand elvesham placing poison in my way and i should be sure that it was his intention so to get rid of the only living witness against him were it not for this careful concealment the man has practically solved the problem of immortality save for the spite of chance he will live in my body until it has aged and then again throwing aside he will assume some other victims youth and strength when one remembers his heartlessness it is terrible to think of the ever growing experience that how long has he been leaping from body to body but i tire of writing the powder appears to be soluble in water the taste is not unpleasant there the narrative found upon mr elveshams desk ends his dead body lay between the desk and the chair the latter had been pushed back probably by his last convulsions the story was written in pencil and in a crazy hand quite unlike his usual minute characters there remain only two curious facts to record indisputably there was some connection between eden and elvesham since the whole of elveshams property was bequeathed to the young man but he never inherited when elvesham committed suicide eden was strangely enough already dead twenty four hours before he had been knocked down by a cab and killed instantly at the crowded crossing at the intersection of gower street and euston road so that the only human being who could have thrown light upon this fantastic narrative is beyond the reach of questions without further comment i leave this extraordinary matter to the readers individual judgment under the knife what if i die under it the thought recurred again and again as i walked home from haddons it was a purely personal question i was spared the deep anxieties of a married man and i knew there were few of my intimate friends but would find my death troublesome chiefly on account of their duty of regret i was surprised indeed and perhaps a little humiliated as i turned the matter over to think how few could possibly exceed the conventional requirement things came before me stripped of glamour in a clear dry light during that walk from haddons house over primrose hill there were the friends of my youth i perceived now that our affection was a tradition which we foregathered rather laboriously to maintain there were the rivals and helpers of my later career i suppose i had been cold blooded or undemonstrative one perhaps implies the other it may be that even the capacity for friendship is a question of physique there had been a time in my own life when i had grieved bitterly enough at the loss of a friend but as i walked home that afternoon the emotional side of my imagination was dormant i could not pity myself nor feel sorry for my friends nor conceive of them as grieving for me i was interested in this deadness of my emotional nature no doubt a concomitant of my stagnating physiology and my thoughts wandered off along the line it suggested once before in my hot youth i had suffered a sudden loss of blood and had been within an ace of death i remembered now that my affections as well as my passions had drained out of me leaving scarce anything but a tranquil resignation a dreg of self pity it had been weeks before the old ambitions and tendernesses and all the complex moral interplay of a man had reasserted themselves it occurred to me that the real meaning of this numbness might be a gradual slipping away from the pleasure pain guidance of the animal man it has been proven i take it as thoroughly as anything can be proven in this world that the higher emotions the moral feelings even the subtle unselfishness of love are evolved from the elemental desires and fears of the simple animal they are the harness in which mans mental freedom goes and it may be that as death overshadows us as our possibility of acting diminishes this complex growth of balanced impulse propensity and aversion whose interplay inspires our acts goes with it leaving what i was suddenly brought back to reality by an imminent collision with the butcher boys tray i found that i was crossing the bridge over the regents park canal which runs parallel with that in the zoological gardens the boy in blue had been looking over his shoulder at a black barge advancing slowly towed by a gaunt white horse in the gardens a nurse was leading three happy little children over the bridge the trees were bright green the spring hopefulness was still unstained by the dusts of summer the sky in the water was bright and clear but broken by long waves by quivering bands of black as the barge drove through the breeze was stirring but it did not stir me as the spring breeze used to do was this dullness of feeling in itself an anticipation it was curious that i could reason and follow out a network of suggestion as clearly as ever so at least it seemed to me it was calmness rather than dullness that was coming upon me was there any ground for the belief in the presentiment of death did a man near to death begin instinctively to withdraw himself from the meshes of matter and sense even before the cold hand was laid upon his i felt strangely isolated isolated without regret from the life and existence about me the children playing in the sun and gathering strength and experience for the business of life the park keeper gossiping with a nursemaid the nursing mother the young couple intent upon each other as they passed me the trees by the wayside spreading new pleading leaves to the sunlight the stir in their branches i had been part of it all but i had nearly done with it now some way down the broad walk i perceived that i was tired and that my feet were heavy it was hot that afternoon and i turned aside and sat down on one of the green chairs that line the way in a minute i had dozed into a dream and the tide of my thoughts washed up a vision of the resurrection i was still sitting in the chair but i thought myself actually dead withered tattered dried one eye i saw pecked out by birds awake cried a voice and incontinently the dust of the path and the mould under the grass became insurgent i had never before thought of regents park as a cemetery but now through the trees stretching as far as eye could see i beheld a flat plain of writhing graves and heeling tombstones there seemed to be some trouble the rising dead appeared to stifle as they struggled upward they bled in their struggles the red flesh was torn away from the white bones awake cried a voice but i determined i would not rise to such horrors awake they would not let me alone wike up said an angry voice a cockney angel the man who sells the tickets was shaking me demanding my penny i paid my penny pocketed my ticket yawned stretched my legs and feeling now rather less torpid got up and walked on towards langham place i speedily lost myself again in a shifting maze of thoughts about death going across marylebone road into that crescent at the end of langham place i had the narrowest escape from the shaft of a cab and went on my way with a palpitating heart and a bruised shoulder it struck me that it would have been curious if my meditations on my death on the morrow had led to my death that day but i will not weary you with more of my experiences that day and the next i knew more and more certainly that i should die under the operation at times i think i was inclined to pose to myself the doctors were coming at eleven and i did not get up it seemed scarce worth while to trouble about washing and dressing and though i read my newspapers and the letters that came by the first post i did not find them very interesting there was a friendly note from addison my old school friend calling my attention to two discrepancies and a printers error in my new book with one from langridge venting some vexation over minton the rest were business communications i breakfasted in bed the glow of pain at my side seemed more massive i knew it was pain and yet if you can understand i did not find it very painful i had been awake and hot and thirsty in the night but in the morning bed felt comfortable in the night time i had lain thinking of things that were past in the morning i dozed over the question of immortality haddon came punctual to the minute with a neat black bag and mowbray soon followed their arrival stirred me up a little i began to take a more personal interest in the proceedings haddon moved the little octagonal table close to the bedside and with his broad back to me began taking things out of his bag i heard the light click of steel upon steel my imagination i found was not altogether stagnant will you hurt me much i said in an off hand tone not a bit haddon answered over his shoulder we shall chloroform you your hearts as sound as a bell and as he spoke i had a whiff of the pungent sweetness of the ansthetic they stretched me out with a convenient exposure of my side and almost before i realised what was happening the chloroform was being administered it stings the nostrils and there is a suffocating sensation at first i knew i should die that this was the end of consciousness for me and suddenly i felt that i was not prepared for death i had a vague sense of a duty overlooked i knew not what what was it i had not done i could think of nothing more to do nothing desirable left in life and yet i had the strangest disinclination to death and the physical sensation was painfully oppressive of course the doctors did not know they were going to kill me possibly i struggled then i fell motionless and a great silence a monstrous silence and an impenetrable blackness came upon me there must have been an interval of absolute unconsciousness seconds or minutes then with a chilly unemotional clearness i perceived that i was not yet dead i was still in my body but all the multitudinous sensations that come sweeping from it to make up the background of consciousness had gone leaving me free of it all no not free of it all for as yet something still held me to the poor stark flesh upon the bed held me yet not so closely that i did not feel myself external to it independent of it straining away from it i do not think i saw i do not think i heard but i perceived all that was going on and it was as if i both heard and saw haddon was bending over me mowbray behind me the scalpel it was a large scalpel was cutting my flesh at the side under the flying ribs it was interesting to see myself cut like cheese without a pang without even a qualm the interest was much of a quality with that one might feel in a game of chess between strangers haddons face was firm and his hand steady but i was surprised to perceive how i know not that he was feeling the gravest doubt as to his own wisdom in the conduct of the operation mowbrays thoughts too i could see he was thinking that haddons manner showed too much of the specialist new suggestions came up like bubbles through a stream of frothing meditation and burst one after another in the little bright spot of his consciousness he could not help noticing and admiring haddons swift dexterity in spite of his envious quality and his disposition to detract i saw my liver exposed i was puzzled at my own condition i did not feel that i was dead but i was different in some way from my living self the gray depression that had weighed on me for a year or more and coloured all my thoughts was gone i perceived and thought without any emotional tint at all i wondered if every one perceived things in this way under chloroform and forgot it again when he came out of it it would be inconvenient to look into some heads and not forget although i did not think that i was dead i still perceived quite clearly that i was soon to die this brought me back to the consideration of haddons proceedings i looked into his mind and saw that he was afraid of cutting a branch of the portal vein my attention was distracted from details by the curious changes going on in his mind his consciousness was like the quivering little spot of light which is thrown by the mirror of a galvanometer his thoughts ran under it like a stream some through the focus bright and distinct some shadowy in the half light of the edge just now the little glow was steady but the least movement on mowbrays part the slightest sound from outside even a faint difference in the slow movement of the living flesh he was cutting set the light spot shivering and spinning a new sense impression came rushing up through the flow of thoughts and lo the light spot jerked away towards it swifter than a frightened fish it was wonderful to think that upon that unstable fitful thing depended all the complex motions of the man that for the next five minutes therefore my life hung upon its movements and he was growing more and more nervous in his work it was as if a little picture of a cut vein grew brighter and struggled to oust from his brain another picture of a cut falling short of the mark he was afraid his dread of cutting too little was battling with his dread of cutting too far then suddenly like an escape of water from under a lock gate a great uprush of horrible realisation set all his thoughts swirling and simultaneously i perceived that the vein was cut he started back with a hoarse exclamation and i saw the brown purple blood gather in a swift bead and run trickling he was horrified he pitched the red stained scalpel on to the octagonal table and instantly both doctors flung themselves upon me making hasty and ill conceived efforts to remedy the disaster ice said mowbray gasping but i knew that i was killed though my body still clung to me i will not describe their belated endeavours to save me though i perceived every detail my perceptions were sharper and swifter than they had ever been in life my thoughts rushed through my mind with incredible swiftness but with perfect definition i can only compare their crowded clarity to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium in a moment it would all be over and i should be free i knew i was immortal what would happen i did not know should i drift off presently like a puff of smoke from a gun in some kind of half material body an attenuated version of my material self should i find myself suddenly among the innumerable hosts of the dead and know the world about me for the phantasmagoria it had always seemed should i drift to some spiritualistic sance and there make foolish incomprehensible attempts to affect a purblind medium it was a state of unemotional curiosity of colourless expectation and then i realised a growing stress upon me a feeling as though some huge human magnet was drawing me upward out of my body the stress grew and grew i seemed an atom for which monstrous forces were fighting for one brief terrible moment sensation came back to me that feeling of falling headlong which comes in nightmares that feeling a thousand times intensified that and a black horror swept across my thoughts in a torrent then the two doctors the naked body with its cut side the little room swept away from under me and vanished as a speck of foam vanishes down an eddy i was in mid air far below was the west end of london receding rapidly for i seemed to be flying swiftly upward and as it receded passing westward like a panorama i could see through the faint haze of smoke the innumerable roofs chimney set the narrow roadways stippled with people and conveyances the little specks of squares and the church steeples like thorns sticking out of the fabric but it spun away as the earth rotated on its axis and in a few seconds as it seemed i was over the scattered clumps of town about ealing the little thames a thread of blue to the south and the chiltern hills and the north downs coming up like the rim of a basin far away and faint with haze up i rushed and at first i had not the faintest conception what this headlong rush upward could mean every moment the circle of scenery beneath me grew wider and wider and the details of town and field of hill and valley got more and more hazy and pale and indistinct a luminous gray was mingled more and more with the blue of the hills and the green of the open meadows and a little patch of cloud low and far to the west shone ever more dazzlingly white above as the veil of atmosphere between myself and outer space grew thinner the sky which had been a fair springtime blue at first grew deeper and richer in colour passing steadily through the intervening shades until presently it was as dark as the blue sky of midnight and presently as black as the blackness of a frosty starlight and at last as black as no blackness i had ever beheld and first one star and then many and at last an innumerable host broke out upon the sky more stars than any one has ever seen from the face of the earth for the blueness of the sky is the light of the sun and stars sifted and spread abroad blindingly there is diffused light even in the darkest skies of winter and we do not see the stars by day only because of the dazzling irradiation of the sun but now i saw things i know not how assuredly with no mortal eyes and that defect of bedazzlement blinded me no longer the sun was incredibly strange and wonderful the body of it was a disc of blinding white light not yellowish as it seems to those who live upon the earth but livid white all streaked with scarlet streaks and rimmed about with a fringe of writhing tongues of red fire and shooting half way across the heavens from either side of it and brighter than the milky way were two pinions of silver white making it look more like those winged globes i have seen in egyptian sculpture than anything else i can remember upon earth these i knew for the solar corona though i had never seen anything of it but a picture during the days of my earthly life when my attention came back to the earth again i saw that it had fallen very far away from me field and town were long since indistinguishable and all the varied hues of the country were merging into a uniform bright gray broken only by the brilliant white of the clouds that lay scattered in flocculent masses over ireland and the west of england for now i could see the outlines of the north of france and ireland and all this island of britain save where scotland passed over the horizon to the north or where the coast was blurred or obliterated by cloud the sea was a dull gray and darker than the land and the whole panorama was rotating slowly towards the east all this had happened so swiftly that until i was some thousand miles or so from the earth i had no thought for myself but now i perceived i had neither hands nor feet neither parts nor organs and that i felt neither alarm nor pain all about me i perceived that the vacancy for i had already left the air behind was cold beyond the imagination of man but it troubled me not the suns rays shot through the void powerless to light or heat until they should strike on matter in their course i saw things with a serene self forgetfulness even as if i were god and down below there rushing away from me countless miles in a second where a little dark spot on the gray marked the position of london two doctors were struggling to restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell i had abandoned i felt then such release such serenity as i can compare to no mortal delight i have ever known it was only after i had perceived all these things that the meaning of that headlong rush of the earth grew into comprehension yet it was so simple so obvious that i was amazed at my never anticipating the thing that was happening to me i had suddenly been cut adrift from matter all that was material of me was there upon earth whirling away through space held to the earth by gravitation partaking of the earth inertia moving in its wreath of epicycles round the sun and with the sun and the planets on their vast march through space but the immaterial has no inertia feels nothing of the pull of matter for matter where it parts from its garments of flesh there it remains so far as space concerns it any longer immovable in space i was not leaving the earth the earth was leaving me and not only the earth but the whole solar system was streaming past and about me in space invisible to me scattered in the wake of the earth upon its journey there must be an innumerable multitude of souls stripped like myself of the material stripped like myself of the passions of the individual and the generous emotions of the gregarious brute naked intelligences things of new born wonder and thought marvelling at the strange release that had suddenly come on them as i receded faster and faster from the strange white sun in the black heavens and from the broad and shining earth upon which my being had begun i seemed to grow in some incredible manner vast vast as regards this world i had left vast as regards the moments and periods of a human life very soon i saw the full circle of the earth slightly gibbous like the moon when she nears her full but very large and the silvery shape of america was now in the noonday blaze wherein as it seemed little england had been basking but a few minutes ago at first the earth was large and shone in the heavens filling a great part of them but every moment she grew smaller and more distant as she shrank the broad moon in its third quarter crept into view over the rim of her disc i looked for the constellations only that part of aries directly behind the sun and the lion which the earth covered were hidden i recognised the tortuous tattered band of the milky way with vega very bright between sun and earth and sirius and orion shone splendid against the unfathomable blackness in the opposite quarter of the heavens the pole star was overhead and the great bear hung over the circle of the earth and away beneath and beyond the shining corona of the sun were strange groupings of stars i had never seen in my life notably a dagger shaped group that i knew for the southern cross all these were no larger than when they had shone on earth but the little stars that one scarce sees shone now against the setting of black vacancy as brightly as the first magnitudes had done while the larger worlds were points of indescribable glory and colour aldebaran was a spot of blood red fire and sirius condensed to one point the light of innumerable sapphires and they shone steadily they did not scintillate they were calmly glorious my impressions had an adamantine hardness and brightness there was no blurring softness no atmosphere nothing but infinite darkness set with the myriads of these acute and brilliant points and specks of light presently when i looked again the little earth seemed no bigger than the sun and it dwindled and turned as i looked until in a seconds space as it seemed to me it was halved and so it went on swiftly dwindling far away in the opposite direction a little pinkish pins head of light shining steadily was the planet mars i swam motionless in vacancy and without a trace of terror or astonishment watched the speck of cosmic dust we call the world fall away from me presently it dawned upon me that my sense of duration had changed that my mind was moving not faster but infinitely slower that between each separate impression there was a period of many days the moon spun once round the earth as i noted this and i perceived clearly the motion of mars in his orbit moreover it appeared as if the time between thought and thought grew steadily greater until at last a thousand years was but a moment in my perception at first the constellations had shone motionless against the black background of infinite space but presently it seemed as though the group of stars about hercules and the scorpion was contracting while orion and aldebaran and their neighbours were scattering apart flashing suddenly out of the darkness there came a flying multitude of particles of rock glittering like dust specks in a sunbeam and encompassed in a faintly luminous cloud they swirled all about me and vanished again in a twinkling far behind and then i saw that a bright spot of light that shone a little to one side of my path was growing very rapidly larger and perceived that it was the planet saturn rushing towards me larger and larger it grew swallowing up the heavens behind it and hiding every moment a fresh multitude of stars i perceived its flattened whirling body its disc like belt and seven of its little satellites it grew and grew till it towered enormous and then i plunged amid a streaming multitude of clashing stones and dancing dust particles and gas eddies and saw for a moment the mighty triple belt like three concentric arches of moonlight above me its shadow black on the boiling tumult below these things happened in one tenth of the time it takes to tell them the planet went by like a flash of lightning for a few seconds it blotted out the sun and there and then became a mere black dwindling winged patch against the light the earth the mother mote of my being i could no longer see so with a stately swiftness in the profoundest silence the solar system fell from me as it had been a garment until the sun was a mere star amid the multitude of stars with its eddy of planet specks lost in the confused glittering of the remoter light i was no longer a denizen of the solar system i had come to the outer universe i seemed to grasp and comprehend the whole world of matter ever more swiftly the stars closed in about the spot where antares and vega had vanished in a phosphorescent haze until that part of the sky had the semblance of a whirling mass of nebul and ever before me yawned vaster gaps of vacant blackness and the stars shone fewer and fewer it seemed as if i moved towards a point between orions belt and sword and the void about that region opened vaster and vaster every second an incredible gulf of nothingness into which i was falling faster and ever faster the universe rushed by a hurry of whirling motes at last speeding silently into the void stars glowing brighter and brighter with their circling planets catching the light in a ghostly fashion as i neared them shone out and vanished again into inexistence faint comets clusters of meteorites winking specks of matter eddying light points whizzed past some perhaps a hundred millions of miles or so from me at most few nearer travelling with unimaginable rapidity shooting constellations momentary darts of fire through that black enormous night more than anything else it was like a dusty draught sunbeam lit broader and wider and deeper grew the starless space the vacant beyond into which i was being drawn at last a quarter of the heavens was black and blank and the whole headlong rush of stellar universe closed in behind me like a veil of light that is gathered together it drove away from me like a monstrous jack o lantern driven by the wind i had come out into the wilderness of space ever the vacant blackness grew broader until the hosts of the stars seemed only like a swarm of fiery specks hurrying away from me inconceivably remote and the darkness the nothingness and emptiness was about me on every side soon the little universe of matter the cage of points in which i had begun to be was dwindling now to a whirling disc of luminous glittering and now to one minute disc of hazy light in a little while it would shrink to a point and at last would vanish altogether suddenly feeling came back to me feeling in the shape of overwhelming terror such a dread of those dark vastitudes as no words can describe a passionate resurgence of sympathy and social desire were there other souls invisible to me as i to them about me in the blackness or was i indeed even as i felt alone had i passed out of being into something that was neither being nor not being the covering of the body the covering of matter had been torn from me and the hallucinations of companionship and security everything was black and silent i had ceased to be i was nothing there was nothing save only that infinitesimal dot of light that dwindled in the gulf i strained myself to hear and see and for a while there was naught but infinite silence intolerable darkness horror and despair then i saw that about the spot of light into which the whole world of matter had shrunk there was a faint glow and in a band on either side of that the darkness was not absolute i watched it for ages as it seemed to me and through the long waiting the haze grew imperceptibly more distinct and then about the band appeared an irregular cloud of the faintest palest brown i felt a passionate impatience but the things grew brighter so slowly that they scarce seemed to change what was unfolding itself what was this strange reddish dawn in the interminable night of space the clouds shape was grotesque it seemed to be looped along its lower side into four projecting masses and above it ended in a straight line what phantom was it i felt assured i had seen that figure before but i could not think what nor where nor when it was then the realisation rushed upon me it was a clenched hand i was alone in space alone with this huge shadowy hand upon which the whole universe of matter lay like an unconsidered speck of dust it seemed as though i watched it through vast periods of time on the forefinger glittered a ring and the universe from which i had come was but a spot of light upon the rings curvature and the thing that the hand gripped had the likeness of a black rod through a long eternity i watched this hand with the ring and the rod marvelling and fearing and waiting helplessly on what might follow it seemed as though nothing could follow that i should watch for ever seeing only the hand and the thing it held and understanding nothing of its import was the whole universe but a refracting speck upon some greater being were our worlds but the atoms of another universe and those again of another and so on through an endless progression and what was i was i indeed immaterial a vague persuasion of a body gathering about me came into my suspense the abysmal darkness about the hand filled with impalpable suggestions with uncertain fluctuating shapes then suddenly came a sound like the sound of a tolling bell faint as if infinitely far muffled as though heard through thick swathings of darkness a deep vibrating resonance with vast gulfs of silence between each stroke and the hand appeared to tighten on the rod and i saw far above the hand towards the apex of the darkness a circle of dim phosphorescence a ghostly sphere whence these sounds came throbbing and at the last stroke the hand vanished for the hour had come and i heard a noise of many waters but the black rod remained as a great band across the sky and then a voice which seemed to run to the uttermost parts of space spoke saying there will be no more pain at that an almost intolerable gladness and radiance rushed in upon me and i saw the circle shining white and bright and the rod black and shining and many things else distinct and clear and the circle was the face of the clock and the rod the rail of my bed haddon was standing at the foot against the rail with a small pair of scissors on his fingers and the hands of my clock on the mantel over his shoulder were clasped together over the hour of twelve mowbray was washing something in a basin at the octagonal table and at my side i felt a subdued feeling that could scarce be spoken of as pain the operation had not killed me and i perceived suddenly that the dull melancholy of half a year was lifted from my mind the plattner story whether the story of gottfried plattner is to be credited or not is a pretty question in the value of evidence on the one hand we have seven witnesses to be perfectly exact we have six and a half pairs of eyes and one undeniable fact and on the other we have what is it prejudice common sense the inertia of opinion never were there seven more honest seeming witnesses never was there a more undeniable fact than the inversion of gottfried plattners anatomical structure and never was there a more preposterous story than the one they have to tell the most preposterous part of the story is the worthy gottfrieds contribution for i count him as one of the seven heaven forbid that i should be led into giving countenance to superstition by a passion for impartiality and so come to share the fate of eusapias patrons frankly i believe there is something crooked about this business of gottfried plattner but what that crooked factor is i will admit as frankly i do not know i have been surprised at the credit accorded to the story in the most unexpected and authoritative quarters the fairest way to the reader however will be for me to tell it without further comment gottfried plattner is in spite of his name a freeborn englishman his father was an alsatian who came to england in the sixties married a respectable english girl of unexceptional antecedents and died after a wholesome and uneventful life devoted i understand chiefly to the laying of parquet flooring in gottfrieds age is seven and twenty he is by virtue of his heritage of three languages modern languages master in a small private school in the south of england to the casual observer he is singularly like any other modern languages master in any other small private school his costume is neither very costly nor very fashionable but on the other hand it is not markedly cheap or shabby his complexion like his height and his bearing is inconspicuous you would notice perhaps that like the majority of people his face was not absolutely symmetrical his right eye a little larger than the left and his jaw a trifle heavier on the right side if you as an ordinary careless person were to bare his chest and feel his heart beating you would probably find it quite like the heart of any one else but here you and the trained observer would part company if you found his heart quite ordinary the trained observer would find it quite otherwise and once the thing was pointed out to you you too would perceive the peculiarity easily enough it is that gottfrieds heart beats on the right side of his body now that is not the only singularity of gottfrieds structure although it is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind careful sounding of gottfrieds internal arrangements by a well known surgeon seems to point to the fact that all the other unsymmetrical parts of his body are similarly misplaced the right lobe of his liver is on the left side the left on his right while his lungs too are similarly contraposed what is still more singular unless gottfried is a consummate actor we must believe that his right hand has recently become his left since the occurrences we are about to consider as impartially as possible he has found the utmost difficulty in writing except from right to left across the paper with his left hand he cannot throw with his right hand he is perplexed at meal times between knife and fork and his ideas of the rule of the road he is a cyclist are still a dangerous confusion and there is not a scrap of evidence to show that before these occurrences gottfried was at all left handed there is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous business gottfried produces three photographs of himself you have him at the age of five or six thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid frock and scowling in that photograph his left eye is a little larger than his right and his jaw is a trifle heavier on the left side this is the reverse of his present living condition the photograph of gottfried at fourteen seems to contradict these facts but that is because it is one of those cheap gem photographs that were then in vogue taken direct upon metal and therefore reversing things just as a looking glass would the third photograph represents him at one and twenty and confirms the record of the others there seems here evidence of the strongest confirmatory character that gottfried has exchanged his left side for his right yet how a human being can be so changed short of a fantastic and pointless miracle it is exceedingly hard to suggest in one way of course these facts might be explicable on the supposition that plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification on the strength of his hearts displacement photographs may be faked and left handedness imitated but the character of the man does not lend itself to any such theory he is quiet practical unobtrusive and thoroughly sane from the nordau standpoint he likes beer and smokes moderately takes walking exercise daily and has a healthily high estimate of the value of his teaching he has a good but untrained tenor voice and takes a pleasure in singing airs of a popular and cheerful character he is fond but not morbidly fond of reading chiefly fiction pervaded with a vaguely pious optimism sleeps well and rarely dreams he is in fact the very last person to evolve a fantastic fable indeed so far from forcing this story upon the world he has been singularly reticent on the matter he meets inquirers with a certain engaging bashfulness is almost the word that disarms the most suspicious he seems genuinely ashamed that anything so unusual has occurred to him it is to be regretted that plattners aversion to the idea of post mortem dissection may postpone perhaps for ever the positive proof that his entire body has had its left and right sides transposed upon that fact mainly the credibility of his story hangs there is no way of taking a man and moving him about in space as ordinary people understand space that will result in our changing his sides whatever you do his right is still his right his left his left you can do that with a perfectly thin and flat thing of course if you were to cut a figure out of paper any figure with a right and left side you could change its sides simply by lifting it up and turning it over but with a solid it is different mathematical theorists tell us that the only way in which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking that body clean out of space as we know it taking it out of ordinary existence that is and turning it somewhere outside space this is a little abstruse no doubt but any one with any knowledge of mathematical theory will assure the reader of its truth to put the thing in technical language the curious inversion of plattners right and left sides is proof that he has moved out of our space into what is called the fourth dimension and that he has returned again to our world unless we choose to consider ourselves the victims of an elaborate and motiveless fabrication we are almost bound to believe that this has occurred so much for the tangible facts we come now to the account of the phenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the world it appears that in the sussexville proprietary school plattner not only discharged the duties of modern languages master but also taught chemistry commercial geography bookkeeping shorthand drawing and any other additional subject to which the changing fancies of the boys parents might direct attention he knew little or nothing of these various subjects but in secondary as distinguished from board or elementary schools knowledge in the teacher is very properly by no means so necessary as high moral character and gentlemanly tone in chemistry he was particularly deficient knowing he says nothing beyond the three gases whatever the three gases may be as however his pupils began by knowing nothing and derived all their information from him this caused him or any one but little inconvenience for several terms then a little boy named whibble joined the school who had been educated it seems by some mischievous relative into an inquiring habit of mind this little boy followed plattners lessons with marked and sustained interest and in order to exhibit his zeal on the subject brought at various times substances for plattner to analyse plattner flattered by this evidence of his power of awakening interest and trusting to the boys ignorance analysed these and even made general statements as to their composition indeed he was so far stimulated by his pupil as to obtain a work upon analytical chemistry and study it during his supervision of the evenings preparation he was surprised to find chemistry quite an interesting subject so far the story is absolutely commonplace but now the greenish powder comes upon the scene the source of that greenish powder seems unfortunately lost master whibble tells a tortuous story of finding it done up in a packet in a disused limekiln near the downs it would have been an excellent thing for plattner and possibly for master whibbles family if a match could have been applied to that powder there and then the young gentleman certainly did not bring it to school in a packet but in a common eight ounce graduated medicine bottle plugged with masticated newspaper he gave it to plattner at the end of the afternoon school four boys had been detained after school prayers in order to complete some neglected tasks and plattner was supervising these in the small class room in which the chemical teaching was conducted the appliances for the practical teaching of chemistry in the sussexville proprietary school as in most small schools in this country are characterised by a severe simplicity they are kept in a small cupboard standing in a recess and having about the same capacity as a common travelling trunk plattner being bored with his passive superintendence seems to have welcomed the intervention of whibble with his green powder as an agreeable diversion and unlocking this cupboard proceeded at once with his analytical experiments whibble sat luckily for himself at a safe distance regarding him the four malefactors feigning a profound absorption in their work watched him furtively with the keenest interest for even within the limits of the three gases plattners practical chemistry was i understand temerarious they are practically unanimous in their account of plattners proceedings he poured a little of the green powder into a test tube and tried the substance with water hydrochloric acid nitric acid and sulphuric acid in succession getting no result he emptied out a little heap nearly half the bottleful in fact upon a slate and tried a match he held the medicine bottle in his left hand the stuff began to smoke and melt and then exploded with deafening violence and a blinding flash the five boys seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes ducked below their desks and were none of them seriously hurt the window was blown out into the playground and the blackboard on its easel was upset the slate was smashed to atoms some plaster fell from the ceiling no other damage was done to the school edifice or appliances and the boys at first seeing nothing of plattner fancied he was knocked down and lying out of their sight below the desks they jumped out of their places to go to his assistance and were amazed to find the space empty being still confused by the sudden violence of the report they hurried to the open door under the impression that he must have been hurt and have rushed out of the room but carson the foremost nearly collided in the doorway with the principal mr lidgett mr lidgett is a corpulent excitable man with one eye the boys describe him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those tempered expletives irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to use lest worse befall wretched mumchancer he said wheres mr plattner the boys are agreed on the very words wobbler snivelling puppy and mumchancer are it seems among the ordinary small change of mr lidgetts scholastic commerce wheres mr plattner that was a question that was to be repeated many times in the next few days it really seemed as though that frantic hyperbole blown to atoms had for once realised itself there was not a visible particle of plattner to be seen not a drop of blood nor a stitch of clothing to be found apparently he had been blown clean out of existence and left not a wrack behind not so much as would cover a sixpenny piece to quote a proverbial expression the evidence of his absolute disappearance as a consequence of that explosion is indubitable it is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in the sussexville proprietary school and in sussexville and elsewhere by this event it is quite possible indeed that some of the readers of these pages may recall the hearing of some remote and dying version of that excitement during the last summer holidays lidgett it would seem did everything in his power to suppress and minimise the story he instituted a penalty of twenty five lines for any mention of plattners name among the boys and stated in the schoolroom that he was clearly aware of his assistants whereabouts he was afraid he explains that the possibility of an explosion happening in spite of the elaborate precautions taken to minimise the practical teaching of chemistry might injure the reputation of the school and so might any mysterious quality in plattners departure indeed he did everything in his power to make the occurrence seem as ordinary as possible in particular he cross examined the five eye witnesses of the occurrence so searchingly that they began to doubt the plain evidence of their senses but in spite of these efforts the tale in a magnified and distorted state made a nine days wonder in the district and several parents withdrew their sons on colourable pretexts not the least remarkable point in the matter is the fact that a large number of people in the neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dreams of plattner during the period of excitement before his return and that these dreams had a curious uniformity in almost all of them plattner was seen sometimes singly sometimes in company wandering about through a coruscating iridescence in all cases his face was pale and distressed and in some he gesticulated towards the dreamer one or two of the boys evidently under the influence of nightmare fancied that plattner approached them with remarkable swiftness and seemed to look closely into their very eyes others fled with plattner from the pursuit of vague and extraordinary creatures of a globular shape but all these fancies were forgotten in inquiries and speculations when on the wednesday next but one after the monday of the explosion plattner returned the circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his departure so far as mr lidgetts somewhat choleric outline can be filled in from plattners hesitating statements it would appear that on wednesday evening towards the hour of sunset the former gentleman having dismissed evening preparation was engaged in his garden picking and eating strawberries a fruit of which he is inordinately fond it is a large old fashioned garden secured from observation fortunately by a high and ivy covered red brick wall just as he was stooping over a particularly prolific plant there was a flash in the air and a heavy thud and before he could look round some heavy body struck him violently from behind he was pitched forward crushing the strawberries he held in his hand and that so roughly that his silk hat mr lidgett adheres to the older ideas of scholastic costume was driven violently down upon his forehead and almost over one eye this heavy missile which slid over him sideways and collapsed into a sitting posture among the strawberry plants proved to be our long lost mr gottfried plattner in an extremely dishevelled condition he was collarless and hatless his linen was dirty and there was blood upon his hands mr lidgett was so indignant and surprised that he remained on all fours and with his hat jammed down on his eye while he expostulated vehemently with plattner for his disrespectful and unaccountable conduct this scarcely idyllic scene completes what i may call the exterior version of the plattner story its exoteric aspect it is quite unnecessary to enter here into all the details of his dismissal by mr lidgett such details with the full names and dates and references will be found in the larger report of these occurrences that was laid before the society for the investigation of abnormal phenomena the singular transposition of plattners right and left sides was scarcely observed for the first day or so and then first in connection with his disposition to write from right to left across the blackboard he concealed rather than ostended this curious confirmatory circumstance as he considered it would unfavourably affect his prospects in a new situation the displacement of his heart was discovered some months after when he was having a tooth extracted under ansthetics he then very unwillingly allowed a cursory surgical examination to be made of himself with a view to a brief account in the journal of anatomy that exhausts the statement of the material facts and we may now go on to consider plattners account of the matter but first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion of this story and what is to follow all i have told thus far is established by such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve every one of the witnesses is still alive the reader if he have the leisure may hunt the lads out to morrow or even brave the terrors of the redoubtable lidgett and cross examine and trap and test to his hearts content gottfried plattner himself and his twisted heart and his three photographs are producible it may be taken as proved that he did disappear for nine days as the consequence of an explosion that he returned almost as violently under circumstances in their nature annoying to mr lidgett whatever the details of those circumstances may be and that he returned inverted just as a reflection returns from a mirror from the last fact as i have already stated it follows almost inevitably that plattner during those nine days must have been in some state of existence altogether out of space the evidence to these statements is indeed far stronger than that upon which most murderers are hanged but for his own particular account of where he had been with its confused explanations and wellnigh self contradictory details we have only mr gottfried plattners word i do not wish to discredit that but i must point out what so many writers upon obscure psychic phenomena fail to do that we are passing here from the practically undeniable to that kind of matter which any reasonable man is entitled to believe or reject as he thinks proper the previous statements render it plausible its discordance with common experience tilts it towards the incredible i would prefer not to sway the beam of the readers judgment either way but simply to tell the story as plattner told it to me he gave me his narrative i may state at my house at chislehurst and so soon as he had left me that evening i went into my study and wrote down everything as i remembered it subsequently he was good enough to read over a typewritten copy so that its substantial correctness is undeniable he states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought he was killed he felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward it is a curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his backward flight and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry cupboard or the blackboard easel his heels struck ground and he staggered and fell heavily into a sitting position on something soft and firm for a moment the concussion stunned him he became aware at once of a vivid scent of singed hair and he seemed to hear the voice of lidgett asking for him you will understand that for a time his mind was greatly confused at first he was under the impression that he was still standing in the class room he perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the boys and the entry of mr lidgett he is quite positive upon that score he did not hear their remarks but that he ascribed to the deafening effect of the experiment things about him seemed curiously dark and faint but his mind explained that on the obvious but mistaken idea that the explosion had engendered a huge volume of dark smoke through the dimness the figures of lidgett and the boys moved as faint and silent as ghosts plattners face still tingled with the stinging heat of the flash he was he says all muddled his first definite thoughts seem to have been of his personal safety he thought he was perhaps blinded and deafened he felt his limbs and face in a gingerly manner then his perceptions grew clearer and he was astonished to miss the old familiar desks and other schoolroom furniture about him only dim uncertain gray shapes stood in the place of these then came a thing that made him shout aloud and awoke his stunned faculties to instant activity two of the boys gesticulating walked one after the other clean through him neither manifested the slightest consciousness of his presence it is difficult to imagine the sensation he felt they came against him he says with no more force than a wisp of mist plattners first thought after that was that he was dead having been brought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters however he was a little surprised to find his body still about him his second conclusion was that he was not dead but that the others were that the explosion had destroyed the sussexville proprietary school and every soul in it except himself but that too was scarcely satisfactory he was thrown back upon astonished observation everything about him was profoundly dark at first it seemed to have an altogether ebony blackness overhead was a black firmament the only touch of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow at the edge of the sky in one direction which threw into prominence a horizon of undulating black hills this i say was his impression at first as his eye grew accustomed to the darkness he began to distinguish a faint quality of differentiating greenish colour in the circumambient night against this background the furniture and occupants of the class room it seems stood out like phosphorescent spectres faint and impalpable he extended his hand and thrust it without an effort through the wall of the room by the fireplace he describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract attention he shouted to lidgett and tried to seize the boys as they went to and fro he only desisted from these attempts when mrs lidgett whom he as an assistant master naturally disliked entered the room he says the sensation of being in the world and yet not a part of it was an extraordinarily disagreeable one he compared his feelings not inaptly to those of a cat watching a mouse through a window whenever he made a motion to communicate with the dim familiar world about him he found an invisible incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse he then turned his attention to his solid environment he found the medicine bottle still unbroken in his hand with the remainder of the green powder therein he put this in his pocket and began to feel about him apparently he was sitting on a boulder of rock covered with a velvety moss the dark country about him he was unable to see the faint misty picture of the schoolroom blotting it out but he had a feeling due perhaps to a cold wind that he was near the crest of a hill and that a steep valley fell away beneath his feet the green glow along the edge of the sky seemed to be growing in extent and intensity he stood up rubbing his eyes it would seem that he made a few steps going steeply downhill and then stumbled nearly fell and sat down again upon a jagged mass of rock to watch the dawn he became aware that the world about him was absolutely silent it was as still as it was dark and though there was a cold wind blowing up the hill face the rustle of grass the soughing of the boughs that should have accompanied it were absent he could hear therefore if he could not see that the hillside upon which he stood was rocky and desolate the green grew brighter every moment and as it did so a faint transparent blood red mingled with but did not mitigate the blackness of the sky overhead and the rocky desolations about him having regard to what follows i am inclined to think that that redness may have been an optical effect due to contrast something black fluttered momentarily against the livid yellow green of the lower sky and then the thin and penetrating voice of a bell rose out of the black gulf below him an oppressive expectation grew with the growing light it is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there the strange green light growing brighter every moment and spreading slowly in flamboyant fingers upward towards the zenith as it grew the spectral vision of our world became relatively or absolutely fainter probably both for the time must have been about that of our earthly sunset so far as his vision of our world went plattner by his few steps downhill had passed through the floor of the class room and was now it seemed sitting in mid air in the larger schoolroom downstairs he saw the boarders distinctly but much more faintly than he had seen lidgett they were preparing their evening tasks and he noticed with interest that several were cheating with their euclid riders by means of a crib a compilation whose existence he had hitherto never suspected as the time passed they faded steadily as steadily as the light of the green dawn increased looking down into the valley he saw that the light had crept far down its rocky sides and that the profound blackness of the abyss was now broken by a minute green glow like the light of a glow worm and almost immediately the limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over the basaltic undulations of the distant hills and the monstrous hill masses about him came out gaunt and desolate in green light and deep ruddy black shadows he became aware of a vast number of ball shaped objects drifting as thistledown drifts over the high ground there were none of these nearer to him than the opposite side of the gorge the bell below twanged quicker and quicker with something like impatient insistence and several lights moved hither and thither the boys at work at their desks were now almost imperceptibly faint this extinction of our world when the green sun of this other universe rose is a curious point upon which plattner insists during the other world night it is difficult to move about on account of the vividness with which the things of this world are visible it becomes a riddle to explain why if this is the case we in this world catch no glimpse of the other world it is due perhaps to the comparatively vivid illumination of this world of ours plattner describes the midday of the other world at its brightest as not being nearly so bright as this world at full moon while its night is profoundly black consequently the amount of light even in an ordinary dark room is sufficient to render the things of the other world invisible on the same principle that faint phosphorescence is only visible in the profoundest darkness i have tried since he told me his story to see something of the other world by sitting for a long space in a photographers dark room at night i have certainly seen indistinctly the form of greenish slopes and rocks but only i must admit very indistinctly indeed the reader may possibly be more successful plattner tells me that since his return he has dreamt and seen and recognised places in the other world but this is probably due to his memory of these scenes it seems quite possible that people with unusually keen eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this strange other world about us however this is a digression as the green sun rose a long street of black buildings became perceptible though only darkly and indistinctly in the gorge and after some hesitation plattner began to clamber down the precipitous descent towards them the descent was long and exceedingly tedious being so not only by the extraordinary steepness but also by reason of the looseness of the boulders with which the whole face of the hill was strewn the noise of his descent now and then his heels struck fire from the rocks seemed now the only sound in the universe for the beating of the bell had ceased as he drew nearer he perceived that the various edifices had a singular resemblance to tombs and mausoleums and monuments saving only that they were all uniformly black instead of being white as most sepulchres are and then he saw crowding out of the largest building very much as people disperse from church a number of pallid rounded pale green figures these dispersed in several directions about the broad street of the place some going through side alleys and reappearing upon the steepness of the hill others entering some of the small black buildings which lined the way at the sight of these things drifting up towards him plattner stopped staring they were not walking they were indeed limbless and they had the appearance of human heads beneath which a tadpole like body swung he was too astonished at their strangeness too full indeed of strangeness to be seriously alarmed by them they drove towards him in front of the chill wind that was blowing uphill much as soap bubbles drive before a draught and as he looked at the nearest of those approaching he saw it was indeed a human head albeit with singularly large eyes and wearing such an expression of distress and anguish as he had never seen before upon mortal countenance he was surprised to find that it did not turn to regard him but seemed to be watching and following some unseen moving thing for a moment he was puzzled and then it occurred to him that this creature was watching with its enormous eyes something that was happening in the world he had just left nearer it came and nearer and he was too astonished to cry out it made a very faint fretting sound as it came close to him then it struck his face with a gentle pat its touch was very cold and drove past him and upward towards the crest of the hill an extraordinary conviction flashed across plattners mind that this head had a strong likeness to lidgett then he turned his attention to the other heads that were now swarming thickly up the hill side none made the slightest sign of recognition one or two indeed came close to his head and almost followed the example of the first but he dodged convulsively out of the way upon most of them he saw the same expression of unavailing regret he had seen upon the first and heard the same faint sounds of wretchedness from them one or two wept and one rolling swiftly uphill wore an expression of diabolical rage but others were cold and several had a look of gratified interest in their eyes one at least was almost in an ecstasy of happiness plattner does not remember that he recognised any more likenesses in those he saw at this time for several hours perhaps plattner watched these strange things dispersing themselves over the hills and not till long after they had ceased to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge did he resume his downward climb the darkness about him increased so much that he had a difficulty in stepping true overhead the sky was now a bright pale green he felt neither hunger nor thirst later when he did he found a chilly stream running down the centre of the gorge and the rare moss upon the boulders when he tried it at last in desperation was good to eat he groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge seeking vaguely for some clue to these inexplicable things after a long time he came to the entrance of the big mausoleum like building from which the heads had issued in this he found a group of green lights burning upon a kind of basaltic altar and a bell rope from a belfry overhead hanging down into the centre of the place round the wall ran a lettering of fire in a character unknown to him while he was still wondering at the purport of these things he heard the receding tramp of heavy feet echoing far down the street he ran out into the darkness again but he could see nothing he had a mind to pull the bell rope and finally decided to follow the footsteps but although he ran far he never overtook them and his shouting was of no avail the gorge seemed to extend an interminable distance it was as dark as earthly starlight throughout its length while the ghastly green day lay along the upper edge of its precipices there were none of the heads now below they were all it seemed busily occupied along the upper slopes looking up he saw them drifting hither and thither some hovering stationary some flying swiftly through the air it reminded him he said of big snowflakes only these were black and pale green in pursuing the firm undeviating footsteps that he never overtook in groping into new regions of this endless devils dyke in clambering up and down the pitiless heights in wandering about the summits and in watching the drifting faces plattner states that he spent the better part of seven or eight days he did not keep count he says though once or twice he found eyes watching him he had word with no living soul he slept among the rocks on the hillside in the gorge things earthly were invisible because from the earthly standpoint it was far underground on the altitudes so soon as the earthly day began the world became visible to him he found himself sometimes stumbling over the dark green rocks or arresting himself on a precipitous brink while all about him the green branches of the sussexville lanes were swaying or again he seemed to be walking through the sussexville streets or watching unseen the private business of some household and then it was he discovered that to almost every human being in our world there pertained some of these drifting heads that every one in the world is watched intermittently by these helpless disembodiments what are they these watchers of the living plattner never learned but two that presently found and followed him were like his childhoods memory of his father and mother now and then other faces turned their eyes upon him eyes like those of dead people who had swayed him or injured him or helped him in his youth and manhood whenever they looked at him plattner was overcome with a strange sense of responsibility to his mother he ventured to speak but she made no answer she looked sadly steadfastly and tenderly a little reproachfully too it seemed into his eyes he simply tells this story he does not endeavour to explain we are left to surmise who these watchers of the living may be or if they are indeed the dead why they should so closely and passionately watch a world they have left for ever it may be indeed to my mind it seems just that when our life has closed when evil or good is no longer a choice for us we may still have to witness the working out of the train of consequences we have laid if human souls continue after death then surely human interests continue after death but that is merely my own guess at the meaning of the things seen plattner offers no interpretation for none was given him it is well the reader should understand this clearly day after day with his head reeling he wandered about this strange lit world outside the world weary and towards the end weak and hungry by day by our earthly day that is the ghostly vision of the old familiar scenery of sussexville all about him irked and worried him he could not see where to put his feet and ever and again with a chilly touch one of these watching souls would come against his face and after dark the multitude of these watchers about him and their intent distress confused his mind beyond describing a great longing to return to the earthly life that was so near and yet so remote consumed him the unearthliness of things about him produced a positively painful mental distress he was worried beyond describing by his own particular followers he would shout at them to desist from staring at him scold at them hurry away from them they were always mute and intent run as he might over the uneven ground they followed his destinies on the ninth day towards evening plattner heard the invisible footsteps approaching far away down the gorge he was then wandering over the broad crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen in his entry into this strange other world of his he turned to hurry down into the gorge feeling his way hastily and was arrested by the sight of the thing that was happening in a room in a back street near the school both of the people in the room he knew by sight the windows were open the blinds up and the setting sun shone clearly into it so that it came out quite brightly at first a vivid oblong of room lying like a magic lantern picture upon the black landscape and the livid green dawn in addition to the sunlight a candle had just been lit in the room on the bed lay a lank man his ghastly white face terrible upon the tumbled pillow his clenched hands were raised above his head a little table beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles some toast and water and an empty glass every now and then the lank mans lips fell apart to indicate a word he could not articulate but the woman did not notice that he wanted anything because she was busy turning out papers from an old fashioned bureau in the opposite corner of the room at first the picture was very vivid indeed but as the green dawn behind it grew brighter and brighter so it became fainter and more and more transparent as the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer those footsteps that sound so loud in that other world and come so silently in this plattner perceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering together out of the darkness and watching the two people in the room never before had he seen so many of the watchers of the living a multitude had eyes only for the sufferer in the room another multitude in infinite anguish watched the woman as she hunted with greedy eyes for something she could not find they crowded about plattner they came across his sight and buffeted his face the noise of their unavailing regrets was all about him he saw clearly only now and then at other times the picture quivered dimly through the veil of green reflections upon their movements in the room it must have been very still and plattner says the candle flame streamed up into a perfectly vertical line of smoke but in his ears each footfall and its echoes beat like a clap of thunder and the faces two more particularly near the womans one a womans also white and clear featured a face which might have once been cold and hard but which was now softened by the touch of a wisdom strange to earth the other might have been the womans father both were evidently absorbed in the contemplation of some act of hateful meanness so it seemed which they could no longer guard against and prevent behind were others teachers it may be who had taught ill friends whose influence had failed and over the man too a multitude but none that seemed to be parents or teachers faces that might once have been coarse now purged to strength by sorrow and in the forefront one face a girlish one neither angry nor remorseful but merely patient and weary and as it seemed to plattner waiting for relief his powers of description fail him at the memory of this multitude of ghastly countenances they gathered on the stroke of the bell he saw them all in the space of a second it would seem that he was so worked on by his excitement that quite involuntarily his restless fingers took the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it before him but he does not remember that abruptly the footsteps ceased he waited for the next and there was silence and then suddenly cutting through the unexpected stillness like a keen thin blade came the first stroke of the bell at that the multitudinous faces swayed to and fro and a louder crying began all about him the woman did not hear she was burning something now in the candle flame at the second stroke everything grew dim and a breath of wind icy cold blew through the host of watchers they swirled about him like an eddy of dead leaves in the spring and at the third stroke something was extended through them to the bed you have heard of a beam of light this was like a beam of darkness and looking again at it plattner saw that it was a shadowy arm and hand the green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon and the vision of the room was very faint plattner could see that the white of the bed struggled and was convulsed and that the woman looked round over her shoulder at it startled the cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before the wind and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the gorge then suddenly plattner understood the meaning of the shadowy black arm that stretched across his shoulder and clutched its prey he did not dare turn his head to see the shadow behind the arm with a violent effort and covering his eyes he set himself to run made perhaps twenty strides then slipped on a boulder and fell he fell forward on his hands and the bottle smashed and exploded as he touched the ground in another moment he found himself stunned and bleeding sitting face to face with lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school there the story of plattners experiences ends i have resisted i believe successfully the natural disposition of a writer of fiction to dress up incidents of this sort i have told the thing as far as possible in the order in which plattner told it to me i have carefully avoided any attempt at style effect or construction it would have been easy for instance to have worked the scene of the death bed into a kind of plot in which plattner might have been involved but quite apart from the objectionableness of falsifying a most extraordinary true story any such trite devices would spoil to my mind the peculiar effect of this dark world with its livid green illumination and its drifting watchers of the living which unseen and unapproachable to us is yet lying all about us it remains to add that a death did actually occur in vincent terrace just beyond the school garden and so far as can be proved at the moment of plattners return deceased was a rate collector and insurance agent his widow who was much younger than himself married last month a mr whymper a veterinary surgeon of allbeeding as the portion of this story given here has in various forms circulated orally in sussexville she has consented to my use of her name on condition that i make it distinctly known that she emphatically contradicts every detail of plattners account of her husbands last moments she burnt no will she says although plattner never accused her of doing so her husband made but one will and that just after their marriage certainly from a man who had never seen it plattners account of the furniture of the room was curiously accurate one other thing even at the risk of an irksome repetition i must insist upon lest i seem to favour the credulous superstitious view plattners absence from the world for nine days is i think proved but that does not prove his story it is quite conceivable that even outside space hallucinations may be possible that at least the reader must bear distinctly in mind the crystal egg there was until a year ago a little and very grimy looking shop near seven dials over which in weatherworn yellow lettering the name of c cave naturalist and dealer in antiquities was inscribed the contents of its window were curiously variegated they comprised some elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen beads and weapons a box of eyes two skulls of tigers and one human several moth eaten stuffed monkeys one holding a lamp an old fashioned cabinet a fly blown ostrich egg or so some fishing tackle and an extraordinarily dirty empty glass fish tank there was also at the moment the story begins a mass of crystal worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished and at that two people who stood outside the window were looking one of them a tall thin clergyman the other a black bearded young man of dusky complexion and unobtrusive costume the dusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the article while they were there mr cave came into his shop his beard still wagging with the bread and butter of his tea when he saw these men and the object of their regard his countenance fell he glanced guiltily over his shoulder and softly shut the door he was a little old man with pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes his hair was a dirty gray and he wore a shabby blue frock coat an ancient silk hat and carpet slippers very much down at heel he remained watching the two men as they talked the clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket examined a handful of money and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile mr cave seemed still more depressed when they came into the shop the clergyman without any ceremony asked the price of the crystal egg mr cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour and said five pounds the clergyman protested that the price was high to his companion as well as to mr cave it was indeed very much more than mr cave had intended to ask when he had stocked the article and an attempt at bargaining ensued mr cave stepped to the shop door and held it open five pounds is my price he said as though he wished to save himself the trouble of unprofitable discussion as he did so the upper portion of a womans face appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the door leading into the parlour and stared curiously at the two customers five pounds is my price said mr cave with a quiver in his voice the swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator watching cave keenly now he spoke give him five pounds he said the clergyman glanced at him to see if he were in earnest and when he looked at mr cave again he saw that the latters face was white its a lot of money said the clergyman and diving into his pocket began counting his resources he had little more than thirty shillings and he appealed to his companion with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable intimacy this gave mr cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts and he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not as a matter of fact entirely free for sale his two customers were naturally surprised at this and inquired why he had not thought of that before he began to bargain mr cave became confused but he stuck to his story that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon that a probable purchaser of it had already appeared the two treating this as an attempt to raise the price still further made as if they would leave the shop but at this point the parlour door opened and the owner of the dark fringe and the little eyes appeared she was a coarse featured corpulent woman younger and very much larger than mr cave she walked heavily and her face was flushed that crystal is for sale she said and five pounds is a good enough price for it i cant think what youre about cave not to take the gentlemans offer mr cave greatly perturbed by the irruption looked angrily at her over the rims of his spectacles and without excessive assurance asserted his right to manage his business in his own way an altercation began the two customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement occasionally assisting mrs cave with suggestions mr cave hard driven persisted in a confused and impossible story of an inquiry for the crystal that morning and his agitation became painful but he stuck to his point with extraordinary persistence it was the young oriental who ended this curious controversy he proposed that they should call again in the course of two days so as to give the alleged inquirer a fair chance and then we must insist said the clergyman five pounds mrs cave took it on herself to apologise for her husband explaining that he was sometimes a little odd and as the two customers left the couple prepared for a free discussion of the incident in all its bearings mrs cave talked to her husband with singular directness the poor little man quivering with emotion muddled himself between his stories maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer in view and on the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas why did you ask five pounds said his wife do let me manage my business my own way said mr cave mr cave had living with him a stepdaughter and a stepson and at supper that night the transaction was re discussed none of them had a high opinion of mr caves business methods and this action seemed a culminating folly its my opinion hes refused that crystal before said the stepson a loose limbed lout of eighteen but five pounds said the stepdaughter an argumentative young woman of six and twenty mr caves answers were wretched he could only mumble weak assertions that he knew his own business best they drove him from his half eaten supper into the shop to close it for the night his ears aflame and tears of vexation behind his spectacles why had he left the crystal in the window so long the folly of it that was the trouble closest in his mind for a time he could see no way of evading sale after supper his stepdaughter and stepson smartened themselves up and went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business aspects of the crystal over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in hot water mr cave went into the shop and stayed there until late ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for gold fish cases but really for a private purpose that will be better explained later the next day mrs cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window and was lying behind some second hand books on angling she replaced it in a conspicuous position but she did not argue further about it as a nervous headache disinclined her from debate mr cave was always disinclined the day passed disagreeably mr cave was if anything more absent minded than usual and uncommonly irritable withal in the afternoon when his wife was taking her customary sleep he removed the crystal from the window again the next day mr cave had to deliver a consignment of dog fish at one of the hospital schools where they were needed for dissection in his absence mrs caves mind reverted to the topic of the crystal and the methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds she had already devised some very agreeable expedients among others a dress of green silk for herself and a trip to richmond when a jangling of the front door bell summoned her into the shop the customer was an examination coach who came to complain of the non delivery of certain frogs asked for the previous day mrs cave did not approve of this particular branch of mr caves business and the gentleman who had called in a somewhat aggressive mood retired after a brief exchange of words entirely civil so far as he was concerned mrs caves eye then naturally turned to the window for the sight of the crystal was an assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams what was her surprise to find it gone she went to the place behind the locker on the counter where she had discovered it the day before it was not there and she immediately began an eager search about the shop when mr cave returned from his business with the dogfish about a quarter to two in the afternoon he found the shop in some confusion and his wife extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter routing among his taxidermic material her face came up hot and angry over the counter as the jangling bell announced his return and she forthwith accused him of hiding it hid what asked mr cave the crystal at that mr cave apparently much surprised rushed to the window isnt it here he said great heavens what has become of it just then mr caves stepson re entered the shop from the inner room he had come home a minute or so before mr cave and he was blaspheming freely he was apprenticed to a second hand furniture dealer down the road but he had his meals at home and he was naturally annoyed to find no dinner ready but when he heard of the loss of the crystal he forgot his meal and his anger was diverted from his mother to his stepfather their first idea of course was that he had hidden it but mr cave stoutly denied all knowledge of its fate freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the matter and at last was worked up to the point of accusing first his wife and then his stepson of having taken it with a view to a private sale so began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion which ended for mrs cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between hysterics and amuck and caused the stepson to be half an hour late at the furniture establishment in the afternoon mr cave took refuge from his wifes emotions in the shop in the evening the matter was resumed with less passion and in a judicial spirit under the presidency of the stepdaughter the supper passed unhappily and culminated in a painful scene mr cave gave way at last to extreme exasperation and went out banging the front door violently the rest of the family having discussed him with the freedom his absence warranted hunted the house from garret to cellar hoping to light upon the crystal the next day the two customers called again they were received by mrs cave almost in tears it transpired that no one could imagine all that she had stood from cave at various times in her married pilgrimage she also gave a garbled account of the disappearance the clergyman and the oriental laughed silently at one another and said it was very extraordinary as mrs cave seemed disposed to give them the complete history of her life they made to leave the shop thereupon mrs cave still clinging to hope asked for the clergymans address so that if she could get anything out of cave she might communicate it the address was duly given but apparently was afterwards mislaid mrs cave can remember nothing about it in the evening of that day the caves seem to have exhausted their emotions and mr cave who had been out in the afternoon supped in a gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned controversy of the previous days for some time matters were very badly strained in the cave household but neither crystal nor customer reappeared now without mincing the matter we must admit that mr cave was a liar he knew perfectly well where the crystal was it was in the rooms of mr jacoby wace assistant demonstrator at st catherines hospital westbourne street it stood on the sideboard partially covered by a black velvet cloth and beside a decanter of american whisky it is from mr wace indeed that the particulars upon which this narrative is based were derived cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden in the dog fish sack and there had pressed the young investigator to keep it for him mr wace was a little dubious at first his relationship to cave was peculiar he had a taste for singular characters and he had more than once invited the old man to smoke and drink in his rooms and to unfold his rather amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular mr wace had encountered mrs cave too on occasions when mr cave was not at home to attend to him he knew the constant interference to which cave was subjected and having weighed the story judicially he decided to give the crystal a refuge mr cave promised to explain the reasons for his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein he called on mr wace the same evening he told a complicated story the crystal he said had come into his possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity dealers effects and not knowing what its value might be he had ticketed it at ten shillings it had hung upon his hands at that price for some months and he was thinking of reducing the figure when he made a singular discovery at that time his health was very bad and it must be borne in mind that throughout all this experience his physical condition was one of ebb and he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence the positive ill treatment even he received from his wife and stepchildren his wife was vain extravagant unfeeling and had a growing taste for private drinking his stepdaughter was mean and over reaching and his stepson had conceived a violent dislike for him and lost no chance of showing it the requirements of his business pressed heavily upon him and mr wace does not think that he was altogether free from occasional intemperance he had begun life in a comfortable position he was a man of fair education and he suffered for weeks at a stretch from melancholia and insomnia afraid to disturb his family he would slip quietly from his wifes side when his thoughts became intolerable and wander about the house and about three oclock one morning late in august chance directed him into the shop the dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot where he perceived an unusual glow of light approaching this he discovered it to be the crystal egg which was standing on the corner of the counter towards the window a thin ray smote through a crack in the shutters impinged upon the object and seemed as it were to fill its entire interior it occurred to mr cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of optics as he had known them in his younger days he could understand the rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its interior but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions he approached the crystal nearly peering into it and round it with a transient revival of the scientific curiosity that in his youth had determined his choice of a calling he was surprised to find the light not steady but writhing within the substance of the egg as though that object was a hollow sphere of some luminous vapour in moving about to get different points of view he suddenly found that he had come between it and the ray and that the crystal none the less remained luminous greatly astonished he lifted it out of the light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop it remained bright for some four or five minutes when it slowly faded and went out he placed it in the thin streak of daylight and its luminousness was almost immediately restored so far at least mr wace was able to verify the remarkable story of mr cave he has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light which had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre and in a perfect darkness such as could be produced by velvet wrapping the crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent it would seem however that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort and not equally visible to all eyes for mr harbinger whose name will be familiar to the scientific reader in connection with the pasteur institute was quite unable to see any light whatever and mr waces own capacity for its appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that of mr caves even with mr cave the power varied very considerably his vision was most vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue now from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a curious fascination upon mr cave and it says more for his loneliness of soul than a volume of pathetic writing could do that he told no human being of his curious observations he seems to have been living in such an atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would have been to risk the loss of it he found that as the dawn advanced and the amount of diffused light increased the crystal became to all appearance non luminous and for some time he was unable to see anything in it except at night time in dark corners of the shop but the use of an old velvet cloth which he used as a background for a collection of minerals occurred to him and by doubling this and putting it over his head and hands he was able to get a sight of the luminous movement within the crystal even in the day time he was very cautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife and he practised this occupation only in the afternoons while she was asleep upstairs and then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter and one day turning the crystal about in his hands he saw something it came and went like a flash but it gave him the impression that the object had for a moment opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange country and turning it about he did just as the light faded see the same vision again now it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of mr caves discovery from this point suffice that the effect was this the crystal being peered into at an angle of about degrees from the direction of the illuminating ray gave a clear and consistent picture of a wide and peculiar countryside it was not dream like at all it produced a definite impression of reality and the better the light the more real and solid it seemed it was a moving picture that is to say certain objects moved in it but slowly in an orderly manner like real things and according as the direction of the lighting and vision changed the picture changed also it must indeed have been like looking through an oval glass at a view and turning the glass about to get at different aspects mr caves statements mr wace assures me were extremely circumstantial and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that taints hallucinatory impressions but it must be remembered that all the efforts of mr wace to see any similar clarity in the faint opalescence of the crystal were wholly unsuccessful try as he would the difference in intensity of the impressions received by the two men was very great and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to mr cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to mr wace the view as mr cave described it was invariably of an extensive plain and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable height as if from a tower or a mast to the east and to the west the plain was bounded at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs which reminded him of those he had seen in some picture but what the picture was mr wace was unable to ascertain these cliffs passed north and south he could tell the points of the compass by the stars that were visible of a night receding in an almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the distance before they met he was nearer the eastern set of cliffs on the occasion of his first vision the sun was rising over them and black against the sunlight and pale against their shadow appeared a multitude of soaring forms that mr cave regarded as birds a vast range of buildings spread below him he seemed to be looking down upon them and as they approached the blurred and refracted edge of the picture they became indistinct there were also trees curious in shape and in colouring a deep mossy green and an exquisite gray beside a wide and shining canal and something great and brilliantly coloured flew across the picture but the first time mr cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes his hands shook his head moved the vision came and went and grew foggy and indistinct and at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the picture again once the direction of it was lost his next clear vision which came about a week after the first the interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful experience showed him the view down the length of the valley the view was different but he had a curious persuasion which his subsequent observations abundantly confirmed that he was regarding the strange world from exactly the same spot although he was looking in a different direction the long faade of the great building whose roof he had looked down upon before was now receding in perspective he recognised the roof in the front of the faade was a terrace of massive proportions and extraordinary length and down the middle of the terrace at certain intervals stood huge but very graceful masts bearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting sun the import of these small objects did not occur to mr cave until some time after as he was describing the scene to mr wace the terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful vegetation and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which certain broad creatures in form like beetles but enormously larger reposed beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone and beyond that and lined with dense red weeds and passing up the valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs was a broad and mirror like expanse of water the air seemed full of squadrons of great birds manuvring in stately curves and across the river was a multitude of splendid buildings richly coloured and glittering with metallic tracery and facets among a forest of moss like and lichenous trees and suddenly something flapped repeatedly across the vision like the fluttering of a jewelled fan or the beating of a wing and a face or rather the upper part of a face with very large eyes came as it were close to his own and as if on the other side of the crystal mr cave was so startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes that he drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it he had become so absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to find himself in the cool darkness of his little shop with its familiar odour of methyl mustiness and decay and as he blinked about him the glowing crystal faded and went out such were the first general impressions of mr cave the story is curiously direct and circumstantial from the outset when the valley first flashed momentarily on his senses his imagination was strangely affected and as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he saw his wonder rose to the point of a passion he went about his business listless and distraught thinking only of the time when he should be able to return to his watching and then a few weeks after his first sight of the valley came the two customers the stress and excitement of their offer and the narrow escape of the crystal from sale as i have already told now while the thing was mr caves secret it remained a mere wonder a thing to creep to covertly and peep at as a child might peep upon a forbidden garden but mr wace has for a young scientific investigator a particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind directly the crystal and its story came to him and he had satisfied himself by seeing the phosphorescence with his own eyes that there really was a certain evidence for mr caves statements he proceeded to develop the matter systematically mr cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes on this wonderland he saw and he came every night from half past eight until half past ten and sometimes in mr waces absence during the day on sunday afternoons also he came from the outset mr wace made copious notes and it was due to his scientific method that the relation between the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the orientation of the picture were proved and by covering the crystal in a box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray and by substituting black holland for his buff blinds he greatly improved the conditions of the observations so that in a little while they were able to survey the valley in any direction they desired so having cleared the way we may give a brief account of this visionary world within the crystal the things were in all cases seen by mr cave and the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal and report what he saw while mr wace who as a science student had learnt the trick of writing in the dark wrote a brief note of his report when the crystal faded it was put into its box in the proper position and the electric light turned on mr wace asked questions and suggested observations to clear up difficult points nothing indeed could have been less visionary and more matter of fact the attention of mr cave had been speedily directed to the bird like creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier visions his first impression was soon corrected and he considered for a time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat then he thought grotesquely enough that they might be cherubs their heads were round and curiously human and it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled him on his second observation they had broad silvery wings not feathered but glistening almost as brilliantly as new killed fish and with the same subtle play of colour and these wings were not built on the plan of bird wing or bat mr wace learned but supported by curved ribs radiating from the body a sort of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems best to express their appearance the body was small but fitted with two bunches of prehensile organs like long tentacles immediately under the mouth incredible as it appeared to mr wace the persuasion at last became irresistible that it was these creatures which owned the great quasi human buildings and the magnificent garden that made the broad valley so splendid and mr cave perceived that the buildings with other peculiarities had no doors but that the great circular windows which opened freely gave the creatures egress and entrance they would alight upon their tentacles fold their wings to a smallness almost rod like and hop into the interior but among them was a multitude of smaller winged creatures like great dragon flies and moths and flying beetles and across the greensward brilliantly coloured gigantic ground beetles crawled lazily to and fro moreover on the causeways and terraces large headed creatures similar to the greater winged flies but wingless were visible hopping busily upon their hand like tangle of tentacles allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that stood upon the terrace of the nearer building it dawned upon mr cave after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly vivid day that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like that into which he peered and a still more careful scrutiny convinced him that each one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one and folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the mast would regard the crystal fixedly for a space sometimes for as long as fifteen minutes and a series of observations made at the suggestion of mr wace convinced both watchers that so far as this visionary world was concerned the crystal into which they peered actually stood at the summit of the endmost mast on the terrace and that on one occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other world had looked into mr caves face while he was making these observations so much for the essential facts of this very singular story unless we dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of mr wace we have to believe one of two things either that mr caves crystal was in two worlds at once and that while it was carried about in one it remained stationary in the other which seems altogether absurd or else that it had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar crystal in this other world so that what was seen in the interior of the one in this world was under suitable conditions visible to an observer in the corresponding crystal in the other world and vice versa at present indeed we do not know of any way in which two crystals could so come en rapport but nowadays we know enough to understand that the thing is not altogether impossible this view of the crystals as en rapport was the supposition that occurred to mr wace and to me at least it seems extremely plausible and where was this other world on this also the alert intelligence of mr wace speedily threw light after sunset the sky darkened rapidly there was a very brief twilight interval indeed and the stars shone out they were recognisably the same as those we see arranged in the same constellations mr cave recognised the bear the pleiades aldebaran and sirius so that the other world must be somewhere in the solar system and at the utmost only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our own following up this clue mr wace learned that the midnight sky was a darker blue even than our midwinter sky and that the sun seemed a little smaller and there were two small moons like our moon but smaller and quite differently marked one of which moved so rapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it these moons were never high in the sky but vanished as they rose that is every time they revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near their primary planet and all this answers quite completely although mr cave did not know it to what must be the condition of things on mars indeed it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into this crystal mr cave did actually see the planet mars and its inhabitants and if that be the case then the evening star that shone so brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision was neither more nor less than our own familiar earth for a time the martians if they were martians do not seem to have known of mr caves inspection once or twice one would come to peer and go away very shortly to some other mast as though the vision was unsatisfactory during this time mr cave was able to watch the proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their attentions and although his report is necessarily vague and fragmentary it is nevertheless very suggestive imagine the impression of humanity a martian observer would get who after a difficult process of preparation and with considerable fatigue to the eyes was able to peer at london from the steeple of st martins church for stretches at longest of four minutes at a time mr cave was unable to ascertain if the winged martians were the same as the martians who hopped about the causeways and terraces and if the latter could put on wings at will he several times saw certain clumsy bipeds dimly suggestive of apes white and partially translucent feeding among certain of the lichenous trees and once some of these fled before one of the hopping round headed martians the latter caught one in its tentacles and then the picture faded suddenly and left mr cave most tantalisingly in the dark on another occasion a vast thing that mr cave thought at first was some gigantic insect appeared advancing along the causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity as this drew nearer mr cave perceived that it was a mechanism of shining metals and of extraordinary complexity and then when he looked again it had passed out of sight after a time mr wace aspired to attract the attention of the martians and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to the crystal mr cave cried out and sprang away and they immediately turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of signalling but when at last mr cave examined the crystal again the martian had departed thus far these observations had progressed in early november and then mr cave feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal were allayed began to take it to and fro with him in order that as occasion arose in the daytime or night he might comfort himself with what was fast becoming the most real thing in his existence in december mr waces work in connection with a forthcoming examination became heavy the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week and for ten or eleven days he is not quite sure which he saw nothing of cave he then grew anxious to resume these investigations and the stress of his seasonal labours being abated he went down to seven dials at the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fanciers window and then another at a cobblers mr caves shop was closed he rapped and the door was opened by the stepson in black he at once called mrs cave who was mr wace could not but observe in cheap but ample widows weeds of the most imposing pattern without any very great surprise mr wace learnt that cave was dead and already buried she was in tears and her voice was a little thick she had just returned from highgate her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects and the honourable details of the obsequies but mr wace was at last able to learn the particulars of caves death he had been found dead in his shop in the early morning the day after his last visit to mr wace and the crystal had been clasped in his stone cold hands his face was smiling said mrs cave and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at his feet he must have been dead five or six hours when he was found this came as a great shock to wace and he began to reproach himself bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old mans ill health but his chief thought was of the crystal he approached that topic in a gingerly manner because he knew mrs caves peculiarities he was dumbfounded to learn that it was sold mrs caves first impulse directly caves body had been taken upstairs had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for the crystal informing him of its recovery but after a violent hunt in which her daughter joined her they were convinced of the loss of his address as they were without the means required to mourn and bury cave in the elaborate style the dignity of an old seven dials inhabitant demands they had appealed to a friendly fellow tradesman in great portland street he had very kindly taken over a portion of the stock at a valuation the valuation was his own and the crystal egg was included in one of the lots mr wace after a few suitable condolences a little offhandedly proffered perhaps hurried at once to great portland street but there he learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall dark man in gray and there the material facts in this curious and to me at least very suggestive story come abruptly to an end the great portland street dealer did not know who the tall dark man in gray was nor had he observed him with sufficient attention to describe him minutely he did not even know which way this person had gone after leaving the shop for a time mr wace remained in the shop trying the dealers patience with hopeless questions venting his own exasperation and at last realising abruptly that the whole thing had passed out of his hands had vanished like a vision of the night he returned to his own rooms a little astonished to find the notes he had made still tangible and visible upon his untidy table his annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great he made a second call equally ineffectual upon the great portland street dealer and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were likely to come into the hands of a bric a brac collector he also wrote letters to the daily chronicle and nature but both those periodicals suspecting a hoax asked him to reconsider his action before they printed and he was advised that such a strange story unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence might imperil his reputation as an investigator moreover the calls of his proper work were urgent so that after a month or so save for an occasional reminder to certain dealers he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg and from that day to this it remains undiscovered occasionally however he tells me and i can quite believe him he has bursts of zeal in which he abandons his more urgent occupation and resumes the search whether or not it will remain lost for ever with the material and origin of it are things equally speculative at the present time if the present purchaser is a collector one would have expected the inquiries of mr wace to have reached him through the dealers he has been able to discover mr caves clergyman and oriental no other than the rev james parker and the young prince of bosso kuni in java i am obliged to them for certain particulars the object of the prince was simply curiosity and extravagance he was so eager to buy because cave was so oddly reluctant to sell it is just as possible that the buyer in the second instance was simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at all and the crystal egg for all i know may at the present moment be within a mile of me decorating a drawing room or serving as a paper weight its remarkable functions all unknown indeed it is partly with the idea of such a possibility that i have thrown this narrative into a form that will give it a chance of being read by the ordinary consumer of fiction my own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of mr wace i believe the crystal on the mast in mars and the crystal egg of mr caves to be in some physical but at present quite inexplicable way en rapport and we both believe further that the terrestrial crystal must have been possibly at some remote date sent hither from that planet in order to give the martians a near view of our affairs possibly the fellows to the crystals on the other masts are also on our globe no theory of hallucination suffices for the facts the man who could work miracles a pantoum in prose it is doubtful whether the gift was innate for my own part i think it came to him suddenly indeed until he was thirty he was a sceptic and did not believe in miraculous powers and here since it is the most convenient place i must mention that he was a little man and had eyes of a hot brown very erect red hair a moustache with ends that he twisted up and freckles his name was george mcwhirter fotheringay not the sort of name by any means to lead to any expectation of miracles and he was clerk at gomshotts he was greatly addicted to assertive argument it was while he was asserting the impossibility of miracles that he had his first intimation of his extraordinary powers this particular argument was being held in the bar of the long dragon and toddy beamish was conducting the opposition by a monotonous but effective so you say that drove mr fotheringay to the very limit of his patience there were present besides these two a very dusty cyclist landlord cox and miss maybridge the perfectly respectable and rather portly barmaid of the dragon miss maybridge was standing with her back to mr fotheringay washing glasses the others were watching him more or less amused by the present ineffectiveness of the assertive method goaded by the torres vedras tactics of mr beamish mr fotheringay determined to make an unusual rhetorical effort looky here mr beamish said mr fotheringay let us clearly understand what a miracle is its something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of will something what couldnt happen without being specially willed so you say said mr beamish repulsing him mr fotheringay appealed to the cyclist who had hitherto been a silent auditor and received his assent given with a hesitating cough and a glance at mr beamish the landlord would express no opinion and mr fotheringay returning to mr beamish received the unexpected concession of a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle for instance said mr fotheringay greatly encouraged here would be a miracle that lamp in the natural course of nature couldnt burn like that upsy down could it beamish you say it couldnt said beamish and you said fotheringay you dont mean to say eh no said beamish reluctantly no it couldnt very well said mr fotheringay then here comes some one as it might be me along here and stands as it might be here and says to that lamp as i might do collecting all my will turn upsy down without breaking and go on burning steady and hallo it was enough to make any one say hallo the impossible the incredible was visible to them all the lamp hung inverted in the air burning quietly with its flame pointing down it was as solid as indisputable as ever a lamp was the prosaic common lamp of the long dragon bar mr fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted brows of one anticipating a catastrophic smash the cyclist who was sitting next the lamp ducked and jumped across the bar everybody jumped more or less miss maybridge turned and screamed for nearly three seconds the lamp remained still a faint cry of mental distress came from mr fotheringay i cant keep it up he said any longer he staggered back and the inverted lamp suddenly flared fell against the corner of the bar bounced aside smashed upon the floor and went out it was lucky it had a metal receiver or the whole place would have been in a blaze mr cox was the first to speak and his remark shorn of needless excrescences was to the effect that fotheringay was a fool fotheringay was beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition as that he was astonished beyond measure at the thing that had occurred the subsequent conversation threw absolutely no light on the matter so far as fotheringay was concerned the general opinion not only followed mr cox very closely but very vehemently every one accused fotheringay of a silly trick and presented him to himself as a foolish destroyer of comfort and security his mind was in a tornado of perplexity he was himself inclined to agree with them and he made a remarkably ineffectual opposition to the proposal of his departure he went home flushed and heated coat collar crumpled eyes smarting and ears red he watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as he passed it it was only when he found himself alone in his little bedroom in church row that he was able to grapple seriously with his memories of the occurrence and ask what on earth happened he had removed his coat and boots and was sitting on the bed with his hands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for the seventeenth time i didnt want the confounded thing to upset when it occurred to him that at the precise moment he had said the commanding words he had inadvertently willed the thing he said and that when he had seen the lamp in the air he had felt that it depended on him to maintain it there without being clear how this was to be done he had not a particularly complex mind or he might have stuck for a time at that inadvertently willed embracing as it does the abstrusest problems of voluntary action but as it was the idea came to him with a quite acceptable haziness and from that following as i must admit no clear logical path he came to the test of experiment he pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind though he felt he did a foolish thing be raised up he said but in a second that feeling vanished the candle was raised hung in the air one giddy moment and as mr fotheringay gasped fell with a smash on his toilet table leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick for a time mr fotheringay sat in the darkness perfectly still it did happen after all he said and ow im to explain it i dont know he sighed heavily and began feeling in his pockets for a match he could find none and he rose and groped about the toilet table i wish i had a match he said he resorted to his coat and there was none there and then it dawned upon him that miracles were possible even with matches he extended a hand and scowled at it in the dark let there be a match in that hand he said he felt some light object fall across his palm and his fingers closed upon a match after several ineffectual attempts to light this he discovered it was a safety match he threw it down and then it occurred to him that he might have willed it lit he did and perceived it burning in the midst of his toilet table mat he caught it up hastily and it went out his perception of possibilities enlarged and he felt for and replaced the candle in its candlestick here you be lit said mr fotheringay and forthwith the candle was flaring and he saw a little black hole in the toilet cover with a wisp of smoke rising from it for a time he stared from this to the little flame and back and then looked up and met his own gaze in the looking glass by this help he communed with himself in silence for a time how about miracles now said mr fotheringay at last addressing his reflection the subsequent meditations of mr fotheringay were of a severe but confused description so far he could see it was a case of pure willing with him the nature of his experiences so far disinclined him for any further experiments at least until he had reconsidered them but he lifted a sheet of paper and turned a glass of water pink and then green and he created a snail which he miraculously annihilated and got himself a miraculous new tooth brush somewhere in the small hours he had reached the fact that his will power must be of a particularly rare and pungent quality a fact which he had indeed had inklings before but no certain assurance the scare and perplexity of his first discovery was now qualified by pride in this evidence of singularity and by vague intimations of advantage he became aware that the church clock was striking one and as it did not occur to him that his daily duties at gomshotts might be miraculously dispensed with he resumed undressing in order to get to bed without further delay as he struggled to get his shirt over his head he was struck with a brilliant idea let me be in bed he said and found himself so undressed he stipulated and finding the sheets cold added hastily and in my nightshirt no in a nice soft woollen nightshirt ah he said with immense enjoyment and now let me be comfortably asleep he awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through breakfast time wondering whether his overnight experience might not be a particularly vivid dream at length his mind turned again to cautious experiments for instance he had three eggs for breakfast two his landlady had supplied good but shoppy and one was a delicious fresh goose egg laid cooked and served by his extraordinary will he hurried off to gomshotts in a state of profound but carefully concealed excitement and only remembered the shell of the third egg when his landlady spoke of it that night all day he could do no work because of this astonishing new self knowledge but this caused him no inconvenience because he made up for it miraculously in his last ten minutes as the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation albeit the circumstances of his dismissal from the long dragon were still disagreeable to recall and a garbled account of the matter that had reached his colleagues led to some badinage it was evident he must be careful how he lifted frangible articles but in other ways his gift promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind he intended among other things to increase his personal property by unostentatious acts of creation he called into existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs and hastily annihilated them again as young gomshott came across the counting house to his desk he was afraid young gomshott might wonder how he had come by them he saw quite clearly the gift required caution and watchfulness in its exercise but so far as he could judge the difficulties attending its mastery would be no greater than those he had already faced in the study of cycling it was that analogy perhaps quite as much as the feeling that he would be unwelcome in the long dragon that drove him out after supper into the lane beyond the gasworks to rehearse a few miracles in private there was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts for apart from his will power mr fotheringay was not a very exceptional man the miracle of moses rod came to his mind but the night was dark and unfavourable to the proper control of large miraculous snakes then he recollected the story of tannhuser that he had read on the back of the philharmonic programme that seemed to him singularly attractive and harmless he stuck his walking stick a very nice poona penang lawyer into the turf that edged the footpath and commanded the dry wood to blossom the air was immediately full of the scent of roses and by means of a match he saw for himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed accomplished his satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps afraid of a premature discovery of his powers he addressed the blossoming stick hastily go back what he meant was change back but of course he was confused the stick receded at a considerable velocity and incontinently came a cry of anger and a bad word from the approaching person who are you throwing brambles at you fool cried a voice that got me on the shin im sorry old chap said mr fotheringay and then realising the awkward nature of the explanation caught nervously at his moustache he saw winch one of the three immering constables advancing what dyer mean by it asked the constable hallo its you is it the gent that broke the lamp at the long dragon i dont mean anything by it said mr fotheringay nothing at all what dyer do it for then oh bother said mr fotheringay bother indeed dyer know that stick hurt what dyer do it for eh for the moment mr fotheringay could not think what he had done it for his silence seemed to irritate mr winch youve been assaulting the police young man this time thats what you done look here mr winch said mr fotheringay annoyed and confused im sorry very the fact is well he could think of no way but the truth i was working a miracle he tried to speak in an offhand way but try as he would he couldnt working a ere dont you talk rot working a miracle indeed miracle well thats downright funny why yous the chap that dont believe in miracles fact is this is another of your silly conjuring tricks thats what this is now i tell you but mr fotheringay never heard what mr winch was going to tell him he realised he had given himself away flung his valuable secret to all the winds of heaven a violent gust of irritation swept him to action he turned on the constable swiftly and fiercely here he said ive had enough of this i have ill show you a silly conjuring trick i will go to hades go now he was alone mr fotheringay performed no more miracles that night nor did he trouble to see what had become of his flowering stick he returned to the town scared and very quiet and went to his bedroom lord he said its a powerful gift an extremely powerful gift i didnt hardly mean as much as that not really i wonder what hades is like he sat on the bed taking off his boots struck by a happy thought he transferred the constable to san francisco and without any more interference with normal causation went soberly to bed in the night he dreamt of the anger of winch the next day mr fotheringay heard two interesting items of news some one had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder mr gomshotts private house in the lullaborough road and the river as far as rawlings mill was to be dragged for constable winch mr fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day and performed no miracles except certain provisions for winch and the miracle of completing his days work with punctual perfection in spite of all the bee swarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind and the extraordinary abstraction and meekness of his manner was remarked by several people and made a matter for jesting for the most part he was thinking of winch on sunday evening he went to chapel and oddly enough mr maydig who took a certain interest in occult matters preached about things that are not lawful mr fotheringay was not a regular chapel goer but the system of assertive scepticism to which i have already alluded was now very much shaken the tenor of the sermon threw an entirely new light on these novel gifts and he suddenly decided to consult mr maydig immediately after the service so soon as that was determined he found himself wondering why he had not done so before mr maydig a lean excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists and neck was gratified at a request for a private conversation from a young man whose carelessness in religious matters was a subject for general remark in the town after a few necessary delays he conducted him to the study of the manse which was contiguous to the chapel seated him comfortably and standing in front of a cheerful fire his legs threw a rhodian arch of shadow on the opposite wall requested mr fotheringay to state his business at first mr fotheringay was a little abashed and found some difficulty in opening the matter you will scarcely believe me mr maydig i am afraid and so forth for some time he tried a question at last and asked mr maydig his opinion of miracles mr maydig was still saying well in an extremely judicial tone when mr fotheringay interrupted again you dont believe i suppose that some common sort of person like myself for instance as it might be sitting here now might have some sort of twist inside him that made him able to do things by his will its possible said mr maydig something of the sort perhaps is possible if i might make free with something here i think i might show you by a sort of experiment said mr fotheringay now take that tobacco jar on the table for instance what i want to know is whether what i am going to do with it is a miracle or not just half a minute mr maydig please he knitted his brows pointed to the tobacco jar and said be a bowl of vilets the tobacco jar did as it was ordered mr maydig started violently at the change and stood looking from the thaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers he said nothing presently he ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets they were fresh picked and very fine ones then he stared at mr fotheringay again how did you do that he asked mr fotheringay pulled his moustache just told it and there you are is that a miracle or is it black art or what is it and what do you thinks the matter with me thats what i want to ask its a most extraordinary occurrence and this day last week i knew no more that i could do things like that than you did it came quite sudden its something odd about my will i suppose and thats as far as i can see is that the only thing could you do other things besides that lord yes said mr fotheringay just anything he thought and suddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen here he pointed change into a bowl of fish no not that change into a glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it thats better you see that mr maydig its astonishing its incredible you are either a most extraordinary but no i could change it into anything said mr fotheringay just anything here be a pigeon will you in another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room and making mr maydig duck every time it came near him stop there will you said mr fotheringay and the pigeon hung motionless in the air i could change it back to a bowl of flowers he said and after replacing the pigeon on the table worked that miracle i expect you will want your pipe in a bit he said and restored the tobacco jar mr maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of ejaculatory silence he stared at mr fotheringay and in a very gingerly manner picked up the tobacco jar examined it replaced it on the table well was the only expression of his feelings now after that its easier to explain what i came about said mr fotheringay and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of his strange experiences beginning with the affair of the lamp in the long dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to winch as he went on the transient pride mr maydigs consternation had caused passed away he became the very ordinary mr fotheringay of everyday intercourse again mr maydig listened intently the tobacco jar in his hand and his bearing changed also with the course of the narrative presently while mr fotheringay was dealing with the miracle of the third egg the minister interrupted with a fluttering extended hand it is possible he said it is credible it is amazing of course but it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties the power to work miracles is a gift a peculiar quality like genius or second sight hitherto it has come very rarely and to exceptional people but in this case i have always wondered at the miracles of mahomet and at yogis miracles and the miracles of madame blavatsky but of course yes it is simply a gift it carries out so beautifully the arguments of that great thinker mr maydigs voice sank his grace the duke of argyll here we plumb some profounder law deeper than the ordinary laws of nature yes yes go on go on mr fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with winch and mr maydig no longer overawed or scared began to jerk his limbs about and interject astonishment its this what troubled me most proceeded mr fotheringay its this im most mijitly in want of advice for of course hes at san francisco wherever san francisco may be but of course its awkward for both of us as youll see mr maydig i dont see how he can understand what has happened and i dare say hes scared and exasperated something tremendous and trying to get at me i dare say he keeps on starting off to come here i send him back by a miracle every few hours when i think of it and of course thats a thing he wont be able to understand and its bound to annoy him and of course if he takes a ticket every time it will cost him a lot of money i done the best i could for him but of course its difficult for him to put himself in my place i thought afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched you know if hades is all its supposed to be before i shifted him in that case i suppose theyd have locked him up in san francisco of course i willed him a new suit of clothes on him directly i thought of it but you see im already in a deuce of a tangle mr maydig looked serious i see you are in a tangle yes its a difficult position how you are to end it he became diffuse and inconclusive however well leave winch for a little and discuss the larger question i dont think this is a case of the black art or anything of the sort i dont think there is any taint of criminality about it at all mr fotheringay none whatever unless you are suppressing material facts no its miracles pure miracles miracles if i may say so of the very highest class he began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate while mr fotheringay sat with his arm on the table and his head on his arm looking worried i dont see how im to manage about winch he said a gift of working miracles apparently a very powerful gift said mr maydig will find a way about winch never fear my dear sir you are a most important man a man of the most astonishing possibilities as evidence for example and in other ways the things you may do yes ive thought of a thing or two said mr fotheringay but some of the things came a bit twisty you saw that fish at first wrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish and i thought id ask some one a proper course said mr maydig a very proper course altogether the proper course he stopped and looked at mr fotheringay its practically an unlimited gift let us test your powers for instance if they really are if they really are all they seem to be and so incredible as it may seem in the study of the little house behind the congregational chapel on the evening of sunday nov mr fotheringay egged on and inspired by mr maydig began to work miracles the readers attention is specially and definitely called to the date he will object probably has already objected that certain points in this story are improbable that if any things of the sort already described had indeed occurred they would have been in all the papers at that time the details immediately following he will find particularly hard to accept because among other things they involve the conclusion that he or she the reader in question must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented manner more than a year ago now a miracle is nothing if not improbable and as a matter of fact the reader was killed in a violent and unprecedented manner in in the subsequent course of this story that will become perfectly clear and credible as every right minded and reasonable reader will admit but this is not the place for the end of the story being but little beyond the hither side of the middle and at first the miracles worked by mr fotheringay were timid little miracles little things with the cups and parlour fitments as feeble as the miracles of theosophists and feeble as they were they were received with awe by his collaborator he would have preferred to settle the winch business out of hand but mr maydig would not let him but after they had worked a dozen of these domestic trivialities their sense of power grew their imagination began to show signs of stimulation and their ambition enlarged their first larger enterprise was due to hunger and the negligence of mrs minchin mr maydigs housekeeper the meal to which the minister conducted mr fotheringay was certainly ill laid and uninviting as refreshment for two industrious miracle workers but they were seated and mr maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in anger upon his housekeepers shortcomings before it occurred to mr fotheringay that an opportunity lay before him dont you think mr maydig he said if it isnt a liberty i my dear mr fotheringay of course no i didnt think mr fotheringay waved his hand what shall we have he said in a large inclusive spirit and at mr maydigs order revised the supper very thoroughly as for me he said eyeing mr maydigs selection i am always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a nice welsh rarebit and ill order that i aint much given to burgundy and forthwith stout and welsh rarebit promptly appeared at his command they sat long at their supper talking like equals as mr fotheringay presently perceived with a glow of surprise and gratification of all the miracles they would presently do and by the by mr maydig said mr fotheringay i might perhaps be able to help you in a domestic way dont quite follow said mr maydig pouring out a glass of miraculous old burgundy mr fotheringay helped himself to a second welsh rarebit out of vacancy and took a mouthful i was thinking he said i might be able chum chum to work chum chum a miracle with mrs minchin chum chum make her a better woman mr maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful shes she strongly objects to interference you know mr fotheringay and as a matter of fact its well past eleven and shes probably in bed and asleep do you think on the whole mr fotheringay considered these objections i dont see that it shouldnt be done in her sleep for a time mr maydig opposed the idea and then he yielded mr fotheringay issued his orders and a little less at their ease perhaps the two gentlemen proceeded with their repast mr maydig was enlarging on the changes he might expect in his housekeeper next day with an optimism that seemed even to mr fotheringays supper senses a little forced and hectic when a series of confused noises from upstairs began their eyes exchanged interrogations and mr maydig left the room hastily mr fotheringay heard him calling up to his housekeeper and then his footsteps going softly up to her in a minute or so the minister returned his step light his face radiant wonderful he said and touching most touching he began pacing the hearthrug a repentance a most touching repentance through the crack of the door poor woman a most wonderful change she had got up she must have got up at once she had got up out of her sleep to smash a private bottle of brandy in her box and to confess it too but this gives us it opens a most amazing vista of possibilities if we can work this miraculous change in her the things unlimited seemingly said mr fotheringay and about mr winch altogether unlimited and from the hearthrug mr maydig waving the winch difficulty aside unfolded a series of wonderful proposals proposals he invented as he went along now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of this story suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite benevolence the sort of benevolence that used to be called post prandial suffice it too that the problem of winch remained unsolved nor is it necessary to describe how far that series got to its fulfilment there were astonishing changes the small hours found mr maydig and mr fotheringay careering across the chilly market square under the still moon in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy mr maydig all flap and gesture mr fotheringay short and bristling and no longer abashed at his greatness they had reformed every drunkard in the parliamentary division changed all the beer and alcohol to water mr maydig had overruled mr fotheringay on this point they had further greatly improved the railway communication of the place drained flinders swamp improved the soil of one tree hill and cured the vicars wart and they were going to see what could be done with the injured pier at south bridge the place gasped mr maydig wont be the same place to morrow how surprised and thankful every one will be and just at that moment the church clock struck three i say said mr fotheringay thats three oclock i must be getting back ive got to be at business by eight and besides mrs wimms were only beginning said mr maydig full of the sweetness of unlimited power were only beginning think of all the good were doing when people wake but said mr fotheringay mr maydig gripped his arm suddenly his eyes were bright and wild my dear chap he said theres no hurry look he pointed to the moon at the zenith joshua joshua said mr fotheringay joshua said mr maydig why not stop it mr fotheringay looked at the moon thats a bit tall he said after a pause why not said mr maydig of course it doesnt stop you stop the rotation of the earth you know time stops it isnt as if we were doing harm hm said mr fotheringay well he sighed ill try here he buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable globe with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power jest stop rotating will you said mr fotheringay incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at the rate of dozens of miles a minute in spite of the innumerable circles he was describing per second he thought for thought is wonderful sometimes as sluggish as flowing pitch sometimes as instantaneous as light he thought in a second and willed let me come down safe and sound whatever else happens let me down safe and sound he willed it only just in time for his clothes heated by his rapid flight through the air were already beginning to singe he came down with a forcible but by no means injurious bump in what appeared to be a mound of fresh turned earth a large mass of metal and masonry extraordinarily like the clock tower in the middle of the market square hit the earth near him ricochetted over him and flew into stonework bricks and cement like a bursting bomb a hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks and smashed like an egg there was a crash that made all the most violent crashes of his past life seem like the sound of falling dust and this was followed by a descending series of lesser crashes a vast wind roared throughout earth and heaven so that he could scarcely lift his head to look for a while he was too breathless and astonished even to see where he was or what had happened and his first movement was to feel his head and reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own lord gasped mr fotheringay scarce able to speak for the gale ive had a squeak whats gone wrong storms and thunder and only a minute ago a fine night its maydig set me on to this sort of thing what a wind if i go on fooling in this way im bound to have a thundering accident wheres maydig what a confounded mess everythings in he looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit the appearance of things was really extremely strange the skys all right anyhow said mr fotheringay and thats about all that is all right and even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up and even theres the moon overhead just as it was just now bright as midday but as for the rest wheres the village wheres wheres any thing and what on earth set this wind a blowing i didnt order no wind mr fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain and after one failure remained on all fours holding on he surveyed the moonlit world to leeward with the tails of his jacket streaming over his head theres something seriously wrong said mr fotheringay and what it is goodness knows far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the haze of dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses of earth and heaps of inchoate ruins no trees no houses no familiar shapes only a wilderness of disorder vanishing at last into the darkness beneath the whirling columns and streamers the lightnings and thunderings of a swiftly rising storm near him in the livid glare was something that might once have been an elm tree a smashed mass of splinters shivered from boughs to base and further a twisted mass of iron girders only too evidently the viaduct rose out of the piled confusion you see when mr fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the solid globe he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling movables upon its surface and the earth spins so fast that the surface at its equator is travelling at rather more than a thousand miles an hour and in these latitudes at more than half that pace so that the village and mr maydig and mr fotheringay and everybody and everything had been jerked violently forward at about nine miles per second that is to say much more violently than if they had been fired out of a cannon and every human being every living creature every house and every tree all the world as we know it had been so jerked and smashed and utterly destroyed that was all these things mr fotheringay did not of course fully appreciate but he perceived that his miracle had miscarried and with that a great disgust of miracles came upon him he was in darkness now for the clouds had swept together and blotted out his momentary glimpse of the moon and the air was full of fitful struggling tortured wraiths of hail a great roaring of wind and waters filled earth and sky and peering under his hand through the dust and sleet to windward he saw by the play of the lightnings a vast wall of water pouring towards him maydig screamed mr fotheringays feeble voice amid the elemental uproar here maydig stop cried mr fotheringay to the advancing water oh for goodness sake stop just a moment said mr fotheringay to the lightnings and thunder stop jest a moment while i collect my thoughts and now what shall i do he said what shall i do lord i wish maydig was about i know said mr fotheringay and for goodness sake lets have it right this time he remained on all fours leaning against the wind very intent to have everything right ah he said let nothing what im going to order happen until i say off lord i wish id thought of that before he lifted his little voice against the whirlwind shouting louder and louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak now then here goes mind about that what i said just now in the first place when all ive got to say is done let me lose my miraculous power let my will become just like anybody elses will and all these dangerous miracles be stopped i dont like them id rather i didnt work em ever so much thats the first thing and the second is let me be back just before the miracles begin let everything be just as it was before that blessed lamp turned up its a big job but its the last have you got it no more miracles everything as it was me back in the long dragon just before i drank my half pint thats it yes he dug his fingers into the mould closed his eyes and said off everything became perfectly still he perceived that he was standing erect so you say said a voice he opened his eyes he was in the bar of the long dragon arguing about miracles with toddy beamish he had a vague sense of some great thing forgotten that instantaneously passed you see that except for the loss of his miraculous powers everything was back as it had been his mind and memory therefore were now just as they had been at the time when this story began so that he knew absolutely nothing of all that is told here knows nothing of all that is told here to this day and among other things of course he still did not believe in miracles i tell you that miracles properly speaking cant possibly happen he said whatever you like to hold and im prepared to prove it up to the hilt thats what you think said toddy beamish and prove it if you can looky here mr beamish said mr fotheringay let us clearly understand what a miracle is its something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of will a dream of armageddon the man with the white face entered the carriage at rugby he moved slowly in spite of the urgency of his porter and even while he was still on the platform i noted how ill he seemed he dropped into the corner over against me with a sigh made an incomplete attempt to arrange his travelling shawl and became motionless with his eyes staring vacantly presently he was moved by a sense of my observation looked up at me and put out a spiritless hand for his newspaper then he glanced again in my direction i feigned to read i feared i had unwittingly embarrassed him and in a moment i was surprised to find him speaking i beg your pardon said i that book he repeated pointing a lean finger is about dreams obviously i answered for it was fortnum roscoes dream states and the title was on the cover he hung silent for a space as if he sought words yes he said at last but they tell you nothing i did not catch his meaning for a second they dont know he added i looked a little more attentively at his face there are dreams he said and dreams that sort of proposition i never dispute i suppose he hesitated do you ever dream i mean vividly i dream very little i answered i doubt if i have three vivid dreams in a year ah he said and seemed for a moment to collect his thoughts your dreams dont mix with your memories he asked abruptly you dont find yourself in doubt did this happen or did it not hardly ever except just for a momentary hesitation now and then i suppose few people do does he say he indicated the book says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation about intensity of impression and the like to account for its not happening as a rule i suppose you know something of these theories very little except that they are wrong his emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a time i prepared to resume reading and that seemed to precipitate his next remark he leant forward almost as though he would touch me isnt there something called consecutive dreaming that goes on night after night i believe there is there are cases given in most books on mental trouble mental trouble yes i dare say there are its the right place for them but what i mean he looked at his bony knuckles is that sort of thing always dreaming is it dreaming or is it something else mightnt it be something else i should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the drawn anxiety of his face i remember now the look of his faded eyes and the lids red stained perhaps you know that look im not just arguing about a matter of opinion he said the things killing me dreams if you call them dreams night after night vivid so vivid this he indicated the landscape that went streaming by the window seems unreal in comparison i can scarcely remember who i am what business i am on he paused even now the dream is always the same do you mean i asked its over you mean i died died smashed and killed and now so much of me as that dream was is dead dead for ever i dreamt i was another man you know living in a different part of the world and in a different time i dreamt that night after night night after night i woke into that other life fresh scenes and fresh happenings until i came upon the last when you died when i died and since then no he said thank god that was the end of the dream it was clear i was in for this dream and after all i had an hour before me the light was fading fast and fortnum roscoe has a dreary way with him living in a different time i said do you mean in some different age yes past no to come to come the year three thousand for example i dont know what year it was i did when i was asleep when i was dreaming that is but not now not now that i am awake theres a lot of things i have forgotten since i woke out of these dreams though i knew them at the time when i was i suppose it was dreaming they called the year differently from our way of calling the year what did they call it he put his hand to his forehead no said he i forget he sat smiling weakly for a moment i feared he did not mean to tell me his dream as a rule i hate people who tell their dreams but this struck me differently i proffered assistance even it began i suggested it was vivid from the first i seemed to wake up in it suddenly and its curious that in these dreams i am speaking of i never remembered this life i am living now it seemed as if the dream life was enough while it lasted perhaps but i will tell you how i find myself when i do my best to recall it all i dont remember anything clearly until i found myself sitting in a sort of loggia looking out over the sea i had been dozing and suddenly i woke up fresh and vivid not a bit dreamlike because the girl had stopped fanning me the girl yes the girl you must not interrupt or you will put me out he stopped abruptly you wont think im mad he said no i answered youve been dreaming tell me your dream i woke up i say because the girl had stopped fanning me i was not surprised to find myself there or anything of that sort you understand i did not feel i had fallen into it suddenly i simply took it up at that point whatever memory i had of this life this nineteenth century life faded as i woke vanished like a dream i knew all about myself knew that my name was no longer cooper but hedon and all about my position in the world ive forgotten a lot since i woke theres a want of connection but it was all quite clear and matter of fact then he hesitated again gripping the window strap putting his face forward and looking up to me appealingly this seems bosh to you no no i cried go on tell me what this loggia was like it was not really a loggia i dont know what to call it it faced south it was small it was all in shadow except the semicircle above the balcony that showed the sky and sea and the corner where the girl stood i was on a couch it was a metal couch with light striped cushions and the girl was leaning over the balcony with her back to me the light of the sunrise fell on her ear and cheek her pretty white neck and the little curls that nestled there and her white shoulder were in the sun and all the grace of her body was in the cool blue shadow she was dressed how can i describe it it was easy and flowing and altogether there she stood so that it came to me how beautiful and desirable she was as though i had never seen her before and when at last i sighed and raised myself upon my arm she turned her face to me he stopped i have lived three and fifty years in this world i have had mother sisters friends wife and daughters all their faces the play of their faces i know but the face of this girl it is much more real to me i can bring it back into memory so that i see it again i could draw it or paint it and after all he stopped but i said nothing the face of a dream the face of a dream she was beautiful not that beauty which is terrible cold and worshipful like the beauty of a saint nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions but a sort of radiation sweet lips that softened into smiles and grave gray eyes and she moved gracefully she seemed to have part with all pleasant and gracious things he stopped and his face was downcast and hidden then he looked up at me and went on making no further attempt to disguise his absolute belief in the reality of his story you see i had thrown up my plans and ambitions thrown up all i had ever worked for or desired for her sake i had been a master man away there in the north with influence and property and a great reputation but none of it had seemed worth having beside her i had come to the place this city of sunny pleasures with her and left all those things to wreck and ruin just to save a remnant at least of my life while i had been in love with her before i knew that she had any care for me before i had imagined that she would dare that we should dare all my life had seemed vain and hollow dust and ashes it was dust and ashes night after night and through the long days i had longed and desired my soul had beaten against the thing forbidden but it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things its emotion its a tint a light that comes and goes only while its there everything changes everything the thing is i came away and left them in their crisis to do what they could left whom i asked puzzled the people up in the north there you see in this dream anyhow i had been a big man the sort of man men come to trust in to group themselves about millions of men who had never seen me were ready to do things and risk things because of their confidence in me i had been playing that game for years that big laborious game that vague monstrous political game amidst intrigues and betrayals speech and agitation it was a vast weltering world and at last i had a sort of leadership against the gang you know it was called the gang a sort of compromise of scoundrelly projects and base ambitions and vast public emotional stupidities and catch words the gang that kept the world noisy and blind year by year and all the while that it was drifting drifting towards infinite disaster but i cant expect you to understand the shades and complications of the year the year something or other ahead i had it all down to the smallest details in my dream i suppose i had been dreaming of it before i awoke and the fading outline of some queer new development i had imagined still hung about me as i rubbed my eyes it was some grubby affair that made me thank god for the sunlight i sat up on the couch and remained looking at the woman and rejoicing rejoicing that i had come away out of all that tumult and folly and violence before it was too late after all i thought this is life love and beauty desire and delight are they not worth all those dismal struggles for vague gigantic ends and i blamed myself for having ever sought to be a leader when i might have given my days to love but then thought i if i had not spent my early days sternly and austerely i might have wasted myself upon vain and worthless women and at the thought all my being went out in love and tenderness to my dear mistress my dear lady who had come at last and compelled me compelled me by her invincible charm for me to lay that life aside you are worth it i said speaking without intending her to hear you are worth it my dearest one worth pride and praise and all things love to have you is worth them all together and at the murmur of my voice she turned about come and see she cried i can hear her now come and see the sunrise upon monte solaro i remember how i sprang to my feet and joined her at the balcony she put a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed towards great masses of limestone flushing as it were into life i looked but first i noted the sunlight on her face caressing the lines of her cheeks and neck how can i describe to you the scene we had before us we were at capri i have been there i said i have clambered up monte solaro and drunk vero capri muddy stuff like cider at the summit ah said the man with the white face then perhaps you can tell me you will know if this was indeed capri for in this life i have never been there let me describe it we were in a little room one of a vast multitude of little rooms very cool and sunny hollowed out of the limestone of a sort of cape very high above the sea the whole island you know was one enormous hotel complex beyond explaining and on the other side there were miles of floating hotels and huge floating stages to which the flying machines came they called it a pleasure city of course there was none of that in your time rather i should say is none of that now of course now yes well this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape so that one could see east and west eastward was a great cliff a thousand feet high perhaps coldly gray except for one bright edge of gold and beyond it the isle of the sirens and a falling coast that faded and passed into the hot sunrise and when one turned to the west distinct and near was a little bay a little beach still in shadow and out of that shadow rose solaro straight and tall flushed and golden crested like a beauty throned and the white moon was floating behind her in the sky and before us from east to west stretched the many tinted sea all dotted with little sailing boats to the eastward of course these little boats were gray and very minute and clear but to the westward they were little boats of gold shining gold almost like little flames and just below us was a rock with an arch worn through it the blue sea water broke to green and foam all round the rock and a galley came gliding out of the arch i know that rock i said i was nearly drowned there it is called the faraglioni faraglioni yes she called it that answered the man with the white face there was some story but that he put his hand to his forehead again no he said i forget that story well that is the first thing i remember the first dream i had that little shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that dear lady of mine with her shining arms and her graceful robe and how we sat and talked in half whispers to one another we talked in whispers not because there was any one to hear but because there was still such a freshness of mind between us that our thoughts were a little frightened i think to find themselves at last in words and so they went softly presently we were hungry and we went from our apartment going by a strange passage with a moving floor until we came to the great breakfast room there was a fountain and music a pleasant and joyful place it was with its sunlight and splashing and the murmur of plucked strings and we sat and ate and smiled at one another and i would not heed a man who was watching me from a table near by and afterwards we went on to the dancing hall but i cannot describe that hall the place was enormous larger than any building you have ever seen and in one place there was the old gate of capri caught into the wall of a gallery high overhead light girders stems and threads of gold burst from the pillars like fountains streamed like an aurora across the roof and interlaced like like conjuring tricks all about the great circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures strange dragons and intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights the place was inundated with artificial light that shamed the newborn day and as we went through the throng the people turned about and looked at us for all through the world my name and face were known and how i had suddenly thrown up pride and struggle to come to this place and they looked also at the lady beside me though half the story of how at last she had come to me was unknown or mistold and few of the men who were there i know but judged me a happy man in spite of all the shame and dishonour that had come upon my name the air was full of music full of harmonious scents full of the rhythm of beautiful motions thousands of beautiful people swarmed about the hall crowded the galleries sat in a myriad recesses they were dressed in splendid colours and crowned with flowers thousands danced about the great circle beneath the white images of the ancient gods and glorious processions of youths and maidens came and went we two danced not the dreary monotonies of your days of this time i mean but dances that were beautiful intoxicating and even now i can see my lady dancing dancing joyously she danced you know with a serious face she danced with a serious dignity and yet she was smiling at me and caressing me smiling and caressing with her eyes the music was different he murmured it went i cannot describe it but it was infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has ever come to me awake and then it was when we had done dancing a man came to speak to me he was a lean resolute man very soberly clad for that place and already i had marked his face watching me in the breakfasting hall and afterwards as we went along the passage i had avoided his eye but now as we sat in a little alcove smiling at the pleasure of all the people who went to and fro across the shining floor he came and touched me and spoke to me so that i was forced to listen and he asked that he might speak to me for a little time apart no i said i have no secrets from this lady what do you want to tell me he said it was a trivial matter or at least a dry matter for a lady to hear perhaps for me to hear said i he glanced at her as though almost he would appeal to her then he asked me suddenly if i had heard of a great and avenging declaration that gresham had made now gresham had always before been the man next to myself in the leadership of that great party in the north he was a forcible hard and tactless man and only i had been able to control and soften him it was on his account even more than my own i think that the others had been so dismayed at my retreat so this question about what he had done re awakened my old interest in the life i had put aside just for a moment i have taken no heed of any news for many days i said what has gresham been saying and with that the man began nothing loath and i must confess even i was struck by greshams reckless folly in the wild and threatening words he had used and this messenger they had sent to me not only told me of greshams speech but went on to ask counsel and to point out what need they had of me while he talked my lady sat a little forward and watched his face and mine my old habits of scheming and organising reasserted themselves i could even see myself suddenly returning to the north and all the dramatic effect of it all that this man said witnessed to the disorder of the party indeed but not to its damage i should go back stronger than i had come and then i thought of my lady you see how can i tell you there were certain peculiarities of our relationship as things are i need not tell about that which would render her presence with me impossible i should have had to leave her indeed i should have had to renounce her clearly and openly if i was to do all that i could do in the north and the man knew that even as he talked to her and me knew it as well as she did that my steps to duty were first separation then abandonment at the touch of that thought my dream of a return was shattered i turned on the man suddenly as he was imagining his eloquence was gaining ground with me what have i to do with these things now i said i have done with them do you think i am coquetting with your people in coming here no he said but why cannot you leave me alone i have done with these things i have ceased to be anything but a private man yes he answered but have you thought this talk of war these reckless challenges these wild aggressions i stood up no i cried i wont hear you i took count of all those things i weighed them and i have come away he seemed to consider the possibility of persistence he looked from me to where the lady sat regarding us war he said as if he were speaking to himself and then turned slowly from me and walked away i stood caught in the whirl of thoughts his appeal had set going i heard my ladys voice dear she said but if they have need of you she did not finish her sentence she let it rest there i turned to her sweet face and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled they want me only to do the thing they dare not do themselves i said if they distrust gresham they must settle with him themselves she looked at me doubtfully but war she said i saw a doubt on her face that i had seen before a doubt of herself and me the first shadow of the discovery that seen strongly and completely must drive us apart for ever now i was an older mind than hers and i could sway her to this belief or that my dear one i said you must not trouble over these things there will be no war certainly there will be no war the age of wars is past trust me to know the justice of this case they have no right upon me dearest and no one has a right upon me i have been free to choose my life and i have chosen this but war she said i sat down beside her i put an arm behind her and took her hand in mine i set myself to drive that doubt away i set myself to fill her mind with pleasant things again i lied to her and in lying to her i lied also to myself and she was only too ready to believe me only too ready to forget very soon the shadow had gone again and we were hastening to our bathing place in the grotta del bovo marino where it was our custom to bathe every day we swam and splashed one another and in that buoyant water i seemed to become something lighter and stronger than a man and at last we came out dripping and rejoicing and raced among the rocks and then i put on a dry bathing dress and we sat to bask in the sun and presently i nodded resting my head against her knee and she put her hand upon my hair and stroked it softly and i dozed and behold as it were with the snapping of the string of a violin i was awakening and i was in my own bed in liverpool in the life of to day only for a time i could not believe that all these vivid moments had been no more than the substance of a dream in truth i could not believe it a dream for all the sobering reality of things about me i bathed and dressed as it were by habit and as i shaved i argued why i of all men should leave the woman i loved to go back to fantastic politics in the hard and strenuous north even if gresham did force the world back to war what was that to me i was a man with the heart of a man and why should i feel the responsibility of a deity for the way the world might go you know that is not quite the way i think about affairs about my real affairs i am a solicitor you know with a point of view the vision was so real you must understand so utterly unlike a dream that i kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details even the ornament of a book cover that lay on my wifes sewing machine in the breakfast room recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that ran about the seat in the alcove where i had talked with the messenger from my deserted party have you ever heard of a dream that had a quality like that like so that afterwards you remembered little details you had forgotten i thought i had never noticed the point before but he was right never i said that is what you never seem to do with dreams no he answered but that is just what i did i am a solicitor you must understand in liverpool and i could not help wondering what the clients and business people i found myself talking to in my office would think if i told them suddenly i was in love with a girl who would be born a couple of hundred years or so hence and worried about the politics of my great great great grandchildren i was chiefly busy that day negotiating a ninety nine year building lease it was a private builder in a hurry and we wanted to tie him in every possible way i had an interview with him and he showed a certain want of temper that sent me to bed still irritated that night i had no dream nor did i dream the next night at least to remember something of that intense reality of conviction vanished i began to feel sure it was a dream and then it came again when the dream came again nearly four days later it was very different i think it certain that four days had also elapsed in the dream many things had happened in the north and the shadow of them was back again between us and this time it was not so easily dispelled i began i know with moody musings why in spite of all should i go back go back for all the rest of my days to toil and stress insults and perpetual dissatisfaction simply to save hundreds of millions of common people whom i did not love whom too often i could not do other than despise from the stress and anguish of war and infinite misrule and after all i might fail they all sought their own narrow ends and why should not i why should not i also live as a man and out of such thoughts her voice summoned me and i lifted my eyes i found myself awake and walking we had come out above the pleasure city we were near the summit of monte solaro and looking towards the bay it was the late afternoon and very clear far away to the left ischia hung in a golden haze between sea and sky and naples was coldly white against the hills and before us was vesuvius with a tall and slender streamer feathering at last towards the south and the ruins of torre dell annunziata and castellammare glittering and near i interrupted suddenly you have been to capri of course only in this dream he said only in this dream all across the bay beyond sorrento were the floating palaces of the pleasure city moored and chained and northward were the broad floating stages that received the aeroplanes aeroplanes fell out of the sky every afternoon each bringing its thousands of pleasure seekers from the uttermost parts of the earth to capri and its delights all these things i say stretched below but we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual sight that evening had to show five war aeroplanes that had long slumbered useless in the distant arsenals of the rhine mouth were manuvring now in the eastward sky gresham had astonished the world by producing them and others and sending them to circle here and there it was the threat material in the great game of bluff he was playing and it had taken even me by surprise he was one of those incredibly stupid energetic people who seem sent by heaven to create disasters his energy to the first glance seemed so wonderfully like capacity but he had no imagination no invention only a stupid vast driving force of will and a mad faith in his stupid idiot luck to pull him through i remember how we stood out upon the headland watching the squadron circling far away and how i weighed the full meaning of the sight seeing clearly the way things must go and even then it was not too late i might have gone back i think and saved the world the people of the north would follow me i knew granted only that in one thing i respected their moral standards the east and south would trust me as they would trust no other northern man and i knew i had only to put it to her and she would have let me go not because she did not love me only i did not want to go my will was all the other way about i had so newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility i was still so fresh a renegade from duty that the daylight clearness of what i ought to do had no power at all to touch my will my will was to live to gather pleasures and make my dear lady happy but though this sense of vast neglected duties had no power to draw me it could make me silent and preoccupied it robbed the days i had spent of half their brightness and roused me into dark meditations in the silence of the night and as i stood and watched greshams aeroplanes sweep to and fro those birds of infinite ill omen she stood beside me watching me perceiving the trouble indeed but not perceiving it clearly her eyes questioning my face her expression shaded with perplexity her face was gray because the sunset was fading out of the sky it was no fault of hers that she held me she had asked me to go from her and again in the night time and with tears she had asked me to go at last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood i turned upon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes no she said as if i jarred with her gravity but i was resolved to end that gravity and made her run no one can be very gray and sad who is out of breath and when she stumbled i ran with my hand beneath her arm we ran down past a couple of men who turned back staring in astonishment at my behaviour they must have recognised my face and half way down the slope came a tumult in the air clang clank clang clank and we stopped and presently over the hill crest those war things came flying one behind the other the man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description what were they like i asked they had never fought he said they were just like our ironclads are nowadays they had never fought no one knew what they might do with excited men inside them few even cared to speculate they were great driving things shaped like spear heads without a shaft with a propeller in the place of the shaft steel not steel aluminium no no nothing of that sort an alloy that was very common as common as brass for example it was called let me see he squeezed his forehead with the fingers of one hand i am forgetting everything he said and they carried guns little guns firing high explosive shells they fired the guns backwards out of the base of the leaf so to speak and rammed with the beak that was the theory you know but they had never been fought no one could tell exactly what was going to happen and meanwhile i suppose it was very fine to go whirling through the air like a flight of young swallows swift and easy i guess the captains tried not to think too clearly what the real thing would be like and these flying war machines you know were only one sort of the endless war contrivances that had been invented and had fallen into abeyance during the long peace there were all sorts of these things that people were routing out and furbishing up infernal things silly things things that had never been tried big engines terrible explosives great guns you know the silly way of these ingenious sort of men who make these things they turn em out as beavers build dams and with no more sense of the rivers theyre going to divert and the lands theyre going to flood as we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again in the twilight i foresaw it all i saw how clearly and inevitably things were driving for war in greshams silly violent hands and i had some inkling of what war was bound to be under these new conditions and even then though i knew it was drawing near the limit of my opportunity i could find no will to go back he sighed that was my last chance we did not go into the city until the sky was full of stars so we walked out upon the high terrace to and fro and she counselled me to go back my dearest she said and her sweet face looked up to me this is death this life you lead is death go back to them go back to your duty she began to weep saying between her sobs and clinging to my arm as she said it go back go back then suddenly she fell mute and glancing down at her face i read in an instant the thing she had thought to do it was one of those moments when one sees no i said no she asked in surprise and i think a little fearful at the answer to her thought nothing i said shall send me back nothing i have chosen love i have chosen and the world must go whatever happens i will live this life i will live for you it nothing shall turn me aside nothing my dear one even if you died even if you died yes she murmured softly then i also would die and before she could speak again i began to talk talking eloquently as i could do in that life talking to exalt love to make the life we were living seem heroic and glorious and the thing i was deserting something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine thing to set aside i bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it seeking not only to convert her but myself to that we talked and she clung to me torn too between all that she deemed noble and all that she knew was sweet and at last i did make it heroic made all the thickening disaster of the world only a sort of glorious setting to our unparalleled love and we two poor foolish souls strutted there at last clad in that splendid delusion drunken rather with that glorious delusion under the still stars and so my moment passed it was my last chance even as we went to and fro there the leaders of the south and east were gathering their resolve and the hot answer that shattered greshams bluffing for ever took shape and waited and all over asia and the ocean and the south the air and the wires were throbbing with their warnings to prepare prepare no one living you know knew what war was no one could imagine with all these new inventions what horror war might bring i believe most people still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and shouting charges and triumphs and flags and bands in a time when half the world drew its food supply from regions ten thousand miles away the man with the white face paused i glanced at him and his face was intent on the floor of the carriage a little railway station a string of loaded trucks a signal box and the back of a cottage shot by the carriage window and a bridge passed with a clap of noise echoing the tumult of the train after that he said i dreamt often for three weeks of nights that dream was my life and the worst of it was there were nights when i could not dream when i lay tossing on a bed in this accursed life and there somewhere lost to me things were happening momentous terrible things i lived at nights my days my waking days this life i am living now became a faded far away dream a drab setting the cover of the book he thought i could tell you all tell you every little thing in the dream but as to what i did in the daytime no i could not tell i do not remember my memory my memory has gone the business of life slips from me he leant forward and pressed his hands upon his eyes for a long time he said nothing and then said i the war burst like a hurricane he stared before him at unspeakable things and then i urged again one touch of unreality he said in the low tone of a man who speaks to himself and they would have been nightmares but they were not nightmares they were not nightmares no he was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a danger of losing the rest of the story but he went on talking again in the same tone of questioning self communion what was there to do but flight i had not thought the war would touch capri i had seemed to see capri as being out of it all as the contrast to it all but two nights after the whole place was shouting and bawling every woman almost and every other man wore a badge greshams badge and there was no music but a jangling war song over and over again and everywhere men enlisting and in the dancing halls they were drilling the whole island was a whirl with rumours it was said again and again that fighting had begun i had not expected this i had seen so little of the life of pleasure that i had failed to reckon with this violence of the amateurs and as for me i was out of it i was like a man who might have prevented the firing of a magazine the time had gone i was no one the vainest stripling with a badge counted for more than i the crowd jostled us and bawled in our ears that accursed song deafened us a woman shrieked at my lady because no badge was on her and we two went back to our own place again ruffled and insulted my lady white and silent and i a quiver with rage so furious was i i could have quarrelled with her if i could have found one shade of accusation in her eyes all my magnificence had gone from me i walked up and down our rock cell and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward that flared and passed and came again we must get out of this place i said over and over i have made my choice and i will have no hand in these troubles i will have nothing of this war we have taken our lives out of all these things this is no refuge for us let us go and the next day we were already in flight from the war that covered the world and all the rest was flight all the rest was flight he mused darkly how much was there of it he made no answer how many days his face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched he took no heed of my curiosity i tried to draw him back to his story with questions where did you go i said when when you left capri south west he said and glanced at me for a second we went in a boat but i should have thought an aeroplane they had been seized i questioned him no more presently i thought he was beginning again he broke out in an argumentative monotone but why should it be if indeed this battle this slaughter and stress is life why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty if there is no refuge if there is no place of peace and if all our dreams of quiet places are a folly and a snare why have we such dreams surely it was no ignoble cravings no base intentions had brought us to this it was love had isolated us love had come to me with her eyes and robed in her beauty more glorious than all else in life in the very shape and colour of life and summoned me away i had silenced all the voices i had answered all the questions i had come to her and suddenly there was nothing but war and death i had an inspiration after all i said it could have been only a dream a dream he cried flaming upon me a dream when even now for the first time he became animated a faint flush crept into his cheek he raised his open hand and clenched it and dropped it to his knee he spoke looking away from me and for all the rest of the time he looked away we are but phantoms he said and the phantoms of phantoms desires like cloud shadows and wills of straw that eddy in the wind the days pass use and wont carry us through as a train carries the shadow of its lights so be it but one thing is real and certain one thing is no dream stuff but eternal and enduring it is the centre of my life and all other things about it are subordinate or altogether vain i loved her that woman of a dream and she and i are dead together a dream how can it be a dream when it drenched a living life with unappeasable sorrow when it makes all that i have lived for and cared for worthless and unmeaning until that very moment when she was killed i believe we had still a chance of getting away he said all through the night and morning that we sailed across the sea from capri to salerno we talked of escape we were full of hope and it clung about us to the end hope for the life together we should lead out of it all out of the battle and struggle the wild and empty passions the empty arbitrary thou shalt and thou shalt not of the world we were uplifted as though our quest was a holy thing as though love for one another was a mission even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock capri already scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and hiding places that were to make it a fastness we reckoned nothing of the imminent slaughter though the fury of preparation hung about in puffs and clouds of dust at a hundred points amidst the gray but indeed i made a text of that and talked there you know was the rock still beautiful for all its scars with its countless windows and arches and ways tier upon tier for a thousand feet a vast carving of gray broken by vine clad terraces and lemon and orange groves and masses of agave and prickly pear and puffs of almond blossom and out under the archway that is built over the piccola marina other boats were coming and as we came round the cape and within sight of the mainland another little string of boats came into view driving before the wind towards the south west in a little while a multitude had come out the remoter just little specks of ultramarine in the shadow of the eastward cliff it is love and reason i said fleeing from all this madness of war and though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying across the southern sky we did not heed it there it was a line of little dots in the sky and then more dotting the south eastern horizon and then still more until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue specks now they were all thin little strokes of blue and now one and now a multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes of light they came rising and falling and growing larger like some huge flight of gulls or rooks or such like birds moving with a marvellous uniformity and ever as they drew nearer they spread over a greater width of sky the southward wing flung itself in an arrow headed cloud athwart the sun and then suddenly they swept round to the eastward and streamed eastward growing smaller and smaller and clearer and clearer again until they vanished from the sky and after that we noted to the northward and very high greshams fighting machines hanging high over naples like an evening swarm of gnats it seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of birds even the mutter of guns far away in the south east seemed to us to signify nothing each day each dream after that we were still exalted still seeking that refuge where we might live and love fatigue had come upon us pain and many distresses for though we were dusty and stained by our toilsome tramping and half starved and with the horror of the dead men we had seen and the flight of the peasants for very soon a gust of fighting swept up the peninsula with these things haunting our minds it still resulted only in a deepening resolution to escape oh but she was brave and patient she who had never faced hardship and exposure had courage for herself and me we went to and fro seeking an outlet over a country all commandeered and ransacked by the gathering hosts of war always we went on foot at first there were other fugitives but we did not mingle with them some escaped northward some were caught in the torrent of peasantry that swept along the main roads many gave themselves into the hands of the soldiery and were sent northward many of the men were impressed but we kept away from these things we had brought no money to bribe a passage north and i feared for my lady at the hands of these conscript crowds we had landed at salerno and we had been turned back from cava and we had tried to cross towards taranto by a pass over mount alburno but we had been driven back for want of food and so we had come down among the marshes by pstum where those great temples stand alone i had some vague idea that by pstum it might be possible to find a boat or something and take once more to sea and there it was the battle overtook us a sort of soul blindness had me plainly i could see that we were being hemmed in that the great net of that giant warfare had us in its toils many times we had seen the levies that had come down from the north going to and fro and had come upon them in the distance amidst the mountains making ways for the ammunition and preparing the mounting of the guns once we fancied they had fired at us taking us for spies at any rate a shot had gone shuddering over us several times we had hidden in woods from hovering aeroplanes but all these things do not matter now these nights of flight and pain we were in an open place near those great temples at pstum at last on a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes empty and desolate and so flat that a grove of eucalyptus far away showed to the feet of its stems how i can see it my lady was sitting down under a bush resting a little for she was very weak and weary and i was standing up watching to see if i could tell the distance of the firing that came and went they were still you know fighting far from each other with these terrible new weapons that had never before been used guns that would carry beyond sight and aeroplanes that would do what they would do no man could foretell i knew that we were between the two armies and that they drew together i knew we were in danger and that we could not stop there and rest though all those things were in my mind they were in the background they seemed to be affairs beyond our concern chiefly i was thinking of my lady an aching distress filled me for the first time she had owned herself beaten and had fallen a weeping behind me i could hear her sobbing but i would not turn round to her because i knew she had need of weeping and had held herself so far and so long for me it was well i thought that she would weep and rest and then we would toil on again for i had no inkling of the thing that hung so near even now i can see her as she sat there her lovely hair upon her shoulder can mark again the deepening hollow of her cheek if we had parted she said if i had let you go no said i even now i do not repent i will not repent i made my choice and i will hold on to the end and then overhead in the sky flashed something and burst and all about us i heard the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly thrown they chipped the stones about us and whirled fragments from the bricks and passed he put his hand to his mouth and then moistened his lips at the flash i had turned about you know she stood up she stood up you know and moved a step towards me as though she wanted to reach me and she had been shot through the heart he stopped and stared at me i felt all that foolish incapacity an englishman feels on such occasions i met his eyes for a moment and then stared out of the window for a long space we kept silence when at last i looked at him he was sitting back in his corner his arms folded and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles he bit his nail suddenly and stared at it i carried her he said towards the temples in my arms as though it mattered i dont know why they seemed a sort of sanctuary you know they had lasted so long i suppose she must have died almost instantly only i talked to her all the way silence again i have seen those temples i said abruptly and indeed he had brought those still sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me it was the brown one the big brown one i sat down on a fallen pillar and held her in my arms silent after the first babble was over and after a little while the lizards came out and ran about again as though nothing unusual was going on as though nothing had changed it was tremendously still there the sun high and the shadows still even the shadows of the weeds upon the entablature were still in spite of the thudding and banging that went all about the sky i seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the south and that the battle went away to the west one aeroplane was struck and overset and fell i remember that though it didnt interest me in the least it didnt seem to signify it was like a wounded gull you know flapping for a time in the water i could see it down the aisle of the temple a black thing in the bright blue water three or four times shells burst about the beach and then that ceased each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for a space that was all the mischief done except that once a stray bullet gashed the stone hard by made just a fresh bright surface as the shadows grew longer the stillness seemed greater the curious thing he remarked with the manner of a man who makes a trivial conversation is that i didnt think i didnt think at all i sat with her in my arms amidst the stones in a sort of lethargy stagnant and i dont remember waking up i dont remember dressing that day i know i found myself in my office with my letters all slit open in front of me and how i was struck by the absurdity of being there seeing that in reality i was sitting stunned in that pstum temple with a dead woman in my arms i read my letters like a machine i have forgotten what they were about he stopped and there was a long silence suddenly i perceived that we were running down the incline from chalk farm to euston i started at this passing of time i turned on him with a brutal question with the tone of now or never and did you dream again yes he seemed to force himself to finish his voice was very low once more and as it were only for a few instants i seemed to have suddenly awakened out of a great apathy to have risen into a sitting position and the body lay there on the stones beside me a gaunt body not her you know so soon it was not her i may have heard voices i do not know only i knew clearly that men were coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage i stood up and walked through the temple and there came into sight first one man with a yellow face dressed in a uniform of dirty white trimmed with blue and then several climbing to the crest of the old wall of the vanished city and crouching there they were little bright figures in the sunlight and there they hung weapon in hand peering cautiously before them and further away i saw others and then more at another point in the wall it was a long lax line of men in open order presently the man i had first seen stood up and shouted a command and his men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds towards the temple he scrambled down with them and led them he came facing towards me and when he saw me he stopped at first i had watched these men with a mere curiosity but when i had seen they meant to come to the temple i was moved to forbid them i shouted to the officer you must not come here i cried i am here i am here with my dead he stared and then shouted a question back to me in some unknown tongue i repeated what i had said he shouted again and i folded my arms and stood still presently he spoke to his men and came forward he carried a drawn sword i signed to him to keep away but he continued to advance i told him again very patiently and clearly you must not come here these are old temples and i am here with my dead presently he was so close i could see his face clearly it was a narrow face with dull gray eyes and a black moustache he had a scar on his upper lip and he was dirty and unshaven he kept shouting unintelligible things questions perhaps at me i know now that he was afraid of me but at the time that did not occur to me as i tried to explain to him he interrupted me in imperious tones bidding me i suppose stand aside he made to go past me and i caught hold of him i saw his face change at my grip you fool i cried dont you know she is dead he started back he looked at me with cruel eyes i saw a sort of exultant resolve leap into them delight then suddenly with a scowl he swept his sword back so and thrust he stopped abruptly i became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train the brakes lifted their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked this present world insisted upon itself became clamorous i saw through the steamy window huge electric lights glaring down from tall masts upon a fog saw rows of stationary empty carriages passing by and then a signal box hoisting its constellation of green and red into the murky london twilight marched after them i looked again at his drawn features he ran me through the heart it was with a sort of astonishment no fear no pain but just amazement that i felt it pierce me felt the sword drive home into my body it didnt hurt you know it didnt hurt at all the yellow platform lights came into the field of view passing first rapidly then slowly and at last stopping with a jerk dim shapes of men passed to and fro without euston cried a voice do you mean there was no pain no sting or smart amazement and then darkness sweeping over everything the hot brutal face before me the face of the man who had killed me seemed to recede it swept out of existence euston clamoured the voices outside euston the carriage door opened admitting a flood of sound and a porter stood regarding us the sounds of doors slamming and the hoof clatter of cab horses and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the london cobble stones came to my ears a truck load of lighted lamps blazed along the platform a darkness a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out all things any luggage sir said the porter and that was the end i asked he seemed to hesitate then almost inaudibly he answered no you mean i couldnt get to her she was there on the other side of the temple and then yes i insisted yes nightmares he cried nightmares indeed my god great birds that fought and tore the new accelerator certainly if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a pin it is my good friend professor gibberne i have heard before of investigators overshooting the mark but never quite to the extent that he has done he has really this time at any rate without any touch of exaggeration in the phrase found something to revolutionise human life and that when he was simply seeking an all round nervous stimulant to bring languid people up to the stresses of these pushful days i have tasted the stuff now several times and i cannot do better than describe the effect the thing had on me that there are astonishing experiences in store for all in search of new sensations will become apparent enough professor gibberne as many people know is my neighbour in folkestone unless my memory plays me a trick his portrait at various ages has already appeared in the strand magazine i think late in but i am unable to look it up because i have lent that volume to some one who has never sent it back the reader may perhaps recall the high forehead and the singularly long black eyebrows that give such a mephistophelian touch to his face he occupies one of those pleasant little detached houses in the mixed style that make the western end of the upper sandgate road so interesting his is the one with the flemish gables and the moorish portico and it is in the little room with the mullioned bay window that he works when he is down here and in which of an evening we have so often smoked and talked together he is a mighty jester but besides he likes to talk to me about his work he is one of those men who find a help and stimulus in talking and so i have been able to follow the conception of the new accelerator right up from a very early stage of course the greater portion of his experimental work is not done in folkestone but in gower street in the fine new laboratory next to the hospital that he has been the first to use as every one knows or at least as all intelligent people know the special department in which gibberne has gained so great and deserved a reputation among physiologists is the action of drugs upon the nervous system upon soporifics sedatives and ansthetics he is i am told unequalled he is also a chemist of considerable eminence and i suppose in the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that centres about the ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little cleared places of his making little glades of illumination that until he sees fit to publish his results are still inaccessible to every other living man and in the last few years he has been particularly assiduous upon this question of nervous stimulants and already before the discovery of the new accelerator very successful with them medical science has to thank him for at least three distinct and absolutely safe invigorators of unrivalled value to practising men in cases of exhaustion the preparation known as gibbernes b syrup has i suppose saved more lives already than any lifeboat round the coast but none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet he told me nearly a year ago either they increase the central energy without affecting the nerves or they simply increase the available energy by lowering the nervous conductivity and all of them are unequal and local in their operation one wakes up the heart and viscera and leaves the brain stupefied one gets at the brain champagne fashion and does nothing good for the solar plexus and what i want and what if its an earthly possibility i mean to have is a stimulant that stimulates all round that wakes you up for a time from the crown of your head to the tip of your great toe and makes you go two or even three to everybody elses one eh thats the thing im after it would tire a man i said not a doubt of it and youd eat double or treble and all that but just think what the thing would mean imagine yourself with a little phial like this he held up a little bottle of green glass and marked his points with it and in this precious phial is the power to think twice as fast move twice as quickly do twice as much work in a given time as you could otherwise do but is such a thing possible i believe so if it isnt ive wasted my time for a year these various preparations of the hypophosphites for example seem to show that something of the sort even if it was only one and a half times as fast it would do it would do i said if you were a statesman in a corner for example time rushing up against you something urgent to be done eh he could dose his private secretary i said and gain double time and think if you for example wanted to finish a book usually i said i wish id never begun em or a doctor driven to death wants to sit down and think out a case or a barrister or a man cramming for an examination worth a guinea a drop said i and more to men like that and in a duel again said gibberne where it all depends on your quickness in pulling the trigger or in fencing i echoed you see said gibberne if i get it as an all round thing it will really do you no harm at all except perhaps to an infinitesimal degree it brings you nearer old age you will just have lived twice to other peoples once i suppose i meditated in a duel it would be fair thats a question for the seconds said gibberne i harked back further and you really think such a thing is possible i said as possible said gibberne and glanced at something that went throbbing by the window as a motor bus as a matter of fact he paused and smiled at me deeply and tapped slowly on the edge of his desk with the green phial i think i know the stuff already ive got something coming the nervous smile upon his face betrayed the gravity of his revelation he rarely talked of his actual experimental work unless things were very near the end and it may be it may be i shouldnt be surprised it may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice it will be rather a big thing i hazarded it will be i think rather a big thing but i dont think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be for all that i remember we had several talks about the stuff after that the new accelerator he called it and his tone about it grew more confident on each occasion sometimes he talked nervously of unexpected physiological results its use might have and then he would get a little unhappy at others he was frankly mercenary and we debated long and anxiously how the preparation might be turned to commercial account its a good thing said gibberne a tremendous thing i know im giving the world something and i think it only reasonable we should expect the world to pay the dignity of science is all very well but i think somehow i must have the monopoly of the stuff for say ten years i dont see why all the fun in life should go to the dealers in ham my own interest in the coming drug certainly did not wane in the time i have always had a queer little twist towards metaphysics in my mind i have always been given to paradoxes about space and time and it seemed to me that gibberne was really preparing no less than the absolute acceleration of life suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a preparation he would live an active and record life indeed but he would be an adult at eleven middle aged at twenty five and by thirty well on the road to senile decay it seemed to me that so far gibberne was only going to do for any one who took his drug exactly what nature has done for the jews and orientals who are men in their teens and aged by fifty and quicker in thought and act than we are all the time the marvel of drugs has always been great to my mind you can madden a man calm a man make him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log quicken this passion and allay that all by means of drugs and here was a new miracle to be added to this strange armoury of phials the doctors use but gibberne was far too eager upon his technical points to enter very keenly into my aspect of the question it was the th or th of august when he told me the distillation that would decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we talked and it was on the th that he told me the thing was done and the new accelerator a tangible reality in the world i met him as i was going up the sandgate hill towards folkestone i think i was going to get my hair cut and he came hurrying down to meet me i suppose he was coming to my house to tell me at once of his success i remember that his eyes were unusually bright and his face flushed and i noted even then the swift alacrity of his step its done he cried and gripped my hand speaking very fast its more than done come up to my house and see really really he shouted incredibly come up and see and it does twice it does more much more it scares me come up and see the stuff taste it try it its the most amazing stuff on earth he gripped my arm and walking at such a pace that he forced me into a trot went shouting with me up the hill a whole char banc full of people turned and stared at us in unison after the manner of people in chars banc it was one of those hot clear days that folkestone sees so much of every colour incredibly bright and every outline hard there was a breeze of course but not so much breeze as sufficed under these conditions to keep me cool and dry i panted for mercy im not walking fast am i cried gibberne and slackened his pace to a quick march youve been taking some of this stuff i puffed no he said at the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker from which i had washed out the last traces of the stuff i took some last night you know but that is ancient history now and it goes twice i said nearing his doorway in a grateful perspiration it goes a thousand times many thousand times cried gibberne with a dramatic gesture flinging open his early english carved oak gate phew said i and followed him to the door i dont know how many times it goes he said with his latch key in his hand and you it throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology it kicks the theory of vision into a perfectly new shape heaven knows how many thousand times well try all that after the thing is to try the stuff now try the stuff i said as we went along the passage rather said gibberne turning on me in his study there it is in that little green phial there unless you happen to be afraid i am a careful man by nature and only theoretically adventurous i was afraid but on the other hand there is pride well i haggled you say youve tried it ive tried it he said and i dont look hurt by it do i i dont even look livery and i feel i sat down give me the potion i said if the worst comes to the worst it will save having my hair cut and that i think is one of the most hateful duties of a civilised man how do you take the mixture with water said gibberne whacking down a carafe he stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy chair his manner was suddenly affected by a touch of the harley street specialist its rum stuff you know he said i made a gesture with my hand i must warn you in the first place as soon as youve got it down to shut your eyes and open them very cautiously in a minute or sos time one still sees the sense of vision is a question of length of vibration and not of multitude of impacts but theres a kind of shock to the retina a nasty giddy confusion just at the time if the eyes are open keep em shut shut i said good and the next thing is keep still dont begin to whack about you may fetch something a nasty rap if you do remember you will be going several thousand times faster than you ever did before heart lungs muscles brain everything and you will hit hard without knowing it you wont know it you know youll feel just as you do now only everything in the world will seem to be going ever so many thousand times slower than it ever went before thats what makes it so deuced queer lor i said and you mean youll see said he and took up a little measure he glanced at the material on his desk glasses he said water all here mustnt take too much for the first attempt the little phial glucked out its precious contents dont forget what i told you he said turning the contents of the measure into a glass in the manner of an italian waiter measuring whisky sit with the eyes tightly shut and in absolute stillness for two minutes he said then you will hear me speak he added an inch or so of water to the little dose in each glass by the by he said dont put your glass down keep it in your hand and rest your hand on your knee yes so and now he raised his glass the new accelerator i said the new accelerator he answered and we touched glasses and drank and instantly i closed my eyes you know that blank non existence into which one drops when one has taken gas for an indefinite interval it was like that then i heard gibberne telling me to wake up and i stirred and opened my eyes there he stood as he had been standing glass still in hand it was empty that was all the difference well said i nothing out of the way nothing a slight feeling of exhilaration perhaps nothing more sounds things are still i said by jove yes they are still except the sort of faint pat patter like rain falling on different things what is it analysed sounds i think he said but i am not sure he glanced at the window have you ever seen a curtain before a window fixed in that way before i followed his eyes and there was the end of the curtain frozen as it were corner high in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze no said i thats odd and here he said and opened the hand that held the glass naturally i winced expecting the glass to smash but so far from smashing it did not even seem to stir it hung in mid air motionless roughly speaking said gibberne an object in these latitudes falls feet in the first second this glass is falling feet in a second now only you see it hasnt been falling yet for the hundredth part of a second that gives you some idea of the pace of my accelerator and he waved his hand round and round over and under the slowly sinking glass finally he took it by the bottom pulled it down and placed it very carefully on the table eh he said to me and laughed that seems all right i said and began very gingerly to raise myself from my chair i felt perfectly well very light and comfortable and quite confident in my mind i was going fast all over my heart for example was beating a thousand times a second but that caused me no discomfort at all i looked out of the window an immovable cyclist head down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his driving wheel scorched to overtake a galloping char banc that did not stir i gaped in amazement at this incredible spectacle gibberne i cried how long will this confounded stuff last heaven knows he answered last time i took it i went to bed and slept it off i tell you i was frightened it must have lasted some minutes i think it seemed like hours but after a bit it slows down rather suddenly i believe i was proud to observe that i did not feel frightened i suppose because there were two of us why shouldnt we go out i asked why not theyll see us not they goodness no why we shall be going a thousand times faster than the quickest conjuring trick that was ever done come along which way shall we go window or door and out by the window we went assuredly of all the strange experiences that i have ever had or imagined or read of other people having or imagining that little raid i made with gibberne on the folkestone leas under the influence of the new accelerator was the strangest and maddest of all we went out by his gate into the road and there we made a minute examination of the statuesque passing traffic the tops of the wheels and some of the legs of the horses of this char banc the end of the whip lash and the lower jaw of the conductor who was just beginning to yawn were perceptibly in motion but all the rest of the lumbering conveyance seemed still and quite noiseless except for a faint rattling that came from one mans throat and as parts of this frozen edifice there were a driver you know and a conductor and eleven people the effect as we walked about the thing began by being madly queer and ended by being disagreeable there they were people like ourselves and yet not like ourselves frozen in careless attitudes caught in mid gesture a girl and a man smiled at one another a leering smile that threatened to last for evermore a woman in a floppy capelline rested her arm on the rail and stared at gibbernes house with the unwinking stare of eternity a man stroked his moustache like a figure of wax and another stretched a tiresome stiff hand with extended fingers towards his loosened hat we stared at them we laughed at them we made faces at them and then a sort of disgust of them came upon us and we turned away and walked round in front of the cyclist towards the leas goodness cried gibberne suddenly look there he pointed and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down the air with wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an exceptionally languid snail was a bee and so we came out upon the leas there the thing seemed madder than ever the band was playing in the upper stand though all the sound it made for us was a low pitched wheezy rattle a sort of prolonged last sigh that passed at times into a sound like the slow muffled ticking of some monstrous clock frozen people stood erect strange silent self conscious looking dummies hung unstably in mid stride promenading upon the grass i passed close to a little poodle dog suspended in the act of leaping and watched the slow movement of his legs as he sank to earth lord look here cried gibberne and we halted for a moment before a magnificent person in white faint striped flannels white shoes and a panama hat who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed ladies he had passed a wink studied with such leisurely deliberation as we could afford is an unattractive thing it loses any quality of alert gaiety and one remarks that the winking eye does not completely close that under its drooping lid appears the lower edge of an eyeball and a little line of white heaven give me memory said i and i will never wink again or smile said gibberne with his eye on the ladys answering teeth its infernally hot somehow said i lets go slower oh come along said gibberne we picked our way among the bath chairs in the path many of the people sitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive poses but the contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful thing to see a purple faced little gentleman was frozen in the midst of a violent struggle to refold his newspaper against the wind there were many evidences that all these people in their sluggish way were exposed to a considerable breeze a breeze that had no existence so far as our sensations went we came out and walked a little way from the crowd and turned and regarded it to see all that multitude changed to a picture smitten rigid as it were into the semblance of realistic wax was impossibly wonderful it was absurd of course but it filled me with an irrational an exultant sense of superior advantage consider the wonder of it all that i had said and thought and done since the stuff had begun to work in my veins had happened so far as those people so far as the world in general went in the twinkling of an eye the new accelerator i began but gibberne interrupted me theres that infernal old woman he said what old woman lives next door to me said gibberne has a lapdog that yaps gods the temptation is strong there is something very boyish and impulsive about gibberne at times before i could expostulate with him he had dashed forward snatched the unfortunate animal out of visible existence and was running violently with it towards the cliff of the leas it was most extraordinary the little brute you know didnt bark or wriggle or make the slightest sign of vitality it kept quite stiffly in an attitude of somnolent repose and gibberne held it by the neck it was like running about with a dog of wood gibberne i cried put it down then i said something else if you run like that gibberne i cried youll set your clothes on fire your linen trousers are going brown as it is he clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge gibberne i cried coming up put it down this heat is too much its our running so two or three miles a second friction of the air what he said glancing at the dog friction of the air i shouted friction of the air going too fast like meteorites and things too hot and gibberne gibberne im all over pricking and a sort of perspiration you can see people stirring slightly i believe the stuffs working off put that dog down eh he said its working off i repeated were too hot and the stuffs working off im wet through he stared at me then at the band the wheezy rattle of whose performance was certainly going faster then with a tremendous sweep of the arm he hurled the dog away from him and it went spinning upward still inanimate and hung at last over the grouped parasols of a knot of chattering people gibberne was gripping my elbow by jove he cried i believe it is a sort of hot pricking and yes that mans moving his pocket handkerchief perceptibly we must get out of this sharp but we could not get out of it sharply enough luckily perhaps for we might have run and if we had run we should i believe have burst into flames almost certainly we should have burst into flames you know we had neither of us thought of that but before we could even begin to run the action of the drug had ceased it was the business of a minute fraction of a second the effect of the new accelerator passed like the drawing of a curtain vanished in the movement of a hand i heard gibbernes voice in infinite alarm sit down he said and flop down upon the turf at the edge of the leas i sat scorching as i sat there is a patch of burnt grass there still where i sat down the whole stagnation seemed to wake up as i did so the disarticulated vibration of the band rushed together into a blast of music the promenaders put their feet down and walked their ways the papers and flags began flapping smiles passed into words the winker finished his wink and went on his way complacently and all the seated people moved and spoke the whole world had come alive again was going as fast as we were or rather we were going no faster than the rest of the world it was like slowing down as one comes into a railway station everything seemed to spin round for a second or two i had the most transient feeling of nausea and that was all and the little dog which had seemed to hang for a moment when the force of gibbernes arm was expended fell with a swift acceleration clean through a ladys parasol that was the saving of us unless it was for one corpulent old gentleman in a bath chair who certainly did start at the sight of us and afterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye and finally i believe said something to his nurse about us i doubt if a solitary person remarked our sudden appearance among them plop we must have appeared abruptly we ceased to smoulder almost at once though the turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot the attention of every one including even the amusements association band which on this occasion for the only time in its history got out of tune was arrested by the amazing fact and the still more amazing yapping and uproar caused by the fact that a respectable over fed lapdog sleeping quietly to the east of the bandstand should suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the west in a slightly singed condition due to the extreme velocity of its movements through the air in these absurd days too when we are all trying to be as psychic and silly and superstitious as possible people got up and trod on other people chairs were overturned the leas policeman ran how the matter settled itself i do not know we were much too anxious to disentangle ourselves from the affair and get out of range of the eye of the old gentleman in the bath chair to make minute inquiries as soon as we were sufficiently cool and sufficiently recovered from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to do so we stood up and skirting the crowd directed our steps back along the road below the metropole towards gibbernes house but amidst the din i heard very distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting beside the lady of the ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threats and language to one of those chair attendants who had inspector written on their caps if you didnt throw the dog he said who did the sudden return of movement and familiar noises and our natural anxiety about ourselves our clothes were still dreadfully hot and the fronts of the thighs of gibbernes white trousers were scorched a drabbish brown prevented the minute observations i should have liked to make on all these things indeed i really made no observations of any scientific value on that return the bee of course had gone i looked for that cyclist but he was already out of sight as we came into the upper sandgate road or hidden from us by traffic the char banc however with its people now all alive and stirring was clattering along at a spanking pace almost abreast of the nearer church we noted however that the window sill on which we had stepped in getting out of the house was slightly singed and that the impressions of our feet on the gravel on the path were unusually deep so it was i had my first experience of the new accelerator practically we had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of things in the space of a second or so of time we had lived half an hour while the band had played perhaps two bars but the effect it had upon us was that the whole world had stopped for our convenient inspection considering all things and particularly considering our rashness in venturing out of the house the experience might certainly have been much more disagreeable than it was it showed no doubt that gibberne has still much to learn before his preparation is a manageable convenience but its practicability it certainly demonstrated beyond all cavil since that adventure he has been steadily bringing its use under control and i have several times and without the slightest bad result taken measured doses under his direction though i must confess i have not yet ventured abroad again while under its influence i may mention for example that this story has been written at one sitting and without interruption except for the nibbling of some chocolate by its means i began at and my watch is now very nearly at the minute past the half hour the convenience of securing a long uninterrupted spell of work in the midst of a day full of engagements cannot be exaggerated gibberne is now working at the quantitative handling of his preparation with especial reference to its distinctive effects upon different types of constitution he then hopes to find a retarder with which to dilute its present rather excessive potency the retarder will of course have the reverse effect to the accelerator used alone it should enable the patient to spread a few seconds over many hours of ordinary time and so to maintain an apathetic inaction a glacier like absence of alacrity amidst the most animated or irritating surroundings the two things together must necessarily work an entire revolution in civilised existence it is the beginning of our escape from that time garment of which carlyle speaks while this accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our utmost sense and vigour the retarder will enable us to pass in passive tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium perhaps i am a little optimistic about the retarder which has indeed still to be discovered but about the accelerator there is no possible sort of doubt whatever its appearance upon the market in a convenient controllable and assimilable form is a matter of the next few months it will be obtainable of all chemists and druggists in small green bottles at a high but considering its extraordinary qualities by no means excessive price gibbernes nervous accelerator it will be called and he hopes to be able to supply it in three strengths one in one in and one in distinguished by yellow pink and white labels respectively no doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary things possible for of course the most remarkable and possibly even criminal proceedings may be effected with impunity by thus dodging as it were into the interstices of time like all potent preparations it will be liable to abuse we have however discussed this aspect of the question very thoroughly and we have decided that this is purely a matter of medical jurisprudence and altogether outside our province we shall manufacture and sell the accelerator and as for the consequences we shall see the door in the wall i one confidential evening not three months ago lionel wallace told me this story of the door in the wall and at the time i thought that so far as he was concerned it was a true story he told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that i could not do otherwise than believe in him but in the morning in my own flat i woke to a different atmosphere and as i lay in bed and recalled the things he had told me stripped of the glamour of his earnest slow voice denuded of the focused shaded table light the shadowy atmosphere that wrapped about him and me and the pleasant bright things the dessert and glasses and napery of the dinner we had shared making them for the time a bright little world quite cut off from everyday realities i saw it all as frankly incredible he was mystifying i said and then how well he did it it isnt quite the thing i should have expected him of all people to do well afterwards as i sat up in bed and sipped my morning tea i found myself trying to account for the flavour of reality that perplexed me in his impossible reminiscences by supposing they did in some way suggest present convey i hardly know which word to use experiences it was otherwise impossible to tell well i dont resort to that explanation now i have got over my intervening doubts i believe now as i believed at the moment of telling that wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the truth of his secret for me but whether he himself saw or only thought he saw whether he himself was the possessor of an inestimable privilege or the victim of a fantastic dream i cannot pretend to guess even the facts of his death which ended my doubts for ever throw no light on that that much the reader must judge for himself i forget now what chance comment or criticism of mine moved so reticent a man to confide in me he was i think defending himself against an imputation of slackness and unreliability i had made in relation to a great public movement in which he had disappointed me but he plunged suddenly i have he said a preoccupation i know he went on after a pause i have been negligent the fact is it isnt a case of ghosts or apparitions but its an odd thing to tell of redmond i am haunted i am haunted by something that rather takes the light out of things that fills me with longings he paused checked by that english shyness that so often overcomes us when we would speak of moving or grave or beautiful things you were at saint thelstans all through he said and for a moment that seemed to me quite irrelevant well and he paused then very haltingly at first but afterwards more easily he began to tell of the thing that was hidden in his life the haunting memory of a beauty and a happiness that filled his heart with insatiable longings that made all the interests and spectacle of worldly life seem dull and tedious and vain to him now that i have the clue to it the thing seems written visibly in his face i have a photograph in which that look of detachment has been caught and intensified it reminds me of what a woman once said of him a woman who had loved him greatly suddenly she said the interest goes out of him he forgets you he doesnt care a rap for you under his very nose yet the interest was not always out of him and when he was holding his attention to a thing wallace could contrive to be an extremely successful man his career indeed is set with successes he left me behind him long ago he soared up over my head and cut a figure in the world that i couldnt cut anyhow he was still a year short of forty and they say now that he would have been in office and very probably in the new cabinet if he had lived at school he always beat me without effort as it were by nature we were at school together at saint thelstans college in west kensington for almost all our school time he came into the school as my co equal but he left far above me in a blaze of scholarships and brilliant performance yet i think i made a fair average running and it was at school i heard first of the door in the wall that i was to hear of a second time only a month before his death to him at least the door in the wall was a real door leading through a real wall to immortal realities of that i am now quite assured and it came into his life quite early when he was a little fellow between five and six i remember how as he sat making his confession to me with a slow gravity he reasoned and reckoned the date of it there was he said a crimson virginia creeper in it all one bright uniform crimson in a clear amber sunshine against a white wall that came into the impression somehow though i dont clearly remember how and there were horse chestnut leaves upon the clean pavement outside the green door they were blotched yellow and green you know not brown nor dirty so that they must have been new fallen i take it that means october i look out for horse chestnut leaves every year and i ought to know if im right in that i was about five years and four months old he was he said rather a precocious little boy he learnt to talk at an abnormally early age and he was so sane and old fashioned as people say that he was permitted an amount of initiative that most children scarcely attain by seven or eight his mother died when he was two and he was under the less vigilant and authoritative care of a nursery governess his father was a stern preoccupied lawyer who gave him little attention and expected great things of him for all his brightness he found life a little gray and dull i think and one day he wandered he could not recall the particular neglect that enabled him to get away nor the course he took among the west kensington roads all that had faded among the incurable blurs of memory but the white wall and the green door stood out quite distinctly as his memory of that childish experience ran he did at the very first sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion an attraction a desire to get to the door and open it and walk in and at the same time he had the clearest conviction that either it was unwise or it was wrong of him he could not tell which to yield to this attraction he insisted upon it as a curious thing that he knew from the very beginning unless memory has played him the queerest trick that the door was unfastened and that he could go in as he chose i seem to see the figure of that little boy drawn and repelled and it was very clear in his mind too though why it should be so was never explained that his father would be very angry if he went in through that door wallace described all these moments of hesitation to me with the utmost particularity he went right past the door and then with his hands in his pockets and making an infantile attempt to whistle strolled right along beyond the end of the wall there he recalls a number of mean dirty shops and particularly that of a plumber and decorator with a dusty disorder of earthenware pipes sheet lead ball taps pattern books of wall paper and tins of enamel he stood pretending to examine these things and coveting passionately desiring the green door then he said he had a gust of emotion he made a run for it lest hesitation should grip him again he went plump with outstretched hand through the green door and let it slam behind him and so in a trice he came into the garden that has haunted all his life it was very difficult for wallace to give me his full sense of that garden into which he came there was something in the very air of it that exhilarated that gave one a sense of lightness and good happening and well being there was something in the sight of it that made all its colour clean and perfect and subtly luminous in the instant of coming into it one was exquisitely glad as only in rare moments and when one is young and joyful one can be glad in this world and everything was beautiful there wallace mused before he went on telling me you see he said with the doubtful inflection of a man who pauses at incredible things there were two great panthers there yes spotted panthers and i was not afraid there was a long wide path with marble edged flower borders on either side and these two huge velvety beasts were playing there with a ball one looked up and came towards me a little curious as it seemed it came right up to me rubbed its soft round ear very gently against the small hand i held out and purred it was i tell you an enchanted garden i know and the size oh it stretched far and wide this way and that i believe there were hills far away heaven knows where west kensington had suddenly got to and somehow it was just like coming home you know in the very moment the door swung to behind me i forgot the road with its fallen chestnut leaves its cabs and tradesmens carts i forgot the sort of gravitational pull back to the discipline and obedience of home i forgot all hesitations and fear forgot discretion forgot all the intimate realities of this life i became in a moment a very glad and wonder happy little boy in another world it was a world with a different quality a warmer more penetrating and mellower light with a faint clear gladness in its air and wisps of sun touched cloud in the blueness of its sky and before me ran this long wide path invitingly with weedless beds on either side rich with untended flowers and these two great panthers i put my little hands fearlessly on their soft fur and caressed their round ears and the sensitive corners under their ears and played with them and it was as though they welcomed me home there was a keen sense of home coming in my mind and when presently a tall fair girl appeared in the pathway and came to meet me smiling and said well to me and lifted me and kissed me and put me down and led me by the hand there was no amazement but only an impression of delightful rightness of being reminded of happy things that had in some strange way been overlooked there were broad red steps i remember that came into view between spikes of delphinium and up these we went to a great avenue between very old and shady dark trees all down this avenue you know between the red chapped stems were marble seats of honour and statuary and very tame and friendly white doves along this cool avenue my girl friend led me looking down i recall the pleasant lines the finely modelled chin of her sweet kind face asking me questions in a soft agreeable voice and telling me things pleasant things i know though what they were i was never able to recall presently a little capuchin monkey very clean with a fur of ruddy brown and kindly hazel eyes came down a tree to us and ran beside me looking up at me and grinning and presently leapt to my shoulder so we two went on our way in great happiness he paused go on i said i remember little things we passed an old man musing among laurels i remember and a place gay with paroquets and came through a broad shaded colonnade to a spacious cool palace full of pleasant fountains full of beautiful things full of the quality and promise of hearts desire and there were many things and many people some that still seem to stand out clearly and some that are a little vague but all these people were beautiful and kind in some way i dont know how it was conveyed to me that they all were kind to me glad to have me there and filling me with gladness by their gestures by the touch of their hands by the welcome and love in their eyes yes he mused for a while playmates i found there that was very much to me because i was a lonely little boy they played delightful games in a grass covered court where there was a sun dial set about with flowers and as one played one loved but its odd theres a gap in my memory i dont remember the games we played i never remembered afterwards as a child i spent long hours trying even with tears to recall the form of that happiness i wanted to play it all over again in my nursery by myself no all i remember is the happiness and two dear playfellows who were most with me then presently came a sombre dark woman with a grave pale face and dreamy eyes a sombre woman wearing a soft long robe of pale purple who carried a book and beckoned and took me aside with her into a gallery above a hall though my playmates were loath to have me go and ceased their game and stood watching as i was carried away come back to us they cried come back to us soon i looked up at her face but she heeded them not at all her face was very gentle and grave she took me to a seat in the gallery and i stood beside her ready to look at her book as she opened it upon her knee the pages fell open she pointed and i looked marvelling for in the living pages of that book i saw myself it was a story about myself and in it were all the things that had happened to me since ever i was born it was wonderful to me because the pages of that book were not pictures you understand but realities wallace paused gravely looked at me doubtfully go on i said i understand they were realities yes they must have been people moved and things came and went in them my dear mother whom i had near forgotten then my father stern and upright the servants the nursery all the familiar things of home then the front door and the busy streets with traffic to and fro i looked and marvelled and looked half doubtfully again into the womans face and turned the pages over skipping this and that to see more of this book and more and so at last i came to myself hovering and hesitating outside the green door in the long white wall and felt again the conflict and the fear and next i cried and would have turned on but the cool hand of the grave woman delayed me next i insisted and struggled gently with her hand pulling up her fingers with all my childish strength and as she yielded and the page came over she bent down upon me like a shadow and kissed my brow but the page did not show the enchanted garden nor the panthers nor the girl who had led me by the hand nor the playfellows who had been so loath to let me go it showed a long gray street in west kensington in that chill hour of afternoon before the lamps are lit and i was there a wretched little figure weeping aloud for all that i could do to restrain myself and i was weeping because i could not return to my dear playfellows who had called after me come back to us come back to us soon i was there this was no page in a book but harsh reality that enchanted place and the restraining hand of the grave mother at whose knee i stood had gone whither had they gone he halted again and remained for a time staring into the fire oh the woefulness of that return he murmured well i said after a minute or so poor little wretch i was brought back to this gray world again as i realised the fullness of what had happened to me i gave way to quite ungovernable grief and the shame and humiliation of that public weeping and my disgraceful home coming remain with me still i see again the benevolent looking old gentleman in gold spectacles who stopped and spoke to me prodding me first with his umbrella poor little chap said he and are you lost then and me a london boy of five and more and he must needs bring in a kindly young policeman and make a crowd of me and so march me home sobbing conspicuous and frightened i came back from the enchanted garden to the steps of my fathers house that is as well as i can remember my vision of that garden the garden that haunts me still of course i can convey nothing of that indescribable quality of translucent unreality that difference from the common things of experience that hung about it all but that that is what happened if it was a dream i am sure it was a daytime and altogether extraordinary dream hm naturally there followed a terrible questioning by my aunt my father the nurse the governess every one i tried to tell them and my father gave me my first thrashing for telling lies when afterwards i tried to tell my aunt she punished me again for my wicked persistence then as i said every one was forbidden to listen to me to hear a word about it even my fairy tale books were taken away from me for a time because i was too imaginative eh yes they did that my father belonged to the old school and my story was driven back upon myself i whispered it to my pillow my pillow that was often damp and salt to my whispering lips with childish tears and i added always to my official and less fervent prayers this one heartfelt request please god i may dream of the garden oh take me back to my garden take me back to my garden i dreamt often of the garden i may have added to it i may have changed it i do not know all this you understand is an attempt to reconstruct from fragmentary memories a very early experience between that and the other consecutive memories of my boyhood there is a gulf a time came when it seemed impossible i should ever speak of that wonder glimpse again i asked an obvious question no he said i dont remember that i ever attempted to find my way back to the garden in those early years this seems odd to me now but i think that very probably a closer watch was kept on my movements after this misadventure to prevent my going astray no it wasnt till you knew me that i tried for the garden again and i believe there was a period incredible as it seems now when i forgot the garden altogether when i was about eight or nine it may have been do you remember me as a kid at saint thelstans rather i didnt show any signs did i in those days of having a secret dream ii he looked up with a sudden smile did you ever play north west passage with me no of course you didnt come my way it was the sort of game he went on that every imaginative child plays all day the idea was the discovery of a north west passage to school the way to school was plain enough the game consisted in finding some way that wasnt plain starting off ten minutes early in some almost hopeless direction and working my way round through unaccustomed streets to my goal and one day i got entangled among some rather low class streets on the other side of campden hill and i began to think that for once the game would be against me and that i should get to school late i tried rather desperately a street that seemed a cul de sac and found a passage at the end i hurried through that with renewed hope i shall do it yet i said and passed a row of frowsy little shops that were inexplicably familiar to me and behold there was my long white wall and the green door that led to the enchanted garden the thing whacked upon me suddenly then after all that garden that wonderful garden wasnt a dream he paused i suppose my second experience with the green door marks the world of difference there is between the busy life of a schoolboy and the infinite leisure of a child anyhow this second time i didnt for a moment think of going in straight away you see for one thing my mind was full of the idea of getting to school in time set on not breaking my record for punctuality i must surely have felt some little desire at least to try the door yes i must have felt that but i seem to remember the attraction of the door mainly as another obstacle to my overmastering determination to get to school i was immensely interested by this discovery i had made of course i went on with my mind full of it but i went on it didnt check me i ran past tugging out my watch found i had ten minutes still to spare and then i was going downhill into familiar surroundings i got to school breathless it is true and wet with perspiration but in time i can remember hanging up my coat and hat went right by it and left it behind me odd eh he looked at me thoughtfully of course i didnt know then that it wouldnt always be there schoolboys have limited imaginations i suppose i thought it was an awfully jolly thing to have it there to know my way back to it but there was the school tugging at me i expect i was a good deal distraught and inattentive that morning recalling what i could of the beautiful strange people i should presently see again oddly enough i had no doubt in my mind that they would be glad to see me yes i must have thought of the garden that morning just as a jolly sort of place to which one might resort in the interludes of a strenuous scholastic career i didnt go that day at all the next day was a half holiday and that may have weighed with me perhaps too my state of inattention brought down impositions upon me and docked the margin of time necessary for the detour i dont know what i do know is that in the meantime the enchanted garden was so much upon my mind that i could not keep it to myself i told what was his name a ferrety looking youngster we used to call squiff young hopkins said i hopkins it was i did not like telling him i had a feeling that in some way it was against the rules to tell him but i did he was walking part of the way home with me he was talkative and if we had not talked about the enchanted garden we should have talked of something else and it was intolerable to me to think about any other subject so i blabbed well he told my secret the next day in the play interval i found myself surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys half teasing and wholly curious to hear more of the enchanted garden there was that big fawcett you remember him and carnaby and morley reynolds you werent there by any chance no i think i should have remembered if you were a boy is a creature of odd feelings i was i really believe in spite of my secret self disgust a little flattered to have the attention of these big fellows i remember particularly a moment of pleasure caused by the praise of crawshaw you remember crawshaw major the son of crawshaw the composer who said it was the best lie he had ever heard but at the same time there was a really painful undertow of shame at telling what i felt was indeed a sacred secret that beast fawcett made a joke about the girl in green wallaces voice sank with the keen memory of that shame i pretended not to hear he said well then carnaby suddenly called me a young liar and disputed with me when i said the thing was true i said i knew where to find the green door could lead them all there in ten minutes carnaby became outrageously virtuous and said id have to and bear out my words or suffer did you ever have carnaby twist your arm then perhaps youll understand how it went with me i swore my story was true there was nobody in the school then to save a chap from carnaby though crawshaw put in a word or so carnaby had got his game i grew excited and red eared and a little frightened i behaved altogether like a silly little chap and the outcome of it all was that instead of starting alone for my enchanted garden i led the way presently cheeks flushed ears hot eyes smarting and my soul one burning misery and shame for a party of six mocking curious and threatening schoolfellows we never found the white wall and the green door you mean i mean i couldnt find it i would have found it if i could and afterwards when i could go alone i couldnt find it i never found it i seem now to have been always looking for it through my schoolboy days but i never came upon it never did the fellows make it disagreeable beastly carnaby held a council over me for wanton lying i remember how i sneaked home and upstairs to hide the marks of my blubbering but when i cried myself to sleep at last it wasnt for carnaby but for the garden for the beautiful afternoon i had hoped for for the sweet friendly women and the waiting playfellows and the game i had hoped to learn again that beautiful forgotten game i believed firmly that if i had not told i had bad times after that crying at night and wool gathering by day for two terms i slackened and had bad reports do you remember of course you would it was you your beating me in mathematics that brought me back to the grind again iii for a time my friend stared silently into the red heart of the fire then he said i never saw it again until i was seventeen it leapt upon me for the third time as i was driving to paddington on my way to oxford and a scholarship i had just one momentary glimpse i was leaning over the apron of my hansom smoking a cigarette and no doubt thinking myself no end of a man of the world and suddenly there was the door the wall the dear sense of unforgettable and still attainable things we clattered by i too taken by surprise to stop my cab until we were well past and round a corner then i had a queer moment a double and divergent movement of my will i tapped the little door in the roof of the cab and brought my arm down to pull out my watch yes sir said the cabman smartly er well its nothing i cried my mistake we havent much time go on and he went on i got my scholarship and the night after i was told of that i sat over my fire in my little upper room my study in my fathers house with his praise his rare praise and his sound counsels ringing in my ears and i smoked my favourite pipe the formidable bulldog of adolescence and thought of that door in the long white wall if i had stopped i thought i should have missed my scholarship i should have missed oxford muddled all the fine career before me i begin to see things better i fell musing deeply but i did not doubt then this career of mine was a thing that merited sacrifice those dear friends and that clear atmosphere seemed very sweet to me very fine but remote my grip was fixing now upon the world i saw another door opening the door of my career he stared again into the fire its red light picked out a stubborn strength in his face for just one flickering moment and then it vanished again well he said and sighed i have served that career i have done much work much hard work but i have dreamt of the enchanted garden a thousand dreams and seen its door or at least glimpsed its door four times since then yes four times for a while this world was so bright and interesting seemed so full of meaning and opportunity that the half effaced charm of the garden was by comparison gentle and remote who wants to pat panthers on the way to dinner with pretty women and distinguished men i came down to london from oxford a man of bold promise that i have done something to redeem something and yet there have been disappointments twice i have been in love i will not dwell on that but once as i went to some one who i knew doubted whether i dared to come i took a short cut at a venture through an unfrequented road near earls court and so happened on a white wall and a familiar green door odd said i to myself but i thought this place was on campden hill its the place i never could find somehow like counting stonehenge the place of that queer daydream of mine and i went by it intent upon my purpose it had no appeal to me that afternoon i had just a moments impulse to try the door three steps aside were needed at the most though i was sure enough in my heart that it would open to me and then i thought that doing so might delay me on the way to that appointment in which i thought my honour was involved afterwards i was sorry for my punctuality i might at least have peeped in i thought and waved a hand to those panthers but i knew enough by this time not to seek again belatedly that which is not found by seeking yes that time made me very sorry years of hard work after that and never a sight of the door its only recently it has come back to me with it there has come a sense as though some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world i began to think of it as a sorrowful and bitter thing that i should never see that door again perhaps i was suffering a little from overwork perhaps it was what ive heard spoken of as the feeling of forty i dont know but certainly the keen brightness that makes effort easy has gone out of things recently and that just at a time with all these new political developments when i ought to be working odd isnt it but i do begin to find life toilsome its rewards as i come near them cheap i began a little while ago to want the garden quite badly yes and ive seen it three times the garden no the door and i havent gone in he leant over the table to me with an enormous sorrow in his voice as he spoke thrice i have had my chance thrice if ever that door offers itself to me again i swore i will go in out of this dust and heat out of this dry glitter of vanity out of these toilsome futilities i will go and never return this time i will stay i swore it and when the time came i didnt go three times in one year have i passed that door and failed to enter three times in the last year the first time was on the night of the snatch division on the tenants redemption bill on which the government was saved by a majority of three you remember no one on our side perhaps very few on the opposite side expected the end that night then the debate collapsed like eggshells i and hotchkiss were dining with his cousin at brentford we were both unpaired and we were called up by telephone and set off at once in his cousins motor we got in barely in time and on the way we passed my wall and door livid in the moonlight blotched with hot yellow as the glare of our lamps lit it but unmistakable my god cried i what said hotchkiss nothing i answered and the moment passed ive made a great sacrifice i told the whip as i got in they all have he said and hurried by i do not see how i could have done otherwise then and the next occasion was as i rushed to my fathers bedside to bid that stern old man farewell then too the claims of life were imperative but the third time was different it happened a week ago it fills me with hot remorse to recall it i was with gurker and ralphs its no secret now you know that ive had my talk with gurker we had been dining at frobishers and the talk had become intimate between us the question of my place in the reconstructed ministry lay always just over the boundary of the discussion yes yes thats all settled it neednt be talked about yet but theres no reason to keep a secret from you yes thanks thanks but let me tell you my story then on that night things were very much in the air my position was a very delicate one i was keenly anxious to get some definite word from gurker but was hampered by ralphs presence i was using the best power of my brain to keep that light and careless talk not too obviously directed to the point that concerned me i had to ralphs behaviour since has more than justified my caution ralphs i knew would leave us beyond the kensington high street and then i could surprise gurker by a sudden frankness one has sometimes to resort to these little devices and then it was that in the margin of my field of vision i became aware once more of the white wall the green door before us down the road we passed it talking i passed it i can still see the shadow of gurkers marked profile his opera hat tilted forward over his prominent nose the many folds of his neck wrap going before my shadow and ralphs as we sauntered past i passed within twenty inches of the door if i say good night to them and go in i asked myself what will happen and i was all a tingle for that word with gurker i could not answer that question in the tangle of my other problems they will think me mad i thought and suppose i vanish now amazing disappearance of a prominent politician that weighed with me a thousand inconceivably petty worldlinesses weighed with me in that crisis then he turned on me with a sorrowful smile and speaking slowly here i am he said here i am he repeated and my chance has gone from me three times in one year the door has been offered me the door that goes into peace into delight into a beauty beyond dreaming a kindness no man on earth can know and i have rejected it redmond and it has gone how do you know i know i know i am left now to work it out to stick to the tasks that held me so strongly when my moments came you say i have success this vulgar tawdry irksome envied thing i have it he had a walnut in his big hand if that was my success he said and crushed it and held it out for me to see let me tell you something redmond this loss is destroying me for two months for ten weeks nearly now i have done no work at all except the most necessary and urgent duties my soul is full of inappeasable regrets at nights when it is less likely i shall be recognised i go out i wander yes i wonder what people would think of that if they knew a cabinet minister the responsible head of that most vital of all departments wandering alone grieving sometimes near audibly lamenting for a door for a garden iv i can see now his rather pallid face and the unfamiliar sombre fire that had come into his eyes i see him very vividly to night i sit recalling his words his tones and last evenings westminster gazette still lies on my sofa containing the notice of his death at lunch to day the club was busy with his death we talked of nothing else they found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep excavation near east kensington station it is one of two shafts that have been made in connection with an extension of the railway southward it is protected from the intrusion of the public by a hoarding upon the high road in which a small doorway has been cut for the convenience of some of the workmen who live in that direction the doorway was left unfastened through a misunderstanding between two gangers and through it he made his way my mind is darkened with questions and riddles it would seem he walked all the way from the house that night he has frequently walked home during the past session and so it is i figure his dark form coming along the late and empty streets wrapped up intent and then did the pale electric lights near the station cheat the rough planking into a semblance of white did that fatal unfastened door awaken some memory was there after all ever any green door in the wall at all i do not know i have told his story as he told it to me there are times when i believe that wallace was no more than the victim of the coincidence between a rare but not unprecedented type of hallucination and a careless trap but that indeed is not my profoundest belief you may think me superstitious if you will and foolish but indeed i am more than half convinced that he had in truth an abnormal gift and a sense something i know not what that in the guise of wall and door offered him an outlet a secret and peculiar passage of escape into another and altogether more beautiful world at any rate you will say it betrayed him in the end but did it betray him there you touch the inmost mystery of these dreamers these men of vision and the imagination we see our world fair and common the hoarding and the pit by our daylight standard he walked out of security into darkness danger and death but did he see like that the apple i must get rid of it said the man in the corner of the carriage abruptly breaking the silence mr hinchcliff looked up hearing imperfectly he had been lost in the rapt contemplation of the college cap tied by a string to his portmanteau handles the outward and visible sign of his newly gained pedagogic position in the rapt appreciation of the college cap and the pleasant anticipations it excited for mr hinchcliff had just matriculated at london university and was going to be junior assistant at the holmwood grammar school a very enviable position he stared across the carriage at his fellow traveller why not give it away said this person give it away why not he was a tall dark sunburnt man with a pale face his arms were folded tightly and his feet were on the seat in front of him he was pulling at a lank black moustache he stared hard at his toes why not he said mr hinchcliff coughed the stranger lifted his eyes they were curious dark gray eyes and stared blankly at mr hinchcliff for the best part of a minute perhaps his expression grew to interest yes he said slowly why not and end it i dont quite follow you im afraid said mr hinchcliff with another cough you dont quite follow me said the stranger quite mechanically his singular eyes wandering from mr hinchcliff to the bag with its ostentatiously displayed cap and back to mr hinchcliffs downy face youre so abrupt you know apologised mr hinchcliff why shouldnt i said the stranger following his thoughts you are a student he said addressing mr hinchcliff i am by correspondence of the london university said mr hinchcliff with irrepressible pride and feeling nervously at his tie in pursuit of knowledge said the stranger and suddenly took his feet off the seat put his fist on his knees and stared at mr hinchcliff as though he had never seen a student before yes he said and flung out an index finger then he rose took a bag from the hat rack and unlocked it quite silently he drew out something round and wrapped in a quantity of silver paper and unfolded this carefully he held it out towards mr hinchcliff a small very smooth golden yellow fruit mr hinchcliffs eyes and mouth were open he did not offer to take this object if he was intended to take it that said this fantastic stranger speaking very slowly is the apple of the tree of knowledge look at it small and bright and wonderful knowledge and i am going to give it to you mr hinchcliffs mind worked painfully for a minute and then the sufficient explanation mad flashed across his brain and illuminated the whole situation one humoured madmen he put his head a little on one side the apple of the tree of knowledge eh said mr hinchcliff regarding it with a finely assumed air of interest and then looking at the interlocutor but dont you want to eat it yourself and besides how did you come by it it never fades i have had it now three months and it is ever bright and smooth and ripe and desirable as you see it he laid his hand on his knee and regarded the fruit musingly then he began to wrap it again in the papers as though he had abandoned his intention of giving it away but how did you come by it said mr hinchcliff who had his argumentative side and how do you know that it is the fruit of the tree i bought this fruit said the stranger three months ago for a drink of water and a crust of bread the man who gave it to me because i kept the life in him was an armenian armenia that wonderful country the first of all countries where the ark of the flood remains to this day buried in the glaciers of mount ararat this man i say fleeing with others from the kurds who had come upon them went up into desolate places among the mountains places beyond the common knowledge of men and fleeing from imminent pursuit they came to a slope high among the mountain peaks green with a grass like knife blades that cut and slashed most pitilessly at any one who went into it the kurds were close behind and there was nothing for it but to plunge in and the worst of it was that the paths they made through it at the price of their blood served for the kurds to follow every one of the fugitives was killed save this armenian and another he heard the screams and cries of his friends and the swish of the grass about those who were pursuing them it was tall grass rising overhead and then a shouting and answers and when presently he paused everything was still he pushed out again not understanding cut and bleeding until he came out on a steep slope of rocks below a precipice and then he saw the grass was all on fire and the smoke of it rose like a veil between him and his enemies the stranger paused yes said mr hinchcliff yes there he was all torn and bloody from the knife blades of the grass the rocks blazing under the afternoon sun the sky molten brass and the smoke of the fire driving towards him he dared not stay there death he did not mind but torture far away beyond the smoke he heard shouts and cries women screaming so he went clambering up a gorge in the rocks everywhere were bushes with dry branches that stuck out like thorns among the leaves until he clambered over the brow of a ridge that hid him and then he met his companion a shepherd who had also escaped and counting cold and famine and thirst as nothing against the kurds they went on into the heights and among the snow and ice they wandered three whole days the third day came the vision i suppose hungry men often do see visions but then there is this fruit he lifted the wrapped globe in his hand and i have heard it too from other mountaineers who have known something of the legend it was in the evening time when the stars were increasing that they came down a slope of polished rock into a huge dark valley all set about with strange contorted trees and in these trees hung little globes like glow worm spheres strange round yellow lights suddenly this valley was lit far away many miles away far down it with a golden flame marching slowly athwart it that made the stunted trees against it black as night and turned the slopes all about them and their figures to the likeness of fiery gold and at the vision they knowing the legends of the mountains instantly knew that it was eden they saw or the sentinel of eden and they fell upon their faces like men struck dead when they dared to look again the valley was dark for a space and then the light came again returning a burning amber at that the shepherd sprang to his feet and with a shout began to run down towards the light but the other man was too fearful to follow him he stood stunned amazed and terrified watching his companion recede towards the marching glare and hardly had the shepherd set out when there came a noise like thunder the beating of invisible wings hurrying up the valley and a great and terrible fear and at that the man who gave me the fruit turned if he might still escape and hurrying headlong up the slope again with that tumult sweeping after him he stumbled against one of these stunted bushes and a ripe fruit came off it into his hand this fruit forthwith the wings and the thunder rolled all about him he fell and fainted and when he came to his senses he was back among the blackened ruins of his own village and i and the others were attending to the wounded a vision but the golden fruit of the tree was still clutched in his hand there were others there who knew the legend knew what that strange fruit might be he paused and this is it he said it was a most extraordinary story to be told in a third class carriage on a sussex railway it was as if the real was a mere veil to the fantastic and here was the fantastic poking through is it was all mr hinchcliff could say the legend said the stranger tells that those thickets of dwarfed trees growing about the garden sprang from the apple that adam carried in his hand when he and eve were driven forth he felt something in his hand saw the half eaten apple and flung it petulantly aside and there they grow in that desolate valley girdled round with the everlasting snows and there the fiery swords keep war against the judgment day but i thought these things were mr hinchcliff paused fables parables rather do you mean to tell me that there in armenia the stranger answered the unfinished question with the fruit in his open hand but you dont know said mr hinchcliff that that is the fruit of the tree of knowledge the man may have had a sort of mirage say suppose look at it said the stranger it was certainly a strange looking globe not really an apple mr hinchcliff saw and a curious glowing golden colour almost as though light itself was wrought into its substance as he looked at it he began to see more vividly the desolate valley among the mountains the guarding swords of fire the strange antiquities of the story he had just heard he rubbed a knuckle into his eye but said he it has kept like that smooth and full three months longer than that it is now by some days no drying no withering no decay and you yourself said mr hinchcliff really believe that is the forbidden fruit there was no mistaking the earnestness of the mans manner and his perfect sanity the fruit of knowledge he said suppose it was said mr hinchcliff after a pause still staring at it but after all said mr hinchcliff its not my kind of knowledge not the sort of knowledge i mean adam and eve have eaten it already we inherit their sins not their knowledge said the stranger that would make it all clear and bright again we should see into everything through everything into the deepest meaning of everything why dont you eat it then said mr hinchcliff with an inspiration i took it intending to eat it said the stranger man has fallen merely to eat again could scarcely knowledge is power said mr hinchcliff but is it happiness i am older than you more than twice as old time after time i have held this in my hand and my heart has failed me at the thought of all that one might know that terrible lucidity suppose suddenly all the world became pitilessly clear that i think would be a great advantage said mr hinchcliff on the whole suppose you saw into the hearts and minds of every one about you into their most secret recesses people you loved whose love you valued youd soon find out the humbugs said mr hinchcliff greatly struck by the idea and worse to know yourself bare of your most intimate illusions to see yourself in your place all that your lusts and weaknesses prevented your doing no merciful perspective that might be an excellent thing too know thyself you know you are young said the stranger if you dont care to eat it and it bothers you why dont you throw it away there again perhaps you will not understand me to me how could one throw away a thing like that glowing wonderful once one has it one is bound but on the other hand to give it away to give it away to some one who thirsted after knowledge who found no terror in the thought of that clear perception of course said mr hinchcliff thoughtfully it might be some sort of poisonous fruit and then his eye caught something motionless the end of a white board black lettered outside the carriage window mwood he saw he started convulsively gracious said mr hinchcliff holmwood and the practical present blotted out the mystic realisations that had been stealing upon him in another moment he was opening the carriage door portmanteau in hand the guard was already fluttering his green flag mr hinchcliff jumped out here said a voice behind him and he saw the dark eyes of the stranger shining and the golden fruit bright and bare held out of the open carriage door he took it instinctively the train was already moving no shouted the stranger and made a snatch at it as if to take it back stand away cried a country porter thrusting forward to close the door the stranger shouted something mr hinchcliff did not catch head and arm thrust excitedly out of the window and then the shadow of the bridge fell on him and in a trice he was hidden mr hinchcliff stood astonished staring at the end of the last wagon receding round the bend and with the wonderful fruit in his hand for the fraction of a minute his mind was confused and then he became aware that two or three people on the platform were regarding him with interest was he not the new grammar school master making his debut it occurred to him that so far as they could tell the fruit might very well be the nave refreshment of an orange he flushed at the thought and thrust the fruit into his side pocket where it bulged undesirably but there was no help for it so he went towards them awkwardly concealing his sense of awkwardness to ask the way to the grammar school and the means of getting his portmanteau and the two tin boxes which lay up the platform thither of all the odd and fantastic yarns to tell a fellow his luggage could be taken on a truck for sixpence he found and he could precede it on foot he fancied an ironical note in the voices he was painfully aware of his contour the curious earnestness of the man in the train and the glamour of the story he told had for a time diverted the current of mr hinchcliffs thoughts it drove a mist before his immediate concerns fires that went to and fro but the preoccupation of his new position and the impression he was to produce upon holmwood generally and the school people in particular returned upon him with reinvigorating power before he left the station and cleared his mental atmosphere but it is extraordinary what an inconvenient thing the addition of a soft and rather brightly golden fruit not three inches in diameter may prove to a sensitive youth on his best appearance in the pocket of his black jacket it bulged dreadfully spoilt the lines altogether he passed a little old lady in black and he felt her eye drop upon the excrescence at once he was wearing one glove and carrying the other together with his stick so that to bear the fruit openly was impossible in one place where the road into the town seemed suitably secluded he took his encumbrance out of his pocket and tried it in his hat it was just too large the hat wobbled ludicrously and just as he was taking it out again a butchers boy came driving round the corner confound it said mr hinchcliff he would have eaten the thing and attained omniscience there and then but it would seem so silly to go into the town sucking a juicy fruit and it certainly felt juicy if one of the boys should come by it might do him a serious injury with his discipline so to be seen and the juice might make his face sticky and get upon his cuffs or it might be an acid juice as potent as lemon and take all the colour out of his clothes then round a bend in the lane came two pleasant sunlit girlish figures they were walking slowly towards the town and chattering at any moment they might look round and see a hot faced young man behind them carrying a kind of phosphorescent yellow tomato they would be sure to laugh hang said mr hinchcliff and with a swift jerk sent the encumbrance flying over the stone wall of an orchard that there abutted on the road as it vanished he felt a faint twinge of loss that lasted scarcely a moment he adjusted the stick and glove in his hand and walked on erect and self conscious to pass the girls but in the darkness of the night mr hinchcliff had a dream and saw the valley and the flaming swords and the contorted trees and knew that it really was the apple of the tree of knowledge that he had thrown regardlessly away and he awoke very unhappy in the morning his regret had passed but afterwards it returned and troubled him never however when he was happy or busily occupied at last one moonlight night about eleven when all holmwood was quiet his regrets returned with redoubled force and therewith an impulse to adventure he slipped out of the house and over the playground wall went through the silent town to station lane and climbed into the orchard where he had thrown the fruit but nothing was to be found of it there among the dewy grass and the faint intangible globes of dandelion down the temptation of harringay it is quite impossible to say whether this thing really happened it depends entirely on the word of r m harringay who is an artist following his version of the affair the narrative deposes that harringay went into his studio about ten oclock to see what he could make of the head that he had been working at the day before the head in question was that of an italian organ grinder and harringay thought but was not quite sure that the title would be the vigil so far he is frank and his narrative bears the stamp of truth he had seen the man expectant for pennies and with a promptness that suggested genius had had him in at once kneel look up at that bracket said harringay as if you expected pennies dont grin said harringay i dont want to paint your gums look as though you were unhappy now after a nights rest the picture proved decidedly unsatisfactory its good work said harringay that little bit in the neck but he walked about the studio and looked at the thing from this point and from that then he said a wicked word in the original the word is given painting he says he said just a painting of an organ grinder a mere portrait if it was a live organ grinder i wouldnt mind but somehow i never make things alive i wonder if my imagination is wrong this too has a truthful air his imagination is wrong that creative touch to take canvas and pigment and make a man as adam was made of red ochre but this thing if you met it walking about the streets you would know it was only a studio production the little boys would tell it to garnome and git frimed some little touch well it wont do as it is he went to the blinds and began to pull them down they were made of blue holland with the rollers at the bottom of the window so that you pull them down to get more light he gathered his palette brushes and mahl stick from his table then he turned to the picture and put a speck of brown in the corner of the mouth and shifted his attention thence to the pupil of the eye then he decided that the chin was a trifle too impassive for a vigil presently he put down his impedimenta and lighting a pipe surveyed the progress of his work im hanged if the thing isnt sneering at me said harringay and he still believes it sneered the animation of the figure had certainly increased but scarcely in the direction he wished there was no mistake about the sneer vigil of the unbeliever said harringay rather subtle and clever that but the left eyebrow isnt cynical enough he went and dabbed at the eyebrow and added a little to the lobe of the ear to suggest materialism further consideration ensued vigils off im afraid said harringay why not mephistopheles but thats a bit too common a friend of the doge not so seedy the armour wont do though too camelot how about a scarlet robe and call him one of the sacred college humour in that and an appreciation of middle italian history theres always benvenuto cellini said harringay with a clever suggestion of a gold cup in one corner but that would scarcely suit the complexion he describes himself as babbling in this way in order to keep down an unaccountably unpleasant sensation of fear the thing was certainly acquiring anything but a pleasing expression yet it was as certainly becoming far more of a living thing than it had been if a sinister one far more alive than anything he had ever painted before call it portrait of a gentleman said harringay a certain gentleman wont do said harringay still keeping up his courage kind of thing they call bad taste that sneer will have to come out that gone and a little more fire in the eye never noticed how warm his eye was before and he might do for what price passionate pilgrim but that devilish face wont do this side of the channel some little inaccuracy does it he said eyebrows probably too oblique therewith pulling the blind lower to get a better light and resuming palette and brushes the face on the canvas seemed animated by a spirit of its own where the expression of diablerie came in he found impossible to discover experiment was necessary the eyebrows it could scarcely be the eyebrows but he altered them no that was no better in fact if anything a trifle more satanic the corner of the mouth pah more than ever a leer and now retouched it was ominously grim the eye then catastrophe he had filled his brush with vermilion instead of brown and yet he had felt sure it was brown the eye seemed now to have rolled in its socket and was glaring at him an eye of fire in a flash of passion possibly with something of the courage of panic he struck the brush full of bright red athwart the picture and then a very curious thing a very strange thing indeed occurred if it did occur the diabolified italian before him shut both his eyes pursed his mouth and wiped the colour off his face with his hand then the red eye opened again with a sound like the opening of lips and the face smiled that was rather hasty of you said the picture harringay states that now that the worst had happened his self possession returned he had a saving persuasion that devils were reasonable creatures why do you keep moving about then he said making faces and all that sneering and squinting while i am painting you i dont said the picture you do said harringay its yourself said the picture its not myself said harringay it is yourself said the picture no dont go hitting me with paint again because its true you have been trying to fluke an expression on my face all the morning really you havent an idea what your picture ought to look like i have said harringay you have not said the picture you never have with your pictures you always start with the vaguest presentiment of what you are going to do it is to be something beautiful you are sure of that and devout perhaps or tragic but beyond that it is all experiment and chance my dear fellow you dont think you can paint a picture like that now it must be remembered that for what follows we have only harringays word i shall paint a picture exactly as i like said harringay calmly this seemed to disconcert the picture a little you cant paint a picture without an inspiration it remarked but i had an inspiration for this inspiration sneered the sardonic figure a fancy that came from your seeing an organ grinder looking up at a window vigil ha ha you just started painting on the chance of something coming thats what you did and when i saw you at it i came i want a talk with you art with you said the picture its a poor business you potter i dont know how it is but you dont seem able to throw your soul into it you know too much it hampers you in the midst of your enthusiasms you ask yourself whether something like this has not been done before and look here said harringay who had expected something better than criticism from the devil are you going to talk studio to me he filled his number twelve hoghair with red paint the true artist said the picture is always an ignorant man an artist who theorises about his work is no longer artist but critic wagner i say whats that red paint for im going to paint you out said harringay i dont want to hear all that tommy rot if you think just because im an artist by trade im going to talk studio to you you make a precious mistake one minute said the picture evidently alarmed i want to make you an offer a genuine offer its right what im saying you lack inspirations well no doubt youve heard of the cathedral of cologne and the devils bridge and rubbish said harringay do you think i want to go to perdition simply for the pleasure of painting a good picture and getting it slated take that his blood was up his danger only nerved him to action so he says so he planted a dab of vermilion in his creatures mouth the italian spluttered and tried to wipe it off evidently horribly surprised and then according to harringay there began a very remarkable struggle harringay splashing away with the red paint and the picture wriggling about and wiping it off as fast as he put it on two masterpieces said the demon two indubitable masterpieces for a chelsea artists soul its a bargain harringay replied with the paint brush for a few minutes nothing could be heard but the brush going and the spluttering and ejaculations of the italian a lot of the strokes he caught on his arm and hand though harringay got over his guard often enough presently the paint on the palette gave out and the two antagonists stood breathless regarding each other the picture was so smeared with red that it looked as if it had been rolling about a slaughterhouse and it was painfully out of breath and very uncomfortable with the wet paint trickling down its neck still the first round was in its favour on the whole think it said sticking pluckily to its point two supreme masterpieces in different styles each equivalent to the cathedral i know said harringay and rushed out of the studio and along the passage towards his wifes boudoir in another minute he was back with a large tin of enamel hedge sparrows egg tint it was and a brush at the sight of that the artistic devil with the red eye began to scream three masterpieces culminating masterpieces harringay delivered cut two across the demon and followed with a thrust in the eye there was an indistinct rumbling four masterpieces and a spitting sound but harringay had the upper hand now and meant to keep it with rapid bold strokes he continued to paint over the writhing canvas until at last it was a uniform field of shining hedge sparrow tint once the mouth reappeared and got as far as five master before he filled it with enamel and near the end the red eye opened and glared at him indignantly but at last nothing remained save a gleaming panel of drying enamel for a little while a faint stirring beneath the surface puckered it slightly here and there but presently even that died away and the thing was perfectly still then harringay according to harringays account lit his pipe and sat down and stared at the enamelled canvas and tried to make out clearly what had happened then he walked round behind it to see if the back of it was at all remarkable then it was he began to regret he had not photographed the devil before he painted him out this is harringays story not mine he supports it by a small canvas by enamelled a pale green and by violent asseverations it is also true that he never has produced a masterpiece and in the opinion of his intimate friends probably never will mr skelmersdale in fairyland theres a man in that shop said the doctor who has been in fairyland nonsense i said and stared back at the shop it was the usual village shop post office telegraph wire on its brow zinc pans and brushes outside boots shirtings and potted meats in the window tell me about it i said after a pause i dont know said the doctor hes an ordinary sort of lout skelmersdale is his name but everybody about here believes it like bible truth i reverted presently to the topic i know nothing about it said the doctor and i dont want to know i attended him for a broken finger married and single cricket match and thats when i struck the nonsense thats all but it shows you the sort of stuff i have to deal with anyhow eh nice to get modern sanitary ideas into a people like this very i said in a mildly sympathetic tone and he went on to tell me about that business of the bonham drain things of that kind i observe are apt to weigh on the minds of medical officers of health i was as sympathetic as i knew how and when he called the bonham people asses i said they were thundering asses but even that did not allay him afterwards later in the summer an urgent desire to seclude myself while finishing my chapter on spiritual pathology it was really i believe stiffer to write than it is to read took me to bignor i lodged at a farmhouse and presently found myself outside that little general shop again in search of tobacco skelmersdale said i to myself at the sight of it and went in i was served by a short but shapely young man with a fair downy complexion good small teeth blue eyes and a languid manner i scrutinised him curiously except for a touch of melancholy in his expression he was nothing out of the common he was in the shirtsleeves and tucked up apron of his trade and a pencil was thrust behind his inoffensive ear athwart his black waistcoat was a gold chain from which dangled a bent guinea nothing more to day sir he inquired he leant forward over my bill as he spoke are you mr skelmersdale said i i am sir he said without looking up is it true that you have been in fairyland he looked up at me for a moment with wrinkled brows with an aggrieved exasperated face o shut it he said and after a moment of hostility eye to eye he went on adding up my bill four six and a half he said after a pause thank you sir so unpropitiously my acquaintance with mr skelmersdale began well i got from that to confidence through a series of toilsome efforts i picked him up again in the village room where of a night i went to play billiards after my supper and mitigate the extreme seclusion from my kind that was so helpful to work during the day i contrived to play with him and afterwards to talk with him i found the one subject to avoid was fairyland on everything else he was open and amiable in a commonplace sort of way but on that he had been worried it was a manifest taboo only once in the room did i hear the slightest allusion to his experience in his presence and that was by a cross grained farm hand who was losing to him skelmersdale had run a break into double figures which by the bignor standards was uncommonly good play steady on said his adversary none of your fairy flukes skelmersdale stared at him for a moment cue in hand then flung it down and walked out of the room why cant you leave im alone said a respectable elder who had been enjoying the game and in the general murmur of disapproval the grin of satisfied wit faded from the ploughboys face i scented my opportunity whats this joke said i about fairyland taint no joke about fairyland not to young skelmersdale said the respectable elder drinking a little man with rosy cheeks was more communicative they do say sir he said that they took him into aldington knoll an kep him there a matter of three weeks and with that the gathering was well under weigh once one sheep had started others were ready enough to follow and in a little time i had at least the exterior aspect of the skelmersdale affair formerly before he came to bignor he had been in that very similar little shop at aldington corner and there whatever it was did happen had taken place the story was clear that he had stayed out late one night on the knoll and vanished for three weeks from the sight of men and had returned with his cuffs as clean as when he started and his pockets full of dust and ashes he returned in a state of moody wretchedness that only slowly passed away and for many days he would give no account of where it was he had been the girl he was engaged to at clapton hill tried to get it out of him and threw him over partly because he refused and partly because as she said he fairly gave her the ump and then when some time after he let out to some one carelessly that he had been in fairyland and wanted to go back and when the thing spread and the simple badinage of the countryside came into play he threw up his situation abruptly and came to bignor to get out of the fuss but as to what had happened in fairyland none of these people knew there the gathering in the village room went to pieces like a pack at fault one said this and another said that their air in dealing with this marvel was ostensibly critical and sceptical but i could see a considerable amount of belief showing through their guarded qualifications i took a line of intelligent interest tinged with a reasonable doubt of the whole story if fairylands inside aldington knoll i said why dont you dig it out thats what i says said the young ploughboy theres a many have tried to dig on aldington knoll said the respectable elder solemnly one time and another but theres none as goes about to day to tell what they got by digging the unanimity of vague belief that surrounded me was rather impressive i felt there must surely be something at the root of so much conviction and the already pretty keen curiosity i felt about the real facts of the case was distinctly whetted if these real facts were to be got from any one they were to be got from skelmersdale himself and i set myself therefore still more assiduously to efface the first bad impression i had made and win his confidence to the pitch of voluntary speech in that endeavour i had a social advantage being a person of affability and no apparent employment and wearing tweeds and knickerbockers i was naturally classed as an artist in bignor and in the remarkable code of social precedence prevalent in bignor an artist ranks considerably higher than a grocers assistant skelmersdale like too many of his class is something of a snob he had told me to shut it only under sudden excessive provocation and with i am certain a subsequent repentance he was i knew quite glad to be seen walking about the village with me in due course he accepted the proposal of a pipe and whisky in my rooms readily enough and there scenting by some happy instinct that there was trouble of the heart in this and knowing that confidences beget confidences i plied him with much of interest and suggestion from my real and fictitious past and it was after the third whisky of the third visit of that sort if i remember rightly that apropos of some artless expansion of a little affair that had touched and left me in my teens that he did at last of his own free will and motion break the ice it was like that with me he said over there at aldington its just that thats so rum first i didnt care a bit and it was all her and afterwards when it was too late it was in a manner of speaking all me i forbore to jump upon this allusion and so he presently threw out another and in a little while he was making it as plain as daylight that the one thing he wanted to talk about now was this fairyland adventure he had sat tight upon for so long you see id done the trick with him and from being just another half incredulous would be facetious stranger i had by all my wealth of shameless self exposure become the possible confidant he had been bitten by the desire to show that he too had lived and felt many things and the fever was upon him he was certainly confoundedly allusive at first and my eagerness to clear him up with a few precise questions was only equalled and controlled by my anxiety not to get to this sort of thing too soon but in another meeting or so the basis of confidence was complete and from first to last i think i got most of the items and aspects indeed i got quite a number of times over almost everything that mr skelmersdale with his very limited powers of narration will ever be able to tell and so i come to the story of his adventure and i piece it all together again whether it really happened whether he imagined it or dreamt it or fell upon it in some strange hallucinatory trance i do not profess to say but that he invented it i will not for one moment entertain the man simply and honestly believes the thing happened as he says it happened he is transparently incapable of any lie so elaborate and sustained and in the belief of the simple yet often keenly penetrating rustic minds about him i find a very strong confirmation of his sincerity he believes and nobody can produce any positive fact to falsify his belief as for me with this much of endorsement i transmit his story i am a little old now to justify or explain he says he went to sleep on aldington knoll about ten oclock one night it was quite possibly midsummer night though he has never thought of the date and he cannot be sure within a week or so and it was a fine night and windless with a rising moon i have been at the pains to visit this knoll thrice since his story grew up under my persuasions and once i went there in the twilight summer moonrise on what was perhaps a similar night to that of his adventure jupiter was great and splendid above the moon and in the north and north west the sky was green and vividly bright over the sunken sun the knoll stands out bare and bleak under the sky but surrounded at a little distance by dark thickets and as i went up towards it there was a mighty starting and scampering of ghostly or quite invisible rabbits just over the crown of the knoll but nowhere else was a multitudinous thin trumpeting of midges the knoll is i believe an artificial mound the tumulus of some great prehistoric chieftain and surely no man ever chose a more spacious prospect for a sepulchre eastward one sees along the hills to hythe and thence across the channel to where thirty miles and more perhaps away the great white lights by gris nez and boulogne wink and pass and shine westward lies the whole tumbled valley of the weald visible as far as hindhead and leith hill and the valley of the stour opens the downs in the north to interminable hills beyond wye all romney marsh lies southward at ones feet dymchurch and romney and lydd hastings and its hill are in the middle distance and the hills multiply vaguely far beyond where eastbourne rolls up to beachy head and out upon all this it was that skelmersdale wandered being troubled in his earlier love affair and as he says not caring where he went and there he sat down to think it over and so sulking and grieving was overtaken by sleep and so he fell into the fairies power the quarrel that had upset him was some trivial matter enough between himself and the girl at clapton hill to whom he was engaged she was a farmers daughter said skelmersdale and very respectable and no doubt an excellent match for him but both girl and lover were very young and with just that mutual jealousy that intolerantly keen edge of criticism that irrational hunger for a beautiful perfection that life and wisdom do presently and most mercifully dull what the precise matter of quarrel was i have no idea she may have said she liked men in gaiters when he hadnt any gaiters on or he may have said he liked her better in a different sort of hat but however it began it got by a series of clumsy stages to bitterness and tears she no doubt got tearful and smeary and he grew dusty and drooping and she parted with invidious comparisons grave doubts whether she ever had really cared for him and a clear certainty she would never care again and with this sort of thing upon his mind he came out upon aldington knoll grieving and presently after a long interval perhaps quite inexplicably fell asleep he woke to find himself on a softer turf than ever he had slept on before and under the shade of very dark trees that completely hid the sky always indeed in fairyland the sky is hidden it seems except for one night when the fairies were dancing mr skelmersdale during all his time with them never saw a star and of that night i am in doubt whether he was in fairyland proper or out where the rings and rushes are in those low meadows near the railway line at smeeth but it was light under these trees for all that and on the leaves and amidst the turf shone a multitude of glow worms very bright and fine mr skelmersdales first impression was that he was small and the next that quite a number of people still smaller were standing all about him for some reason he says he was neither surprised nor frightened but sat up quite deliberately and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and there all about him stood the smiling elves who had caught him sleeping under their privileges and had brought him into fairyland what these elves were like i have failed to gather so vague and imperfect is his vocabulary and so unobservant of all minor detail does he seem to have been they were clothed in something very light and beautiful that was neither wool nor silk nor leaves nor the petals of flowers they stood all about him as he sat and waked and down the glade towards him down a glow worm avenue and fronted by a star came at once that fairy lady who is the chief personage of his memory and tale of her i gathered more she was clothed in filmy green and about her little waist was a broad silver girdle her hair waved back from her forehead on either side there were curls not too wayward and yet astray and on her brow was a little tiara set with a single star her sleeves were some sort of open sleeves that gave little glimpses of her arms her throat i think was a little displayed because he speaks of the beauty of her neck and chin there was a necklace of coral about her white throat and in her breast a coral coloured flower she had the soft lines of a little child in her chin and cheeks and throat and her eyes i gather were of a kindled brown very soft and straight and sweet under her level brows you see by these particulars how greatly this lady must have loomed in mr skelmersdales picture certain things he tried to express and could not express the way she moved he said several times and i fancy a sort of demure joyousness radiated from this lady and it was in the company of this delightful person as the guest and chosen companion of this delightful person that mr skelmersdale set out to be taken into the intimacies of fairyland she welcomed him gladly and a little warmly i suspect a pressure of his hand in both of hers and a lit face to his after all ten years ago young skelmersdale may have been a very comely youth and once she took his arm and once i think she led him by the hand adown the glade that the glow worms lit just how things chanced and happened there is no telling from mr skelmersdales disarticulated skeleton of description he gives little unsatisfactory glimpses of strange corners and doings of places where there were many fairies together of toadstool things that shone pink of fairy food of which he could only say you should have tasted it and of fairy music like a little musical box that came out of nodding flowers there was a great open place where fairies rode and raced on things but what mr skelmersdale meant by these here things they rode there is no telling larv perhaps or crickets or the little beetles that elude us so abundantly there was a place where water splashed and gigantic kingcups grew and there in the hotter times the fairies bathed together there were games being played and dancing and much elvish love making too i think among the moss branch thickets there can be no doubt that the fairy lady made love to mr skelmersdale and no doubt either that this young man set himself to resist her a time came indeed when she sat on a bank beside him in a quiet secluded place all smelling of vilets and talked to him of love when her voice went low and she whispered said mr skelmersdale and laid er and on my and you know and came close with a soft warm friendly way she ad it was as much as i could do to keep my ead it seems he kept his head to a certain limited unfortunate extent he saw ow the wind was blowing he says and so sitting there in a place all smelling of violets with the touch of this lovely fairy lady about him mr skelmersdale broke it to her gently that he was engaged she had told him she loved him dearly that he was a sweet human lad for her and whatever he would ask of her he should have even his hearts desire and mr skelmersdale who i fancy tried hard to avoid looking at her little lips as they just dropped apart and came together led up to the more intimate question by saying he would like enough capital to start a little shop hed just like to feel he said he had money enough to do that i imagine a little surprise in those brown eyes he talked about but she seemed sympathetic for all that and she asked him many questions about the little shop laughing like all the time so he got to the complete statement of his affianced position and told her all about millie all said i everything said mr skelmersdale just who she was and where she lived and everything about her i sort of felt i ad to all the time i did whatever you want you shall have said the fairy lady thats as good as done you shall feel you have the money just as you wish and now you know you must kiss me and mr skelmersdale pretended not to hear the latter part of her remark and said she was very kind that he really didnt deserve she should be so kind and the fairy lady suddenly came quite close to him and whispered kiss me and said mr skelmersdale like a fool i did there are kisses and kisses i am told and this must have been quite the other sort from millies resonant signals of regard there was something magic in that kiss assuredly it marked a turning point at any rate this is one of the passages that he thought sufficiently important to describe most at length i have tried to get it right i have tried to disentangle it from the hints and gestures through which it came to me but i have no doubt that it was all different from my telling and far finer and sweeter in the soft filtered light and the subtly stirring silences of the fairy glades the fairy lady asked him more about millie and was she very lovely and so on a great many times as to millies loveliness i conceive him answering that she was all right and then or on some such occasion the fairy lady told him she had fallen in love with him as he slept in the moonlight and so he had been brought into fairyland and she had thought not knowing of millie that perhaps he might chance to love her but now you know you cant she said so you must stop with me just a little while and then you must go back to millie she told him that and you know skelmersdale was already in love with her but the pure inertia of his mind kept him in the way he was going i imagine him sitting in a sort of stupefaction amidst all these glowing beautiful things answering about his millie and the little shop he projected and the need of a horse and cart and that absurd state of affairs must have gone on for days and days i see this little lady hovering about him and trying to amuse him too dainty to understand his complexity and too tender to let him go and he you know hypnotised as it were by his earthly position went his way with her hither and thither blind to everything in fairyland but this wonderful intimacy that had come to him it is hard it is impossible to give in print the effect of her radiant sweetness shining through the jungle of poor skelmersdales rough and broken sentences to me at least she shone clear amidst the muddle of his story like a glow worm in a tangle of weeds there must have been many days of things while all this was happening and once i say they danced under the moonlight in the fairy rings that stud the meadows near smeeth but at last it all came to an end she led him into a great cavernous place lit by a red nightlight sort of thing where there were coffers piled on coffers and cups and golden boxes and a great heap of what certainly seemed to all mr skelmersdales senses coined gold there were little gnomes amidst this wealth who saluted her at her coming and stood aside and suddenly she turned on him there with brightly shining eyes and now she said you have been kind to stay with me so long and it is time i let you go you must go back to your millie you must go back to your millie and here just as i promised you they will give you gold she choked like said mr skelmersdale at that i had a sort of feeling he touched his breastbone as though i was fainting here i felt pale you know and shivering and even then i hadnt a thing to say he paused yes i said the scene was beyond his describing but i know that she kissed him good bye and you said nothing nothing he said i stood like a stuffed calf she just looked back once you know and stood smiling like and crying i could see the shine of her eyes and then she was gone and there was all these little fellows bustling about me stuffing my ands and my pockets and the back of my collar and everywhere with gold and then it was when the fairy lady had vanished that mr skelmersdale really understood and knew he suddenly began plucking out the gold they were thrusting upon him and shouting out at them to prevent their giving him more i dont want yer gold i said i avent done yet im not going i want to speak to that fairy lady again i started off to go after her and they held me back yes stuck their little ands against my middle and shoved me back they kept giving me more and more gold until it was running all down my trouser legs and dropping out of my ands i dont want yer gold i says to them i want just to speak to the fairy lady again and did you it came to a tussle before you saw her i didnt see her when i got out from them she wasnt anywhere to be seen so he ran in search of her out of this red lit cave down a long grotto seeking her and thence he came out in a great and desolate place athwart which a swarm of will o the wisps were flying to and fro and about him elves were dancing in derision and the little gnomes came out of the cave after him carrying gold in handfuls and casting it after him shouting fairy love and fairy gold fairy love and fairy gold and when he heard these words came a great fear that it was all over and he lifted up his voice and called to her by her name and suddenly set himself to run down the slope from the mouth of the cavern through a place of thorns and briers calling after her very loudly and often the elves danced about him unheeded pinching and pricking him and the will o the wisps circled round him and dashed into his face and the gnomes pursued him shouting and pelting him with fairy gold as he ran with all this strange rout about him and distracting him suddenly he was knee deep in a swamp and suddenly he was amidst thick twisted roots and he caught his foot in one and stumbled and fell he fell and he rolled over and in that instant he found himself sprawling upon aldington knoll all lonely under the stars he sat up sharply at once he says and found he was very stiff and cold and his clothes were damp with dew the first pallor of dawn and a chilly wind were coming up together he could have believed the whole thing a strangely vivid dream until he thrust his hand into his side pocket and found it stuffed with ashes then he knew for certain it was fairy gold they had given him he could feel all their pinches and pricks still though there was never a bruise upon him and in that manner and so suddenly mr skelmersdale came out of fairyland back into this world of men even then he fancied the thing was but the matter of a night until he returned to the shop at aldington corner and discovered amidst their astonishment that he had been away three weeks lor the trouble i ad said mr skelmersdale how explaining i suppose youve never had anything like that to explain never i said and he expatiated for a time on the behaviour of this person and that one name he avoided for a space and millie said i at last i didnt seem to care a bit for seeing millie he said i expect she seemed changed every one was changed changed for good every one seemed big you know and coarse and their voices seemed loud why the sun when it rose in the morning fair hit me in the eye and millie i didnt want to see millie and when you did i came up against her sunday coming out of church where you been she said and i saw there was a row i didnt care if there was i seemed to forget about her even while she was there a talking to me she was just nothing i couldnt make out whatever i ad seen in er ever or what there could ave been sometimes when she wasnt about i did get back a little but never when she was there then it was always the other came up and blotted her out anyow it didnt break her heart married i asked married er cousin said mr skelmersdale and reflected on the pattern of the tablecloth for a space when he spoke again it was clear that his former sweetheart had clean vanished from his mind and that the talk had brought back the fairy lady triumphant in his heart he talked of her soon he was letting out the oddest things queer love secrets it would be treachery to repeat i think indeed that was the queerest thing in the whole affair to hear that neat little grocer man after his story was done with a glass of whisky beside him and a cigar between his fingers witnessing with sorrow still though now indeed with a time blunted anguish of the inappeasable hunger of the heart that presently came upon him i couldnt eat he said i couldnt sleep i made mistakes in orders and got mixed with change there she was day and night drawing me and drawing me oh i wanted her lord how i wanted her i was up there most evenings i was up there on the knoll often even when it rained i used to walk over the knoll and round it and round it calling for them to let me in shouting near blubbering i was at times daft i was and miserable i kept on saying it was all a mistake and every sunday afternoon i went up there wet and fine though i knew as well as you do it wasnt no good by day and ive tried to go to sleep there he stopped abruptly and decided to drink some whisky ive tried to go to sleep there he said and i could swear his lips trembled ive tried to go to sleep there often and often and you know i couldnt sir never ive thought if i could go to sleep there there might be something but ive sat up there and laid up there and i couldnt not for thinking and longing its the longing ive tried he blew drank up the rest of his whisky spasmodically stood up suddenly and buttoned his jacket staring closely and critically at the cheap oleographs beside the mantel meanwhile the little black notebook in which he recorded the orders of his daily round projected stiffly from his breast pocket when all the buttons were quite done he patted his chest and turned on me suddenly well he said i must be going there was something in his eyes and manner that was too difficult for him to express in words one gets talking he said at last at the door and smiled wanly and so vanished from my eyes and that is the tale of mr skelmersdale in fairyland just as he told it to me the story of the inexperienced ghost the scene amidst which clayton told his last story comes back very vividly to my mind there he sat for the greater part of the time in the corner of the authentic settle by the spacious open fire and sanderson sat beside him smoking the broseley clay that bore his name there was evans and that marvel among actors wish who is also a modest man we had all come down to the mermaid club that saturday morning except clayton who had slept there overnight which indeed gave him the opening of his story we had golfed until golfing was invisible we had dined and we were in that mood of tranquil kindliness when men will suffer a story when clayton began to tell one we naturally supposed he was lying it may be that indeed he was lying of that the reader will speedily be able to judge as well as i he began it is true with an air of matter of fact anecdote but that we thought was only the incurable artifice of the man i say he remarked after a long consideration of the upward rain of sparks from the log that sanderson had thumped you know i was alone here last night except for the domestics said wish who sleep in the other wing said clayton yes well he pulled at his cigar for some little time as though he still hesitated about his confidence then he said quite quietly i caught a ghost caught a ghost did you said sanderson where is it and evans who admires clayton immensely and has been four weeks in america shouted caught a ghost did you clayton im glad of it tell us all about it right now clayton said he would in a minute and asked him to shut the door he looked apologetically at me theres no eavesdropping of course but we dont want to upset our very excellent service with any rumours of ghosts in the place theres too much shadow and oak panelling to trifle with that and this you know wasnt a regular ghost i dont think it will come again ever you mean to say you didnt keep it said sanderson i hadnt the heart to said clayton and sanderson said he was surprised we laughed and clayton looked aggrieved i know he said with a flicker of a smile but the fact is it really was a ghost and im as sure of it as i am that i am talking to you now im not joking i mean what i say sanderson drew deeply at his pipe with one reddish eye on clayton and then emitted a thin jet of smoke more eloquent than many words clayton ignored the comment it is the strangest thing that has ever happened in my life you know i never believed in ghosts or anything of the sort before ever and then you know i bag one in a corner and the whole business is in my hands he meditated still more profoundly and produced and began to pierce a second cigar with a curious little stabber he affected you talked to it asked wish for the space probably of an hour chatty i said joining the party of the sceptics the poor devil was in trouble said clayton bowed over his cigar end and with the very faintest note of reproof sobbing some one asked clayton heaved a realistic sigh at the memory good lord he said yes and then poor fellow yes where did you strike it asked evans in his best american accent i never realised said clayton ignoring him the poor sort of thing a ghost might be and he hung us up again for a time while he sought for matches in his pocket and lit and warmed to his cigar i took an advantage he reflected at last we were none of us in a hurry a character he said remains just the same character for all that its been disembodied thats a thing we too often forget people with a certain strength or fixity of purpose may have ghosts of a certain strength and fixity of purpose most haunting ghosts you know must be as one idead as monomaniacs and as obstinate as mules to come back again and again this poor creature wasnt he suddenly looked up rather queerly and his eye went round the room i say it he said in all kindliness but that is the plain truth of the case even at the first glance he struck me as weak he punctuated with the help of his cigar i came upon him you know in the long passage his back was towards me and i saw him first right off i knew him for a ghost he was transparent and whitish clean through his chest i could see the glimmer of the little window at the end and not only his physique but his attitude struck me as being weak he looked you know as though he didnt know in the slightest whatever he meant to do one hand was on the panelling and the other fluttered to his mouth like so what sort of physique said sanderson lean you know that sort of young mans neck that has two great flutings down the back here and here so and a little meanish head with scrubby hair and rather bad ears shoulders bad narrower than the hips turndown collar ready made short jacket trousers baggy and a little frayed at the heels thats how he took me i came very quietly up the staircase i did not carry a light you know the candles are on the landing table and there is that lamp and i was in my list slippers and i saw him as i came up i stopped dead at that taking him in i wasnt a bit afraid i think that in most of these affairs one is never nearly so afraid or excited as one imagines one would be i was surprised and interested i thought good lord heres a ghost at last and i havent believed for a moment in ghosts during the last five and twenty years um said wish i suppose i wasnt on the landing a moment before he found out i was there he turned on me sharply and i saw the face of an immature young man a weak nose a scrubby little moustache a feeble chin so for an instant we stood he looking over his shoulder at me and regarded one another then he seemed to remember his high calling he turned round drew himself up projected his face raised his arms spread his hands in approved ghost fashion came towards me as he did so his little jaw dropped and he emitted a faint drawn out boo no it wasnt not a bit dreadful id dined id had a bottle of champagne and being all alone perhaps two or three perhaps even four or five whiskies so i was as solid as rocks and no more frightened than if id been assailed by a frog boo i said nonsense you dont belong to this place what are you doing here i could see him wince boo oo he said boo be hanged are you a member i said and just to show i didnt care a pin for him i stepped through a corner of him and made to light my candle are you a member i repeated looking at him sideways he moved a little so as to stand clear of me and his bearing became crestfallen no he said in answer to the persistent interrogation of my eye im not a member im a ghost well that doesnt give you the run of the mermaid club is there any one you want to see or anything of that sort and doing it as steadily as possible for fear that he should mistake the carelessness of whisky for the distraction of fear i got my candle alight i turned on him holding it what are you doing here i said he had dropped his hands and stopped his booing and there he stood abashed and awkward the ghost of a weak silly aimless young man im haunting he said you havent any business to i said in a quiet voice im a ghost he said as if in defence that may be but you havent any business to haunt here this is a respectable private club people often stop here with nursemaids and children and going about in the careless way you do some poor little mite could easily come upon you and be scared out of her wits i suppose you didnt think of that no sir he said i didnt you should have done you havent any claim on the place have you werent murdered here or anything of that sort none sir but i thought as it was old and oak panelled thats no excuse i regarded him firmly your coming here is a mistake i said in a tone of friendly superiority i feigned to see if i had my matches and then looked up at him frankly if i were you i wouldnt wait for cock crow id vanish right away he looked embarrassed the fact is sir he began id vanish i said driving it home the fact is sir that somehow i cant you cant no sir theres something ive forgotten ive been hanging about here since midnight last night hiding in the cupboards of the empty bedrooms and things like that im flurried ive never come haunting before and it seems to put me out put you out yes sir ive tried to do it several times and it doesnt come off theres some little thing has slipped me and i cant get back that you know rather bowled me over he looked at me in such an abject way that for the life of me i couldnt keep up quite the high hectoring vein i had adopted thats queer i said and as i spoke i fancied i heard some one moving about down below come into my room and tell me more about it i said i didnt of course understand this and i tried to take him by the arm but of course you might as well have tried to take hold of a puff of smoke i had forgotten my number i think anyhow i remember going into several bedrooms it was lucky i was the only soul in that wing until i saw my traps here we are i said and sat down in the arm chair sit down and tell me all about it it seems to me you have got yourself into a jolly awkward position old chap well he said he wouldnt sit down hed prefer to flit up and down the room if it was all the same to me and so he did and in a little while we were deep in a long and serious talk and presently you know something of those whiskies and sodas evaporated out of me and i began to realise just a little what a thundering rum and weird business it was that i was in there he was semi transparent the proper conventional phantom and noiseless except for his ghost of a voice flitting to and fro in that nice clean chintz hung old bedroom you could see the gleam of the copper candlesticks through him and the lights on the brass fender and the corners of the framed engravings on the wall and there he was telling me all about this wretched little life of his that had recently ended on earth he hadnt a particularly honest face you know but being transparent of course he couldnt avoid telling the truth eh said wish suddenly sitting up in his chair what said clayton being transparent couldnt avoid telling the truth i dont see it said wish i dont see it said clayton with inimitable assurance but it is so i can assure you nevertheless i dont believe he got once a nails breadth off the bible truth he told me how he had been killed he went down into a london basement with a candle to look for a leakage of gas and described himself as a senior english master in a london private school when that release occurred poor wretch said i thats what i thought and the more he talked the more i thought it there he was purposeless in life and purposeless out of it he talked of his father and mother and his schoolmaster and all who had ever been anything to him in the world meanly he had been too sensitive too nervous none of them had ever valued him properly or understood him he said he had never had a real friend in the world i think he had never had a success he had shirked games and failed examinations its like that with some people he said whenever i got into the examination room or anywhere everything seemed to go engaged to be married of course to another over sensitive person i suppose when the indiscretion with the gas escape ended his affairs and where are you now i asked not in he wasnt clear on that point at all the impression he gave me was of a sort of vague intermediate state a special reserve for souls too non existent for anything so positive as either sin or virtue i dont know he was much too egotistical and unobservant to give me any clear idea of the kind of place kind of country there is on the other side of things wherever he was he seems to have fallen in with a set of kindred spirits ghosts of weak cockney young men who were on a footing of christian names and among these there was certainly a lot of talk about going haunting and things like that yes going haunting they seemed to think haunting a tremendous adventure and most of them funked it all the time and so primed you know he had come but really said wish to the fire these are the impressions he gave me anyhow said clayton modestly i may of course have been in a rather uncritical state but that was the sort of background he gave to himself he kept flitting up and down with his thin voice going talking talking about his wretched self and never a word of clear firm statement from first to last he was thinner and sillier and more pointless than if he had been real and alive only then you know he would not have been in my bedroom here if he had been alive i should have kicked him out of course said evans there are poor mortals like that and theres just as much chance of their having ghosts as the rest of us i admitted what gave a sort of point to him you know was the fact that he did seem within limits to have found himself out the mess he had made of haunting had depressed him terribly he had been told it would be a lark he had come expecting it to be a lark and here it was nothing but another failure added to his record he proclaimed himself an utter out and out failure he said and i can quite believe it that he had never tried to do anything all his life that he hadnt made a perfect mess of and through all the wastes of eternity he never would if he had had sympathy perhaps he paused at that and stood regarding me he remarked that strange as it might seem to me nobody not any one ever had given him the amount of sympathy i was doing now i could see what he wanted straight away and i determined to head him off at once i may be a brute you know but being the only real friend the recipient of the confidences of one of these egotistical weaklings ghost or body is beyond my physical endurance i got up briskly dont you brood on these things too much i said the thing youve got to do is to get out of this get out of this sharp you pull yourself together and try i cant he said you try i said and try he did try said sanderson how passes said clayton passes complicated series of gestures and passes with the hands thats how he had come in and thats how he had to get out again lord what a business i had but how could any series of passes i began my dear man said clayton turning on me and putting a great emphasis on certain words you want everything clear i dont know how all i know is that you do that he did anyhow at least after a fearful time you know he got his passes right and suddenly disappeared did you said sanderson slowly observe the passes yes said clayton and seemed to think it was tremendously queer he said there we were i and this thin vague ghost in that silent room in this silent empty inn in this silent little friday night town not a sound except our voices and a faint panting he made when he swung there was the bedroom candle and one candle on the dressing table alight that was all sometimes one or other would flare up into a tall lean astonished flame for a space and queer things happened i cant he said i shall never and suddenly he sat down on a little chair at the foot of the bed and began to sob and sob lord what a harrowing whimpering thing he seemed you pull yourself together i said and tried to pat him on the back and my confounded hand went through him by that time you know i wasnt nearly so massive as i had been on the landing i got the queerness of it full i remember snatching back my hand out of him as it were with a little thrill and walking over to the dressing table you pull yourself together i said to him and try and in order to encourage and help him i began to try as well what said sanderson the passes yes the passes but i said moved by an idea that eluded me for a space this is interesting said sanderson with his finger in his pipe bowl you mean to say this ghost of yours gave away did his level best to give away the whole confounded barrier yes he didnt said wish he couldnt or youd have gone there too thats precisely it i said finding my elusive idea put into words for me that is precisely it said clayton with thoughtful eyes upon the fire for just a little while there was silence and at last he did it said sanderson at last he did it i had to keep him up to it hard but he did it at last rather suddenly he despaired we had a scene and then he got up abruptly and asked me to go through the whole performance slowly so that he might see i believe he said if i could see i should spot what was wrong at once and he did i know he said what do you know said i i know he repeated then he said peevishly i cant do it if you look at me i really cant its been that partly all along im such a nervous fellow that you put me out well we had a bit of an argument naturally i wanted to see but he was as obstinate as a mule and suddenly i had come over as tired as a dog he tired me out all right i said i wont look at you and turned towards the mirror on the wardrobe by the bed he started off very fast i tried to follow him by looking in the looking glass to see just what it was had hung round went his arms and hands so and so and so and then with a rush came to the last gesture of all you stand erect and open out your arms and so dont you know he stood and then he didnt he didnt he wasnt i wheeled round from the looking glass to him there was nothing i was alone with the flaring candles and a staggering mind what had happened had anything happened had i been dreaming and then with an absurd note of finality about it the clock upon the landing discovered the moment was ripe for striking one so ping and i was as grave and sober as a judge with all my champagne and whisky gone into the vast serene feeling queer you know confoundedly queer queer good lord he regarded his cigar ash for a moment thats all that happened he said and then you went to bed asked evans what else was there to do i looked wish in the eye we wanted to scoff and there was something something perhaps in claytons voice and manner that hampered our desire and about these passes said sanderson i believe i could do them now oh said sanderson and produced a pen knife and set himself to grub the dottel out of the bowl of his clay why dont you do them now said sanderson shutting his pen knife with a click thats what im going to do said clayton they wont work said evans if they do i suggested you know id rather you didnt said wish stretching out his legs why asked evans id rather he didnt said wish but he hasnt got em right said sanderson plugging too much tobacco into his pipe all the same id rather he didnt said wish we argued with wish he said that for clayton to go through those gestures was like mocking a serious matter but you dont believe i said wish glanced at clayton who was staring into the fire weighing something in his mind i do more than half anyhow i do said wish clayton said i youre too good a liar for us most of it was all right but that disappearance happened to be convincing tell us its a tale of cock and bull he stood up without heeding me took the middle of the hearthrug and faced me for a moment he regarded his feet thoughtfully and then for all the rest of the time his eyes were on the opposite wall with an intent expression he raised his two hands slowly to the level of his eyes and so began now sanderson is a freemason a member of the lodge of the four kings which devotes itself so ably to the study and elucidation of all the mysteries of masonry past and present and among the students of this lodge sanderson is by no means the least he followed claytons motions with a singular interest in his reddish eye thats not bad he said when it was done you really do you know put things together clayton in a most amazing fashion but theres one little detail out i know said clayton i believe i could tell you which well this said clayton and did a queer little twist and writhing and thrust of the hands yes that you know was what he couldnt get right said clayton but how do you most of this business and particularly how you invented it i dont understand at all said sanderson but just that phase i do he reflected these happen to be a series of gestures connected with a certain branch of esoteric masonry probably you know or else how he reflected still further i do not see i can do any harm in telling you just the proper twist after all if you know you know if you dont you dont i know nothing said clayton except what the poor devil let out last night well anyhow said sanderson and placed his churchwarden very carefully upon the shelf over the fireplace then very rapidly he gesticulated with his hands so said clayton repeating so said sanderson and took his pipe in hand again ah now said clayton i can do the whole thing right he stood up before the waning fire and smiled at us all but i think there was just a little hesitation in his smile if i begin he said i wouldnt begin said wish its all right said evans matter is indestructible you dont think any jiggery pokery of this sort is going to snatch clayton into the world of shades not it you may try clayton so far as im concerned until your arms drop off at the wrists i dont believe that said wish and stood up and put his arm on claytons shoulder youve made me half believe in that story somehow and i dont want to see the thing done goodness said i heres wish frightened i am said wish with real or admirably feigned intensity i believe that if he goes through these motions right hell go hell not do anything of the sort i cried theres only one way out of this world for men and clayton is thirty years from that besides and such a ghost do you think wish interrupted me by moving he walked out from among our chairs and stopped beside the table and stood there clayton he said youre a fool clayton with a humorous light in his eyes smiled back at him wish he said is right and all you others are wrong i shall go i shall get to the end of these passes and as the last swish whistles through the air presto this hearthrug will be vacant the room will be blank amazement and a respectably dressed gentleman of fifteen stone will plump into the world of shades im certain so will you be i decline to argue further let the thing be tried no said wish and made a step and ceased and clayton raised his hands once more to repeat the spirits passing by that time you know we were all in a state of tension largely because of the behaviour of wish we sat all of us with our eyes on clayton i at least with a sort of tight stiff feeling about me as though from the back of my skull to the middle of my thighs my body had been changed to steel and there with a gravity that was imperturbably serene clayton bowed and swayed and waved his hands and arms before us as he drew towards the end one piled up one tingled in ones teeth the last gesture i have said was to swing the arms out wide open with the face held up and when at last he swung out to this closing gesture i ceased even to breathe it was ridiculous of course but you know that ghost story feeling it was after dinner in a queer old shadowy house would he after all there he stood for one stupendous moment with his arms open and his upturned face assured and bright in the glare of the hanging lamp we hung through that moment as if it were an age and then came from all of us something that was half a sigh of infinite relief and half a reassuring no for visibly he wasnt going it was all nonsense he had told an idle story and carried it almost to conviction that was all and then in that moment the face of clayton changed it changed it changed as a lit house changes when its lights are suddenly extinguished his eyes were suddenly eyes that were fixed his smile was frozen on his lips and he stood there still he stood there very gently swaying that moment too was an age and then you know chairs were scraping things were falling and we were all moving his knees seemed to give and he fell forward and evans rose and caught him in his arms it stunned us all for a minute i suppose no one said a coherent thing we believed it yet could not believe it i came out of a muddled stupefaction to find myself kneeling beside him and his vest and shirt were torn open and sandersons hand lay on his heart well the simple fact before us could very well wait our convenience there was no hurry for us to comprehend it lay there for an hour it lies athwart my memory black and amazing still to this day clayton had indeed passed into the world that lies so near to and so far from our own and he had gone thither by the only road that mortal man may take but whether he did indeed pass there by that poor ghosts incantation or whether he was stricken suddenly by apoplexy in the midst of an idle tale as the coroners jury would have us believe is no matter for my judging it is just one of those inexplicable riddles that must remain unsolved until the final solution of all things shall come all i certainly know is that in the very moment in the very instant of concluding those passes he changed and staggered and fell down before us dead the stolen body mr bessel was the senior partner in the firm of bessel hart and brown of st pauls churchyard and for many years he was well known among those interested in psychical research as a liberal minded and conscientious investigator he was an unmarried man and instead of living in the suburbs after the fashion of his class he occupied rooms in the albany near piccadilly he was particularly interested in the questions of thought transference and of apparitions of the living and in november he commenced a series of experiments in conjunction with mr vincey of staple inn in order to test the alleged possibility of projecting an apparition of oneself by force of will through space their experiments were conducted in the following manner at a pre arranged hour mr bessel shut himself in one of his rooms in the albany and mr vincey in his sitting room in staple inn and each then fixed his mind as resolutely as possible on the other mr bessel had acquired the art of self hypnotism and so far as he could he attempted first to hypnotise himself and then to project himself as a phantom of the living across the intervening space of nearly two miles into mr vinceys apartment on several evenings this was tried without any satisfactory result but on the fifth or sixth occasion mr vincey did actually see or imagine he saw an apparition of mr bessel standing in his room he states that the appearance although brief was very vivid and real he noticed that mr bessels face was white and his expression anxious and moreover that his hair was disordered for a moment mr vincey in spite of his state of expectation was too surprised to speak or move and in that moment it seemed to him as though the figure glanced over its shoulder and incontinently vanished it had been arranged that an attempt should be made to photograph any phantasm seen but mr vincey had not the instant presence of mind to snap the camera that lay ready on the table beside him and when he did so he was too late greatly elated however even by this partial success he made a note of the exact time and at once took a cab to the albany to inform mr bessel of this result he was surprised to find mr bessels outer door standing open to the night and the inner apartments lit and in an extraordinary disorder an empty champagne magnum lay smashed upon the floor its neck had been broken off against the inkpot on the bureau and lay beside it an octagonal occasional table which carried a bronze statuette and a number of choice books had been rudely overturned and down the primrose paper of the wall inky fingers had been drawn as it seemed for the mere pleasure of defilement one of the delicate chintz curtains had been violently torn from its rings and thrust upon the fire so that the smell of its smouldering filled the room indeed the whole place was disarranged in the strangest fashion for a few minutes mr vincey who had entered sure of finding mr bessel in his easy chair awaiting him could scarcely believe his eyes and stood staring helplessly at these unanticipated things then full of a vague sense of calamity he sought the porter at the entrance lodge where is mr bessel he asked do you know that all the furniture is broken in mr bessels room the porter said nothing but obeying his gestures came at once to mr bessels apartment to see the state of affairs this settles it he said surveying the lunatic confusion i didnt know of this mr bessels gone off hes mad he then proceeded to tell mr vincey that about half an hour previously that is to say at about the time of mr bessels apparition in mr vinceys rooms the missing gentleman had rushed out of the gates of the albany into vigo street hatless and with disordered hair and had vanished into the direction of bond street and as he went past me said the porter he laughed a sort of gasping laugh with his mouth open and his eyes glaring i tell you sir he fair scared me like this according to his imitation it was anything but a pleasant laugh he waved his hand with all his fingers crooked and clawing like that and he said in a sort of fierce whisper life just that one word life dear me said mr vincey tut tut and dear me he could think of nothing else to say he was naturally very much surprised he turned from the room to the porter and from the porter to the room in the gravest perplexity beyond his suggestion that probably mr bessel would come back presently and explain what had happened their conversation was unable to proceed it might be a sudden toothache said the porter a very sudden and violent toothache jumping on him suddenly like and driving him wild ive broken things myself before now in such a case he thought if it was why should he say life to me as he went past mr vincey did not know mr bessel did not return and at last mr vincey having done some more helpless staring and having addressed a note of brief inquiry and left it in a conspicuous position on the bureau returned in a very perplexed frame of mind to his own premises in staple inn this affair had given him a shock he was at a loss to account for mr bessels conduct on any sane hypothesis he tried to read but he could not do so he went for a short walk and was so preoccupied that he narrowly escaped a cab at the top of chancery lane and at last a full hour before his usual time he went to bed for a considerable time he could not sleep because of his memory of the silent confusion of mr bessels apartment and when at length he did attain an uneasy slumber it was at once disturbed by a very vivid and distressing dream of mr bessel he saw mr bessel gesticulating wildly and with his face white and contorted and inexplicably mingled with his appearance suggested perhaps by his gestures was an intense fear an urgency to act he even believes that he heard the voice of his fellow experimenter calling distressfully to him though at the time he considered this to be an illusion the vivid impression remained though mr vincey awoke for a space he lay awake and trembling in the darkness possessed with that vague unaccountable terror of unknown possibilities that comes out of dreams upon even the bravest men but at last he roused himself and turned over and went to sleep again only for the dream to return with enhanced vividness he awoke with such a strong conviction that mr bessel was in overwhelming distress and need of help that sleep was no longer possible he was persuaded that his friend had rushed out to some dire calamity for a time he lay reasoning vainly against this belief but at last he gave way to it he arose against all reason lit his gas and dressed and set out through the deserted streets deserted save for a noiseless policeman or so and the early news carts towards vigo street to inquire if mr bessel had returned but he never got there as he was going down long acre some unaccountable impulse turned him aside out of that street towards covent garden which was just waking to its nocturnal activities he saw the market in front of him a queer effect of glowing yellow lights and busy black figures he became aware of a shouting and perceived a figure turn the corner by the hotel and run swiftly towards him he knew at once that it was mr bessel but it was mr bessel transfigured he was hatless and dishevelled his collar was torn open he grasped a bone handled walking cane near the ferrule end and his mouth was pulled awry and he ran with agile strides very rapidly their encounter was the affair of an instant bessel cried vincey the running man gave no sign of recognition either of mr vincey or of his own name instead he cut at his friend savagely with the stick hitting him in the face within an inch of the eye mr vincey stunned and astonished staggered back lost his footing and fell heavily on the pavement it seemed to him that mr bessel leapt over him as he fell when he looked again mr bessel had vanished and a policeman and a number of garden porters and salesmen were rushing past towards long acre in hot pursuit with the assistance of several passers by for the whole street was speedily alive with running people mr vincey struggled to his feet he at once became the centre of a crowd greedy to see his injury a multitude of voices competed to reassure him of his safety and then to tell him of the behaviour of the madman as they regarded mr bessel he had suddenly appeared in the middle of the market screaming life life striking right and left with a blood stained walking stick and dancing and shouting with laughter at each successful blow a lad and two women had broken heads and he had smashed a mans wrist a little child had been knocked insensible and for a time he had driven every one before him so furious and resolute had his behaviour been then he made a raid upon a coffee stall hurled its paraffin flare through the window of the post office and fled laughing after stunning the foremost of the two policemen who had the pluck to charge him mr vinceys first impulse was naturally to join in the pursuit of his friend in order if possible to save him from the violence of the indignant people but his action was slow the blow had half stunned him and while this was still no more than a resolution came the news shouted through the crowd that mr bessel had eluded his pursuers at first mr vincey could scarcely credit this but the universality of the report and presently the dignified return of two futile policemen convinced him after some aimless inquiries he returned towards staple inn padding a handkerchief to a now very painful nose he was angry and astonished and perplexed it appeared to him indisputable that mr bessel must have gone violently mad in the midst of his experiment in thought transference but why that should make him appear with a sad white face in mr vinceys dreams seemed a problem beyond solution he racked his brains in vain to explain this it seemed to him at last that not simply mr bessel but the order of things must be insane but he could think of nothing to do he shut himself carefully into his room lit his fire it was a gas fire with asbestos bricks and fearing fresh dreams if he went to bed remained bathing his injured face or holding up books in a vain attempt to read until dawn throughout that vigil he had a curious persuasion that mr bessel was endeavouring to speak to him but he would not let himself attend to any such belief about dawn his physical fatigue asserted itself and he went to bed and slept at last in spite of dreaming he rose late unrested and anxious and in considerable facial pain the morning papers had no news of mr bessels aberration it had come too late for them mr vinceys perplexities to which the fever of his bruise added fresh irritation became at last intolerable and after a fruitless visit to the albany he went down to st pauls churchyard to mr hart mr bessels partner and so far as mr vincey knew his nearest friend he was surprised to learn that mr hart although he knew nothing of the outbreak had also been disturbed by a vision the very vision that mr vincey had seen mr bessel white and dishevelled pleading earnestly by his gestures for help that was his impression of the import of his signs i was just going to look him up in the albany when you arrived said mr hart i was so sure of something being wrong with him as the outcome of their consultation the two gentlemen decided to inquire at scotland yard for news of their missing friend he is bound to be laid by the heels said mr hart he cant go on at that pace for long but the police authorities had not laid mr bessel by the heels they confirmed mr vinceys overnight experiences and added fresh circumstances some of an even graver character than those he knew a list of smashed glass along the upper half of tottenham court road an attack upon a policeman in hampstead road and an atrocious assault upon a woman all these outrages were committed between half past twelve and a quarter to two in the morning and between those hours and indeed from the very moment of mr bessels first rush from his rooms at half past nine in the evening they could trace the deepening violence of his fantastic career for the last hour at least from before one that is until a quarter to two he had run amuck through london eluding with amazing agility every effort to stop or capture him but after a quarter to two he had vanished up to that hour witnesses were multitudinous dozens of people had seen him fled from him or pursued him and then things suddenly came to an end at a quarter to two he had been seen running down the euston road towards baker street flourishing a can of burning colza oil and jerking splashes of flame therefrom at the windows of the houses he passed but none of the policemen on euston road beyond the waxwork exhibition nor any of those in the side streets down which he must have passed had he left the euston road had seen anything of him abruptly he disappeared nothing of his subsequent doings came to light in spite of the keenest inquiry here was a fresh astonishment for mr vincey he had found considerable comfort in mr harts conviction he is bound to be laid by the heels before long and in that assurance he had been able to suspend his mental perplexities but any fresh development seemed destined to add new impossibilities to a pile already heaped beyond the powers of his acceptance he found himself doubting whether his memory might not have played him some grotesque trick debating whether any of these things could possibly have happened and in the afternoon he hunted up mr hart again to share the intolerable weight on his mind he found mr hart engaged with a well known private detective but as that gentleman accomplished nothing in this case we need not enlarge upon his proceedings all that day mr bessels whereabouts eluded an unceasingly active inquiry and all that night and all that day there was a persuasion in the back of mr vinceys mind that mr bessel sought his attention and all through the night mr bessel with a tear stained face of anguish pursued him through his dreams and whenever he saw mr bessel in his dreams he also saw a number of other faces vague but malignant that seemed to be pursuing mr bessel it was on the following day sunday that mr vincey recalled certain remarkable stories of mrs bullock the medium who was then attracting attention for the first time in london he determined to consult her she was staying at the house of that well known inquirer dr wilson paget and mr vincey although he had never met that gentleman before repaired to him forthwith with the intention of invoking her help but scarcely had he mentioned the name of bessel when doctor paget interrupted him last night just at the end he said we had a communication he left the room and returned with a slate on which were certain words written in a handwriting shaky indeed but indisputably the handwriting of mr bessel how did you get this said mr vincey do you mean we got it last night said doctor paget with numerous interruptions from mr vincey he proceeded to explain how the writing had been obtained it appears that in her sances mrs bullock passes into a condition of trance her eyes rolling up in a strange way under her eyelids and her body becoming rigid she then begins to talk very rapidly usually in voices other than her own at the same time one or both of her hands may become active and if slates and pencils are provided they will then write messages simultaneously with and quite independently of the flow of words from her mouth by many she is considered an even more remarkable medium than the celebrated mrs piper it was one of these messages the one written by her left hand that mr vincey now had before him it consisted of eight words written disconnectedly george bessel trial excavn baker street help starvation curiously enough neither doctor paget nor the two other inquirers who were present had heard of the disappearance of mr bessel the news of it appeared only in the evening papers of saturday and they had put the message aside with many others of a vague and enigmatical sort that mrs bullock has from time to time delivered when doctor paget heard mr vinceys story he gave himself at once with great energy to the pursuit of this clue to the discovery of mr bessel it would serve no useful purpose here to describe the inquiries of mr vincey and himself suffice it that the clue was a genuine one and that mr bessel was actually discovered by its aid he was found at the bottom of a detached shaft which had been sunk and abandoned at the commencement of the work for the new electric railway near baker street station his arm and leg and two ribs were broken the shaft is protected by a hoarding nearly ft high and over this incredible as it seems mr bessel a stout middle aged gentleman must have scrambled in order to fall down the shaft he was saturated in colza oil and the smashed tin lay beside him but luckily the flame had been extinguished by his fall and his madness had passed from him altogether but he was of course terribly enfeebled and at the sight of his rescuers he gave way to hysterical weeping in view of the deplorable state of his flat he was taken to the house of dr hatton in upper baker street here he was subjected to a sedative treatment and anything that might recall the violent crisis through which he had passed was carefully avoided but on the second day he volunteered a statement since that occasion mr bessel has several times repeated this statement to myself among other people varying the details as the narrator of real experiences always does but never by any chance contradicting himself in any particular and the statement he makes is in substance as follows in order to understand it clearly it is necessary to go back to his experiments with mr vincey before his remarkable attack mr bessels first attempts at self projection in his experiments with mr vincey were as the reader will remember unsuccessful but through all of them he was concentrating all his power and will upon getting out of the body willing it with all my might he says at last almost against expectation came success and mr bessel asserts that he being alive did actually by an effort of will leave his body and pass into some place or state outside this world the release was he asserts instantaneous at one moment i was seated in my chair with my eyes tightly shut my hands gripping the arms of the chair doing all i could to concentrate my mind on vincey and then i perceived myself outside my body saw my body near me but certainly not containing me with the hands relaxing and the head drooping forward on the breast nothing shakes him in his assurance of that release he describes in a quiet matter of fact way the new sensation he experienced he felt he had become impalpable so much he had expected but he had not expected to find himself enormously large so however it would seem he became i was a great cloud if i may express it that way anchored to my body it appeared to me at first as if i had discovered a greater self of which the conscious being in my brain was only a little part i saw the albany and piccadilly and regent street and all the rooms and places in the houses very minute and very bright and distinct spread out below me like a little city seen from a balloon every now and then vague shapes like drifting wreaths of smoke made the vision a little indistinct but at first i paid little heed to them the thing that astonished me most and which astonishes me still is that i saw quite distinctly the insides of the houses as well as the streets saw little people dining and talking in the private houses men and women dining playing billiards and drinking in restaurants and hotels and several places of entertainment crammed with people it was like watching the affairs of a glass hive such were mr bessels exact words as i took them down when he told me the story quite forgetful of mr vincey he remained for a space observing these things impelled by curiosity he says he stooped down and with the shadowy arm he found himself possessed of attempted to touch a man walking along vigo street but he could not do so though his finger seemed to pass through the man something prevented his doing this but what it was he finds it hard to describe he compares the obstacle to a sheet of glass i felt as a kitten may feel he said when it goes for the first time to pat its reflection in a mirror again and again on the occasion when i heard him tell this story mr bessel returned to that comparison of the sheet of glass yet it was not altogether a precise comparison because as the reader will speedily see there were interruptions of this generally impermeable resistance means of getting through the barrier to the material world again but naturally there is a very great difficulty in expressing these unprecedented impressions in the language of everyday experience a thing that impressed him instantly and which weighed upon him throughout all this experience was the stillness of this place he was in a world without sound at first mr bessels mental state was an unemotional wonder his thought chiefly concerned itself with where he might be he was out of the body out of his material body at any rate but that was not all he believes and i for one believe also that he was somewhere out of space as we understand it altogether by a strenuous effort of will he had passed out of his body into a world beyond this world a world undreamt of yet lying so close to it and so strangely situated with regard to it that all things on this earth are clearly visible both from without and from within in this other world about us for a long time as it seemed to him this realisation occupied his mind to the exclusion of all other matters and then he recalled the engagement with mr vincey to which this astonishing experience was after all but a prelude he turned his mind to locomotion in this new body in which he found himself for a time he was unable to shift himself from his attachment to his earthly carcass for a time this new strange cloud body of his simply swayed contracted expanded coiled and writhed with his efforts to free himself and then quite suddenly the link that bound him snapped for a moment everything was hidden by what appeared to be whirling spheres of dark vapour and then through a momentary gap he saw his drooping body collapse limply saw his lifeless head drop sideways and found he was driving along like a huge cloud in a strange place of shadowy clouds that had the luminous intricacy of london spread like a model below but now he was aware that the fluctuating vapour about him was something more than vapour and the temerarious excitement of his first essay was shot with fear for he perceived at first indistinctly and then suddenly very clearly that he was surrounded by faces that each roll and coil of the seeming cloud stuff was a face and such faces faces of thin shadow faces of gaseous tenuity faces like those faces that glare with intolerable strangeness upon the sleeper in the evil hours of his dreams evil greedy eyes that were full of a covetous curiosity faces with knit brows and snarling smiling lips their vague hands clutched at mr bessel as he passed and the rest of their bodies was but an elusive streak of trailing darkness never a word they said never a sound from the mouths that seemed to gibber all about him they pressed in that dreamy silence passing freely through the dim mistiness that was his body gathering ever more numerously about him and the shadowy mr bessel now suddenly fear stricken drove through the silent active multitude of eyes and clutching hands so inhuman were these faces so malignant their staring eyes and shadowy clawing gestures that it did not occur to mr bessel to attempt intercourse with these drifting creatures idiot phantoms they seemed children of vain desire beings unborn and forbidden the boon of being whose only expressions and gestures told of the envy and craving for life that was their one link with existence it says much for his resolution that amidst the swarming cloud of these noiseless spirits of evil he could still think of mr vincey he made a violent effort of will and found himself he knew not how stooping towards staple inn saw vincey sitting attentive and alert in his arm chair by the fire and clustering also about him as they clustered ever about all that lives and breathes was another multitude of these vain voiceless shadows longing desiring seeking some loophole into life for a space mr bessel sought ineffectually to attract his friends attention he tried to get in front of his eyes to move the objects in his room to touch him but mr vincey remained unaffected ignorant of the being that was so close to his own the strange something that mr bessel has compared to a sheet of glass separated them impermeably and at last mr bessel did a desperate thing i have told how that in some strange way he could see not only the outside of a man as we see him but within he extended his shadowy hand and thrust his vague black fingers as it seemed through the heedless brain then suddenly mr vincey started like a man who recalls his attention from wandering thoughts and it seemed to mr bessel that a little dark red body situated in the middle of mr vinceys brain swelled and glowed as he did so since that experience he has been shown anatomical figures of the brain and he knows now that this is that useless structure as doctors call it the pineal eye for strange as it will seem to many we have deep in our brains where it cannot possibly see any earthly light an eye at the time this with the rest of the internal anatomy of the brain was quite new to him at the sight of its changed appearance however he thrust forth his finger and rather fearful still of the consequences touched this little spot and instantly mr vincey started and mr bessel knew that he was seen and at that instant it came to mr bessel that evil had happened to his body and behold a great wind blew through all that world of shadows and tore him away so strong was this persuasion that he thought no more of mr vincey but turned about forthwith and all the countless faces drove back with him like leaves before a gale but he returned too late in an instant he saw the body that he had left inert and collapsed lying indeed like the body of a man just dead had arisen by virtue of some strength and will beyond his own it stood with staring eyes stretching its limbs in dubious fashion for a moment he watched it in wild dismay and then he stooped towards it but the pane of glass had closed against him again and he was foiled he beat himself passionately against this and all about him the spirits of evil grinned and pointed and mocked he gave way to furious anger he compares himself to a bird that has fluttered heedlessly into a room and is beating at the window pane that holds it back from freedom and behold the little body that had once been his was now dancing with delight he saw it shouting though he could not hear its shouts he saw the violence of its movements grow he watched it fling his cherished furniture about in the mad delight of existence rend his books apart smash bottles drink heedlessly from the jagged fragments leap and smite in a passionate acceptance of living he watched these actions in paralysed astonishment then once more he hurled himself against the impassable barrier and then with all that crew of mocking ghosts about him hurried back in dire confusion to vincey to tell him of the outrage that had come upon him but the brain of vincey was now closed against apparitions and the disembodied mr bessel pursued him in vain as he hurried out into holborn to call a cab foiled and terror stricken mr bessel swept back again to find his desecrated body whooping in a glorious frenzy down the burlington arcade and now the attentive reader begins to understand mr bessels interpretation of the first part of this strange story the being whose frantic rush through london had inflicted so much injury and disaster had indeed mr bessels body but it was not mr bessel it was an evil spirit out of that strange world beyond existence into which mr bessel had so rashly ventured for twenty hours it held possession of him and for all those twenty hours the dispossessed spirit body of mr bessel was going to and fro in that unheard of middle world of shadows seeking help in vain he spent many hours beating at the minds of mr vincey and of his friend mr hart each as we know he roused by his efforts but the language that might convey his situation to these helpers across the gulf he did not know his feeble fingers groped vainly and powerlessly in their brains once indeed as we have already told he was able to turn mr vincey aside from his path so that he encountered the stolen body in its career but he could not make him understand the thing that had happened he was unable to draw any help from that encounter all through those hours the persuasion was overwhelming in mr bessels mind that presently his body would be killed by its furious tenant and he would have to remain in this shadow land for evermore so that those long hours were a growing agony of fear and ever as he hurried to and fro in his ineffectual excitement innumerable spirits of that world about him mobbed him and confused his mind and ever an envious applauding multitude poured after their successful fellow as he went upon his glorious career for that it would seem must be the life of these bodiless things of this world that is the shadow of our world ever they watch coveting a way into a mortal body in order that they may descend as furies and frenzies as violent lusts and mad strange impulses rejoicing in the body they have won for mr bessel was not the only human soul in that place witness the fact that he met first one and afterwards several shadows of men men like himself it seemed who had lost their bodies even it may be as he had lost his and wandered despairingly in that lost world that is neither life nor death they could not speak because that world is silent yet he knew them for men because of their dim human bodies and because of the sadness of their faces but how they had come into that world he could not tell nor where the bodies they had lost might be whether they still raved about the earth or whether they were closed for ever in death against return that they were the spirits of the dead neither he nor i believe but doctor wilson paget thinks they are the rational souls of men who are lost in madness on the earth at last mr bessel chanced upon a place where a little crowd of such disembodied silent creatures was gathered and thrusting through them he saw below a brightly lit room and four or five quiet gentlemen and a woman a stoutish woman dressed in black bombazine and sitting awkwardly in a chair with her head thrown back he knew her from her portraits to be mrs bullock the medium and he perceived that tracts and structures in her brain glowed and stirred as he had seen the pineal eye in the brain of mr vincey glow the light was very fitful sometimes it was a broad illumination and sometimes merely a faint twilight spot and it shifted slowly about her brain she kept on talking and writing with one hand and mr bessel saw that the crowding shadows of men about him and a great multitude of the shadow spirits of that shadow land were all striving and thrusting to touch the lighted regions of her brain as one gained her brain or another was thrust away her voice and the writing of her hand changed so that what she said was disorderly and confused for the most part now a fragment of one souls message and now a fragment of anothers and now she babbled the insane fancies of the spirits of vain desire then mr bessel understood that she spoke for the spirit that had touch of her and he began to struggle very furiously towards her but he was on the outside of the crowd and at that time he could not reach her and at last growing anxious he went away to find what had happened meanwhile to his body for a long time he went to and fro seeking it in vain and fearing that it must have been killed and then he found it at the bottom of the shaft in baker street writhing furiously and cursing with pain its leg and an arm and two ribs had been broken by its fall moreover the evil spirit was angry because his time had been so short and because of the pain making violent movements and casting his body about and at that mr bessel returned with redoubled earnestness to the room where the sance was going on and so soon as he had thrust himself within sight of the place he saw one of the men who stood about the medium looking at his watch as if he meant that the sance should presently end at that a great number of the shadows who had been striving turned away with gestures of despair but the thought that the sance was almost over only made mr bessel the more earnest and he struggled so stoutly with his will against the others that presently he gained the womans brain it chanced that just at that moment it glowed very brightly and in that instant she wrote the message that doctor wilson paget preserved and then the other shadows and the cloud of evil spirits about him had thrust mr bessel away from her and for all the rest of the sance he could regain her no more so he went back and watched through the long hours at the bottom of the shaft where the evil spirit lay in the stolen body it had maimed writhing and cursing and weeping and groaning and learning the lesson of pain and towards dawn the thing he had waited for happened the brain glowed brightly and the evil spirit came out and mr bessel entered the body he had feared he should never enter again as he did so the silence the brooding silence ended he heard the tumult of traffic and the voices of people overhead and that strange world that is the shadow of our world the dark and silent shadows of ineffectual desire and the shadows of lost men vanished clean away he lay there for the space of about three hours before he was found and in spite of the pain and suffering of his wounds and of the dim damp place in which he lay in spite of the tears wrung from him by his physical distress his heart was full of gladness to know that he was nevertheless back once more in the kindly world of men glasgow w collins sons and co ltd

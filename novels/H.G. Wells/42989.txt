plattner story whether the story of gottfried plattner is to be credited or not is a pretty question in the value of evidence on the one hand we have seven witnessesto be perfectly exact we have six and a half pairs of eyes and one undeniable fact and on the other we havewhat is itprejudice common sense the inertia of opinion never were there seven more honestseeming witnesses never was there a more undeniable fact than the inversion of gottfried plattners anatomical structure andnever was there a more preposterous story than the one they have to tell the most preposterous part of the story is the worthy gottfrieds contribution for i count him as one of the seven heaven forbid that i should be led into giving countenance to superstition by a passion for impartiality and so come to share the fate of eusapias patrons frankly i believe there is something crooked about this business of gottfried plattner but what that crooked factor is i will admit as frankly i do not know i have been surprised at the credit accorded to the story in the most unexpected and authoritative quarters the fairest way to the reader however will be for me to tell it without further comment gottfried plattner is in spite of his name a freeborn englishman his father was an alsatian who came to england in the sixties married a respectable english girl of unexceptionable antecedents and died after a wholesome and uneventful life devoted i understand chiefly to the laying of parquet flooring in gottfrieds age is sevenandtwenty he is by virtue of his heritage of three languages modern languages master in a small private school in the south of england to the casual observer he is singularly like any other modern languages master in any other small private school his costume is neither very costly nor very fashionable but on the other hand it is not markedly cheap or shabby his complexion like his height and his bearing is inconspicuous you would notice perhaps that like the majority of people his face was not absolutely symmetrical his right eye a little larger than the left and his jaw a trifle heavier on the right side if you as an ordinary careless person were to bare his chest and feel his heart beating you would probably find it quite like the heart of anyone else but here you and the trained observer would part company if you found his heart quite ordinary the trained observer would find it quite otherwise and once the thing was pointed out to you you too would perceive the peculiarity easily enough it is that gottfrieds heart beats on the right side of his body now that is not the only singularity of gottfrieds structure although it is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind careful sounding of gottfrieds internal arrangements by a wellknown surgeon seems to point to the fact that all the other unsymmetrical parts of his body are similarly misplaced the right lobe of his liver is on the left side the left on his right while his lungs too are similarly contraposed what is still more singular unless gottfried is a consummate actor we must believe that his right hand has recently become his left since the occurrences we are about to consider as impartially as possible he has found the utmost difficulty in writing except from right to left across the paper with his left hand he cannot throw with his right hand he is perplexed at meal times between knife and fork and his ideas of the rule of the roadhe is a cyclistare still a dangerous confusion and there is not a scrap of evidence to show that before these occurrences gottfried was at all lefthanded there is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous business gottfried produces three photographs of himself you have him at the age of five or six thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid frock and scowling in that photograph his left eye is a little larger than his right and his jaw is a trifle heavier on the left side this is the reverse of his present living conditions the photograph of gottfried at fourteen seems to contradict these facts but that is because it is one of those cheap gem photographs that were then in vogue taken direct upon metal and therefore reversing things just as a lookingglass would the third photograph represents him at oneandtwenty and confirms the record of the others there seems here evidence of the strongest confirmatory character that gottfried has exchanged his left side for his right yet how a human being can be so changed short of a fantastic and pointless miracle it is exceedingly hard to suggest in one way of course these facts might be explicable on the supposition that plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification on the strength of his hearts displacement photographs may be fudged and lefthandedness imitated but the character of the man does not lend itself to any such theory he is quiet practical unobtrusive and thoroughly sane from the nordau standpoint he likes beer and smokes moderately takes walking exercise daily and has a healthily high estimate of the value of his teaching he has a good but untrained tenor voice and takes a pleasure in singing airs of a popular and cheerful character he is fond but not morbidly fond of readingchiefly fiction pervaded with a vaguely pious optimismsleeps well and rarely dreams he is in fact the very last person to evolve a fantastic fable indeed so far from forcing this story upon the world he has been singularly reticent on the matter he meets inquirers with a certain engagingbashfulness is almost the word that disarms the most suspicious he seems genuinely ashamed that anything so unusual has occurred to him it is to be regretted that plattners aversion to the idea of postmortem dissection may postpone perhaps for ever the positive proof that his entire body has had its left and right sides transposed upon that fact mainly the credibility of his story hangs there is no way of taking a man and moving him about in space as ordinary people understand space that will result in our changing his sides whatever you do his right is still his right his left his left you can do that with a perfectly thin and flat thing of course if you were to cut a figure out of paper any figure with a right and left side you could change its sides simply by lifting it up and turning it over but with a solid it is different mathematical theorists tell us that the only way in which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking that body clean out of space as we know ittaking it out of ordinary existence that is and turning it somewhere outside space this is a little abstruse no doubt but anyone with any knowledge of mathematical theory will assure the reader of its truth to put the thing in technical language the curious inversion of plattners right and left sides is proof that he has moved out of our space into what is called the fourth dimension and that he has returned again to our world unless we choose to consider ourselves the victims of an elaborate and motiveless fabrication we are almost bound to believe that this has occurred so much for the tangible facts we come now to the account of the phenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the world it appears that in the sussexville proprietary school plattner not only discharged the duties of modern languages master but also taught chemistry commercial geography bookkeeping shorthand drawing and any other additional subject to which the changing fancies of the boys parents might direct attention he knew little or nothing of these various subjects but in secondary as distinguished from board or elementary schools knowledge in the teacher is very properly by no means so necessary as high moral character and gentlemanly tone in chemistry he was particularly deficient knowing he says nothing beyond the three gases whatever the three gases may be as however his pupils began by knowing nothing and derived all their information from him this caused him or anyone but little inconvenience for several terms then a little boy named whibble joined the school who had been educated it seems by some mischievous relative into an inquiring habit of mind this little boy followed plattners lessons with marked and sustained interest and in order to exhibit his zeal on the subject brought at various times substances for plattner to analyse plattner flattered by this evidence of his power of awakening interest and trusting to the boys ignorance analysed these and even made general statements as to their composition indeed he was so far stimulated by his pupil as to obtain a work upon analytical chemistry and study it during his supervision of the evenings preparation he was surprised to find chemistry quite an interesting subject so far the story is absolutely commonplace but now the greenish powder comes upon the scene the source of that greenish powder seems unfortunately lost master whibble tells a tortuous story of finding it done up in a packet in a disused limekiln near the downs it would have been an excellent thing for plattner and possibly for master whibbles family if a match could have been applied to that powder there and then the young gentleman certainly did not bring it to school in a packet but in a common eightounce graduated medicine bottle plugged with masticated newspaper he gave it to plattner at the end of the afternoon school four boys had been detained after school prayers in order to complete some neglected tasks and plattner was supervising these in the small classroom in which the chemical teaching was conducted the appliances for the practical teaching of chemistry in the sussexville proprietary school as in most small schools in this country are characterised by a severe simplicity they are kept in a small cupboard standing in a recess and having about the same capacity as a common travelling trunk plattner being bored with his passive superintendence seems to have welcomed the intervention of whibble with his green powder as an agreeable diversion and unlocking this cupboard proceeded at once with his analytical experiments whibble sat luckily for himself at a safe distance regarding him the four malefactors feigning a profound absorption in their work watched him furtively with the keenest interest for even within the limits of the three gases plattners practical chemistry was i understand temerarious they are practically unanimous in their account of plattners proceedings he poured a little of the green powder into a testtube and tried the substance with water hydrochloric acid nitric acid and sulphuric acid in succession getting no result he emptied out a little heapnearly half the bottleful in factupon a slate and tried a match he held the medicine bottle in his left hand the stuff began to smoke and melt and thenexploded with deafening violence and a blinding flash the five boys seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes ducked below their desks and were none of them seriously hurt the window was blown out into the playground and the blackboard on its easel was upset the slate was smashed to atoms some plaster fell from the ceiling no other damage was done to the school edifice or appliances and the boys at first seeing nothing of plattner fancied he was knocked down and lying out of their sight below the desks they jumped out of their places to go to his assistance and were amazed to find the space empty being still confused by the sudden violence of the report they hurried to the open door under the impression that he must have been hurt and have rushed out of the room but carson the foremost nearly collided in the doorway with the principal mr lidgett mr lidgett is a corpulent excitable man with one eye the boys describe him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those tempered expletives irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to uselest worse befall wretched mumchancer he said wheres mr plattner the boys are agreed on the very words wobbler snivelling puppy and mumchancer are it seems among the ordinary small change of mr lidgetts scholastic commerce wheres mr plattner that was a question that was to be repeated many times in the next few days it really seemed as though that frantic hyperbole blown to atoms had for once realised itself there was not a visible particle of plattner to be seen not a drop of blood nor a stitch of clothing to be found apparently he had been blown clean out of existence and left not a wrack behind not so much as would cover a sixpenny piece to quote a proverbial expression the evidence of his absolute disappearance as a consequence of that explosion is indubitable it is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in the sussexville proprietary school and in sussexville and elsewhere by this event it is quite possible indeed that some of the readers of these pages may recall the hearing of some remote and dying version of that excitement during the last summer holidays lidgett it would seem did everything in his power to suppress and minimise the story he instituted a penalty of twentyfive lines for any mention of plattners name among the boys and stated in the schoolroom that he was clearly aware of his assistants whereabouts he was afraid he explains that the possibility of an explosion happening in spite of the elaborate precautions taken to minimise the practical teaching of chemistry might injure the reputation of the school and so might any mysterious quality in plattners departure indeed he did everything in his power to make the occurrence seem as ordinary as possible in particular he crossexamined the five eyewitnesses of the occurrence so searchingly that they began to doubt the plain evidence of their senses but in spite of these efforts the tale in a magnified and distorted state made a nine days wonder in the district and several parents withdrew their sons on colourable pretexts not the least remarkable point in the matter is the fact that a large number of people in the neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dreams of plattner during the period of excitement before his return and that these dreams had a curious uniformity in almost all of them plattner was seen sometimes singly sometimes in company wandering about through a coruscating iridescence in all cases his face was pale and distressed and in some he gesticulated towards the dreamer one or two of the boys evidently under the influence of nightmare fancied that plattner approached them with remarkable swiftness and seemed to look closely into their very eyes others fled with plattner from the pursuit of vague and extraordinary creatures of a globular shape but all these fancies were forgotten in inquiries and speculations when on the wednesday next but one after the monday of the explosion plattner returned the circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his departure so far as mr lidgetts somewhat choleric outline can be filled in from plattners hesitating statements it would appear that on wednesday evening towards the hour of sunset the former gentleman having dismissed evening preparation was engaged in his garden picking and eating strawberries a fruit of which he is inordinately fond it is a large oldfashioned garden secured from observation fortunately by a high and ivycovered redbrick wall just as he was stooping over a particularly prolific plant there was a flash in the air and a heavy thud and before he could look round some heavy body struck him violently from behind he was pitched forward crushing the strawberries he held in his hand and that so roughly that his silk hatmr lidgett adheres to the older ideas of scholastic costumewas driven violently down upon his forehead and almost over one eye this heavy missile which slid over him sideways and collapsed into a sitting posture among the strawberry plants proved to be our longlost mr gottfried plattner in an extremely dishevelled condition he was collarless and hatless his linen was dirty and there was blood upon his hands mr lidgett was so indignant and surprised that he remained on allfours and with his hat jammed down on his eye while he expostulated vehemently with plattner for his disrespectful and unaccountable conduct this scarcely idyllic scene completes what i may call the exterior version of the plattner storyits exoteric aspect it is quite unnecessary to enter here into all the details of his dismissal by mr lidgett such details with the full names and dates and references will be found in the larger report of these occurrences that was laid before the society for the investigation of abnormal phenomena the singular transposition of plattners right and left sides was scarcely observed for the first day or so and then first in connection with his disposition to write from right to left across the blackboard he concealed rather than ostended this curious confirmatory circumstance as he considered it would unfavourably affect his prospects in a new situation the displacement of his heart was discovered some months after when he was having a tooth extracted under anaesthetics he then very unwillingly allowed a cursory surgical examination to be made of himself with a view to a brief account in the journal of anatomy that exhausts the statement of the material facts and we may now go on to consider plattners account of the matter but first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion of this story and what is to follow all i have told thus far is established by such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve every one of the witnesses is still alive the reader if he have the leisure may hunt the lads out tomorrow or even brave the terrors of the redoubtable lidgett and crossexamine and trap and test to his hearts content gottfried plattner himself and his twisted heart and his three photographs are producible it may be taken as proved that he did disappear for nine days as the consequence of an explosion that he returned almost as violently under circumstances in their nature annoying to mr lidgett whatever the details of those circumstances may be and that he returned inverted just as a reflection returns from a mirror from the last fact as i have already stated it follows almost inevitably that plattner during those nine days must have been in some state of existence altogether out of space the evidence to these statements is indeed far stronger than that upon which most murderers are hanged but for his own particular account of where he had been with its confused explanations and wellnigh selfcontradictory details we have only mr gottfried plattners word i do not wish to discredit that but i must point outwhat so many writers upon obscure psychic phenomena fail to dothat we are passing here from the practically undeniable to that kind of matter which any reasonable man is entitled to believe or reject as he thinks proper the previous statements render it plausible its discordance with common experience tilts it towards the incredible i would prefer not to sway the beam of the readers judgment either way but simply to tell the story as plattner told it me he gave me his narrative i may state at my house at chislehurst and so soon as he had left me that evening i went into my study and wrote down everything as i remembered it subsequently he was good enough to read over a typewritten copy so that its substantial correctness is undeniable he states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought he was killed he felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward it is a curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his backward flight and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry cupboard or the blackboard easel his heels struck ground and he staggered and fell heavily into a sitting position on something soft and firm for a moment the concussion stunned him he became aware at once of a vivid scent of singed hair and he seemed to hear the voice of lidgett asking for him you will understand that for a time his mind was greatly confused at first he was distinctly under the impression that he was still in the classroom he perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the boys and the entry of mr lidgett he is quite positive upon that score he did not hear their remarks but that he ascribed to the deafening effect of the experiment things about him seemed curiously dark and faint but his mind explained that on the obvious but mistaken idea that the explosion had engendered a huge volume of dark smoke through the dimness the figures of lidgett and the boys moved as faint and silent as ghosts plattners face still tingled with the stinging heat of the flash he was he says all muddled his first definite thoughts seem to have been of his personal safety he thought he was perhaps blinded and deafened he felt his limbs and face in a gingerly manner then his perceptions grew clearer and he was astonished to miss the old familiar desks and other schoolroom furniture about him only dim uncertain grey shapes stood in the place of these then came a thing that made him shout aloud and awoke his stunned faculties to instant activity two of the boys gesticulating walked one after the other clean through him neither manifested the slightest consciousness of his presence it is difficult to imagine the sensation he felt they came against him he says with no more force than a wisp of mist plattners first thought after that was that he was dead having been brought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters however he was a little surprised to find his body still about him his second conclusion was that he was not dead but that the others were that the explosion had destroyed the sussexville proprietary school and every soul in it except himself but that too was scarcely satisfactory he was thrown back upon astonished observation everything about him was extraordinarily dark at first it seemed to have an altogether ebony blackness overhead was a black firmament the only touch of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow at the edge of the sky in one direction which threw into prominence a horizon of undulating black hills this i say was his impression at first as his eye grew accustomed to the darkness he began to distinguish a faint quality of differentiating greenish colour in the circumambient night against this background the furniture and occupants of the classroom it seems stood out like phosphorescent spectres faint and impalpable he extended his hand and thrust it without an effort through the wall of the room by the fireplace he describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract attention he shouted to lidgett and tried to seize the boys as they went to and fro he only desisted from these attempts when mrs lidgett whom he as an assistant master naturally disliked entered the room he says the sensation of being in the world and yet not a part of it was an extraordinarily disagreeable one he compared his feelings not inaptly to those of a cat watching a mouse through a window whenever he made a motion to communicate with the dim familiar world about him he found an invisible incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse he then turned his attention to his solid environment he found the medicine bottle still unbroken in his hand with the remainder of the green powder therein he put this in his pocket and began to feel about him apparently he was sitting on a boulder of rock covered with a velvety moss the dark country about him he was unable to see the faint misty picture of the schoolroom blotting it out but he had a feeling due perhaps to a cold wind that he was near the crest of a hill and that a steep valley fell away beneath his feet the green glow along the edge of the sky seemed to be growing in extent and intensity he stood up rubbing his eyes it would seem that he made a few steps going steeply down hill and then stumbled nearly fell and sat down again upon a jagged mass of rock to watch the dawn he became aware that the world about him was absolutely silent it was as still as it was dark and though there was a cold wind blowing up the hillface the rustle of grass the soughing of the boughs that should have accompanied it were absent he could hear therefore if he could not see that the hillside upon which he stood was rocky and desolate the green grew brighter every moment and as it did so a faint transparent bloodred mingled with but did not mitigate the blackness of the sky overhead and the rocky desolations about him having regard to what follows i am inclined to think that that redness may have been an optical effect due to contrast something black fluttered momentarily against the livid yellowgreen of the lower sky and then the thin and penetrating voice of a bell rose out of the black gulf below him an oppressive expectation grew with the growing light it is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there the strange green light growing brighter every moment and spreading slowly in flamboyant fingers upward towards the zenith as it grew the spectral vision of our world became relatively or absolutely fainter probably both for the time must have been about that of our earthly sunset so far as his vision of our world went plattner by his few steps downhill had passed through the floor of the classroom and was now it seemed sitting in midair in the larger schoolroom downstairs he saw the boarders distinctly but much more faintly than he had seen lidgett they were preparing their evening tasks and he noticed with interest that several were cheating with their euclid riders by means of a crib a compilation whose existence he had hitherto never suspected as the time passed they faded steadily as steadily as the light of the green dawn increased looking down into the valley he saw that the light had crept far down its rocky sides and that the profound blackness of the abyss was now broken by a minute green glow like the light of a glowworm and almost immediately the limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over the basaltic undulations of the distant hills and the monstrous hillmasses about him came out gaunt and desolate in green light and deep ruddy black shadows he became aware of a vast number of ballshaped objects drifting as thistledown drifts over the high ground there were none of these nearer to him than the opposite side of the gorge the bell below twanged quicker and quicker with something like impatient insistence and several lights moved hither and thither the boys at work at their desks were now almost imperceptibly faint this extinction of our world when the green sun of this other universe rose is a curious point upon which plattner insists during the otherworld night it is difficult to move about on account of the vividness with which the things of this world are visible it becomes a riddle to explain why if this is the case we in this world catch no glimpse of the otherworld it is due perhaps to the comparatively vivid illumination of this world of ours plattner describes the midday of the otherworld at its brightest as not being nearly so bright as this world at full moon while its night is profoundly black consequently the amount of light even in an ordinary dark room is sufficient to render the things of the otherworld invisible on the same principle that faint phosphorescence is only visible in the profoundest darkness i have tried since he told me his story to see something of the otherworld by sitting for a long space in a photographers dark room at night i have certainly seen indistinctly the form of greenish slopes and rocks but only i must admit very indistinctly indeed the reader may possibly be more successful plattner tells me that since his return he has dreamt and seen and recognised places in the otherworld but this is probably due to his memory of these scenes it seems quite possible that people with unusually keen eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this strange otherworld about us however this is a digression as the green sun rose a long street of black buildings became perceptible though only darkly and indistinctly in the gorge and after some hesitation plattner began to clamber down the precipitous descent towards them the descent was long and exceedingly tedious being so not only by the extraordinary steepness but also by reason of the looseness of the boulders with which the whole face of the hill was strewn the noise of his descentnow and then his heels struck fire from the rocksseemed now the only sound in the universe for the beating of the bell had ceased as he drew nearer he perceived that the various edifices had a singular resemblance to tombs and mausoleums and monuments saving only that they were all uniformly black instead of being white as most sepulchres are and then he saw crowding out of the largest building very much as people disperse from church a number of pallid rounded palegreen figures these dispersed in several directions about the broad street of the place some going through side alleys and reappearing upon the steepness of the hill others entering some of the small black buildings which lined the way at the sight of these things drifting up towards him plattner stopped staring they were not walking they were indeed limbless and they had the appearance of human heads beneath which a tadpolelike body swung he was too astonished at their strangeness too full indeed of strangeness to be seriously alarmed by them they drove towards him in front of the chill wind that was blowing uphill much as soapbubbles drive before a draught and as he looked at the nearest of those approaching he saw it was indeed a human head albeit with singularly large eyes and wearing such an expression of distress and anguish as he had never seen before upon mortal countenance he was surprised to find that it did not turn to regard him but seemed to be watching and following some unseen moving thing for a moment he was puzzled and then it occurred to him that this creature was watching with its enormous eyes something that was happening in the world he had just left nearer it came and nearer and he was too astonished to cry out it made a very faint fretting sound as it came close to him then it struck his face with a gentle patits touch was very coldand drove past him and upward towards the crest of the hill an extraordinary conviction flashed across plattners mind that this head had a strong likeness to lidgett then he turned his attention to the other heads that were now swarming thickly up the hillside none made the slightest sign of recognition one or two indeed came close to his head and almost followed the example of the first but he dodged convulsively out of the way upon most of them he saw the same expression of unavailing regret he had seen upon the first and heard the same faint sounds of wretchedness from them one or two wept and one rolling swiftly uphill wore an expression of diabolical rage but others were cold and several had a look of gratified interest in their eyes one at least was almost in an ecstasy of happiness plattner does not remember that he recognised any more likenesses in those he saw at this time for several hours perhaps plattner watched these strange things dispersing themselves over the hills and not till long after they had ceased to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge did he resume his downward climb the darkness about him increased so much that he had a difficulty in stepping true overhead the sky was now a bright pale green he felt neither hunger nor thirst later when he did he found a chilly stream running down the centre of the gorge and the rare moss upon the boulders when he tried it at last in desperation was good to eat he groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge seeking vaguely for some clue to these inexplicable things after a long time he came to the entrance of the big mausoleumlike building from which the heads had issued in this he found a group of green lights burning upon a kind of basaltic altar and a bellrope from a belfry overhead hanging down into the centre of the place round the wall ran a lettering of fire in a character unknown to him while he was still wondering at the purport of these things he heard the receding tramp of heavy feet echoing far down the street he ran out into the darkness again but he could see nothing he had a mind to pull the bellrope and finally decided to follow the footsteps but although he ran far he never overtook them and his shouting was of no avail the gorge seemed to extend an interminable distance it was as dark as earthly starlight throughout its length while the ghastly green day lay along the upper edge of its precipices there were none of the heads now below they were all it seemed busily occupied along the upper slopes looking up he saw them drifting hither and thither some hovering stationary some flying swiftly through the air it reminded him he said of big snowflakes only these were black and pale green in pursuing the firm undeviating footsteps that he never overtook in groping into new regions of this endless devils dyke in clambering up and down the pitiless heights in wandering about the summits and in watching the drifting faces plattner states that he spent the better part of seven or eight days he did not keep count he says though once or twice he found eyes watching him he had word with no living soul he slept among the rocks on the hillside in the gorge things earthly were invisible because from the earthly standpoint it was far underground on the altitudes so soon as the earthly day began the world became visible to him he found himself sometimes stumbling over the dark green rocks or arresting himself on a precipitous brink while all about him the green branches of the sussexville lanes were swaying or again he seemed to be walking through the sussexville streets or watching unseen the private business of some household and then it was he discovered that to almost every human being in our world there pertained some of these drifting heads that everyone in the world is watched intermittently by these helpless disembodiments what are theythese watchers of the living plattner never learned but two that presently found and followed him were like his childhoods memory of his father and mother now and then other faces turned their eyes upon him eyes like those of dead people who had swayed him or injured him or helped him in his youth and manhood whenever they looked at him plattner was overcome with a strange sense of responsibility to his mother he ventured to speak but she made no answer she looked sadly steadfastly and tenderlya little reproachfully too it seemedinto his eyes he simply tells this story he does not endeavour to explain we are left to surmise who these watchers of the living may be or if they are indeed the dead why they should so closely and passionately watch a world they have left for ever it may beindeed to my mind it seems justthat when our life has closed when evil or good is no longer a choice for us we may still have to witness the working out of the train of consequences we have laid if human souls continue after death then surely human interests continue after death but that is merely my own guess at the meaning of the things seen plattner offers no interpretation for none was given him it is well the reader should understand this clearly day after day with his head reeling he wandered about this strangelit world outside the world weary and towards the end weak and hungry by dayby our earthly day that isthe ghostly vision of the old familiar scenery of sussexville all about him irked and worried him he could not see where to put his feet and ever and again with a chilly touch one of these watching souls would come against his face and after dark the multitude of these watchers about him and their intent distress confused his mind beyond describing a great longing to return to the earthly life that was so near and yet so remote consumed him the unearthliness of things about him produced a positively painful mental distress he was worried beyond describing by his own particular followers he would shout at them to desist from staring at him scold at them hurry away from them they were always mute and intent run as he might over the uneven ground they followed his destinies on the ninth day towards evening plattner heard the invisible footsteps approaching far away down the gorge he was then wandering over the broad crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen in his entry into this strange otherworld of his he turned to hurry down into the gorge feeling his way hastily and was arrested by the sight of the thing that was happening in a room in a back street near the school both of the people in the room he knew by sight the windows were open the blinds up and the setting sun shone clearly into it so that it came out quite brightly at first a vivid oblong of room lying like a magiclantern picture upon the black landscape and the livid green dawn in addition to the sunlight a candle had just been lit in the room on the bed lay a lank man his ghastly white face terrible upon the tumbled pillow his clenched hands were raised above his head a little table beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles some toast and water and an empty glass every now and then the lank mans lips fell apart to indicate a word he could not articulate but the woman did not notice that he wanted anything because she was busy turning out papers from an oldfashioned bureau in the opposite corner of the room at first the picture was very vivid indeed but as the green dawn behind it grew brighter and brighter so it became fainter and more and more transparent as the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer those footsteps that sound so loud in that otherworld and come so silently in this plattner perceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering together out of the darkness and watching the two people in the room never before had he seen so many of the watchers of the living a multitude had eyes only for the sufferer in the room another multitude in infinite anguish watched the woman as she hunted with greedy eyes for something she could not find they crowded about plattner they came across his sight and buffeted his face the noise of their unavailing regrets was all about him he saw clearly only now and then at other times the picture quivered dimly through the veil of green reflections upon their movements in the room it must have been very still and plattner says the candle flame streamed up into a perfectly vertical line of smoke but in his ears each footfall and its echoes beat like a clap of thunder and the faces two more particularly near the womans one a womans also white and clearfeatured a face which might have once been cold and hard but which was now softened by the touch of a wisdom strange to earth the other might have been the womans father both were evidently absorbed in the contemplation of some act of hateful meanness so it seemed which they could no longer guard against and prevent behind were others teachers it may be who had taught ill friends whose influence had failed and over the man tooa multitude but none that seemed to be parents or teachers faces that might once have been coarse now purged to strength by sorrow and in the forefront one face a girlish one neither angry nor remorseful but merely patient and weary and as it seemed to plattner waiting for relief his powers of description fail him at the memory of this multitude of ghastly countenances they gathered on the stroke of the bell he saw them all in the space of a second it would seem that he was so worked on by his excitement that quite involuntarily his restless fingers took the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it before him but he does not remember that abruptly the footsteps ceased he waited for the next and there was silence and then suddenly cutting through the unexpected stillness like a keen thin blade came the first stroke of the bell at that the multitudinous faces swayed to and fro and a louder crying began all about him the woman did not hear she was burning something now in the candle flame at the second stroke everything grew dim and a breath of wind icy cold blew through the host of watchers they swirled about him like an eddy of dead leaves in the spring and at the third stroke something was extended through them to the bed you have heard of a beam of light this was like a beam of darkness and looking again at it plattner saw that it was a shadowy arm and hand the green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon and the vision of the room was very faint plattner could see that the white of the bed struggled and was convulsed and that the woman looked round over her shoulder at it startled the cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before the wind and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the gorge then suddenly plattner understood the meaning of the shadowy black arm that stretched across his shoulder and clutched its prey he did not dare turn his head to see the shadow behind the arm with a violent effort and covering his eyes he set himself to run made perhaps twenty strides then slipped on a boulder and fell he fell forward on his hands and the bottle smashed and exploded as he touched the ground in another moment he found himself stunned and bleeding sitting face to face with lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school there the story of plattners experiences ends i have resisted i believe successfully the natural disposition of a writer of fiction to dress up incidents of this sort i have told the thing as far as possible in the order in which plattner told it to me i have carefully avoided any attempt at style effect or construction it would have been easy for instance to have worked the scene of the deathbed into a kind of plot in which plattner might have been involved but quite apart from the objectionableness of falsifying a most extraordinary true story any such trite devices would spoil to my mind the peculiar effect of this dark world with its livid green illumination and its drifting watchers of the living which unseen and unapproachable to us is yet lying all about us it remains to add that a death did actually occur in vincent terrace just beyond the school garden and so far as can be proved at the moment of plattners return deceased was a ratecollector and insurance agent his widow who was much younger than himself married last month a mr whymper a veterinary surgeon of allbeeding as the portion of this story given here has in various forms circulated orally in sussexville she has consented to my use of her name on condition that i make it distinctly known that she emphatically contradicts every detail of plattners account of her husbands last moments she burnt no will she says although plattner never accused her of doing so her husband made but one will and that just after their marriage certainly from a man who had never seen it plattners account of the furniture of the room was curiously accurate one other thing even at the risk of an irksome repetition i must insist upon lest i seem to favour the credulous superstitious view plattners absence from the world for nine days is i think proved but that does not prove his story it is quite conceivable that even outside space hallucinations may be possible that at least the reader must bear distinctly in mind the argonauts of the air one saw monsons flying machine from the windows of the trains passing either along the southwestern main line or along the line between wimbledon and worcester parkto be more exact one saw the huge scaffoldings which limited the flight of the apparatus they rose over the treetops a massive alley of interlacing iron and timber and an enormous web of ropes and tackle extending the best part of two miles from the leatherhead branch this alley was foreshortened and in part hidden by a hill with villas but from the main line one had it in profile a complex tangle of girders and curving bars very impressive to the excursionists from portsmouth and southampton and the west monson had taken up the work where maxim had left it had gone on at first with an utter contempt for the journalistic wit and ignorance that had irritated and hampered his predecessor and had spent it was said rather more than half his immense fortune upon his experiments the results to an impatient generation seemed inconsiderable when some five years had passed after the growth of the colossal iron groves at worcester park and monson still failed to put in a fluttering appearance over trafalgar square even the isle of wight trippers felt their liberty to smile and such intelligent people as did not consider monson a fool stricken with the mania for invention denounced him as being for no particular reason a selfadvertising quack yet now and again a morning trainload of seasonticket holders would see a white monster rush headlong through the airy tracery of guides and bars and hear the further stays nettings and buffers snap creak and groan with the impact of the blow then there would be an efflorescence of blackset whiterimmed faces along the sides of the train and the morning papers would be neglected for a vigorous discussion of the possibility of flying in which nothing new was ever said by any chance until the train reached waterloo and its cargo of seasonticket holders dispersed themselves over london or the fathers and mothers in some multitudinous train of weary excursionists returning exhausted from a day of rest by the sea would find the dark fabric standing out against the evening sky useful in diverting some bilious child from its introspection and be suddenly startled by the swift transit of a huge black flapping shape that strained upward against the guides it was a great and forcible thing beyond dispute and excellent for conversation yet all the same it was but flying in leadingstrings and most of those who witnessed it scarcely counted its flight as flying more of a switchback it seemed to the run of the folk monson i say did not trouble himself very keenly about the opinions of the press at first but possibly he even had formed but a poor idea of the time it would take before the tactics of flying were mastered the swift assured adjustment of the big soaring shape to every gust and chance movement of the air nor had he clearly reckoned the money this prolonged struggle against gravitation would cost him and he was not so pachydermatous as he seemed secretly he had his periodical bundles of cuttings sent him by romeike he had his periodical reminders from his banker and if he did not mind the initial ridicule and scepticism he felt the growing neglect as the months went by and the money dribbled away time was when monson had sent the enterprising journalist keen after readable matter empty from his gates but when the enterprising journalist ceased from troubling monson was anything but satisfied in his heart of hearts still day by day the work went on and the multitudinous subtle difficulties of the steering diminished in number day by day too the money trickled away until his balance was no longer a matter of hundreds of thousands but of tens and at last came an anniversary monson sitting in the little drawingshed suddenly noticed the date on woodhouses calendar it was five years ago today that we began he said to woodhouse suddenly is it said woodhouse its the alterations play the devil with us said monson biting a paperfastener the drawings for the new vans to the hinder screw lay on the table before him as he spoke he pitched the mutilated brass paperfastener into the wastepaper basket and drummed with his fingers these alterations will the mathematicians ever be clever enough to save us all this patching and experimenting five yearslearning by rule of thumb when one might think that it was possible to calculate the whole thing out beforehand the cost of it i might have hired three senior wranglers for life but theyd only have developed some beautifully useless theorems in pneumatics what a time it has been woodhouse these mouldings will take three weeks said woodhouse at special prices three weeks said monson and sat drumming three weeks certain said woodhouse an excellent engineer but no good as a comforter he drew the sheets towards him and began shading a bar monson stopped drumming and began to bite his fingernails staring the while at woodhouses head how long have they been calling this monsons folly he said suddenly oh year or so said woodhouse carelessly without looking up monson sucked the air in between his teeth and went to the window the stout iron columns carrying the elevated rails upon which the start of the machine was made rose up close by and the machine was hidden by the upper edge of the window through the grove of iron pillars red painted and ornate with rows of bolts one had a glimpse of the pretty scenery towards esher a train went gliding noiselessly across the middle distance its rattle drowned by the hammering of the workmen overhead monson could imagine the grinning faces at the windows of the carriages he swore savagely under his breath and dabbed viciously at a blowfly that suddenly became noisy on the windowpane whats up said woodhouse staring in surprise at his employer im about sick of this woodhouse scratched his cheek oh he said after an assimilating pause he pushed the drawing away from him here these fools im trying to conquer a new elementtrying to do a thing that will revolutionise life and instead of taking an intelligent interest they grin and make their stupid jokes and call me and my appliances names asses said woodhouse letting his eye fall again on the drawing the epithet curiously enough made monson wince im about sick of it woodhouse anyhow he said after a pause woodhouse shrugged his shoulders theres nothing for it but patience i suppose said monson sticking his hands in his pockets ive started ive made my bed and ive got to lie on it i cant go back ill see it through and spend every penny i have and every penny i can borrow but i tell you woodhouse im infernally sick of it all the same if id paid a tenth part of the money towards some political greasers expensesid have been a baronet before this monson paused woodhouse stared in front of him with a blank expression he always employed to indicate sympathy and tapped his pencilcase on the table monson stared at him for a minute oh damn said monson suddenly and abruptly rushed out of the room woodhouse continued his sympathetic rigour for perhaps half a minute then he sighed and resumed the shading of the drawings something had evidently upset monson nice chap and generous but difficult to get on with it was the way with every amateur who had anything to do with engineeringwanted everything finished at once but monson had usually the patience of the expert odd he was so irritable nice and round that aluminium rod did look now woodhouse threw back his head and put it first this side and then that to appreciate his bit of shading better mr woodhouse said hooper the foreman of the labourers putting his head in at the door hullo said woodhouse without turning round nothing happened sir said hooper happened said woodhouse the governor just been up the rails swearing like a tornader oh said woodhouse it aint like him sir no and i was thinking perhaps dont think said woodhouse still admiring the drawings hooper knew woodhouse and he shut the door suddenly with a vicious slam woodhouse stared stonily before him for some further minutes and then made an ineffectual effort to pick his teeth with his pencil abruptly he desisted pitched that old tried and stumpy servitor across the room got up stretched himself and followed hooper he looked ruffledit was visible to every workman he met when a millionaire who has been spending thousands on experiments that employ quite a little army of people suddenly indicates that he is sick of the undertaking there is almost invariably a certain amount of mental friction in the ranks of the little army he employs and even before he indicates his intentions there are speculations and murmurs a watching of faces and a study of straws hundreds of people knew before the day was out that monson was ruffled woodhouse ruffled hooper ruffled a workmans wife for instance whom monson had never seen decided to keep her money in the savingsbank instead of buying a velveteen dress so farreaching are even the casual curses of a millionaire monson found a certain satisfaction in going on the works and behaving disagreeably to as many people as possible after a time even that palled upon him and he rode off the grounds to every ones relief there and through the lanes southeastward to the infinite tribulation of his house steward at cheam and the immediate cause of it all the little grain of annoyance that had suddenly precipitated all this discontent with his lifework wasthese trivial things that direct all our great decisionshalf a dozen illconsidered remarks made by a pretty girl prettily dressed with a beautiful voice and something more than prettiness in her soft grey eyes and of these halfdozen remarks two words especiallymonsons folly she had felt she was behaving charmingly to monson she reflected the next day how exceptionally effective she had been and no one would have been more amazed than she had she learned the effect she had left on monsons mind i hope considering everything that she never knew how are you getting on with your flyingmachine she asked i wonder if i shall ever meet any one with the sense not to ask that thought monson it will be very dangerous at first will it not thinks im afraid jorgon is going to play presently have you heard him before my mania being attended to we turn to rational conversation gush about jorgon gradual decline of conversation ending withyou must let me know when your flyingmachine is finished mr monson and then i will consider the advisability of taking a ticket one would think i was still playing inventions in the nursery but the bitterest thing she said was not meant for monsons ears to phlox the novelist she was always conscientiously brilliant i have been talking to mr monson and he can think of nothing positively nothing but that flyingmachine of his do you know all his workmen call that place of his monsons folly he is quite impossible it is really very very sad i always regard him myself in the light of sunken treasurethe lost millionaire you know she was pretty and well educatedindeed she had written an epigrammatic novelette but the bitterness was that she was typical she summarised what the world thought of the man who was working sanely steadily and surely towards a more tremendous revolution in the appliances of civilisation a more farreaching alteration in the ways of humanity than has ever been effected since history began they did not even take him seriously in a little while he would be proverbial i must fly now he said on his way home smarting with a sense of absolute social failure i must fly soon if it doesnt come off soon by god i shall run amuck he said that before he had gone through his passbook and his litter of papers inadequate as the cause seems it was that girls voice and the expression of her eyes that precipitated his discontent but certainly the discovery that he had no longer even one hundred thousand pounds worth of realisable property behind him was the poison that made the wound deadly it was the next day after this that he exploded upon woodhouse and his workmen and thereafter his bearing was consistently grim for three weeks and anxiety dwelt in cheam and ewell malden morden and worcester park places that had thriven mightily on his experiments four weeks after that first swearing of his he stood with woodhouse by the reconstructed machine as it lay across the elevated railway by means of which it gained its initial impetus the new propeller glittered a brighter white than the rest of the machine and a gilder obedient to a whim of monsons was picking out the aluminium bars with gold and looking down the long avenue between the ropes gilded now with the sunset one saw red signals and two miles away an anthill of workmen busy altering the last falls of the run into a rising slope ill come said woodhouse ill come right enough but i tell you its infernally foolhardy if only you would give another year i tell you i wont i tell you the thing works ive given years enough its not that said woodhouse were all right with the machine but its the steering havent i been rushing night and morning backwards and forwards through this squirrels cage if the thing steers true here it will steer true all across england its just funk i tell you woodhouse we could have gone a year ago and besides well said woodhouse the money snapped monson over his shoulder hang it i never thought of the money said woodhouse and then speaking now in a very different tone to that with which he had said the words before he repeated ill come trust me monson turned suddenly and saw all that woodhouse had not the dexterity to say shining on his sunsetlit face he looked for a moment then impulsively extended his hand thanks he said all right said woodhouse gripping the hand and with a queer softening of his features trust me then both men turned to the big apparatus that lay with its flat wings extended upon the carrier and stared at it meditatively monson guided perhaps by a photographic study of the flight of birds and by lilienthals methods had gradually drifted from maxims shapes towards the bird form again the thing however was driven by a huge screw behind in the place of the tail and so hovering which needs an almost vertical adjustment of a flat tail was rendered impossible the body of the machine was small almost cylindrical and pointed forward and aft on the pointed ends were two small petroleum engines for the screw and the navigators sat deep in a canoelike recess the foremost one steering and being protected by a low screen with two plateglass windows from the blinding rush of air on either side a monstrous flat framework with a curved front border could be adjusted so as either to lie horizontally or to be tilted upward or down these wings worked rigidly together or by releasing a pin one could be tilted through a small angle independently of its fellow the front edge of either wing could also be shifted back so as to diminish the wingarea about onesixth the machine was not only not designed to hover but it was also incapable of fluttering monsons idea was to get into the air with the initial rush of the apparatus and then to skim much as a playingcard may be skimmed keeping up the rush by means of the screw at the stern rooks and gulls fly enormous distances in that way with scarcely a perceptible movement of the wings the bird really drives along on an aerial switchback it glides slanting downward for a space until it has gained considerable momentum and then altering the inclination of its wings glides up again almost to its original altitude even a londoner who has watched the birds in the aviary in regents park knows that but the bird is practising this art from the moment it leaves its nest it has not only the perfect apparatus but the perfect instinct to use it a man off his feet has the poorest skill in balancing even the simple trick of the bicycle costs him some hours of labour the instantaneous adjustments of the wings the quick response to a passing breeze the swift recovery of equilibrium the giddy eddying movements that require such absolute precisionall that he must learn learn with infinite labour and infinite danger if ever he is to conquer flying the flyingmachine that will start off some fine day driven by neat little levers with a nice open deck like a liner and all loaded up with bombshells and guns is the easy dreaming of a literary man in lives and in treasure the cost of the conquest of the empire of the air may even exceed all that has been spent in mans great conquest of the sea certainly it will be costlier than the greatest war that has ever devastated the world no one knew these things better than these two practical men and they knew they were in the front rank of the coming army yet there is hope even in a forlorn hope men are killed outright in the reserves sometimes while others who have been left for dead in the thickest corner crawl out and survive if we miss these meadowssaid woodhouse presently in his slow way my dear chap said monson whose spirits had been rising fitfully during the last few days we mustnt miss these meadows theres a quarter of a square mile for us to hit fences removed ditches levelled we shall come down all rightrest assured and if we dont ah said woodhouse if we dont before the day of the start the newspaper people got wind of the alterations at the northward end of the framework and monson was cheered by a decided change in the comments romeike forwarded him he will be off some day said the papers he will be off some day said the southwestern seasonticket holders one to another the seaside excursionists the saturdaytomonday trippers from sussex and hampshire and dorset and devon the eminent literary people from hazlemere all remarked eagerly one to another he will be off some day as the familiar scaffolding came in sight and actually one bright morning in full view of the tenpastten train from basingstoke monsons flyingmachine started on its journey they saw the carrier running swiftly along its rail and the white and gold screw spinning in the air they heard the rapid rumble of wheels and a thud as the carrier reached the buffers at the end of its run then a whirr as the flyingmachine was shot forward into the networks all that the majority of them had seen and heard before the thing went with a drooping flight through the framework and rose again and then every beholder shouted or screamed or yelled or shrieked after his kind for instead of the customary concussion and stoppage the flying machine flew out of its five years cage like a bolt from a crossbow and drove slantingly upward into the air curved round a little so as to cross the line and soared in the direction of wimbledon common it seemed to hang momentarily in the air and grow smaller then it ducked and vanished over the clustering blue treetops to the east of coombe hill and no one stopped staring and gasping until long after it had disappeared that was what the people in the train from basingstoke saw if you had drawn a line down the middle of that train from engine to guards van you would not have found a living soul on the opposite side to the flyingmachine it was a mad rush from window to window as the thing crossed the line and the enginedriver and stoker never took their eyes off the low hills about wimbledon and never noticed that they had run clean through coombe and maiden and raynes park until with returning animation they found themselves pelting at the most indecent pace into wimbledon station from the moment when monson had started the carrier with a now neither he nor woodhouse said a word both men sat with clenched teeth monson had crossed the line with a curve that was too sharp and woodhouse had opened and shut his white lips but neither spoke woodhouse simply gripped his seat and breathed sharply through his teeth watching the blue country to the west rushing past and down and away from him monson knelt at his post forward and his hands trembled on the spoked wheel that moved the wings he could see nothing before him but a mass of white clouds in the sky the machine went slanting upward travelling with an enormous speed still but losing momentum every moment the land ran away underneath with diminishing speed now said woodhouse at last and with a violent effort monson wrenched over the wheel and altered the angle of the wings the machine seemed to hang for half a minute motionless in midair and then he saw the hazy blue housecovered hills of kilburn and hampstead jump up before his eyes and rise steadily until the little sunlit dome of the albert hall appeared through his windows for a moment he scarcely understood the meaning of this upward rush of the horizon but as the nearer and nearer houses came into view he realised what he had done he had turned the wings over too far and they were swooping steeply downward towards the thames the thought the question the realisation were all the business of a second of time too much gasped woodhouse monson brought the wheel halfway back with a jerk and forthwith the kilburn and hampstead ridge dropped again to the lower edge of his windows they had been a thousand feet above coombe and maiden station fifty seconds after they whizzed at a frightful pace not eighty feet above the east putney station on the metropolitan district line to the screaming astonishment of a platformful of people monson flung up the vans against the air and over fulham they rushed up their atmospheric switchback again steeplytoo steeply the buses went floundering across the fulham road the people yelled then down again too steeply still and the distant trees and houses about primrose hill leapt up across monsons window and then suddenly he saw straight before him the greenery of kensington gardens and the towers of the imperial institute they were driving straight down upon south kensington the pinnacles of the natural history museum rushed up into view there came one fatal second of swift thought a moment of hesitation should he try and clear the towers or swerve eastward he made a hesitating attempt to release the right wing left the catch half released and gave a frantic clutch at the wheel the nose of the machine seemed to leap up before him the wheel pressed his hand with irresistible force and jerked itself out of his control woodhouse sitting crouched together gave a hoarse cry and sprang up towards monson too far he cried and then he was clinging to the gunwale for dear life and monson had been jerked clean overhead and was falling backwards upon him so swiftly had the thing happened that barely a quarter of the people going to and fro in hyde park and brompton road and the exhibition road saw anything of the aerial catastrophe a distant winged shape had appeared above the clustering houses to the south had fallen and risen growing larger as it did so had swooped swiftly down towards the imperial institute a broad spread of flying wings had swept round in a quarter circle dashed eastward and then suddenly sprang vertically into the air a black object shot out of it and came spinning downward a man two men clutching each other they came whirling down separated as they struck the roof of the students club and bounded off into the green bushes on its southward side for perhaps half a minute the pointed stem of the big machine still pierced vertically upward the screw spinning desperately for one brief instant that yet seemed an age to all who watched it had hung motionless in midair then a spout of yellow flame licked up its length from the stern engine and swift swifter swifter and flaring like a rocket it rushed down upon the solid mass of masonry which was formerly the royal college of science the big screw of white and gold touched the parapet and crumpled up like wet linen then the blazing spindleshaped body smashed and splintered smashing and splintering in its fall upon the northwestward angle of the building but the crash the flame of blazing paraffin that shot heavenward from the shattered engines of the machine the crushed horrors that were found in the garden beyond the students club the masses of yellow parapet and red brick that fell headlong into the roadway the running to and fro of people like ants in a broken anthill the galloping of fireengines the gathering of crowdsall these things do not belong to this story which was written only to tell how the first of all successful flyingmachines was launched and flew though he failed and failed disastrously the record of monsons work remainsa sufficient monumentto guide the next of that band of gallant experimentalists who will sooner or later master this great problem of flying and between worcester park and malden there still stands that portentous avenue of ironwork rusting now and dangerous here and there to witness to the first desperate struggle for mans right of way through the air the story of the late mr elvesham i set this story down not expecting it will be believed but if possible to prepare a way of escape for the next victim he perhaps may profit by my misfortune my own case i know is hopeless and i am now in some measure prepared to meet my fate my name is edward george eden i was born at trentham in staffordshire my father being employed in the gardens there i lost my mother when i was three years old and my father when i was five my uncle george eden then adopting me as his own son he was a single man selfeducated and wellknown in birmingham as an enterprising journalist he educated me generously fired my ambition to succeed in the world and at his death which happened four years ago left me his entire fortune a matter of about five hundred pounds after all outgoing charges were paid i was then eighteen he advised me in his will to expend the money in completing my education i had already chosen the profession of medicine and through his posthumous generosity and my good fortune in a scholarship competition i became a medical student at university college london at the time of the beginning of my story i lodged at a university street in a little upper room very shabbily furnished and draughty overlooking the back of shoolbreds premises i used this little room both to live in and sleep in because i was anxious to eke out my means to the very last shillingsworth i was taking a pair of shoes to be mended at a shop in the tottenham court road when i first encountered the little old man with the yellow face with whom my life has now become so inextricably entangled he was standing on the kerb and staring at the number on the door in a doubtful way as i opened it his eyesthey were dull grey eyes and reddish under the rimsfell to my face and his countenance immediately assumed an expression of corrugated amiability you come he said apt to the moment i had forgotten the number of your house how do you do mr eden i was a little astonished at his familiar address for i had never set eyes on the man before i was a little annoyed too at his catching me with my boots under my arm he noticed my lack of cordiality wonder who the deuce i am eh a friend let me assure you i have seen you before though you havent seen me is there anywhere where i can talk to you i hesitated the shabbiness of my room upstairs was not a matter for every stranger perhaps said i we might walk down the street im unfortunately preventedmy gesture explained the sentence before i had spoken it the very thing he said and faced this way and then that the street which way shall we go i slipped my boots down in the passage look here he said abruptly this business of mine is a rigmarole come and lunch with me mr eden im an old man a very old man and not good at explanations and what with my piping voice and the clatter of the traffic he laid a persuasive skinny hand that trembled a little upon my arm i was not so old that an old man might not treat me to a lunch yet at the same time i was not altogether pleased by this abrupt invitation i had ratheri began but i had rather he said catching me up and a certain civility is surely due to my grey hairs and so i consented and went with him he took me to blavitskis i had to walk slowly to accommodate myself to his paces and over such a lunch as i had never tasted before he fended off my leading questions and i took a better note of his appearance his cleanshaven face was lean and wrinkled his shrivelled lips fell over a set of false teeth and his white hair was thin and rather long he seemed small to methough indeed most people seemed small to meand his shoulders were rounded and bent and watching him i could not help but observe that he too was taking note of me running his eyes with a curious touch of greed in them over me from my broad shoulders to my suntanned hands and up to my freckled face again and now said he as we lit our cigarettes i must tell you of the business in hand i must tell you then that i am an old man a very old man he paused momentarily and it happens that i have money that i must presently be leaving and never a child have i to leave it to i thought of the confidence trick and resolved i would be on the alert for the vestiges of my five hundred pounds he proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness and the trouble he had to find a proper disposition of his money i have weighed this plan and that plan charities institutions and scholarships and libraries and i have come to this conclusion at lasthe fixed his eyes on my facethat i will find some young fellow ambitious pureminded and poor healthy in body and healthy in mind and in short make him my heir give him all that i have he repeated give him all that i have so that he will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and struggle in which his sympathies have been educated to freedom and influence i tried to seem disinterested with a transparent hypocrisy i said and you want my help my professional services maybe to find that person he smiled and looked at me over his cigarette and i laughed at his quiet exposure of my modest pretence what a career such a man might have he said it fills me with envy to think how i have accumulated that another man may spend but there are conditions of course burdens to be imposed he must for instance take my name you cannot expect everything without some return and i must go into all the circumstances of his life before i can accept him he must be sound i must know his heredity how his parents and grandparents died have the strictest inquiries made into his private morals this modified my secret congratulations a little and do i understand said i that i yes he said almost fiercely you you i answered never a word my imagination was dancing wildly my innate scepticism was useless to modify its transports there was not a particle of gratitude in my mindi did not know what to say nor how to say it but why me in particular i said at last he had chanced to hear of me from professor haslar he said as a typically sound and sane young man and he wished as far as possible to leave his money where health and integrity were assured that was my first meeting with the little old man he was mysterious about himself he would not give his name yet he said and after i had answered some questions of his he left me at the blavitski portal i noticed that he drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket when it came to paying for the lunch his insistence upon bodily health was curious in accordance with an arrangement we had made i applied that day for a life policy in the loyal insurance company for a large sum and i was exhaustively overhauled by the medical advisers of that company in the subsequent week even that did not satisfy him and he insisted i must be reexamined by the great doctor henderson it was friday in whitsun week before he came to a decision he called me down quite late in the eveningnearly nine it wasfrom cramming chemical equations for my preliminary scientific examination he was standing in the passage under the feeble gaslamp and his face was a grotesque interplay of shadows he seemed more bowed than when i had first seen him and his cheeks had sunk in a little his voice shook with emotion everything is satisfactory mr eden he said everything is quite quite satisfactory and this night of all nights you must dine with me and celebrate youraccession he was interrupted by a cough you wont have long to wait either he said wiping his handkerchief across his lips and gripping my hand with his long bony claw that was disengaged certainly not very long to wait we went into the street and called a cab i remember every incident of that drive vividly the swift easy motion the vivid contrast of gas and oil and electric light the crowds of people in the streets the place in regent street to which we went and the sumptuous dinner we were served with there i was disconcerted at first by the welldressed waiters glances at my rough clothes bothered by the stones of the olives but as the champagne warmed my blood my confidence revived at first the old man talked of himself he had already told me his name in the cab he was egbert elvesham the great philosopher whose name i had known since i was a lad at school it seemed incredible to me that this man whose intelligence had so early dominated mine this great abstraction should suddenly realise itself as this decrepit familiar figure i daresay every young fellow who has suddenly fallen among celebrities has felt something of my disappointment he told me now of the future that the feeble streams of his life would presently leave dry for me houses copyrights investments i had never suspected that philosophers were so rich he watched me drink and eat with a touch of envy what a capacity for living you have he said and then with a sigh a sigh of relief i could have thought it it will not be long ay said i my head swimming now with champagne i have a future perhapsof a passing agreeable sort thanks to you i shall now have the honour of your name but you have a past such a past as is worth all my future he shook his head and smiled as i thought with halfsad appreciation of my flattering admiration that future he said would you in truth change it the waiter came with liqueurs you will not perhaps mind taking my name taking my position but would you indeedwillinglytake my years with your achievements said i gallantly he smiled again kummelboth he said to the waiter and turned his attention to a little paper packet he had taken from his pocket this hour said he this afterdinner hour is the hour of small things here is a scrap of my unpublished wisdom he opened the packet with his shaking yellow fingers and showed a little pinkish powder on the paper this said hewell you must guess what it is but kummelput but a dash of this powder in itis himmel his large greyish eyes watched mine with an inscrutable expression it was a bit of a shock to me to find this great teacher gave his mind to the flavour of liqueurs however i feigned a great interest in his weakness for i was drunk enough for such small sycophancy he parted the powder between the little glasses and rising suddenly with a strange unexpected dignity held out his hand towards me i imitated his action and the glasses rang to a quick succession said he and raised his glass towards his lips not that i said hastily not that he paused with the liqueur at the level of his chin and his eyes blazing into mine to a long life said i he hesitated to a long life said he with a sudden bark of laughter and with eyes fixed on one another we tilted the little glasses his eyes looked straight into mine and as i drained the stuff off i felt a curiously intense sensation the first touch of it set my brain in a furious tumult i seemed to feel an actual physical stirring in my skull and a seething humming filled my ears i did not notice the flavour in my mouth the aroma that filled my throat i saw only the grey intensity of his gaze that burnt into mine the draught the mental confusion the noise and stirring in my head seemed to last an interminable time curious vague impressions of halfforgotten things danced and vanished on the edge of my consciousness at last he broke the spell with a sudden explosive sigh he put down his glass well he said its glorious said i though i had not tasted the stuff my head was spinning i sat down my brain was chaos then my perception grew clear and minute as though i saw things in a concave mirror his manner seemed to have changed into something nervous and hasty he pulled out his watch and grimaced at it elevenseven and tonight i mustseventwentyfive waterloo i must go at once he called for the bill and struggled with his coat officious waiters came to our assistance in another moment i was wishing him goodbye over the apron of a cab and still with an absurd feeling of minute distinctness as thoughhow can i express iti not only saw but felt through an inverted operaglass that stuff he said he put his hand to his forehead i ought not to have given it to you it will make your head split tomorrow wait a minute here he handed me out a little flat thing like a seidlitzpowder take that in water as you are going to bed the other thing was a drug not till youre ready to go to bed mind it will clear your head thats all one more shakefuturus i gripped his shrivelled claw goodbye he said and by the droop of his eyelids i judged he too was a little under the influence of that braintwisting cordial he recollected something else with a start felt in his breastpocket and produced another packet this time a cylinder the size and shape of a shavingstick here said he id almost forgotten dont open this until i come tomorrowbut take it now it was so heavy that i wellnigh dropped it all ri said i and he grinned at me through the cab window as the cabman flicked his horse into wakefulness it was a white packet he had given me with red seals at either end and along its edge if this isnt money said i its platinum or lead i stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket and with a whirling brain walked home through the regent street loiterers and the dark back streets beyond portland road i remember the sensations of that walk very vividly strange as they were i was still so far myself that i could notice my strange mental state and wonder whether this stuff i had had was opiuma drug beyond my experience it is hard now to describe the peculiarity of my mental strangenessmental doubling vaguely expresses it as i was walking up regent street i found in my mind a queer persuasion that it was waterloo station and had an odd impulse to get into the polytechnic as a man might get into a train i put a knuckle in my eye and it was regent street how can i express it you see a skilful actor looking quietly at you he pulls a grimace and loanother person is it too extravagant if i tell you that it seemed to me as if regent street had for the moment done that then being persuaded it was regent street again i was oddly muddled about some fantastic reminiscences that cropped up thirty years ago thought i it was here that i quarrelled with my brother then i burst out laughing to the astonishment and encouragement of a group of night prowlers thirty years ago i did not exist and never in my life had i boasted a brother the stuff was surely liquid folly for the poignant regret for that lost brother still clung to me along portland road the madness took another turn i began to recall vanished shops and to compare the street with what it used to be confused troubled thinking is comprehensible enough after the drink i had taken but what puzzled me were these curiously vivid phantasm memories that had crept into my mind and not only the memories that had crept in but also the memories that had slipped out i stopped opposite stevens the natural history dealers and cudgelled my brains to think what he had to do with me a bus went by and sounded exactly like the rumbling of a train i seemed to be dipped into some dark remote pit for the recollection of course said i at last he has promised me three frogs tomorrow odd i should have forgotten do they still show children dissolving views in those i remember one view would begin like a faint ghost and grow and oust another in just that way it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sensations was struggling with those of my ordinary self i went on through euston road to tottenham court road puzzled and a little frightened and scarcely noticed the unusual way i was taking for commonly i used to cut through the intervening network of back streets i turned into university street to discover that i had forgotten my number only by a strong effort did i recall a and even then it seemed to me that it was a thing some forgotten person had told me i tried to steady my mind by recalling the incidents of the dinner and for the life of me i could conjure up no picture of my hosts face i saw him only as a shadowy outline as one might see oneself reflected in a window through which one was looking in his place however i had a curious exterior vision of myself sitting at a table flushed brighteyed and talkative i must take this other powder said i this is getting impossible i tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle and the matches and had a doubt of which landing my room might be on im drunk i said thats certain and blundered needlessly on the staircase to sustain the proposition at the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar what rot i said and stared about me i seemed to bring myself back by the effort and the odd phantasmal quality passed into the concrete familiar there was the old glass still with my notes on the albumens stuck in the corner of the frame my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the floor and yet it was not so real after all i felt an idiotic persuasion trying to creep into my mind as it were that i was in a railway carriage in a train just stopping that i was peering out of the window at some unknown station i gripped the bedrail firmly to reassure myself its clairvoyance perhaps i said i must write to the psychical research society i put the rouleau on my dressingtable sat on my bed and began to take off my boots it was as if the picture of my present sensations was painted over some other picture that was trying to show through curse it said i my wits are going or am i in two places at once halfundressed i tossed the powder into a glass and drank it off it effervesced and became a fluorescent amber colour before i was in bed my mind was already tranquillised i felt the pillow at my cheek and thereupon i must have fallen asleep i awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange beasts and found myself lying on my back probably everyone knows that dismal emotional dream from which one escapes awake indeed but strangely cowed there was a curious taste in my mouth a tired feeling in my limbs a sense of cutaneous discomfort i lay with my head motionless on my pillow expecting that my feeling of strangeness and terror would probably pass away and that i should then doze off again to sleep but instead of that my uncanny sensations increased at first i could perceive nothing wrong about me there was a faint light in the room so faint that it was the very next thing to darkness and the furniture stood out in it as vague blots of absolute darkness i stared with my eyes just over the bedclothes it came into my mind that someone had entered the room to rob me of my rouleau of money but after lying for some moments breathing regularly to simulate sleep i realised this was mere fancy nevertheless the uneasy assurance of something wrong kept fast hold of me with an effort i raised my head from the pillow and peered about me at the dark what it was i could not conceive i looked at the dim shapes around me the greater and lesser darknesses that indicated curtains table fireplace bookshelves and so forth then i began to perceive something unfamiliar in the forms of the darkness had the bed turned round yonder should be the bookshelves and something shrouded and pallid rose there something that would not answer to the bookshelves however i looked at it it was far too big to be my shirt thrown on a chair overcoming a childish terror i threw back the bedclothes and thrust my leg out of bed instead of coming out of my trucklebed upon the floor i found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mattress i made another step as it were and sat up on the edge of the bed by the side of my bed should be the candle and the matches upon the broken chair i put out my hand and touchednothing i waved my hand in the darkness and it came against some heavy hanging soft and thick in texture which gave a rustling noise at my touch i grasped this and pulled it it appeared to be a curtain suspended over the head of my bed i was now thoroughly awake and beginning to realise that i was in a strange room i was puzzled i tried to recall the overnight circumstances and i found them now curiously enough vivid in my memory the supper my reception of the little packages my wonder whether i was intoxicated my slow undressing the coolness to my flushed face of my pillow i felt a sudden distrust was that last night or the night before at anyrate this room was strange to me and i could not imagine how i had got into it the dim pallid outline was growing paler and i perceived it was a window with the dark shape of an oval toiletglass against the weak intimation of the dawn that filtered through the blind i stood up and was surprised by a curious feeling of weakness and unsteadiness with trembling hands outstretched i walked slowly towards the window getting nevertheless a bruise on the knee from a chair by the way i fumbled round the glass which was large with handsome brass sconces to find the blindcord i could not find any by chance i took hold of the tassel and with the click of a spring the blind ran up i found myself looking out upon a scene that was altogether strange to me the night was overcast and through the flocculent grey of the heaped clouds there filtered a faint halflight of dawn just at the edge of the sky the cloudcanopy had a bloodred rim below everything was dark and indistinct dim hills in the distance a vague mass of buildings running up into pinnacles trees like spilt ink and below the window a tracery of black bushes and pale grey paths it was so unfamiliar that for the moment i thought myself still dreaming i felt the toilettable it appeared to be made of some polished wood and was rather elaborately furnishedthere were little cutglass bottles and a brush upon it there was also a queer little object horseshoeshaped it felt with smooth hard projections lying in a saucer i could find no matches nor candlestick i turned my eyes to the room again now the blind was up faint spectres of its furnishing came out of the darkness there was a huge curtained bed and the fireplace at its foot had a large white mantel with something of the shimmer of marble i leant against the toilettable shut my eyes and opened them again and tried to think the whole thing was far too real for dreaming i was inclined to imagine there was still some hiatus in my memory as a consequence of my draught of that strange liqueur that i had come into my inheritance perhaps and suddenly lost my recollection of everything since my good fortune had been announced perhaps if i waited a little things would be clearer to me again yet my dinner with old elvesham was now singularly vivid and recent the champagne the observant waiters the powder and the liqueursi could have staked my soul it all happened a few hours ago and then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so terrible to me that i shiver now to think of that moment i spoke aloud i said how the devil did i get here and the voice was not my own it was not my own it was thin the articulation was slurred the resonance of my facial bones was different then to reassure myself i ran one hand over the other and felt loose folds of skin the bony laxity of age surely i said in that horrible voice that had somehow established itself in my throat surely this thing is a dream almost as quickly as if i did it involuntarily i thrust my fingers into my mouth my teeth had gone my fingertips ran on the flaccid surface of an even row of shrivelled gums i was sick with dismay and disgust i felt then a passionate desire to see myself to realise at once in its full horror the ghastly change that had come upon me i tottered to the mantel and felt along it for matches as i did so a barking cough sprang up in my throat and i clutched the thick flannel nightdress i found about me there were no matches there and i suddenly realised that my extremities were cold sniffing and coughing whimpering a little perhaps i fumbled back to bed it is surely a dream i whimpered to myself as i clambered back surely a dream it was a senile repetition i pulled the bedclothes over my shoulders over my ears i thrust my withered hand under the pillow and determined to compose myself to sleep of course it was a dream in the morning the dream would be over and i should wake up strong and vigorous again to my youth and studies i shut my eyes breathed regularly and finding myself wakeful began to count slowly through the powers of three but the thing i desired would not come i could not get to sleep and the persuasion of the inexorable reality of the change that had happened to me grew steadily presently i found myself with my eyes wide open the powers of three forgotten and my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled gums i was indeed suddenly and abruptly an old man i had in some unaccountable manner fallen through my life and come to old age in some way i had been cheated of all the best of my life of love of struggle of strength and hope i grovelled into the pillow and tried to persuade myself that such hallucination was possible imperceptibly steadily the dawn grew clearer at last despairing of further sleep i sat up in bed and looked about me a chill twilight rendered the whole chamber visible it was spacious and wellfurnished better furnished than any room i had ever slept in before a candle and matches became dimly visible upon a little pedestal in a recess i threw back the bedclothes and shivering with the rawness of the early morning albeit it was summertime i got out and lit the candle then trembling horribly so that the extinguisher rattled on its spike i tottered to the glass and sawelveshams face it was none the less horrible because i had already dimly feared as much he had already seemed physically weak and pitiful to me but seen now dressed only in a coarse flannel nightdress that fell apart and showed the stringy neck seen now as my own body i cannot describe its desolate decrepitude the hollow cheeks the straggling tail of dirty grey hair the rheumy bleared eyes the quivering shrivelled lips the lower displaying a gleam of the pink interior lining and those horrible dark gums showing you who are mind and body together at your natural years cannot imagine what this fiendish imprisonment meant to me to be young and full of the desire and energy of youth and to be caught and presently to be crushed in this tottering ruin of a body but i wander from the course of my story for some time i must have been stunned at this change that had come upon me it was daylight when i did so far gather myself together as to think in some inexplicable way i had been changed though how short of magic the thing had been done i could not say and as i thought the diabolical ingenuity of elvesham came home to me it seemed plain to me that as i found myself in his so he must be in possession of my body of my strength that is and my future but how to prove it then as i thought the thing became so incredible even to me that my mind reeled and i had to pinch myself to feel my toothless gums to see myself in the glass and touch the things about me before i could steady myself to face the facts again was all life hallucination was i indeed elvesham and he me had i been dreaming of eden overnight was there any eden but if i was elvesham i should remember where i was on the previous morning the name of the town in which i lived what happened before the dream began i struggled with my thoughts i recalled the queer doubleness of my memories overnight but now my mind was clear not the ghost of any memories but those proper to eden could i raise this way lies insanity i cried in my piping voice i staggered to my feet dragged my feeble heavy limbs to the washhandstand and plunged my grey head into a basin of cold water then towelling myself i tried again it was no good i felt beyond all question that i was indeed eden not elvesham but eden in elveshams body had i been a man of any other age i might have given myself up to my fate as one enchanted but in these sceptical days miracles do not pass current here was some trick of psychology what a drug and a steady stare could do a drug and a steady stare or some similar treatment could surely undo men have lost their memories before but to exchange memories as one does umbrellas i laughed alas not a healthy laugh but a wheezing senile titter i could have fancied old elvesham laughing at my plight and a gust of petulant anger unusual to me swept across my feelings i began dressing eagerly in the clothes i found lying about on the floor and only realised when i was dressed that it was an evening suit i had assumed i opened the wardrobe and found some more ordinary clothes a pair of plaid trousers and an oldfashioned dressinggown i put a venerable smokingcap on my venerable head and coughing a little from my exertions tottered out upon the landing it was then perhaps a quarter to six and the blinds were closely drawn and the house quite silent the landing was a spacious one a broad richlycarpeted staircase went down into the darkness of the hall below and before me a door ajar showed me a writingdesk a revolving bookcase the back of a study chair and a fine array of bound books shelf upon shelf my study i mumbled and walked across the landing then at the sound of my voice a thought struck me and i went back to the bedroom and put in the set of false teeth they slipped in with the ease of old habit thats better said i gnashing them and so returned to the study the drawers of the writingdesk were locked its revolving top was also locked i could see no indications of the keys and there were none in the pockets of my trousers i shuffled back at once to the bedroom and went through the dress suit and afterwards the pockets of all the garments i could find i was very eager and one might have imagined that burglars had been at work to see my room when i had done not only were there no keys to be found but not a coin nor a scrap of papersave only the receipted bill of the overnight dinner a curious weariness asserted itself i sat down and stared at the garments flung here and there their pockets turned inside out my first frenzy had already flickered out every moment i was beginning to realise the immense intelligence of the plans of my enemy to see more and more clearly the hopelessness of my position with an effort i rose and hurried hobbling into the study again on the staircase was a housemaid pulling up the blinds she stared i think at the expression of my face i shut the door of the study behind me and seizing a poker began an attack upon the desk that is how they found me the cover of the desk was split the lock smashed the letters torn out of the pigeonholes and tossed about the room in my senile rage i had flung about the pens and other such light stationery and overturned the ink moreover a large vase upon the mantel had got brokeni do not know how i could find no chequebook no money no indications of the slightest use for the recovery of my body i was battering madly at the drawers when the butler backed by two womenservants intruded upon me that simply is the story of my change no one will believe my frantic assertions i am treated as one demented and even at this moment i am under restraint but i am sane absolutely sane and to prove it i have sat down to write this story minutely as the things happened to me i appeal to the reader whether there is any trace of insanity in the style or method of the story he has been reading i am a young man locked away in an old mans body but the clear fact is incredible to everyone naturally i appear demented to those who will not believe this naturally i do not know the names of my secretaries of the doctors who come to see me of my servants and neighbours of this town wherever it is where i find myself naturally i lose myself in my own house and suffer inconveniences of every sort naturally i ask the oddest questions naturally i weep and cry out and have paroxysms of despair i have no money and no chequebook the bank will not recognise my signature for i suppose that allowing for the feeble muscles i now have my handwriting is still edens these people about me will not let me go to the bank personally it seems indeed that there is no bank in this town and that i have an account in some part of london it seems that elvesham kept the name of his solicitor secret from all his householdi can ascertain nothing elvesham was of course a profound student of mental science and all my declarations of the facts of the case merely confirm the theory that my insanity is the outcome of overmuch brooding upon psychology dreams of the personal identity indeed two days ago i was a healthy youngster with all life before me now i am a furious old man unkempt and desperate and miserable prowling about a great luxurious strange house watched feared and avoided as a lunatic by everyone about me and in london is elvesham beginning life again in a vigorous body and with all the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of threescore and ten he has stolen my life what has happened i do not clearly know in the study are volumes of manuscript notes referring chiefly to the psychology of memory and parts of what may be either calculations or ciphers in symbols absolutely strange to me in some passages there are indications that he was also occupied with the philosophy of mathematics i take it he has transferred the whole of his memories the accumulation that makes up his personality from this old withered brain of his to mine and similarly that he has transferred mine to his discarded tenement practically that is he has changed bodies but how such a change may be possible is without the range of my philosophy i have been a materialist for all my thinking life but here suddenly is a clear case of mans detachability from matter one desperate experiment i am about to try i sit writing here before putting the matter to issue this morning with the help of a tableknife that i had secreted at breakfast i succeeded in breaking open a fairly obvious secret drawer in this wrecked writingdesk i discovered nothing save a little green glass phial containing a white powder round the neck of the phial was a label and thereon was written this one word release this may beis most probably poison i can understand elvesham placing poison in my way and i should be sure that it was his intention so to get rid of the only living witness against him were it not for this careful concealment the man has practically solved the problem of immortality save for the spite of chance he will live in my body until it has aged and then again throwing that aside he will assume some other victims youth and strength when one remembers his heartlessness it is terrible to think of the evergrowing experience that how long has he been leaping from body to body but i tire of writing the powder appears to be soluble in water the taste is not unpleasant there the narrative found upon mr elveshams desk ends his dead body lay between the desk and the chair the latter had been pushed back probably by his last convulsions the story was written in pencil and in a crazy hand quite unlike his usual minute characters there remain only two curious facts to record indisputably there was some connection between eden and elvesham since the whole of elveshams property was bequeathed to the young man but he never inherited when elvesham committed suicide eden was strangely enough already dead twentyfour hours before he had been knocked down by a cab and killed instantly at the crowded crossing at the intersection of gower street and euston road so that the only human being who could have thrown light upon this fantastic narrative is beyond the reach of questions without further comment i leave this extraordinary matter to the readers individual judgment in the abyss the lieutenant stood in front of the steel sphere and gnawed a piece of pine splinter what do you think of it steevens he asked its an idea said steevens in the tone of one who keeps an open mind i believe it will smashflat said the lieutenant he seems to have calculated it all out pretty well said steevens still impartial but think of the pressure said the lieutenant at the surface of the water its fourteen pounds to the inch thirty feet down its double that sixty treble ninety four times nine hundred forty times five thousand three hundredthats a mileits two hundred and forty times fourteen pounds thatslets seethirty hundredweighta ton and a half steevens a ton and a half to the square inch and the ocean where hes going is five miles deep thats seven and a half sounds a lot said steevens but its jolly thick steel the lieutenant made no answer but resumed his pine splinter the object of their conversation was a huge ball of steel having an exterior diameter of perhaps nine feet it looked like the shot for some titanic piece of artillery it was elaborately nested in a monstrous scaffolding built into the framework of the vessel and the gigantic spars that were presently to sling it overboard gave the stern of the ship an appearance that had raised the curiosity of every decent sailor who had sighted it from the pool of london to the tropic of capricorn in two places one above the other the steel gave place to a couple of circular windows of enormously thick glass and one of these set in a steel frame of great solidity was now partially unscrewed both the men had seen the interior of this globe for the first time that morning it was elaborately padded with air cushions with little studs sunk between bulging pillows to work the simple mechanism of the affair everything was elaborately padded even the myers apparatus which was to absorb carbonic acid and replace the oxygen inspired by its tenant when he had crept in by the glass manhole and had been screwed in it was so elaborately padded that a man might have been fired from a gun in it with perfect safety and it had need to be for presently a man was to crawl in through that glass manhole to be screwed up tightly and to be flung overboard and to sink downdowndown for five miles even as the lieutenant said it had taken the strongest hold of his imagination it made him a bore at mess and he found steevens the new arrival aboard a godsend to talk to about it over and over again its my opinion said the lieutenant that that glass will simply bend in and bulge and smash under a pressure of that sort daubree has made rocks run like water under big pressuresand you mark my words if the glass did break in said steevens what then the water would shoot in like a jet of iron have you ever felt a straight jet of high pressure water it would hit as hard as a bullet it would simply smash him and flatten him it would tear down his throat and into his lungs it would blow in his ears what a detailed imagination you have protested steevens who saw things vividly its a simple statement of the inevitable said the lieutenant and the globe would just give out a few little bubbles and it would settle down comfortably against the day of judgment among the oozes and the bottom claywith poor elstead spread over his own smashed cushions like butter over bread he repeated this sentence as though he liked it very much like butter over bread he said having a look at the jigger said a voice and elstead stood behind them spick and span in white with a cigarette between his teeth and his eyes smiling out of the shadow of his ample hatbrim whats that about bread and butter weybridge grumbling as usual about the insufficient pay of naval officers it wont be more than a day now before i start we are to get the slings ready today this clean sky and gentle swell is just the kind of thing for swinging off a dozen tons of lead and iron isnt it it wont affect you much said weybridge no seventy or eighty feet down and i shall be there in a dozen seconds theres not a particle moving though the wind shriek itself hoarse up above and the water lifts halfway to the clouds no down there he moved to the side of the ship and the other two followed him all three leant forward on their elbows and stared down into the yellowgreen water peace said elstead finishing his thought aloud are you dead certain that clockwork will act asked weybridge presently it has worked thirtyfive times said elstead its bound to work but if it doesnt why shouldnt it i wouldnt go down in that confounded thing said weybridge for twenty thousand pounds cheerful chap you are said elstead and spat sociably at a bubble below i dont understand yet how you mean to work the thing said steevens in the first place im screwed into the sphere said elstead and when ive turned the electric light off and on three times to show im cheerful im swung out over the stern by that crane with all those big lead sinkers slung below me the top lead weight has a roller carrying a hundred fathoms of strong cord rolled up and thats all that joins the sinkers to the sphere except the slings that will be cut when the affair is dropped we use cord rather than wire rope because its easier to cut and more buoyantnecessary points as you will see through each of these lead weights you notice there is a hole and an iron rod will be run through that and will project six feet on the lower side if that rod is rammed up from below it knocks up a lever and sets the clockwork in motion at the side of the cylinder on which the cord winds very well the whole affair is lowered gently into the water and the slings are cut the sphere floatswith the air in it its lighter than waterbut the lead weights go down straight and the cord runs out when the cord is all paid out the sphere will go down too pulled down by the cord but why the cord asked steevens why not fasten the weights directly to the sphere because of the smash down below the whole affair will go rushing down mile after mile at a headlong pace at last it would be knocked to pieces on the bottom if it wasnt for that cord but the weights will hit the bottom and directly they do the buoyancy of the sphere will come into play it will go on sinking slower and slower come to a stop at last and then begin to float upward again thats where the clockwork comes in directly the weights smash against the sea bottom the rod will be knocked through and will kick up the clockwork and the cord will be rewound on the reel i shall be lugged down to the sea bottom there i shall stay for half an hour with the electric light on looking about me then the clockwork will release a spring knife the cord will be cut and up i shall rush again like a sodawater bubble the cord itself will help the flotation and if you should chance to hit a ship said weybridge i should come up at such a pace i should go clean through it said elstead like a cannon ball you neednt worry about that and suppose some nimble crustacean should wriggle into your clockwork it would be a pressing sort of invitation for me to stop said elstead turning his back on the water and staring at the sphere they had swung elstead overboard by eleven oclock the day was serenely bright and calm with the horizon lost in haze the electric glare in the little upper compartment beamed cheerfully three times then they let him down slowly to the surface of the water and a sailor in the stern chains hung ready to cut the tackle that held the lead weights and the sphere together the globe which had looked so large on deck looked the smallest thing conceivable under the stern of the ship it rolled a little and its two dark windows which floated uppermost seemed like eyes turned up in round wonderment at the people who crowded the rail a voice wondered how elstead liked the rolling are you ready sang out the commander ay ay sir then let her go the rope of the tackle tightened against the blade and was cut and an eddy rolled over the globe in a grotesquely helpless fashion someone waved a handkerchief someone else tried an ineffectual cheer a middy was counting slowly eight nine ten another roll then with a jerk and a splash the thing righted itself it seemed to be stationary for a moment to grow rapidly smaller and then the water closed over it and it became visible enlarged by refraction and dimmer below the surface before one could count three it had disappeared there was a flicker of white light far down in the water that diminished to a speck and vanished then there was nothing but a depth of water going down into blackness through which a shark was swimming then suddenly the screw of the cruiser began to rotate the water was crickled the shark disappeared in a wrinkled confusion and a torrent of foam rushed across the crystalline clearness that had swallowed up elstead whats the idee said one ab to another were going to lay off about a couple of miles fear he should hit us when he comes up said his mate the ship steamed slowly to her new position aboard her almost everyone who was unoccupied remained watching the breathing swell into which the sphere had sunk for the next halfhour it is doubtful if a word was spoken that did not bear directly or indirectly on elstead the december sun was now high in the sky and the heat very considerable hell be cold enough down there said weybridge they say that below a certain depth sea waters always just about freezing wherell he come up asked steevens ive lost my bearings thats the spot said the commander who prided himself on his omniscience he extended a precise finger southeastward and this i reckon is pretty nearly the moment he said hes been thirtyfive minutes how long does it take to reach the bottom of the ocean asked steevens for a depth of five miles and reckoningas we didan acceleration of two feet per second both ways is just about threequarters of a minute then hes overdue said weybridge pretty nearly said the commander i suppose it takes a few minutes for that cord of his to wind in i forgot that said weybridge evidently relieved and then began the suspense a minute slowly dragged itself out and no sphere shot out of the water another followed and nothing broke the low oily swell the sailors explained to one another that little point about the windingin of the cord the rigging was dotted with expectant faces come up elstead called one hairychested salt impatiently and the others caught it up and shouted as though they were waiting for the curtain of a theatre to rise the commander glanced irritably at them of course if the accelerations less than two he said hell be all the longer we arent absolutely certain that was the proper figure im no slavish believer in calculations steevens agreed concisely no one on the quarterdeck spoke for a couple of minutes then steevens watchcase clicked when twentyone minutes after the sun reached the zenith they were still waiting for the globe to reappear and not a man aboard had dared to whisper that hope was dead it was weybridge who first gave expression to that realisation he spoke while the sound of eight bells still hung in the air i always distrusted that window he said quite suddenly to steevens good god said steevens you dont think well said weybridge and left the rest to his imagination im no great believer in calculations myself said the commander dubiously so that im not altogether hopeless yet and at midnight the gunboat was steaming slowly in a spiral round the spot where the globe had sunk and the white beam of the electric light fled and halted and swept discontentedly onward again over the waste of phosphorescent waters under the little stars if his window hasnt burst and smashed him said weybridge then its a cursed sight worse for his clockwork has gone wrong and hes alive now five miles under our feet down there in the cold and dark anchored in that little bubble of his where never a ray of light has shone or a human being lived since the waters were gathered together hes there without food feeling hungry and thirsty and scared wondering whether hell starve or stifle which will it be the myers apparatus is running out i suppose how long do they last good heavens he exclaimed what little things we are what daring little devils down there miles and miles of waterall water and all this empty water about us and this sky gulfs he threw his hands out and as he did so a little white streak swept noiselessly up the sky travelled more slowly stopped became a motionless dot as though a new star had fallen up into the sky then it went sliding back again and lost itself amidst the reflections of the stars and the white haze of the seas phosphorescence at the sight he stopped arm extended and mouth open he shut his mouth opened it again and waved his arms with an impatient gesture then he turned shouted elstead ahoy to the first watch and went at a run to lindley and the searchlight i saw him he said starboard there his lights on and hes just shot out of the water bring the light round we ought to see him drifting when he lifts on the swell but they never picked up the explorer until dawn then they almost ran him down the crane was swung out and a boats crew hooked the chain to the sphere when they had shipped the sphere they unscrewed the manhole and peered into the darkness of the interior for the electric light chamber was intended to illuminate the water about the sphere and was shut off entirely from its general cavity the air was very hot within the cavity and the indiarubber at the lip of the manhole was soft there was no answer to their eager questions and no sound of movement within elstead seemed to be lying motionless crumpled up in the bottom of the globe the ships doctor crawled in and lifted him out to the men outside for a moment or so they did not know whether elstead was alive or dead his face in the yellow light of the ships lamps glistened with perspiration they carried him down to his own cabin he was not dead they found but in a state of absolute nervous collapse and besides cruelly bruised for some days he had to lie perfectly still it was a week before he could tell his experiences almost his first words were that he was going down again the sphere would have to be altered he said in order to allow him to throw off the cord if need be and that was all he had had the most marvellous experience you thought i should find nothing but ooze he said you laughed at my explorations and ive discovered a new world he told his story in disconnected fragments and chiefly from the wrong end so that it is impossible to retell it in his words but what follows is the narrative of his experience it began atrociously he said before the cord ran out the thing kept rolling over he felt like a frog in a football he could see nothing but the crane and the sky overhead with an occasional glimpse of the people on the ships rail he couldnt tell a bit which way the thing would roll next suddenly he would find his feet going up and try to step and over he went rolling head over heels and just anyhow on the padding any other shape would have been more comfortable but no other shape was to be relied upon under the huge pressure of the nethermost abyss suddenly the swaying ceased the globe righted and when he had picked himself up he saw the water all about him greenyblue with an attenuated light filtering down from above and a shoal of little floating things went rushing up past him as it seemed to him towards the light and even as he looked it grew darker and darker until the water above was as dark as the midnight sky albeit of a greener shade and the water below black and little transparent things in the water developed a faint glint of luminosity and shot past him in faint greenish streaks and the feeling of falling it was just like the start of a lift he said only it kept on one has to imagine what that means that keeping on it was then of all times that elstead repented of his adventure he saw the chances against him in an altogether new light he thought of the big cuttlefish people knew to exist in the middle waters the kind of things they find half digested in whales at times or floating dead and rotten and half eaten by fish suppose one caught hold and wouldnt let go and had the clockwork really been sufficiently tested but whether he wanted to go on or to go back mattered not the slightest now in fifty seconds everything was as black as night outside except where the beam from his light struck through the waters and picked out every now and then some fish or scrap of sinking matter they flashed by too fast for him to see what they were once he thinks he passed a shark and then the sphere began to get hot by friction against the water they had underestimated this it seems the first thing he noticed was that he was perspiring and then he heard a hissing growing louder under his feet and saw a lot of little bubblesvery little bubbles they wererushing upward like a fan through the water outside steam he felt the window and it was hot he turned on the minute glowlamp that lit his own cavity looked at the padded watch by the studs and saw he had been travelling now for two minutes it came into his head that the window would crack through the conflict of temperatures for he knew the bottom water is very near freezing then suddenly the floor of the sphere seemed to press against his feet the rush of bubbles outside grew slower and slower and the hissing diminished the sphere rolled a little the window had not cracked nothing had given and he knew that the dangers of sinking at anyrate were over in another minute or so he would be on the floor of the abyss he thought he said of steevens and weybridge and the rest of them five miles overhead higher to him than the very highest clouds that ever floated over land are to us steaming slowly and staring down and wondering what had happened to him he peered out of the window there were no more bubbles now and the hissing had stopped outside there was a heavy blacknessas black as black velvetexcept where the electric light pierced the empty water and showed the colour of ita yellowgreen then three things like shapes of fire swam into sight following each other through the water whether they were little and near or big and far off he could not tell each was outlined in a bluish light almost as bright as the lights of a fishing smack a light which seemed to be smoking greatly and all along the sides of them were specks of this like the lighter portholes of a ship their phosphorescence seemed to go out as they came into the radiance of his lamp and he saw then that they were little fish of some strange sort with huge heads vast eyes and dwindling bodies and tails their eyes were turned towards him and he judged they were following him down he supposed they were attracted by his glare presently others of the same sort joined them as he went on down he noticed that the water became of a pallid colour and that little specks twinkled in his ray like motes in a sunbeam this was probably due to the clouds of ooze and mud that the impact of his leaden sinkers had disturbed by the time he was drawn down to the lead weights he was in a dense fog of white that his electric light failed altogether to pierce for more than a few yards and many minutes elapsed before the hanging sheets of sediment subsided to any extent then lit by his light and by the transient phosphorescence of a distant shoal of fishes he was able to see under the huge blackness of the superincumbent water an undulating expanse of greyishwhite ooze broken here and there by tangled thickets of a growth of sea lilies waving hungry tentacles in the air farther away were the graceful translucent outlines of a group of gigantic sponges about this floor there were scattered a number of bristling flattish tufts of rich purple and black which he decided must be some sort of seaurchin and small largeeyed or blind things having a curious resemblance some to woodlice and others to lobsters crawled sluggishly across the track of the light and vanished into the obscurity again leaving furrowed trails behind them then suddenly the hovering swarm of little fishes veered about and came towards him as a flight of starlings might do they passed over him like a phosphorescent snow and then he saw behind them some larger creature advancing towards the sphere at first he could see it only dimly a faintly moving figure remotely suggestive of a walking man and then it came into the spray of light that the lamp shot out as the glare struck it it shut its eyes dazzled he stared in rigid astonishment it was a strange vertebrated animal its dark purple head was dimly suggestive of a chameleon but it had such a high forehead and such a braincase as no reptile ever displayed before the vertical pitch of its face gave it a most extraordinary resemblance to a human being two large and protruding eyes projected from sockets in chameleon fashion and it had a broad reptilian mouth with horny lips beneath its little nostrils in the position of the ears were two huge gillcovers and out of these floated a branching tree of coralline filaments almost like the treelike gills that very young rays and sharks possess but the humanity of the face was not the most extraordinary thing about the creature it was a biped its almost globular body was poised on a tripod of two froglike legs and a long thick tail and its fore limbs which grotesquely caricatured the human hand much as a frogs do carried a long shaft of bone tipped with copper the colour of the creature was variegated its head hands and legs were purple but its skin which hung loosely upon it even as clothes might do was a phosphorescent grey and it stood there blinded by the light at last this unknown creature of the abyss blinked its eyes open and shading them with its disengaged hand opened its mouth and gave vent to a shouting noise articulate almost as speech might be that penetrated even the steel case and padded jacket of the sphere how a shouting may be accomplished without lungs elstead does not profess to explain it then moved sideways out of the glare into the mystery of shadow that bordered it on either side and elstead felt rather than saw that it was coming towards him fancying the light had attracted it he turned the switch that cut off the current in another moment something soft dabbed upon the steel and the globe swayed then the shouting was repeated and it seemed to him that a distant echo answered it the dabbing recurred and the globe swayed and ground against the spindle over which the wire was rolled he stood in the blackness and peered out into the everlasting night of the abyss and presently he saw very faint and remote other phosphorescent quasihuman forms hurrying towards him hardly knowing what he did he felt about in his swaying prison for the stud of the exterior electric light and came by accident against his own small glowlamp in its padded recess the sphere twisted and then threw him down he heard shouts like shouts of surprise and when he rose to his feet he saw two pairs of stalked eyes peering into the lower window and reflecting his light in another moment hands were dabbing vigorously at his steel casing and there was a sound horrible enough in his position of the metal protection of the clockwork being vigorously hammered that indeed sent his heart into his mouth for if these strange creatures succeeded in stopping that his release would never occur scarcely had he thought as much when he felt the sphere sway violently and the floor of it press hard against his feet he turned off the small glowlamp that lit the interior and sent the ray of the large light in the separate compartment out into the water the seafloor and the manlike creatures had disappeared and a couple of fish chasing each other dropped suddenly by the window he thought at once that these strange denizens of the deep sea had broken the rope and that he had escaped he drove up faster and faster and then stopped with a jerk that sent him flying against the padded roof of his prison for half a minute perhaps he was too astonished to think then he felt that the sphere was spinning slowly and rocking and it seemed to him that it was also being drawn through the water by crouching close to the window he managed to make his weight effective and roll that part of the sphere downward but he could see nothing save the pale ray of his light striking down ineffectively into the darkness it occurred to him that he would see more if he turned the lamp off and allowed his eyes to grow accustomed to the profound obscurity in this he was wise after some minutes the velvety blackness became a translucent blackness and then far away and as faint as the zodiacal light of an english summer evening he saw shapes moving below he judged these creatures had detached his cable and were towing him along the sea bottom and then he saw something faint and remote across the undulations of the submarine plain a broad horizon of pale luminosity that extended this way and that way as far as the range of his little window permitted him to see to this he was being towed as a balloon might be towed by men out of the open country into a town he approached it very slowly and very slowly the dim irradiation was gathered together into more definite shapes it was nearly five oclock before he came over this luminous area and by that time he could make out an arrangement suggestive of streets and houses grouped about a vast roofless erection that was grotesquely suggestive of a ruined abbey it was spread out like a map below him the houses were all roofless enclosures of walls and their substance being as he afterwards saw of phosphorescent bones gave the place an appearance as if it were built of drowned moonshine among the inner caves of the place waving trees of crinoid stretched their tentacles and tall slender glassy sponges shot like shining minarets and lilies of filmy light out of the general glow of the city in the open spaces of the place he could see a stirring movement as of crowds of people but he was too many fathoms above them to distinguish the individuals in those crowds then slowly they pulled him down and as they did so the details of the place crept slowly upon his apprehension he saw that the courses of the cloudy buildings were marked out with beaded lines of round objects and then he perceived that at several points below him in broad open spaces were forms like the encrusted shapes of ships slowly and surely he was drawn down and the forms below him became brighter clearer more distinct he was being pulled down he perceived towards the large building in the centre of the town and he could catch a glimpse ever and again of the multitudinous forms that were lugging at his cord he was astonished to see that the rigging of one of the ships which formed such a prominent feature of the place was crowded with a host of gesticulating figures regarding him and then the walls of the great building rose about him silently and hid the city from his eyes and such walls they were of waterlogged wood and twisted wirerope and iron spars and copper and the bones and skulls of dead men the skulls ran in zigzag lines and spirals and fantastic curves over the building and in and out of their eyesockets and over the whole surface of the place lurked and played a multitude of silvery little fishes suddenly his ears were filled with a low shouting and a noise like the violent blowing of horns and this gave place to a fantastic chant down the sphere sank past the huge pointed windows through which he saw vaguely a great number of these strange ghostlike people regarding him and at last he came to rest as it seemed on a kind of altar that stood in the centre of the place and now he was at such a level that he could see these strange people of the abyss plainly once more to his astonishment he perceived that they were prostrating themselves before him all save one dressed as it seemed in a robe of placoid scales and crowned with a luminous diadem who stood with his reptilian mouth opening and shutting as though he led the chanting of the worshippers a curious impulse made elstead turn on his small glowlamp again so that he became visible to these creatures of the abyss albeit the glare made them disappear forthwith into night at this sudden sight of him the chanting gave place to a tumult of exultant shouts and elstead being anxious to watch them turned his light off again and vanished from before their eyes but for a time he was too blind to make out what they were doing and when at last he could distinguish them they were kneeling again and thus they continued worshipping him without rest or intermission for the space of three hours most circumstantial was elsteads account of this astounding city and its people these people of perpetual night who have never seen sun or moon or stars green vegetation nor any living airbreathing creatures who know nothing of fire nor any light but the phosphorescent light of living things startling as is his story it is yet more startling to find that scientific men of such eminence as adams and jenkins find nothing incredible in it they tell me they see no reason why intelligent waterbreathing vertebrated creatures inured to a low temperature and enormous pressure and of such a heavy structure that neither alive nor dead would they float might not live upon the bottom of the deep sea and quite unsuspected by us descendants like ourselves of the great theriomorpha of the new red sandstone age we should be known to them however as strange meteoric creatures wont to fall catastrophically dead out of the mysterious blackness of their watery sky and not only we ourselves but our ships our metals our appliances would come raining down out of the night sometimes sinking things would smite down and crush them as if it were the judgment of some unseen power above and sometimes would come things of the utmost rarity or utility or shapes of inspiring suggestion one can understand perhaps something of their behaviour at the descent of a living man if one thinks what a barbaric people might do to whom an enhaloed shining creature came suddenly out of the sky at one time or another elstead probably told the officers of the ptarmigan every detail of his strange twelve hours in the abyss that he also intended to write them down is certain but he never did and so unhappily we have to piece together the discrepant fragments of his story from the reminiscences of commander simmons weybridge steevens lindley and the others we see the thing darkly in fragmentary glimpsesthe huge ghostly building the bowing chanting people with their dark chameleonlike heads and faintly luminous clothing and elstead with his light turned on again vainly trying to convey to their minds that the cord by which the sphere was held was to be severed minute after minute slipped away and elstead looking at his watch was horrified to find that he had oxygen only for four hours more but the chant in his honour kept on as remorselessly as if it was the marching song of his approaching death the manner of his release he does not understand but to judge by the end of cord that hung from the sphere it had been cut through by rubbing against the edge of the altar abruptly the sphere rolled over and he swept up out of their world as an ethereal creature clothed in a vacuum would sweep through our own atmosphere back to its native ether again he must have torn out of their sight as a hydrogen bubble hastens upward from our air a strange ascension it must have seemed to them the sphere rushed up with even greater velocity than when weighted with the lead sinkers it had rushed down it became exceedingly hot it drove up with the windows uppermost and he remembers the torrent of bubbles frothing against the glass every moment he expected this to fly then suddenly something like a huge wheel seemed to be released in his head the padded compartment began spinning about him and he fainted his next recollection was of his cabin and of the doctors voice but that is the substance of the extraordinary story that elstead related in fragments to the officers of the ptarmigan he promised to write it all down at a later date his mind was chiefly occupied with the improvement of his apparatus which was effected at rio it remains only to tell that on february he made his second descent into the ocean abyss with the improvements his first experience suggested what happened we shall probably never know he never returned the ptarmigan beat about over the point of his submersion seeking him in vain for thirteen days then she returned to rio and the news was telegraphed to his friends so the matter remains for the present but it is hardly probable that no further attempt will be made to verify his strange story of these hitherto unsuspected cities of the deep sea the apple i must get rid of it said the man in the corner of the carriage abruptly breaking the silence mr hinchcliff looked up hearing imperfectly he had been lost in the rapt contemplation of the college cap tied by a string to his portmanteau handlesthe outward and visible sign of his newlygained pedagogic positionin the rapt appreciation of the college cap and the pleasant anticipations it excited for mr hinchcliff had just matriculated at london university and was going to be junior assistant at the holmwood grammar schoola very enviable position he stared across the carriage at his fellowtraveller why not give it away said this person give it away why not he was a tall dark sunburnt man with a pale face his arms were folded tightly and his feet were on the seat in front of him he was pulling at a lank black moustache he stared hard at his toes why not he said mr hinchcliff coughed the stranger lifted his eyesthey were curious darkgrey eyesand stared blankly at mr hinchcliff for the best part of a minute perhaps his expression grew to interest yes he said slowly why not and end it i dont quite follow you im afraid said mr hinchcliff with another cough you dont quite follow me said the stranger quite mechanically his singular eyes wandering from mr hinchcliff to the bag with its ostentatiously displayed cap and back to mr hinchcliffs downy face youre so abrupt you know apologised mr hinchcliff why shouldnt i said the stranger following his thoughts you are a student he said addressing mr hinchcliff i amby correspondenceof the london university said mr hinchcliff with irrepressible pride and feeling nervously at his tie in pursuit of knowledge said the stranger and suddenly took his feet off the seat put his fist on his knees and stared at mr hinchcliff as though he had never seen a student before yes he said and flung out an index finger then he rose took a bag from the hatrack and unlocked it quite silently he drew out something round and wrapped in a quantity of silverpaper and unfolded this carefully he held it out towards mr hinchcliffa small very smooth goldenyellow fruit mr hinchcliffs eyes and mouth were open he did not offer to take this objectif he was intended to take it that said this fantastic stranger speaking very slowly is the apple of the tree of knowledge look at itsmall and bright and wonderfulknowledgeand i am going to give it to you mr hinchcliffs mind worked painfully for a minute and then the sufficient explanation mad flashed across his brain and illuminated the whole situation one humoured madmen he put his head a little on one side the apple of the tree of knowledge eigh said mr hinchcliff regarding it with a finely assumed air of interest and then looking at the interlocutor but dont you want to eat it yourself and besideshow did you come by it it never fades i have had it now three months and it is ever bright and smooth and ripe and desirable as you see it he laid his hand on his knee and regarded the fruit musingly then he began to wrap it again in the papers as though he had abandoned his intention of giving it away but how did you come by it said mr hinchcliff who had his argumentative side and how do you know that it is the fruit of the tree i bought this fruit said the stranger three months agofor a drink of water and a crust of bread the man who gave it to mebecause i kept the life in himwas an armenian armenia that wonderful country the first of all countries where the ark of the flood remains to this day buried in the glaciers of mount ararat this man i say fleeing with others from the kurds who had come upon them went up into desolate places among the mountainsplaces beyond the common knowledge of men and fleeing from imminent pursuit they came to a slope high among the mountainpeaks green with a grass like knifeblades that cut and slashed most pitilessly at anyone who went into it the kurds were close behind and there was nothing for it but to plunge in and the worst of it was that the paths they made through it at the price of their blood served for the kurds to follow every one of the fugitives was killed save this armenian and another he heard the screams and cries of his friends and the swish of the grass about those who were pursuing themit was tall grass rising overhead and then a shouting and answers and when presently he paused everything was still he pushed out again not understanding cut and bleeding until he came out on a steep slope of rocks below a precipice and then he saw the grass was all on fire and the smoke of it rose like a veil between him and his enemies the stranger paused yes said mr hinchcliff yes there he was all torn and bloody from the knifeblades of the grass the rocks blazing under the afternoon sunthe sky molten brassand the smoke of the fire driving towards him he dared not stay there death he did not mind but torture far away beyond the smoke he heard shouts and cries women screaming so he went clambering up a gorge in the rockseverywhere were bushes with dry branches that stuck out like thorns among the leavesuntil he clambered over the brow of a ridge that hid him and then he met his companion a shepherd who had also escaped and counting cold and famine and thirst as nothing against the kurds they went on into the heights and among the snow and ice they wandered three whole days the third day came the vision i suppose hungry men often do see visions but then there is this fruit he lifted the wrapped globe in his hand and i have heard it too from other mountaineers who have known something of the legend it was in the evening time when the stars were increasing that they came down a slope of polished rock into a huge dark valley all set about with strange contorted trees and in these trees hung little globes like glowworm spheres strange round yellow lights suddenly this valley was lit far away many miles away far down it with a golden flame marching slowly athwart it that made the stunted trees against it black as night and turned the slopes all about them and their figures to the likeness of fiery gold and at the vision they knowing the legends of the mountains instantly knew that it was eden they saw or the sentinel of eden and they fell upon their faces like men struck dead when they dared to look again the valley was dark for a space and then the light came againreturning a burning amber at that the shepherd sprang to his feet and with a shout began to run down towards the light but the other man was too fearful to follow him he stood stunned amazed and terrified watching his companion recede towards the marching glare and hardly had the shepherd set out when there came a noise like thunder the beating of invisible wings hurrying up the valley and a great and terrible fear and at that the man who gave me the fruit turnedif he might still escape and hurrying headlong up the slope again with that tumult sweeping after him he stumbled against one of these stunted bushes and a ripe fruit came off it into his hand this fruit forthwith the wings and the thunder rolled all about him he fell and fainted and when he came to his senses he was back among the blackened ruins of his own village and i and the others were attending to the wounded a vision but the golden fruit of the tree was still clutched in his hand there were others there who knew the legend knew what that strange fruit might be he paused and this is it he said it was a most extraordinary story to be told in a thirdclass carriage on a sussex railway it was as if the real was a mere veil to the fantastic and here was the fantastic poking through is it was all mr hinchcliff could say the legend said the stranger tells that those thickets of dwarfed trees growing about the garden sprang from the apple that adam carried in his hand when he and eve were driven forth he felt something in his hand saw the halfeaten apple and flung it petulantly aside and there they grow in that desolate valley girdled round with the everlasting snows and there the fiery swords keep ward against the judgment day but i thought these things weremr hinchcliff pausedfablesparables rather do you mean to tell me that there in armenia the stranger answered the unfinished question with the fruit in his open hand but you dont know said mr hinchcliff that that is the fruit of the tree of knowledge the man may have hada sort of mirage say suppose look at it said the stranger it was certainly a strangelooking globe not really an apple mr hinchcliff saw and a curious glowing golden colour almost as though light itself was wrought into its substance as he looked at it he began to see more vividly the desolate valley among the mountains the guarding swords of fire the strange antiquities of the story he had just heard he rubbed a knuckle into his eye butsaid he it has kept like that smooth and full three months longer than that it is now by some days no drying no withering no decay and you yourself said mr hinchcliff really believe that is the forbidden fruit there was no mistaking the earnestness of the mans manner and his perfect sanity the fruit of knowledge he said suppose it was said mr hinchcliff after a pause still staring at it but after all said mr hinchcliff its not my kind of knowledgenot the sort of knowledge i mean adam and eve have eaten it already we inherit their sinsnot their knowledge said the stranger that would make it all clear and bright again we should see into everything through everything into the deepest meaning of everything why dont you eat it then said mr hinchcliff with an inspiration i took it intending to eat it said the stranger man has fallen merely to eat again could scarcely knowledge is power said mr hinchcliff but is it happiness i am older than youmore than twice as old time after time i have held this in my hand and my heart has failed me at the thought of all that one might know that terrible lucidity suppose suddenly all the world became pitilessly clear that i think would be a great advantage said mr hinchcliff on the whole suppose you saw into the hearts and minds of everyone about you into their most secret recessespeople you loved whose love you valued youd soon find out the humbugs said mr hinchcliff greatly struck by the idea and worseto know yourself bare of your most intimate illusions to see yourself in your place all that your lusts and weaknesses prevented your doing no merciful perspective that might be an excellent thing too know thyself you know you are young said the stranger if you dont care to eat it and it bothers you why dont you throw it away there again perhaps you will not understand me to me how could one throw away a thing like that glowing wonderful once one has it one is bound but on the other hand to give it away to give it away to someone who thirsted after knowledge who found no terror in the thought of that clear perception of course said mr hinchcliff thoughtfully it might be some sort of poisonous fruit and then his eye caught something motionless the end of a white board blacklettered outside the carriage window mwood he saw he started convulsively gracious said mr hinchcliff holmwoodand the practical present blotted out the mystic realisations that had been stealing upon him in another moment he was opening the carriagedoor portmanteau in hand the guard was already fluttering his green flag mr hinchcliff jumped out here said a voice behind him and he saw the dark eyes of the stranger shining and the golden fruit bright and bare held out of the open carriagedoor he took it instinctively the train was already moving no shouted the stranger and made a snatch at it as if to take it back stand away cried a country porter thrusting forward to close the door the stranger shouted something mr hinchcliff did not catch head and arm thrust excitedly out of the window and then the shadow of the bridge fell on him and in a trice he was hidden mr hinchcliff stood astonished staring at the end of the last waggon receding round the bend and with the wonderful fruit in his hand for the fraction of a minute his mind was confused and then he became aware that two or three people on the platform were regarding him with interest was he not the new grammar school master making his debut it occurred to him that so far as they could tell the fruit might very well be the naive refreshment of an orange he flushed at the thought and thrust the fruit into his side pocket where it bulged undesirably but there was no help for it so he went towards them awkwardly concealing his sense of awkwardness to ask the way to the grammar school and the means of getting his portmanteau and the two tin boxes which lay up the platform thither of all the odd and fantastic yarns to tell a fellow his luggage could be taken on a truck for sixpence he found and he could precede it on foot he fancied an ironical note in the voices he was painfully aware of his contour the curious earnestness of the man in the train and the glamour of the story he told had for a time diverted the current of mr hinchcliffs thoughts it drove like a mist before his immediate concerns fires that went to and fro but the preoccupation of his new position and the impression he was to produce upon holmwood generally and the school people in particular returned upon him with reinvigorating power before he left the station and cleared his mental atmosphere but it is extraordinary what an inconvenient thing the addition of a soft and rather brightlygolden fruit not three inches in diameter may prove to a sensitive youth on his best appearance in the pocket of his black jacket it bulged dreadfully spoilt the lines altogether he passed a little old lady in black and he felt her eye drop upon the excrescence at once he was wearing one glove and carrying the other together with his stick so that to bear the fruit openly was impossible in one place where the road into the town seemed suitably secluded he took his encumbrance out of his pocket and tried it in his hat it was just too large the hat wobbled ludicrously and just as he was taking it out again a butchers boy came driving round the corner confound it said mr hinchcliff he would have eaten the thing and attained omniscience there and then but it would seem so silly to go into the town sucking a juicy fruitand it certainly felt juicy if one of the boys should come by it might do him a serious injury with his discipline so to be seen and the juice might make his face sticky and get upon his cuffsor it might be an acid juice as potent as lemon and take all the colour out of his clothes then round a bend in the lane came two pleasant sunlit girlish figures they were walking slowly towards the town and chatteringat any moment they might look round and see a hotfaced young man behind them carrying a kind of phosphorescent yellow tomato they would be sure to laugh hang said mr hinchcliff and with a swift jerk sent the encumbrance flying over the stone wall of an orchard that there abutted on the road as it vanished he felt a faint twinge of loss that lasted scarcely a moment he adjusted the stick and glove in his hand and walked on erect and selfconscious to pass the girls but in the darkness of the night mr hinchcliff had a dream and saw the valley and the flaming swords and the contorted trees and knew that it really was the apple of the tree of knowledge that he had thrown regardlessly away and he awoke very unhappy in the morning his regret had passed but afterwards it returned and troubled him never however when he was happy or busily occupied at last one moonlight night about eleven when all holmwood was quiet his regrets returned with redoubled force and therewith an impulse to adventure he slipped out of the house and over the playground wall went through the silent town to station lane and climbed into the orchard where he had thrown the fruit but nothing was to be found of it there among the dewy grass and the faint intangible globes of dandelion down under the knife what if i die under it the thought recurred again and again as i walked home from haddons it was a purely personal question i was spared the deep anxieties of a married man and i knew there were few of my intimate friends but would find my death troublesome chiefly on account of their duty of regret i was surprised indeed and perhaps a little humiliated as i turned the matter over to think how few could possibly exceed the conventional requirement things came before me stripped of glamour in a clear dry light during that walk from haddons house over primrose hill there were the friends of my youth i perceived now that our affection was a tradition which we foregathered rather laboriously to maintain there were the rivals and helpers of my later career i suppose i had been coldblooded or undemonstrativeone perhaps implies the other it may be that even the capacity for friendship is a question of physique there had been a time in my own life when i had grieved bitterly enough at the loss of a friend but as i walked home that afternoon the emotional side of my imagination was dormant i could not pity myself nor feel sorry for my friends nor conceive of them as grieving for me i was interested in this deadness of my emotional natureno doubt a concomitant of my stagnating physiology and my thoughts wandered off along the line it suggested once before in my hot youth i had suffered a sudden loss of blood and had been within an ace of death i remembered now that my affections as well as my passions had drained out of me leaving scarce anything but a tranquil resignation a dreg of selfpity it had been weeks before the old ambitions and tendernesses and all the complex moral interplay of a man had reasserted themselves it occurred to me that the real meaning of this numbness might be a gradual slipping away from the pleasurepain guidance of the animal man it has been proven i take it as thoroughly as anything can be proven in this world that the higher emotions the moral feelings even the subtle tendernesses of love are evolved from the elemental desires and fears of the simple animal they are the harness in which mans mental freedom goes and it may be that as death overshadows us as our possibility of acting diminishes this complex growth of balanced impulse propensity and aversion whose interplay inspires our acts goes with it leaving what i was suddenly brought back to reality by an imminent collision with a butcherboys tray i found that i was crossing the bridge over the regents park canal which runs parallel with that in the zoological gardens the boy in blue had been looking over his shoulder at a black barge advancing slowly towed by a gaunt white horse in the gardens a nurse was leading three happy little children over the bridge the trees were bright green the spring hopefulness was still unstained by the dusts of summer the sky in the water was bright and clear but broken by long waves by quivering bands of black as the barge drove through the breeze was stirring but it did not stir me as the spring breeze used to do was this dulness of feeling in itself an anticipation it was curious that i could reason and follow out a network of suggestion as clearly as ever so at least it seemed to me it was calmness rather than dulness that was coming upon me was there any ground for the belief in the presentiment of death did a man near to death begin instinctively to withdraw himself from the meshes of matter and sense even before the cold hand was laid upon his i felt strangely isolatedisolated without regretfrom the life and existence about me the children playing in the sun and gathering strength and experience for the business of life the parkkeeper gossiping with a nursemaid the nursing mother the young couple intent upon each other as they passed me the trees by the wayside spreading new pleading leaves to the sunlight the stir in their branchesi had been part of it all but i had nearly done with it now some way down the broad walk i perceived that i was tired and that my feet were heavy it was hot that afternoon and i turned aside and sat down on one of the green chairs that line the way in a minute i had dozed into a dream and the tide of my thoughts washed up a vision of the resurrection i was still sitting in the chair but i thought myself actually dead withered tattered dried one eye i saw pecked out by birds awake cried a voice and incontinently the dust of the path and the mould under the grass became insurgent i had never before thought of regents park as a cemetery but now through the trees stretching as far as eye could see i beheld a flat plain of writhing graves and heeling tombstones there seemed to be some trouble the rising dead appeared to stifle as they struggled upward they bled in their struggles the red flesh was tattered away from the white bones awake cried a voice but i determined i would not rise to such horrors awake they would not let me alone wike up said an angry voice a cockney angel the man who sells the tickets was shaking me demanding my penny i paid my penny pocketed my ticket yawned stretched my legs and feeling now rather less torpid got up and walked on towards langham place i speedily lost myself again in a shifting maze of thoughts about death going across marylebone road into that crescent at the end of langham place i had the narrowest escape from the shaft of a cab and went on my way with a palpitating heart and a bruised shoulder it struck me that it would have been curious if my meditations on my death on the morrow had led to my death that day but i will not weary you with more of my experiences that day and the next i knew more and more certainly that i should die under the operation at times i think i was inclined to pose to myself the doctors were coming at eleven and i did not get up it seemed scarce worth while to trouble about washing and dressing and though i read my newspapers and the letters that came by the first post i did not find them very interesting there was a friendly note from addison my old school friend calling my attention to two discrepancies and a printers error in my new book with one from langridge venting some vexation over minton the rest were business communications i breakfasted in bed the glow of pain at my side seemed more massive i knew it was pain and yet if you can understand i did not find it very painful i had been awake and hot and thirsty in the night but in the morning bed felt comfortable in the nighttime i had lain thinking of things that were past in the morning i dozed over the question of immortality haddon came punctual to the minute with a neat black bag and mowbray soon followed their arrival stirred me up a little i began to take a more personal interest in the proceedings haddon moved the little octagonal table close to the bedside and with his broad black back to me began taking things out of his bag i heard the light click of steel upon steel my imagination i found was not altogether stagnant will you hurt me much i said in an offhand tone not a bit haddon answered over his shoulder we shall chloroform you your hearts as sound as a bell and as he spoke i had a whiff of the pungent sweetness of the anaesthetic they stretched me out with a convenient exposure of my side and almost before i realised what was happening the chloroform was being administered it stings the nostrils and there is a suffocating sensation at first i knew i should diethat this was the end of consciousness for me and suddenly i felt that i was not prepared for death i had a vague sense of a duty overlookedi knew not what what was it i had not done i could think of nothing more to do nothing desirable left in life and yet i had the strangest disinclination to death and the physical sensation was painfully oppressive of course the doctors did not know they were going to kill me possibly i struggled then i fell motionless and a great silence a monstrous silence and an impenetrable blackness came upon me there must have been an interval of absolute unconsciousness seconds or minutes then with a chilly unemotional clearness i perceived that i was not yet dead i was still in my body but all the multitudinous sensations that come sweeping from it to make up the background of consciousness had gone leaving me free of it all no not free of it all for as yet something still held me to the poor stark flesh upon the bedheld me yet not so closely that i did not feel myself external to it independent of it straining away from it i do not think i saw i do not think i heard but i perceived all that was going on and it was as if i both heard and saw haddon was bending over me mowbray behind me the scalpelit was a large scalpelwas cutting my flesh at the side under the flying ribs it was interesting to see myself cut like cheese without a pang without even a qualm the interest was much of a quality with that one might feel in a game of chess between strangers haddons face was firm and his hand steady but i was surprised to perceive how i know not that he was feeling the gravest doubt as to his own wisdom in the conduct of the operation mowbrays thoughts too i could see he was thinking that haddons manner showed too much of the specialist new suggestions came up like bubbles through a stream of frothing meditation and burst one after another in the little bright spot of his consciousness he could not help noticing and admiring haddons swift dexterity in spite of his envious quality and his disposition to detract i saw my liver exposed i was puzzled at my own condition i did not feel that i was dead but i was different in some way from my living self the grey depression that had weighed on me for a year or more and coloured all my thoughts was gone i perceived and thought without any emotional tint at all i wondered if everyone perceived things in this way under chloroform and forgot it again when he came out of it it would be inconvenient to look into some heads and not forget although i did not think that i was dead i still perceived quite clearly that i was soon to die this brought me back to the consideration of haddons proceedings i looked into his mind and saw that he was afraid of cutting a branch of the portal vein my attention was distracted from details by the curious changes going on in his mind his consciousness was like the quivering little spot of light which is thrown by the mirror of a galvanometer his thoughts ran under it like a stream some through the focus bright and distinct some shadowy in the halflight of the edge just now the little glow was steady but the least movement on mowbrays part the slightest sound from outside even a faint difference in the slow movement of the living flesh he was cutting set the lightspot shivering and spinning a new senseimpression came rushing up through the flow of thoughts and lo the lightspot jerked away towards it swifter than a frightened fish it was wonderful to think that upon that unstable fitful thing depended all the complex motions of the man that for the next five minutes therefore my life hung upon its movements and he was growing more and more nervous in his work it was as if a little picture of a cut vein grew brighter and struggled to oust from his brain another picture of a cut falling short of the mark he was afraid his dread of cutting too little was battling with his dread of cutting too far then suddenly like an escape of water from under a lockgate a great uprush of horrible realisation set all his thoughts swirling and simultaneously i perceived that the vein was cut he started back with a hoarse exclamation and i saw the brownpurple blood gather in a swift bead and run trickling he was horrified he pitched the redstained scalpel on to the octagonal table and instantly both doctors flung themselves upon me making hasty and illconceived efforts to remedy the disaster ice said mowbray gasping but i knew that i was killed though my body still clung to me i will not describe their belated endeavours to save me though i perceived every detail my perceptions were sharper and swifter than they had ever been in life my thoughts rushed through my mind with incredible swiftness but with perfect definition i can only compare their crowded clarity to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium in a moment it would all be over and i should be free i knew i was immortal but what would happen i did not know should i drift off presently like a puff of smoke from a gun in some kind of halfmaterial body an attenuated version of my material self should i find myself suddenly among the innumerable hosts of the dead and know the world about me for the phantasmagoria it had always seemed should i drift to some spiritualistic seance and there make foolish incomprehensible attempts to affect a purblind medium it was a state of unemotional curiosity of colourless expectation and then i realised a growing stress upon me a feeling as though some huge human magnet was drawing me upward out of my body the stress grew and grew i seemed an atom for which monstrous forces were fighting for one brief terrible moment sensation came back to me that feeling of falling headlong which comes in nightmares that feeling a thousand times intensified that and a black horror swept across my thoughts in a torrent then the two doctors the naked body with its cut side the little room swept away from under me and vanished as a speck of foam vanishes down an eddy i was in midair far below was the west end of london receding rapidlyfor i seemed to be flying swiftly upwardand as it receded passing westward like a panorama i could see through the faint haze of smoke the innumerable roofs chimneyset the narrow roadways stippled with people and conveyances the little specks of squares and the church steeples like thorns sticking out of the fabric but it spun away as the earth rotated on its axis and in a few seconds as it seemed i was over the scattered clumps of town about ealing the little thames a thread of blue to the south and the chiltern hills and the north downs coming up like the rim of a basin far away and faint with haze up i rushed and at first i had not the faintest conception what this headlong rush upward could mean every moment the circle of scenery beneath me grew wider and wider and the details of town and field of hill and valley got more and more hazy and pale and indistinct a luminous grey was mingled more and more with the blue of the hills and the green of the open meadows and a little patch of cloud low and far to the west shone ever more dazzlingly white above as the veil of atmosphere between myself and outer space grew thinner the sky which had been a fair springtime blue at first grew deeper and richer in colour passing steadily through the intervening shades until presently it was as dark as the blue sky of midnight and presently as black as the blackness of a frosty starlight and at last as black as no blackness i had ever beheld and first one star and then many and at last an innumerable host broke out upon the sky more stars than anyone has ever seen from the face of the earth for the blueness of the sky is the light of the sun and stars sifted and spread abroad blindingly there is diffused light even in the darkest skies of winter and we do not see the stars by day only because of the dazzling irradiation of the sun but now i saw thingsi know not how assuredly with no mortal eyesand that defect of bedazzlement blinded me no longer the sun was incredibly strange and wonderful the body of it was a disc of blinding white light not yellowish as it seems to those who live upon the earth but livid white all streaked with scarlet streaks and rimmed about with a fringe of writhing tongues of red fire and shooting halfway across the heavens from either side of it and brighter than the milky way were two pinions of silverwhite making it look more like those winged globes i have seen in egyptian sculpture than anything else i can remember upon earth these i knew for the solar corona though i had never seen anything of it but a picture during the days of my earthly life when my attention came back to the earth again i saw that it had fallen very far away from me field and town were long since indistinguishable and all the varied hues of the country were merging into a uniform bright grey broken only by the brilliant white of the clouds that lay scattered in flocculent masses over ireland and the west of england for now i could see the outlines of the north of france and ireland and all this island of britain save where scotland passed over the horizon to the north or where the coast was blurred or obliterated by cloud the sea was a dull grey and darker than the land and the whole panorama was rotating slowly towards the east all this had happened so swiftly that until i was some thousand miles or so from the earth i had no thought for myself but now i perceived i had neither hands nor feet neither parts nor organs and that i felt neither alarm nor pain all about me i perceived that the vacancy for i had already left the air behind was cold beyond the imagination of man but it troubled me not the suns rays shot through the void powerless to light or heat until they should strike on matter in their course i saw things with a serene selfforgetfulness even as if i were god and down below there rushing away from mecountless miles in a secondwhere a little dark spot on the grey marked the position of london two doctors were struggling to restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell i had abandoned i felt then such release such serenity as i can compare to no mortal delight i have ever known it was only after i had perceived all these things that the meaning of that headlong rush of the earth grew into comprehension yet it was so simple so obvious that i was amazed at my never anticipating the thing that was happening to me i had suddenly been cut adrift from matter all that was material of me was there upon earth whirling away through space held to the earth by gravitation partaking of the earthinertia moving in its wreath of epicycles round the sun and with the sun and the planets on their vast march through space but the immaterial has no inertia feels nothing of the pull of matter for matter where it parts from its garment of flesh there it remains so far as space concerns it any longer immovable in space i was not leaving the earth the earth was leaving me and not only the earth but the whole solar system was streaming past and about me in space invisible to me scattered in the wake of the earth upon its journey there must be an innumerable multitude of souls stripped like myself of the material stripped like myself of the passions of the individual and the generous emotions of the gregarious brute naked intelligences things of newborn wonder and thought marvelling at the strange release that had suddenly come on them as i receded faster and faster from the strange white sun in the black heavens and from the broad and shining earth upon which my being had begun i seemed to grow in some incredible manner vast vast as regards this world i had left vast as regards the moments and periods of a human life very soon i saw the full circle of the earth slightly gibbous like the moon when she nears her full but very large and the silvery shape of america was now in the noonday blaze wherein as it seemed little england had been basking but a few minutes ago at first the earth was large and shone in the heavens filling a great part of them but every moment she grew smaller and more distant as she shrunk the broad moon in its third quarter crept into view over the rim of her disc i looked for the constellations only that part of aries directly behind the sun and the lion which the earth covered were hidden i recognised the tortuous tattered band of the milky way with vega very bright between sun and earth and sirius and orion shone splendid against the unfathomable blackness in the opposite quarter of the heavens the pole star was overhead and the great bear hung over the circle of the earth and away beneath and beyond the shining corona of the sun were strange groupings of stars i had never seen in my lifenotably a daggershaped group that i knew for the southern cross all these were no larger than when they had shone on earth but the little stars that one scarce sees shone now against the setting of black vacancy as brightly as the firstmagnitudes had done while the larger worlds were points of indescribable glory and colour aldebaran was a spot of bloodred fire and sirius condensed to one point the light of a world of sapphires and they shone steadily they did not scintillate they were calmly glorious my impressions had an adamantine hardness and brightness there was no blurring softness no atmosphere nothing but infinite darkness set with the myriads of these acute and brilliant points and specks of light presently when i looked again the little earth seemed no bigger than the sun and it dwindled and turned as i looked until in a seconds space as it seemed to me it was halved and so it went on swiftly dwindling far away in the opposite direction a little pinkish pins head of light shining steadily was the planet mars i swam motionless in vacancy and without a trace of terror or astonishment watched the speck of cosmic dust we call the world fall away from me presently it dawned upon me that my sense of duration had changed that my mind was moving not faster but infinitely slower that between each separate impression there was a period of many days the moon spun once round the earth as i noted this and i perceived clearly the motion of mars in his orbit moreover it appeared as if the time between thought and thought grew steadily greater until at last a thousand years was but a moment in my perception at first the constellations had shone motionless against the black background of infinite space but presently it seemed as though the group of stars about hercules and the scorpion was contracting while orion and aldebaran and their neighbours were scattering apart flashing suddenly out of the darkness there came a flying multitude of particles of rock glittering like dustspecks in a sunbeam and encompassed in a faintly luminous haze they swirled all about me and vanished again in a twinkling far behind and then i saw that a bright spot of light that shone a little to one side of my path was growing very rapidly larger and perceived that it was the planet saturn rushing towards me larger and larger it grew swallowing up the heavens behind it and hiding every moment a fresh multitude of stars i perceived its flattened whirling body its disclike belt and seven of its little satellites it grew and grew till it towered enormous and then i plunged amid a streaming multitude of clashing stones and dancing dustparticles and gaseddies and saw for a moment the mighty triple belt like three concentric arches of moonlight above me its shadow black on the boiling tumult below these things happened in onetenth of the time it takes to tell of them the planet went by like a flash of lightning for a few seconds it blotted out the sun and there and then became a mere black dwindling winged patch against the light the earth the mother mote of my being i could no longer see so with a stately swiftness in the profoundest silence the solar system fell from me as it had been a garment until the sun was a mere star amid the multitude of stars with its eddy of planetspecks lost in the confused glittering of the remoter light i was no longer a denizen of the solar system i had come to the outer universe i seemed to grasp and comprehend the whole world of matter ever more swiftly the stars closed in about the spot where antares and vega had vanished in a luminous haze until that part of the sky had the semblance of a whirling mass of nebulae and ever before me yawned vaster gaps of vacant blackness and the stars shone fewer and fewer it seemed as if i moved towards a point between orions belt and sword and the void about that region opened vaster and vaster every second an incredible gulf of nothingness into which i was falling faster and ever faster the universe rushed by a hurry of whirling motes at last speeding silently into the void stars glowing brighter and brighter with their circling planets catching the light in a ghostly fashion as i neared them shone out and vanished again into inexistence faint comets clusters of meteorites winking specks of matter eddying light points whizzed past some perhaps a hundred millions of miles or so from me at most few nearer travelling with unimaginable rapidity shooting constellations momentary darts of fire through that black enormous night more than anything else it was like a dusty draught sunbeamlit broader and wider and deeper grew the starless space the vacant beyond into which i was being drawn at last a quarter of the heavens was black and blank and the whole headlong rush of stellar universe closed in behind me like a veil of light that is gathered together it drove away from me like a monstrous jackolantern driven by the wind i had come out into the wilderness of space ever the vacant blackness grew broader until the hosts of the stars seemed only like a swarm of fiery specks hurrying away from me inconceivably remote and the darkness the nothingness and emptiness was about me on every side soon the little universe of matter the cage of points in which i had begun to be was dwindling now to a whirling disc of luminous glittering and now to one minute disc of hazy light in a little while it would shrink to a point and at last would vanish altogether suddenly feeling came back to mefeeling in the shape of overwhelming terror such a dread of those dark vastitudes as no words can describe a passionate resurgence of sympathy and social desire were there other souls invisible to me as i to them about me in the blackness or was i indeed even as i felt alone had i passed out of being into something that was neither being nor notbeing the covering of the body the covering of matter had been torn from me and the hallucinations of companionship and security everything was black and silent i had ceased to be i was nothing there was nothing save only that infinitesimal dot of light that dwindled in the gulf i strained myself to hear and see and for a while there was naught but infinite silence intolerable darkness horror and despair then i saw that about the spot of light into which the whole world of matter had shrunk there was a faint glow and in a band on either side of that the darkness was not absolute i watched it for ages as it seemed to me and through the long waiting the haze grew imperceptibly more distinct and then about the band appeared an irregular cloud of the faintest palest brown i felt a passionate impatience but the things grew brighter so slowly that they scarce seemed to change what was unfolding itself what was this strange reddish dawn in the interminable night of space the clouds shape was grotesque it seemed to be looped along its lower side into four projecting masses and above it ended in a straight line what phantom was it i felt assured i had seen that figure before but i could not think what nor where nor when it was then the realisation rushed upon me it was a clenched hand i was alone in space alone with this huge shadowy hand upon which the whole universe of matter lay like an unconsidered speck of dust it seemed as though i watched it through vast periods of time on the forefinger glittered a ring and the universe from which i had come was but a spot of light upon the rings curvature and the thing that the hand gripped had the likeness of a black rod through a long eternity i watched this hand with the ring and the rod marvelling and fearing and waiting helplessly on what might follow it seemed as though nothing could follow that i should watch for ever seeing only the hand and the thing it held and understanding nothing of its import was the whole universe but a refracting speck upon some greater being were our worlds but the atoms of another universe and those again of another and so on through an endless progression and what was i was i indeed immaterial a vague persuasion of a body gathering about me came into my suspense the abysmal darkness about the hand filled with impalpable suggestions with uncertain fluctuating shapes then suddenly came a sound like the sound of a tolling bell faint as if infinitely far muffled as though heard through thick swathings of darkness a deep vibrating resonance with vast gulfs of silence between each stroke and the hand appeared to tighten on the rod and i saw far above the hand towards the apex of the darkness a circle of dim phosphorescence a ghostly sphere whence these sounds came throbbing and at the last stroke the hand vanished for the hour had come and i heard a noise of many waters but the black rod remained as a great band across the sky and then a voice which seemed to run to the uttermost parts of space spoke saying there will be no more pain at that an almost intolerable gladness and radiance rushed in upon me and i saw the circle shining white and bright and the rod black and shining and many things else distinct and clear and the circle was the face of the clock and the rod the rail of my bed haddon was standing at the foot against the rail with a small pair of scissors on his fingers and the hands of my clock on the mantel over his shoulder were clasped together over the hour of twelve mowbray was washing something in a basin at the octagonal table and at my side i felt a subdued feeling that could scarce be spoken of as pain the operation had not killed me and i perceived suddenly that the dull melancholy of half a year was lifted from my mind the sea raiders i until the extraordinary affair at sidmouth the peculiar species haploteuthis ferox was known to science only generically on the strength of a halfdigested tentacle obtained near the azores and a decaying body pecked by birds and nibbled by fish found early in by mr jennings near lands end in no department of zoological science indeed are we quite so much in the dark as with regard to the deepsea cephalopods a mere accident for instance it was that led to the prince of monacos discovery of nearly a dozen new forms in the summer of a discovery in which the beforementioned tentacle was included it chanced that a cachalot was killed off terceira by some sperm whalers and in its last struggles charged almost to the princes yacht missed it rolled under and died within twenty yards of his rudder and in its agony it threw up a number of large objects which the prince dimly perceiving they were strange and important was by a happy expedient able to secure before they sank he set his screws in motion and kept them circling in the vortices thus created until a boat could be lowered and these specimens were whole cephalopods and fragments of cephalopods some of gigantic proportions and almost all of them unknown to science it would seem indeed that these large and agile creatures living in the middle depths of the sea must to a large extent for ever remain unknown to us since under water they are too nimble for nets and it is only by such rare unlookedfor accidents that specimens can be obtained in the case of haploteuthis ferox for instance we are still altogether ignorant of its habitat as ignorant as we are of the breedingground of the herring or the seaways of the salmon and zoologists are altogether at a loss to account for its sudden appearance on our coast possibly it was the stress of a hunger migration that drove it hither out of the deep but it will be perhaps better to avoid necessarily inconclusive discussion and to proceed at once with our narrative the first human being to set eyes upon a living haploteuthisthe first human being to survive that is for there can be little doubt now that the wave of bathing fatalities and boating accidents that travelled along the coast of cornwall and devon in early may was due to this causewas a retired teadealer of the name of fison who was stopping at a sidmouth boardinghouse it was in the afternoon and he was walking along the cliff path between sidmouth and ladram bay the cliffs in this direction are very high but down the red face of them in one place a kind of ladder staircase has been made he was near this when his attention was attracted by what at first he thought to be a cluster of birds struggling over a fragment of food that caught the sunlight and glistened pinkishwhite the tide was right out and this object was not only far below him but remote across a broad waste of rock reefs covered with dark seaweed and interspersed with silvery shining tidal pools and he was moreover dazzled by the brightness of the further water in a minute regarding this again he perceived that his judgment was in fault for over this struggle circled a number of birds jackdaws and gulls for the most part the latter gleaming blindingly when the sunlight smote their wings and they seemed minute in comparison with it and his curiosity was perhaps aroused all the more strongly because of his first insufficient explanations as he had nothing better to do than amuse himself he decided to make this object whatever it was the goal of his afternoon walk instead of ladram bay conceiving it might perhaps be a great fish of some sort stranded by some chance and flapping about in its distress and so he hurried down the long steep ladder stopping at intervals of thirty feet or so to take breath and scan the mysterious movement at the foot of the cliff he was of course nearer his object than he had been but on the other hand it now came up against the incandescent sky beneath the sun so as to seem dark and indistinct whatever was pinkish of it was now hidden by a skerry of weedy boulders but he perceived that it was made up of seven rounded bodies distinct or connected and that the birds kept up a constant croaking and screaming but seemed afraid to approach it too closely mr fison torn by curiosity began picking his way across the waveworn rocks and finding the wet seaweed that covered them thickly rendered them extremely slippery he stopped removed his shoes and socks and coiled his trousers above his knees his object was of course merely to avoid stumbling into the rocky pools about him and perhaps he was rather glad as all men are of an excuse to resume even for a moment the sensations of his boyhood at anyrate it is to this no doubt that he owes his life he approached his mark with all the assurance which the absolute security of this country against all forms of animal life gives its inhabitants the round bodies moved to and fro but it was only when he surmounted the skerry of boulders i have mentioned that he realised the horrible nature of the discovery it came upon him with some suddenness the rounded bodies fell apart as he came into sight over the ridge and displayed the pinkish object to be the partially devoured body of a human being but whether of a man or woman he was unable to say and the rounded bodies were new and ghastlylooking creatures in shape somewhat resembling an octopus and with huge and very long and flexible tentacles coiled copiously on the ground the skin had a glistening texture unpleasant to see like shiny leather the downward bend of the tentaclesurrounded mouth the curious excrescence at the bend the tentacles and the large intelligent eyes gave the creatures a grotesque suggestion of a face they were the size of a fairsized swine about the body and the tentacles seemed to him to be many feet in length there were he thinks seven or eight at least of the creatures twenty yards beyond them amid the surf of the now returning tide two others were emerging from the sea their bodies lay flatly on the rocks and their eyes regarded him with evil interest but it does not appear that mr fison was afraid or that he realised that he was in any danger possibly his confidence is to be ascribed to the limpness of their attitudes but he was horrified of course and intensely excited and indignant at such revolting creatures preying upon human flesh he thought they had chanced upon a drowned body he shouted to them with the idea of driving them off and finding they did not budge cast about him picked up a big rounded lump of rock and flung it at one and then slowly uncoiling their tentacles they all began moving towards himcreeping at first deliberately and making a soft purring sound to each other in a moment mr fison realised that he was in danger he shouted again threw both his boots and started off with a leap forthwith twenty yards off he stopped and faced about judging them slow and behold the tentacles of their leader were already pouring over the rocky ridge on which he had just been standing at that he shouted again but this time not threatening but a cry of dismay and began jumping striding slipping wading across the uneven expanse between him and the beach the tall red cliffs seemed suddenly at a vast distance and he saw as though they were creatures in another world two minute workmen engaged in the repair of the ladderway and little suspecting the race for life that was beginning below them at one time he could hear the creatures splashing in the pools not a dozen feet behind him and once he slipped and almost fell they chased him to the very foot of the cliffs and desisted only when he had been joined by the workmen at the foot of the ladderway up the cliff all three of the men pelted them with stones for a time and then hurried to the cliff top and along the path towards sidmouth to secure assistance and a boat and to rescue the desecrated body from the clutches of these abominable creatures ii and as if he had not already been in sufficient peril that day mr fison went with the boat to point out the exact spot of his adventure as the tide was down it required a considerable detour to reach the spot and when at last they came off the ladderway the mangled body had disappeared the water was now running in submerging first one slab of slimy rock and then another and the four men in the boatthe workmen that is the boatman and mr fisonnow turned their attention from the bearings off shore to the water beneath the keel at first they could see little below them save a dark jungle of laminaria with an occasional darting fish their minds were set on adventure and they expressed their disappointment freely but presently they saw one of the monsters swimming through the water seaward with a curious rolling motion that suggested to mr fison the spinning roll of a captive balloon almost immediately after the waving streamers of laminaria were extraordinarily perturbed parted for a moment and three of these beasts became darkly visible struggling for what was probably some fragment of the drowned man in a moment the copious olivegreen ribbons had poured again over this writhing group at that all four men greatly excited began beating the water with oars and shouting and immediately they saw a tumultuous movement among the weeds they desisted to see more clearly and as soon as the water was smooth they saw as it seemed to them the whole sea bottom among the weeds set with eyes ugly swine cried one of the men why theres dozens and forthwith the things began to rise through the water about them mr fison has since described to the writer this startling eruption out of the waving laminaria meadows to him it seemed to occupy a considerable time but it is probable that really it was an affair of a few seconds only for a time nothing but eyes and then he speaks of tentacles streaming out and parting the weed fronds this way and that then these things growing larger until at last the bottom was hidden by their intercoiling forms and the tips of tentacles rose darkly here and there into the air above the swell of the waters one came up boldly to the side of the boat and clinging to this with three of its suckerset tentacles threw four others over the gunwale as if with an intention either of oversetting the boat or of clambering into it mr fison at once caught up the boathook and jabbing furiously at the soft tentacles forced it to desist he was struck in the back and almost pitched overboard by the boatman who was using his oar to resist a similar attack on the other side of the boat but the tentacles on either side at once relaxed their hold at this slid out of sight and splashed into the water wed better get out of this said mr fison who was trembling violently he went to the tiller while the boatman and one of the workmen seated themselves and began rowing the other workman stood up in the fore part of the boat with the boathook ready to strike any more tentacles that might appear nothing else seems to have been said mr fison had expressed the common feeling beyond amendment in a hushed scared mood with faces white and drawn they set about escaping from the position into which they had so recklessly blundered but the oars had scarcely dropped into the water before dark tapering serpentine ropes had bound them and were about the rudder and creeping up the sides of the boat with a looping motion came the suckers again the men gripped their oars and pulled but it was like trying to move a boat in a floating raft of weeds help here cried the boatman and mr fison and the second workman rushed to help lug at the oar then the man with the boathookhis name was ewan or ewensprang up with a curse and began striking downward over the side as far as he could reach at the bank of tentacles that now clustered along the boats bottom and at the same time the two rowers stood up to get a better purchase for the recovery of their oars the boatman handed his to mr fison who lugged desperately and meanwhile the boatman opened a big claspknife and leaning over the side of the boat began hacking at the spiring arms upon the oar shaft mr fison staggering with the quivering rocking of the boat his teeth set his breath coming short and the veins starting on his hands as he pulled at his oar suddenly cast his eyes seaward and there not fifty yards off across the long rollers of the incoming tide was a large boat standing in towards them with three women and a little child in it a boatman was rowing and a little man in a pinkribboned straw hat and whites stood in the stern hailing them for a moment of course mr fison thought of help and then he thought of the child he abandoned his oar forthwith threw up his arms in a frantic gesture and screamed to the party in the boat to keep away for gods sake it says much for the modesty and courage of mr fison that he does not seem to be aware that there was any quality of heroism in his action at this juncture the oar he had abandoned was at once drawn under and presently reappeared floating about twenty yards away at the same moment mr fison felt the boat under him lurch violently and a hoarse scream a prolonged cry of terror from hill the boatman caused him to forget the party of excursionists altogether he turned and saw hill crouching by the forward rowlock his face convulsed with terror and his right arm over the side and drawn tightly down he gave now a succession of short sharp cries oh oh ohoh mr fison believes that he must have been hacking at the tentacles below the waterline and have been grasped by them but of course it is quite impossible to say now certainly what had happened the boat was heeling over so that the gunwale was within ten inches of the water and both ewan and the other labourer were striking down into the water with oar and boathook on either side of hills arm mr fison instinctively placed himself to counterpoise them then hill who was a burly powerful man made a strenuous effort and rose almost to a standing position he lifted his arm indeed clean out of the water hanging to it was a complicated tangle of brown ropes and the eyes of one of the brutes that had hold of him glaring straight and resolute showed momentarily above the surface the boat heeled more and more and the greenbrown water came pouring in a cascade over the side then hill slipped and fell with his ribs across the side and his arm and the mass of tentacles about it splashed back into the water he rolled over his boot kicked mr fisons knee as that gentleman rushed forward to seize him and in another moment fresh tentacles had whipped about his waist and neck and after a brief convulsive struggle in which the boat was nearly capsized hill was lugged overboard the boat righted with a violent jerk that all but sent mr fison over the other side and hid the struggle in the water from his eyes he stood staggering to recover his balance for a moment and as he did so he became aware that the struggle and the inflowing tide had carried them close upon the weedy rocks again not four yards off a table of rock still rose in rhythmic movements above the inwash of the tide in a moment mr fison seized the oar from ewan gave one vigorous stroke then dropping it ran to the bows and leapt he felt his feet slide over the rock and by a frantic effort leapt again towards a further mass he stumbled over this came to his knees and rose again look out cried someone and a large drab body struck him he was knocked flat into a tidal pool by one of the workmen and as he went down he heard smothered choking cries that he believed at the time came from hill then he found himself marvelling at the shrillness and variety of hills voice someone jumped over him and a curving rush of foamy water poured over him and passed he scrambled to his feet dripping and without looking seaward ran as fast as his terror would let him shoreward before him over the flat space of scattered rocks stumbled the two workmenone a dozen yards in front of the other he looked over his shoulder at last and seeing that he was not pursued faced about he was astonished from the moment of the rising of the cephalopods out of the water he had been acting too swiftly to fully comprehend his actions now it seemed to him as if he had suddenly jumped out of an evil dream for there were the sky cloudless and blazing with the afternoon sun the sea weltering under its pitiless brightness the soft creamy foam of the breaking water and the low long dark ridges of rock the righted boat floated rising and falling gently on the swell about a dozen yards from shore hill and the monsters all the stress and tumult of that fierce fight for life had vanished as though they had never been mr fisons heart was beating violently he was throbbing to the fingertips and his breath came deep there was something missing for some seconds he could not think clearly enough what this might be sun sky sea rockswhat was it then he remembered the boatload of excursionists it had vanished he wondered whether he had imagined it he turned and saw the two workmen standing side by side under the projecting masses of the tall pink cliffs he hesitated whether he should make one last attempt to save the man hill his physical excitement seemed to desert him suddenly and leave him aimless and helpless he turned shoreward stumbling and wading towards his two companions he looked back again and there were now two boats floating and the one farthest out at sea pitched clumsily bottom upward iii so it was haploteuthis ferox made its appearance upon the devonshire coast so far this has been its most serious aggression mr fisons account taken together with the wave of boating and bathing casualties to which i have already alluded and the absence of fish from the cornish coasts that year points clearly to a shoal of these voracious deepsea monsters prowling slowly along the subtidal coastline hunger migration has i know been suggested as the force that drove them hither but for my own part i prefer to believe the alternative theory of hemsley hemsley holds that a pack or shoal of these creatures may have become enamoured of human flesh by the accident of a foundered ship sinking among them and have wandered in search of it out of their accustomed zone first waylaying and following ships and so coming to our shores in the wake of the atlantic traffic but to discuss hemsleys cogent and admirablystated arguments would be out of place here it would seem that the appetites of the shoal were satisfied by the catch of eleven peoplefor so far as can be ascertained there were ten people in the second boat and certainly these creatures gave no further signs of their presence off sidmouth that day the coast between seaton and budleigh salterton was patrolled all that evening and night by four preventive service boats the men in which were armed with harpoons and cutlasses and as the evening advanced a number of more or less similarly equipped expeditions organised by private individuals joined them mr fison took no part in any of these expeditions about midnight excited hails were heard from a boat about a couple of miles out at sea to the southeast of sidmouth and a lantern was seen waving in a strange manner to and fro and up and down the nearer boats at once hurried towards the alarm the venturesome occupants of the boat a seaman a curate and two schoolboys had actually seen the monsters passing under their boat the creatures it seems like most deepsea organisms were phosphorescent and they had been floating five fathoms deep or so like creatures of moonshine through the blackness of the water their tentacles retracted and as if asleep rolling over and over and moving slowly in a wedgelike formation towards the southeast these people told their story in gesticulated fragments as first one boat drew alongside and then another at last there was a little fleet of eight or nine boats collected together and from them a tumult like the chatter of a marketplace rose into the stillness of the night there was little or no disposition to pursue the shoal the people had neither weapons nor experience for such a dubious chase and presentlyeven with a certain relief it may bethe boats turned shoreward and now to tell what is perhaps the most astonishing fact in this whole astonishing raid we have not the slightest knowledge of the subsequent movements of the shoal although the whole southwest coast was now alert for it but it may perhaps be significant that a cachalot was stranded off sark on june two weeks and three days after this sidmouth affair a living haploteuthis came ashore on calais sands it was alive because several witnesses saw its tentacles moving in a convulsive way but it is probable that it was dying a gentleman named pouchet obtained a rifle and shot it that was the last appearance of a living haploteuthis no others were seen on the french coast on the th of june a dead body almost complete was washed ashore near torquay and a few days later a boat from the marine biological station engaged in dredging off plymouth picked up a rotting specimen slashed deeply with a cutlass wound how the former specimen had come by its death it is impossible to say and on the last day of june mr egbert caine an artist bathing near newlyn threw up his arms shrieked and was drawn under a friend bathing with him made no attempt to save him but swam at once for the shore this is the last fact to tell of this extraordinary raid from the deeper sea whether it is really the last of these horrible creatures it is as yet premature to say but it is believed and certainly it is to be hoped that they have returned now and returned for good to the sunless depths of the middle seas out of which they have so strangely and so mysteriously arisen pollock and the porroh man it was in a swampy village on the lagoon river behind the turner peninsula that pollocks first encounter with the porroh man occurred the women of that country are famous for their good looksthey are gallinas with a dash of european blood that dates from the days of vasco de gama and the english slavetraders and the porroh man too was possibly inspired by a faint caucasian taint in his composition its a curious thing to think that some of us may have distant cousins eating men on sherboro island or raiding with the sofas at anyrate the porroh man stabbed the woman to the heart as though he had been a mere lowclass italian and very narrowly missed pollock but pollock using his revolver to parry the lightning stab which was aimed at his deltoid muscle sent the iron dagger flying and firing hit the man in the hand he fired again and missed knocking a sudden window out of the wall of the hut the porroh man stooped in the doorway glancing under his arm at pollock pollock caught a glimpse of his inverted face in the sunlight and then the englishman was alone sick and trembling with the excitement of the affair in the twilight of the place it had all happened in less time than it takes to read about it the woman was quite dead and having ascertained this pollock went to the entrance of the hut and looked out things outside were dazzling bright half a dozen of the porters of the expedition were standing up in a group near the green huts they occupied and staring towards him wondering what the shots might signify behind the little group of men was the broad stretch of black fetid mud by the river a green carpet of rafts of papyrus and watergrass and then the leaden water the mangroves beyond the stream loomed indistinctly through the blue haze there were no signs of excitement in the squat village whose fence was just visible above the canegrass pollock came out of the hut cautiously and walked towards the river looking over his shoulder at intervals but the porroh man had vanished pollock clutched his revolver nervously in his hand one of his men came to meet him and as he came pointed to the bushes behind the hut in which the porroh man had disappeared pollock had an irritating persuasion of having made an absolute fool of himself he felt bitter savage at the turn things had taken at the same time he would have to tell waterhousethe moral exemplary cautious waterhousewho would inevitably take the matter seriously pollock cursed bitterly at his luck at waterhouse and especially at the west coast of africa he felt consummately sick of the expedition and in the back of his mind all the time was a speculative doubt where precisely within the visible horizon the porroh man might be it is perhaps rather shocking but he was not at all upset by the murder that had just happened he had seen so much brutality during the last three months so many dead women burnt huts drying skeletons up the kittam river in the wake of the sofa cavalry that his senses were blunted what disturbed him was the persuasion that this business was only beginning he swore savagely at the black who ventured to ask a question and went on into the tent under the orangetrees where waterhouse was lying feeling exasperatingly like a boy going into the headmasters study waterhouse was still sleeping off the effects of his last dose of chlorodyne and pollock sat down on a packingcase beside him and lighting his pipe waited for him to awake about him were scattered the pots and weapons waterhouse had collected from the mendi people and which he had been repacking for the canoe voyage to sulyma presently waterhouse woke up and after judicial stretching decided he was all right again pollock got him some tea over the tea the incidents of the afternoon were described by pollock after some preliminary beating about the bush waterhouse took the matter even more seriously than pollock had anticipated he did not simply disapprove he scolded he insulted youre one of those infernal fools who think a black man isnt a human being he said i cant be ill a day without you must get into some dirty scrape or other this is the third time in a month that you have come crosswayson with a native and this time youre in for it with a vengeance porroh too theyre down upon you enough as it is about that idol you wrote your silly name on and theyre the most vindictive devils on earth you make a man ashamed of civilisation to think you come of a decent family if ever i cumber myself up with a vicious stupid young lout like you again steady on now snarled pollock in the tone that always exasperated waterhouse steady on at that waterhouse became speechless he jumped to his feet look here pollock he said after a struggle to control his breath you must go home i wont have you any longer im ill enough as it is through you keep your hair on said pollock staring in front of him im ready enough to go waterhouse became calmer again he sat down on the campstool very well he said i dont want a row pollock you know but its confoundedly annoying to have ones plans put out by this kind of thing ill come to sulyma with you and see you safe aboard you neednt said pollock i can go alone from here not far said waterhouse you dont understand this porroh business how should i know she belonged to a porroh man said pollock bitterly well she did said waterhouse and you cant undo the thing go alone indeed i wonder what theyd do to you you dont seem to understand that this porroh hokeypokey rules this country is its law religion constitution medicine magic they appoint the chiefs the inquisition at its best couldnt hold a candle to these chaps he will probably set awajale the chief here on to us its lucky our porters are mendis we shall have to shift this little settlement of ours confound you pollock and of course you must go and miss him he thought and his thoughts seemed disagreeable presently he stood up and took his rifle id keep close for a bit if i were you he said over his shoulder as he went out im going out to see what i can find out about it pollock remained sitting in the tent meditating i was meant for a civilised life he said to himself regretfully as he filled his pipe the sooner i get back to london or paris the better for me his eye fell on the sealed case in which waterhouse had put the featherless poisoned arrows they had bought in the mendi country i wish i had hit the beggar somewhere vital said pollock viciously waterhouse came back after a long interval he was not communicative though pollock asked him questions enough the porroh man it seems was a prominent member of that mystical society the village was interested but not threatening no doubt the witchdoctor had gone into the bush he was a great witchdoctor of course hes up to something said waterhouse and became silent but what can he do asked pollock unheeded i must get you out of this theres something brewing or things would not be so quiet said waterhouse after a gap of silence pollock wanted to know what the brew might be dancing in a circle of skulls said waterhouse brewing a stink in a copper pot pollock wanted particulars waterhouse was vague pollock pressing at last waterhouse lost his temper how the devil should i know he said to pollocks twentieth inquiry what the porroh man would do he tried to kill you offhand in the hut now i fancy he will try something more elaborate but youll see fast enough i dont want to help unnerve you its probably all nonsense that night as they were sitting at their fire pollock again tried to draw waterhouse out on the subject of porroh methods better get to sleep said waterhouse when pollocks bent became apparent we start early tomorrow you may want all your nerve about you but what line will he take cant say theyre versatile people they know a lot of rum dodges youd better get that copperdevil shakespear to talk there was a flash and a heavy bang out of the darkness behind the huts and a clay bullet came whistling close to pollocks head this at least was crude enough the blacks and halfbreeds sitting and yarning round their own fire jumped up and someone fired into the dark better go into one of the huts said waterhouse quietly still sitting unmoved pollock stood up by the fire and drew his revolver fighting at least he was not afraid of but a man in the dark is in the best of armour realising the wisdom of waterhouses advice pollock went into the tent and lay down there what little sleep he had was disturbed by dreams variegated dreams but chiefly of the porroh mans face upside down as he went out of the hut and looked up under his arm it was odd that this transitory impression should have stuck so firmly in pollocks memory moreover he was troubled by queer pains in his limbs in the white haze of the early morning as they were loading the canoes a barbed arrow suddenly appeared quivering in the ground close to pollocks foot the boys made a perfunctory effort to clear out the thicket but it led to no capture after these two occurrences there was a disposition on the part of the expedition to leave pollock to himself and pollock became for the first time in his life anxious to mingle with blacks waterhouse took one canoe and pollock in spite of a friendly desire to chat with waterhouse had to take the other he was left all alone in the front part of the canoe and he had the greatest trouble to make the menwho did not love himkeep to the middle of the river a clear hundred yards or more from either shore however he made shakespear the freetown halfbreed come up to his own end of the canoe and tell him about porroh which shakespear failing in his attempts to leave pollock alone presently did with considerable freedom and gusto the day passed the canoe glided swiftly along the ribbon of lagoon water between the drift of waterfigs fallen trees papyrus and palmwine palms and with the dark mangrove swamp to the left through which one could hear now and then the roar of the atlantic surf shakespear told in his soft blurred english of how the porroh could cast spells how men withered up under their malice how they could send dreams and devils how they tormented and killed the sons of ijibu how they kidnapped a white trader from sulyma who had maltreated one of the sect and how his body looked when it was found and pollock after each narrative cursed under his breath at the want of missionary enterprise that allowed such things to be and at the inert british government that ruled over this dark heathendom of sierra leone in the evening they came to the kasi lake and sent a score of crocodiles lumbering off the island on which the expedition camped for the night the next day they reached sulyma and smelt the sea breeze but pollock had to put up there for five days before he could get on to freetown waterhouse considering him to be comparatively safe here and within the pale of freetown influence left him and went back with the expedition to gbemma and pollock became very friendly with perera the only resident white trader at sulymaso friendly indeed that he went about with him everywhere perera was a little portuguese jew who had lived in england and he appreciated the englishmans friendliness as a great compliment for two days nothing happened out of the ordinary for the most part pollock and perera played napthe only game they had in commonand pollock got into debt then on the second evening pollock had a disagreeable intimation of the arrival of the porroh man in sulyma by getting a fleshwound in the shoulder from a lump of filed iron it was a long shot and the missile had nearly spent its force when it hit him still it conveyed its message plainly enough pollock sat up in his hammock revolver in hand all that night and next morning confided to some extent in the angloportuguese perera took the matter seriously he knew the local customs pretty thoroughly it is a personal question you must know it is revenge and of course he is hurried by your leaving de country none of de natives or halfbreeds will interfere wid him very muchunless you make it wort deir while if you come upon him suddenly you might shoot him but den he might shoot you den deres disinfernal magic said perera of course i dont believe in itsuperstitionbut still its not nice to tink dat wherever you are dere is a black man who spends a moonlight night now and den adancing about a fire to send you bad dreams had any bad dreams rather said pollock i keep on seeing the beggars head upside down grinning at me and showing all his teeth as he did in the hut and coming close up to me and then going ever so far off and coming back its nothing to be afraid of but somehow it simply paralyses me with terror in my sleep queer thingsdreams i know its a dream all the time and i cant wake up from it its probably only fancy said perera den my niggers say porroh men can send snakes seen any snakes lately only one i killed him this morning on the floor near my hammock almost trod on him as i got up ah said perera and then reassuringly of course it is acoincidence still i would keep my eyes open den deres pains in de bones i thought they were due to miasma said pollock probably dey are when did dey begin then pollock remembered that he first noticed them the night after the fight in the hut its my opinion he dont want to kill you said pereraat least not yet ive heard deir idea is to scare and worry a man wid deir spells and narrow misses and rheumatic pains and bad dreams and all dat until hes sick of life of course its all talk you know you mustnt worry about it but i wonder what hell be up to next i shall have to be up to something first said pollock staring gloomily at the greasy cards that perera was putting on the table it dont suit my dignity to be followed about and shot at and blighted in this way i wonder if porroh hokeypokey upsets your luck at cards he looked at perera suspiciously very likely it does said perera warmly shuffling dey are wonderful people that afternoon pollock killed two snakes in his hammock and there was also an extraordinary increase in the number of red ants that swarmed over the place and these annoyances put him in a fit temper to talk over business with a certain mendi rough he had interviewed before the mendi rough showed pollock a little iron dagger and demonstrated where one struck in the neck in a way that made pollock shiver and in return for certain considerations pollock promised him a doublebarrelled gun with an ornamental lock in the evening as pollock and perera were playing cards the mendi rough came in through the doorway carrying something in a bloodsoaked piece of native cloth not here said pollock very hurriedly not here but he was not quick enough to prevent the man who was anxious to get to pollocks side of the bargain from opening the cloth and throwing the head of the porroh man upon the table it bounded from there on to the floor leaving a red trail on the cards and rolled into a corner where it came to rest upside down but glaring hard at pollock perera jumped up as the thing fell among the cards and began in his excitement to gabble in portuguese the mendi was bowing with the red cloth in his hand de gun he said pollock stared back at the head in the corner it bore exactly the expression it had in his dreams something seemed to snap in his own brain as he looked at it then perera found his english again you got him killed he said you did not kill him yourself why should i said pollock but he will not be able to take it off now take what off said pollock and all dese cards are spoiled what do you mean by taking off said pollock you must send me a new pack from freetown you can buy dem dere buttake it off it is only superstition i forgot de niggers say dat if de witcheshe was a witch but it is rubbish you must make de porroh man take it off or kill him yourself it is very silly pollock swore under his breath still staring hard at the head in the corner i cant stand that glare he said then suddenly he rushed at the thing and kicked it it rolled some yards or so and came to rest in the same position as before upside down and looking at him he is ugly said the angloportuguese very ugly dey do it on deir faces with little knives pollock would have kicked the head again but the mendi man touched him on the arm de gun he said looking nervously at the head twoif you will take that beastly thing away said pollock the mendi shook his head and intimated that he only wanted one gun now due to him and for which he would be obliged pollock found neither cajolery nor bullying any good with him perera had a gun to sell at a profit of three hundred per cent and with that the man presently departed then pollocks eyes against his will were recalled to the thing on the floor it is funny dat his head keeps upside down said perera with an uneasy laugh his brains must be heavy like de weight in de little images one sees dat keep always upright wid lead in dem you will take him wiv you when you go presently you might take him now de cards are all spoilt dere is a man sell dem in freetown de room is in a filty mess as it is you should have killed him yourself pollock pulled himself together and went and picked up the head he would hang it up by the lamphook in the middle of the ceiling of his room and dig a grave for it at once he was under the impression that he hung it up by the hair but that must have been wrong for when he returned for it it was hanging by the neck upside down he buried it before sunset on the north side of the shed he occupied so that he should not have to pass the grave after dark when he was returning from pereras he killed two snakes before he went to sleep in the darkest part of the night he awoke with a start and heard a pattering sound and something scraping on the floor he sat up noiselessly and felt under his pillow for his revolver a mumbling growl followed and pollock fired at the sound there was a yelp and something dark passed for a moment across the hazy blue of the doorway a dog said pollock lying down again in the early dawn he awoke again with a peculiar sense of unrest the vague pain in his bones had returned for some time he lay watching the red ants that were swarming over the ceiling and then as the light grew brighter he looked over the edge of his hammock and saw something dark on the floor he gave such a violent start that the hammock overset and flung him out he found himself lying perhaps a yard away from the head of the porroh man it had been disinterred by the dog and the nose was grievously battered ants and flies swarmed over it by an odd coincidence it was still upside down and with the same diabolical expression in the inverted eyes pollock sat paralysed and stared at the horror for some time then he got up and walked round itgiving it a wide berthand out of the shed the clear light of the sunrise the living stir of vegetation before the breath of the dying landbreeze and the empty grave with the marks of the dogs paws lightened the weight upon his mind a little he told perera of the business as though it was a jesta jest to be told with white lips you should not have frighten de dog said perera with poorly simulated hilarity the next two days until the steamer came were spent by pollock in making a more effectual disposition of his possession overcoming his aversion to handling the thing he went down to the river mouth and threw it into the seawater but by some miracle it escaped the crocodiles and was cast up by the tide on the mud a little way up the river to be found by an intelligent arab halfbreed and offered for sale to pollock and perera as a curiosity just on the edge of night the native hung about in the brief twilight making lower and lower offers and at last getting scared in some way by the evident dread these wise white men had for the thing went off and passing pollocks shed threw his burden in there for pollock to discover in the morning at this pollock got into a kind of frenzy he would burn the thing he went out straightway into the dawn and had constructed a big pyre of brushwood before the heat of the day he was interrupted by the hooter of the little paddle steamer from monrovia to bathurst which was coming through the gap in the bar thank heaven said pollock with infinite piety when the meaning of the sound dawned upon him with trembling hands he lit his pile of wood hastily threw the head upon it and went away to pack his portmanteau and make his adieux to perera that afternoon with a sense of infinite relief pollock watched the flat swampy foreshore of sulyma grow small in the distance the gap in the long line of white surge became narrower and narrower it seemed to be closing in and cutting him off from his trouble the feeling of dread and worry began to slip from him bit by bit at sulyma belief in porroh malignity and porroh magic had been in the air his sense of porroh had been vast pervading threatening dreadful now manifestly the domain of porroh was only a little place a little black band between the sea and the blue cloudy mendi uplands goodbye porroh said pollock goodbyecertainly not au revoir the captain of the steamer came and leant over the rail beside him and wished him goodevening and spat at the froth of the wake in token of friendly ease i picked up a rummy curio on the beach this go said the captain its a thing i never saw done this side of indy before what might that be said pollock pickled ed said the captain what said pollock edsmoked ed of one of these porroh chaps all ornamented with knifecuts why whats up nothing i shouldnt have took you for a nervous chap green in the face by gosh youre a bad sailor all right eh lord how funny you went well this ed i was telling you of is a bit rum in a way ive got it along with some snakes in a jar of spirit in my cabin what i keeps for such curios and im hanged if it dont float upsy down hullo pollock had given an incoherent cry and had his hands in his hair he ran towards the paddleboxes with a halfformed idea of jumping into the sea and then he realised his position and turned back towards the captain here said the captain jack philips just keep him off me stand off no nearer mister whats the matter with you are you mad pollock put his hand to his head it was no good explaining i believe i am pretty nearly mad at times he said its a pain i have here comes suddenly youll excuse me i hope he was white and in a perspiration he saw suddenly very clearly all the danger he ran of having his sanity doubted he forced himself to restore the captains confidence by answering his sympathetic inquiries noting his suggestions even trying a spoonful of neat brandy in his cheek and that matter settled asking a number of questions about the captains private trade in curiosities the captain described the head in detail all the while pollock was struggling to keep under a preposterous persuasion that the ship was as transparent as glass and that he could distinctly see the inverted face looking at him from the cabin beneath his feet pollock had a worse time almost on the steamer than he had at sulyma all day he had to control himself in spite of his intense perception of the imminent presence of that horrible head that was overshadowing his mind at night his old nightmare returned until with a violent effort he would force himself awake rigid with the horror of it and with the ghost of a hoarse scream in his throat he left the actual head behind at bathurst where he changed ship for teneriffe but not his dreams nor the dull ache in his bones at teneriffe pollock transferred to a cape liner but the head followed him he gambled he tried chess he even read books but he knew the danger of drink yet whenever a round black shadow a round black object came into his range there he looked for the head andsaw it he knew clearly enough that his imagination was growing traitor to him and yet at times it seemed the ship he sailed in his fellowpassengers the sailors the wide sea was all part of a filmy phantasmagoria that hung scarcely veiling it between him and a horrible real world then the porroh man thrusting his diabolical face through that curtain was the one real and undeniable thing at that he would get up and touch things taste something gnaw something burn his hand with a match or run a needle into himself so struggling grimly and silently with his excited imagination pollock reached england he landed at southampton and went on straight from waterloo to his bankers in cornhill in a cab there he transacted some business with the manager in a private room and all the while the head hung like an ornament under the black marble mantel and dripped upon the fender he could hear the drops fall and see the red on the fender a pretty fern said the manager following his eyes but it makes the fender rusty very said pollock a very pretty fern and that reminds me can you recommend me a physician for mind troubles ive got a littlewhat is ithallucination the head laughed savagely wildly pollock was surprised the manager did not notice it but the manager only stared at his face with the address of a doctor pollock presently emerged in cornhill there was no cab in sight and so he went on down to the western end of the street and essayed the crossing opposite the mansion house the crossing is hardly easy even for the expert londoner cabs vans carriages mailcarts omnibuses go by in one incessant stream to anyone fresh from the malarious solitudes of sierra leone it is a boiling maddening confusion but when an inverted head suddenly comes bouncing like an indiarubber ball between your legs leaving distinct smears of blood every time it touches the ground you can scarcely hope to avoid an accident pollock lifted his feet convulsively to avoid it and then kicked at the thing furiously then something hit him violently in the back and a hot pain ran up his arm he had been hit by the pole of an omnibus and three of the fingers of his left hand smashed by the hoof of one of the horsesthe very fingers as it happened that he shot from the porroh man they pulled him out from between the horses legs and found the address of the physician in his crushed hand for a couple of days pollocks sensations were full of the sweet pungent smell of chloroform of painful operations that caused him no pain of lying still and being given food and drink then he had a slight fever and was very thirsty and his old nightmare came back it was only when it returned that he noticed it had left him for a day if my skull had been smashed instead of my fingers it might have gone altogether said pollock staring thoughtfully at the dark cushion that had taken on for the time the shape of the head pollock at the first opportunity told the physician of his mind trouble he knew clearly that he must go mad unless something should intervene to save him he explained that he had witnessed a decapitation in dahomey and was haunted by one of the heads naturally he did not care to state the actual facts the physician looked grave presently he spoke hesitatingly as a child did you get very much religious training very little said pollock a shade passed over the physicians face i dont know if you have heard of the miraculous curesit may be of course they are not miraculousat lourdes faithhealing will hardly suit me i am afraid said pollock with his eye on the dark cushion the head distorted its scarred features in an abominable grimace the physician went upon a new track its all imagination he said speaking with sudden briskness a fair case for faithhealing anyhow your nervous system has run down youre in that twilight state of health when the bogles come easiest the strong impression was too much for you i must make you up a little mixture that will strengthen your nervous systemespecially your brain and you must take exercise im no good for faithhealing said pollock and therefore we must restore tone go in search of stimulating airscotland norway the alps jericho if you like said pollockwhere naaman went however so soon as his fingers would let him pollock made a gallant attempt to follow out the doctors suggestion it was now november he tried football but to pollock the game consisted in kicking a furious inverted head about a field he was no good at the game he kicked blindly with a kind of horror and when they put him back into goal and the ball came swooping down upon him he suddenly yelled and got out of its way the discreditable stories that had driven him from england to wander in the tropics shut him off from any but mens society and now his increasingly strange behaviour made even his man friends avoid him the thing was no longer a thing of the eye merely it gibbered at him spoke to him a horrible fear came upon him that presently when he took hold of the apparition it would no longer become some mere article of furniture but would feel like a real dissevered head alone he would curse at the thing defy it entreat it once or twice in spite of his grim selfcontrol he addressed it in the presence of others he felt the growing suspicion in the eyes of the people that watched himhis landlady the servant his man one day early in december his cousin arnoldhis next of kincame to see him and draw him out and watch his sunken yellow face with narrow eager eyes and it seemed to pollock that the hat his cousin carried in his hand was no hat at all but a gorgon head that glared at him upside down and fought with its eyes against his reason however he was still resolute to see the matter out he got a bicycle and riding over the frosty road from wandsworth to kingston found the thing rolling along at his side and leaving a dark trail behind it he set his teeth and rode faster then suddenly as he came down the hill towards richmond park the apparition rolled in front of him and under his wheel so quickly that he had no time for thought and turning quickly to avoid it was flung violently against a heap of stones and broke his left wrist the end came on christmas morning all night he had been in a fever the bandages encircling his wrist like a band of fire his dreams more vivid and terrible than ever in the cold colourless uncertain light that came before the sunrise he sat up in his bed and saw the head upon the bracket in the place of the bronze jar that had stood there overnight i know that is a bronze jar he said with a chill doubt at his heart presently the doubt was irresistible he got out of bed slowly shivering and advanced to the jar with his hand raised surely he would see now his imagination had deceived him recognise the distinctive sheen of bronze at last after an age of hesitation his fingers came down on the patterned cheek of the head he withdrew them spasmodically the last stage was reached his sense of touch had betrayed him trembling stumbling against the bed kicking against his shoes with his bare feet a dark confusion eddying round him he groped his way to the dressingtable took his razor from the drawer and sat down on the bed with this in his hand in the lookingglass he saw his own face colourless haggard full of the ultimate bitterness of despair he beheld in swift succession the incidents in the brief tale of his experience his wretched home his still more wretched schooldays the years of vicious life he had led since then one act of selfish dishonour leading to another it was all clear and pitiless now all its squalid folly in the cold light of the dawn he came to the hut to the fight with the porroh man to the retreat down the river to sulyma to the mendi assassin and his red parcel to his frantic endeavours to destroy the head to the growth of his hallucination it was a hallucination he knew it was a hallucination merely for a moment he snatched at hope he looked away from the glass and on the bracket the inverted head grinned and grimaced at him with the stiff fingers of his bandaged hand he felt at his neck for the throb of his arteries the morning was very cold the steel blade felt like ice the red room i can assure you said i that it will take a very tangible ghost to frighten me and i stood up before the fire with my glass in my hand it is your own choosing said the man with the withered arm and glanced at me askance eightandtwenty years said i i have lived and never a ghost have i seen as yet the old woman sat staring hard into the fire her pale eyes wide open ay she broke in and eightandtwenty years you have lived and never seen the likes of this house i reckon theres a many things to see when ones still but eightandtwenty she swayed her head slowly from side to side a many things to see and sorrow for i half suspected the old people were trying to enhance the spiritual terrors of their house by their droning insistence i put down my empty glass on the table and looked about the room and caught a glimpse of myself abbreviated and broadened to an impossible sturdiness in the queer old mirror at the end of the room well i said if i see anything tonight i shall be so much the wiser for i come to the business with an open mind its your own choosing said the man with the withered arm once more i heard the sound of a stick and a shambling step on the flags in the passage outside and the door creaked on its hinges as a second old man entered more bent more wrinkled more aged even than the first he supported himself by a single crutch his eyes were covered by a shade and his lower lip halfaverted hung pale and pink from his decaying yellow teeth he made straight for an armchair on the opposite side of the table sat down clumsily and began to cough the man with the withered arm gave this newcomer a short glance of positive dislike the old woman took no notice of his arrival but remained with her eyes fixed steadily on the fire i saidits your own choosing said the man with the withered arm when the coughing had ceased for a while its my own choosing i answered the man with the shade became aware of my presence for the first time and threw his head back for a moment and sideways to see me i caught a momentary glimpse of his eyes small and bright and inflamed then he began to cough and splutter again why dont you drink said the man with the withered arm pushing the beer towards him the man with the shade poured out a glassful with a shaky arm that splashed half as much again on the deal table a monstrous shadow of him crouched upon the wall and mocked his action as he poured and drank i must confess i had scarce expected these grotesque custodians there is to my mind something inhuman in senility something crouching and atavistic the human qualities seem to drop from old people insensibly day by day the three of them made me feel uncomfortable with their gaunt silences their bent carriage their evident unfriendliness to me and to one another if said i you will show me to this haunted room of yours i will make myself comfortable there the old man with the cough jerked his head back so suddenly that it startled me and shot another glance of his red eyes at me from under the shade but no one answered me i waited a minute glancing from one to the other if i said a little louder if you will show me to this haunted room of yours i will relieve you from the task of entertaining me theres a candle on the slab outside the door said the man with the withered arm looking at my feet as he addressed me but if you go to the red room tonight this night of all nights said the old woman you go alone very well i answered and which way do i go you go along the passage for a bit said he until you come to a door and through that is a spiral staircase and halfway up that is a landing and another door covered with baize go through that and down the long corridor to the end and the red room is on your left up the steps have i got that right i said and repeated his directions he corrected me in one particular and are you really going said the man with the shade looking at me again for the third time with that queer unnatural tilting of the face this night of all nights said the old woman it is what i came for i said and moved towards the door as i did so the old man with the shade rose and staggered round the table so as to be closer to the others and to the fire at the door i turned and looked at them and saw they were all close together dark against the firelight staring at me over their shoulders with an intent expression on their ancient faces goodnight i said setting the door open its your own choosing said the man with the withered arm i left the door wide open until the candle was well alight and then i shut them in and walked down the chilly echoing passage i must confess that the oddness of these three old pensioners in whose charge her ladyship had left the castle and the deeptoned oldfashioned furniture of the housekeepers room in which they foregathered affected me in spite of my efforts to keep myself at a matteroffact phase they seemed to belong to another age an older age an age when things spiritual were different from this of ours less certain an age when omens and witches were credible and ghosts beyond denying their very existence was spectral the cut of their clothing fashions born in dead brains the ornaments and conveniences of the room about them were ghostlythe thoughts of vanished men which still haunted rather than participated in the world of today but with an effort i sent such thoughts to the rightabout the long draughty subterranean passage was chilly and dusty and my candle flared and made the shadows cower and quiver the echoes rang up and down the spiral staircase and a shadow came sweeping up after me and one fled before me into the darkness overhead i came to the landing and stopped there for a moment listening to a rustling that i fancied i heard then satisfied of the absolute silence i pushed open the baizecovered door and stood in the corridor the effect was scarcely what i expected for the moonlight coming in by the great window on the grand staircase picked out everything in vivid black shadow or silvery illumination everything was in its place the house might have been deserted on the yesterday instead of eighteen months ago there were candles in the sockets of the sconces and whatever dust had gathered on the carpets or upon the polished flooring was distributed so evenly as to be invisible in the moonlight i was about to advance and stopped abruptly a bronze group stood upon the landing hidden from me by the corner of the wall but its shadow fell with marvellous distinctness upon the white panelling and gave me the impression of someone crouching to waylay me i stood rigid for half a minute perhaps then with my hand in the pocket that held my revolver i advanced only to discover a ganymede and eagle glistening in the moonlight that incident for a time restored my nerve and a porcelain chinaman on a buhl table whose head rocked silently as i passed him scarcely startled me the door to the red room and the steps up to it were in a shadowy corner i moved my candle from side to side in order to see clearly the nature of the recess in which i stood before opening the door here it was thought i that my predecessor was found and the memory of that story gave me a sudden twinge of apprehension i glanced over my shoulder at the ganymede in the moonlight and opened the door of the red room rather hastily with my face half turned to the pallid silence of the landing i entered closed the door behind me at once turned the key i found in the lock within and stood with the candle held aloft surveying the scene of my vigil the great red room of lorraine castle in which the young duke had died or rather in which he had begun his dying for he had opened the door and fallen headlong down the steps i had just ascended that had been the end of his vigil of his gallant attempt to conquer the ghostly tradition of the place and never i thought had apoplexy better served the ends of superstition and there were other and older stories that clung to the room back to the halfcredible beginning of it all the tale of a timid wife and the tragic end that came to her husbands jest of frightening her and looking around that large shadowy room with its shadowy window bays its recesses and alcoves one could well understand the legends that had sprouted in its black corners its germinating darkness my candle was a little tongue of light in its vastness that failed to pierce the opposite end of the room and left an ocean of mystery and suggestion beyond its island of light i resolved to make a systematic examination of the place at once and dispel the fanciful suggestions of its obscurity before they obtained a hold upon me after satisfying myself of the fastening of the door i began to walk about the room peering round each article of furniture tucking up the valances of the bed and opening its curtains wide i pulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several windows before closing the shutters leant forward and looked up the blackness of the wide chimney and tapped the dark oak panelling for any secret opening there were two big mirrors in the room each with a pair of sconces bearing candles and on the mantelshelf too were more candles in china candlesticks all these i lit one after the other the fire was laidan unexpected consideration from the old housekeeperand i lit it to keep down any disposition to shiver and when it was burning well i stood round with my back to it and regarded the room again i had pulled up a chintzcovered armchair and a table to form a kind of barricade before me and on this lay my revolver ready to hand my precise examination had done me good but i still found the remoter darkness of the place and its perfect stillness too stimulating for the imagination the echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was no sort of comfort to me the shadow in the alcove at the end in particular had that undefinable quality of a presence that odd suggestion of a lurking living thing that comes so easily in silence and solitude at last to reassure myself i walked with a candle into it and satisfied myself that there was nothing tangible there i stood that candle upon the floor of the alcove and left it in that position by this time i was in a state of considerable nervous tension although to my reason there was no adequate cause for the condition my mind however was perfectly clear i postulated quite unreservedly that nothing supernatural could happen and to pass the time i began to string some rhymes together ingoldsby fashion of the original legend of the place a few i spoke aloud but the echoes were not pleasant for the same reason i also abandoned after a time a conversation with myself upon the impossibility of ghosts and haunting my mind reverted to the three old and distorted people downstairs and i tried to keep it upon that topic the sombre reds and blacks of the room troubled me even with seven candles the place was merely dim the one in the alcove flared in a draught and the fireflickering kept the shadows and penumbra perpetually shifting and stirring casting about for a remedy i recalled the candles i had seen in the passage and with a slight effort walked out into the moonlight carrying a candle and leaving the door open and presently returned with as many as ten these i put in various knickknacks of china with which the room was sparsely adorned lit and placed where the shadows had lain deepest some on the floor some in the window recesses until at last my seventeen candles were so arranged that not an inch of the room but had the direct light of at least one of them it occurred to me that when the ghost came i could warn him not to trip over them the room was now quite brightly illuminated there was something very cheery and reassuring in these little streaming flames and snuffing them gave me an occupation and afforded a reassuring sense of the passage of time even with that however the brooding expectation of the vigil weighed heavily upon me it was after midnight that the candle in the alcove suddenly went out and the black shadow sprang back to its place there i did not see the candle go out i simply turned and saw that the darkness was there as one might start and see the unexpected presence of a stranger by jove said i aloud that draughts a strong one and taking the matches from the table i walked across the room in a leisurely manner to relight the corner again my first match would not strike and as i succeeded with the second something seemed to blink on the wall before me i turned my head involuntarily and saw that the two candles on the little table by the fireplace were extinguished i rose at once to my feet odd i said did i do that myself in a flash of absentmindedness i walked back relit one and as i did so i saw the candle in the right sconce of one of the mirrors wink and go right out and almost immediately its companion followed it there was no mistake about it the flame vanished as if the wicks had been suddenly nipped between a finger and a thumb leaving the wick neither glowing nor smoking but black while i stood gaping the candle at the foot of the bed went out and the shadows seemed to take another step towards me this wont do said i and first one and then another candle on the mantelshelf followed whats up i cried with a queer high note getting into my voice somehow at that the candle on the wardrobe went out and the one i had relit in the alcove followed steady on i said these candles are wanted speaking with a halfhysterical facetiousness and scratching away at a match the while for the mantel candlesticks my hands trembled so much that twice i missed the rough paper of the matchbox as the mantel emerged from darkness again two candles in the remoter end of the window were eclipsed but with the same match i also relit the larger mirror candles and those on the floor near the doorway so that for the moment i seemed to gain on the extinctions but then in a volley there vanished four lights at once in different corners of the room and i struck another match in quivering haste and stood hesitating whither to take it as i stood undecided an invisible hand seemed to sweep out the two candles on the table with a cry of terror i dashed at the alcove then into the corner and then into the window relighting three as two more vanished by the fireplace then perceiving a better way i dropped the matches on the ironbound deedbox in the corner and caught up the bedroom candlestick with this i avoided the delay of striking matches but for all that the steady process of extinction went on and the shadows i feared and fought against returned and crept in upon me first a step gained on this side of me and then on that it was like a ragged stormcloud sweeping out the stars now and then one returned for a minute and was lost again i was now almost frantic with the horror of the coming darkness and my selfpossession deserted me i leaped panting and dishevelled from candle to candle in a vain struggle against that remorseless advance i bruised myself on the thigh against the table i sent a chair headlong i stumbled and fell and whisked the cloth from the table in my fall my candle rolled away from me and i snatched another as i rose abruptly this was blown out as i swung it off the table by the wind of my sudden movement and immediately the two remaining candles followed but there was light still in the room a red light that staved off the shadows from me the fire of course i could still thrust my candle between the bars and relight it i turned to where the flames were still dancing between the glowing coals and splashing red reflections upon the furniture made two steps towards the grate and incontinently the flames dwindled and vanished the glow vanished the reflections rushed together and vanished and as i thrust the candle between the bars darkness closed upon me like the shutting of an eye wrapped about me in a stifling embrace sealed my vision and crushed the last vestiges of reason from my brain the candle fell from my hand i flung out my arms in a vain effort to thrust that ponderous blackness away from me and lifting up my voice screamed with all my mightonce twice thrice then i think i must have staggered to my feet i know i thought suddenly of the moonlit corridor and with my head bowed and my arms over my face made a run for the door but i had forgotten the exact position of the door and struck myself heavily against the corner of the bed i staggered back turned and was either struck or struck myself against some other bulky furniture i have a vague memory of battering myself thus to and fro in the darkness of a cramped struggle and of my own wild crying as i darted to and fro of a heavy blow at last upon my forehead a horrible sensation of falling that lasted an age of my last frantic effort to keep my footing and then i remember no more i opened my eyes in daylight my head was roughly bandaged and the man with the withered arm was watching my face i looked about me trying to remember what had happened and for a space i could not recollect i rolled my eyes into the corner and saw the old woman no longer abstracted pouring out some drops of medicine from a little blue phial into a glass where am i i asked i seem to remember you and yet i cannot remember who you are they told me then and i heard of the haunted red room as one who hears a tale we found you at dawn said he and there was blood on your forehead and lips it was very slowly i recovered my memory of my experience you believe now said the old man that the room is haunted he spoke no longer as one who greets an intruder but as one who grieves for a broken friend yes said i the room is haunted and you have seen it and we who have lived here all our lives have never set eyes upon it because we have never dared tell us is it truly the old earl who no said i it is not i told you so said the old lady with the glass in her hand it is his poor young countess who was frightened it is not i said there is neither ghost of earl nor ghost of countess in that room there is no ghost there at all but worse far worse well they said the worst of all the things that haunt poor mortal man said i and that is in all its nakednessfear fear that will not have light nor sound that will not bear with reason that deafens and darkens and overwhelms it followed me through the corridor it fought against me in the room i stopped abruptly there was an interval of silence my hand went up to my bandages then the man with the shade sighed and spoke that is it said he i knew that was it a power of darkness to put such a curse upon a woman it lurks there always you can feel it even in the daytime even of a bright summers day in the hangings in the curtains keeping behind you however you face about in the dusk it creeps along the corridor and follows you so that you dare not turn there is fear in that room of hersblack fear and there will beso long as this house of sin endures the cone the night was hot and overcast the sky redrimmed with the lingering sunset of midsummer they sat at the open window trying to fancy the air was fresher there the trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and dark beyond in the roadway a gaslamp burnt bright orange against the hazy blue of the evening farther were the three lights of the railway signal against the lowering sky the man and woman spoke to one another in low tones he does not suspect said the man a little nervously not he she said peevishly as though that too irritated her he thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel he has no imagination no poetry none of these men of iron have he said sententiously they have no hearts he has not she said she turned her discontented face towards the window the distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew in volume the house quivered one heard the metallic rattle of the tender as the train passed there was a glare of light above the cutting and a driving tumult of smoke one two three four five six seven eight black oblongseight truckspassed across the dim grey of the embankment and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of the tunnel which with the last seemed to swallow down train smoke and sound in one abrupt gulp this country was all fresh and beautiful once he said and nowit is gehenna down that waynothing but potbanks and chimneys belching fire and dust into the face of heaven but what does it matter an end comes an end to all this cruelty tomorrow he spoke the last word in a whisper tomorrow she said speaking in a whisper too and still staring out of the window dear he said putting his hand on hers she turned with a start and their eyes searched one anothers hers softened to his gaze my dear one she said and then it seems so strangethat you should have come into my life like thisto open she paused to open he said all this wonderful worldshe hesitated and spoke still more softlythis world of love to me then suddenly the door clicked and closed they turned their heads and he started violently back in the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy figuresilent they saw the face dimly in the halflight with unexpressive dark patches under the penthouse brows every muscle in rauts body suddenly became tense when could the door have opened what had he heard had he heard all what had he seen a tumult of questions the newcomers voice came at last after a pause that seemed interminable well he said i was afraid i had missed you horrocks said the man at the window gripping the windowledge with his hand his voice was unsteady the clumsy figure of horrocks came forward out of the shadow he made no answer to rauts remark for a moment he stood above them the womans heart was cold within her i told mr raut it was just possible you might come back she said in a voice that never quivered horrocks still silent sat down abruptly in the chair by her little worktable his big hands were clenched one saw now the fire of his eyes under the shadow of his brows he was trying to get his breath his eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted and then back to the woman by this time and for the moment all three half understood one another yet none dared say a word to ease the pentup things that choked them it was the husbands voice that broke the silence at last you wanted to see me he said to raut raut started as he spoke i came to see you he said resolved to lie to the last yes said horrocks you promised said raut to show me some fine effects of moonlight and smoke i promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke repeated horrocks in a colourless voice and i thought i might catch you tonight before you went down to the works proceeded raut and come with you there was another pause did the man mean to take the thing coolly did he after all know how long had he been in the room yet even at the moment when they heard the door their attitudes horrocks glanced at the profile of the woman shadowy pallid in the halflight then he glanced at raut and seemed to recover himself suddenly of course he said i promised to show you the works under their proper dramatic conditions its odd how i could have forgotten if i am troubling youbegan raut horrocks started again a new light had suddenly come into the sultry gloom of his eyes not in the least he said have you been telling mr raut of all these contrasts of flame and shadow you think so splendid said the woman turning now to her husband for the first time her confidence creeping back again her voice just one halfnote too high that dreadful theory of yours that machinery is beautiful and everything else in the world ugly i thought he would not spare you mr raut its his great theory his one discovery in art i am slow to make discoveries said horrocks grimly damping her suddenly but what i discover he stopped well she said nothing and suddenly he rose to his feet i promised to show you the works he said to raut and put his big clumsy hand on his friends shoulder and you are ready to go quite said raut and stood up also there was another pause each of them peered through the indistinctness of the dusk at the other two horrocks hand still rested on rauts shoulder raut half fancied still that the incident was trivial after all but mrs horrocks knew her husband better knew that grim quiet in his voice and the confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical evil very well said horrocks and dropping his hand turned towards the door my hat raut looked round in the halflight thats my workbasket said mrs horrocks with a gust of hysterical laughter their hands came together on the back of the chair here it is he said she had an impulse to warn him in an undertone but she could not frame a word dont go and beware of him struggled in her mind and the swift moment passed got it said horrocks standing with the door half open raut stepped towards him better say goodbye to mrs horrocks said the ironmaster even more grimly quiet in his tone than before raut started and turned goodevening mrs horrocks he said and their hands touched horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him towards men raut went out and then after a wordless look at her her husband followed she stood motionless while rauts light footfall and her husbands heavy tread like bass and treble passed down the passage together the front door slammed heavily she went to the window moving slowly and stood watchingleaning forward the two men appeared for a moment at the gateway in the road passed under the street lamp and were hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery the lamplight fell for a moment on their faces showing only unmeaning pale patches telling nothing of what she still feared and doubted and craved vainly to know then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big armchair her eyes wide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky an hour after she was still there her attitude scarcely changed the oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon raut they went side by side down the road in silence and in silence turned into the cindermade byway that presently opened out the prospect of the valley a blue haze half dust half mist touched the long valley with mystery beyond were hanley and etruria grey and dark masses outlined thinly by the rare golden dots of the street lamps and here and there a gaslit window or the yellow glare of some lateworking factory or crowded publichouse out of the masses clear and slender against the evening sky rose a multitude of tall chimneys many of them reeking a few smokeless during a season of play here and there a pallid patch and ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a potbank or a wheel black and sharp against the hot lower sky marked some colliery where they raise the iridescent coal of the place nearer at hand was the broad stretch of railway and half invisible trains shunteda steady puffing and rumbling with every run a ringing concussion and a rhythmic series of impacts and a passage of intermittent puffs of white steam across the further view and to the left between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill beyond dominating the whole view colossal inkyblack and crowned with smoke and fitful flames stood the great cylinders of the jeddah company blast furnaces the central edifices of the big ironworks of which horrocks was the manager they stood heavy and threatening full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten iron and about the feet of them rattled the rollingmills and the steamhammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and thither even as they looked a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the giants and the red flames gleamed out and a confusion of smoke and black dust came boiling upwards towards the sky certainly you get some fine effects of colour with your furnaces said raut breaking a silence that had become apprehensive horrocks grunted he stood with his hands in his pockets frowning down at the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond frowning as if he were thinking out some knotty problem raut glanced at him and away again at present your moonlight effect is hardly ripe he continued looking upward the moon is still smothered by the vestiges of daylight horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly awakened vestiges of daylight of course of course he too looked up at the moon pale still in the midsummer sky come along he said suddenly and gripping rauts arm in his hand made a move towards the path that dropped from them to the railway raut hung back their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that their lips came near to say horrockss hand tightened and then relaxed he let go and before raut was aware of it they were arm in arm and walking one unwillingly enough down the path you see the fine effect of the railway signals towards burslem said horrocks suddenly breaking into loquacity striding fast and tightening the grip of his elbow the while little green lights and red and white lights all against the haze you have an eye for effect raut its a fine effect and look at those furnaces of mine how they rise upon us as we come down the hill that to the right is my petseventy feet of him i packed him myself and hes boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts for five long years ive a particular fancy for him that line of red therea lovely bit of warm orange youd call it rautthats the puddlers furnaces and there in the hot light three black figuresdid you see the white splash of the steamhammer thenthats the rollingmills come along clang clatter how it goes rattling across the floor sheet tin rautamazing stuff glass mirrors are not in it when that stuff comes from the mill and squelchthere goes the hammer again come along he had to stop talking to catch at his breath his arm twisted into rauts with benumbing tightness he had come striding down the black path towards the railway as though he was possessed raut had not spoken a word had simply hung back against horrockss pull with all his strength i say he said now laughing nervously but with an undernote of snarl in his voice why on earth are you nipping my arm off horrocks and dragging me along like this at length horrocks released him his manner changed again nipping your arm off he said sorry but its you taught me the trick of walking in that friendly way you havent learnt the refinements of it yet then said raut laughing artificially again by jove im black and blue horrocks offered no apology they stood now near the bottom of the hill close to the fence that bordered the railway the ironworks had grown larger and spread out with their approach they looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of down the further view of etruria and hanley had dropped out of sight with their descent before them by the stile rose a noticeboard bearing still dimly visible the words beware of the trains half hidden by splashes of coaly mud fine effects said horrocks waving his arm here comes a train the puffs of smoke the orange glare the round eye of light in front of it the melodious rattle fine effects but these furnaces of mine used to be finer before we shoved cones in their throats and saved the gas how said raut cones cones my man cones ill show you one nearer the flames used to flare out of the open throats greatwhat is itpillars of cloud by day red and black smoke and pillars of fire by night now we run it off in pipes and burn it to heat the blast and the top is shut by a cone youll be interested in that cone but every now and then said raut you get a burst of fire and smoke up there the cones not fixed its hung by a chain from a lever and balanced by an equipoise you shall see it nearer else of course thered be no way of getting fuel into the thing every now and then the cone dips and out comes the flare i see said raut he looked over his shoulder the moon gets brighter he said come along said horrocks abruptly gripping his shoulder again and moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing and then came one of those swift incidents vivid but so rapid that they leave one doubtful and reeling halfway across horrockss hand suddenly clenched upon him like a vice and swung him backward and through a halfturn so that he looked up the line and there a chain of lamplit carriagewindows telescoped swiftly as it came towards them and the red and yellow lights of an engine grew larger and larger rushing down upon them as he grasped what this meant he turned his face to horrocks and pushed with all his strength against the arm that held him back between the rails the struggle did not last a moment just as certain as it was that horrocks held him there so certain was it that he had been violently lugged out of danger out of the way said horrocks with a gasp as the train came rattling by and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks i did not see it coming said raut still even in spite of his own apprehensions trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse horrocks answered with a grunt the cone he said and then as one who recovers himself i thought you did not hear i didnt said raut i wouldnt have had you run over then for the world said horrocks for a moment i lost my nerve said raut horrocks stood for half a minute then turned abruptly towards the ironworks again see how fine these great mounds of mine these clinkerheaps look in the night that truck yonder up above there up it goes and outtilts the slag see the palpitating red stuff go sliding down the slope as we get nearer the heap rises up and cuts the blast furnaces see the quiver up above the big one not that way this way between the heaps that goes to the puddling furnaces but i want to show you the canal first he came and took raut by the elbow and so they went along side by side raut answered horrocks vaguely what he asked himself had really happened on the line was he deluding himself with his own fancies or had horrocks actually held him back in the way of the train had he just been within an ace of being murdered suppose this slouching scowling monster did know anything for a minute or two then raut was really afraid for his life but the mood passed as he reasoned with himself after all horrocks might have heard nothing at anyrate he had pulled him out of the way in time his odd manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before he was talking now of the ashheaps and the canal eigh said horrocks what said raut rather the haze in the moonlight fine our canal said horrocks stopping suddenly our canal by moonlight and firelight is an immense effect youve never seen it fancy that youve spent too many of your evenings philandering up in newcastle there i tell you for real florid effects but you shall see boiling water as they came out of the labyrinth of clinkerheaps and mounds of coal and ore the noises of the rollingmill sprang upon them suddenly loud near and distinct three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps to horrocks their faces were vague in the darkness raut felt a futile impulse to address them and before he could frame his words they passed into the shadows horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now a weirdlooking place it seemed in the bloodred reflections of the furnaces the hot water that cooled the tuyeres came into it some fifty yards upa tumultuous almost boiling affluent and the steam rose up from the water in silent white wisps and streaks wrapping damply about them an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red eddies a white uprising that made the head swim the shining black tower of the larger blastfurnace rose overhead out of the mist and its tumultuous riot filled their ears raut kept away from the edge of the water and watched horrocks here it is red said horrocks bloodred vapour as red and hot as sin but yonder there where the moonlight falls on it and it drives across the clinkerheaps it is as white as death raut turned his head for a moment and then came back hastily to his watch on horrocks come along to the rollingmills said horrocks the threatening hold was not so evident that time and raut felt a little reassured but all the same what on earth did horrocks mean about white as death and red as sin coincidence perhaps they went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while and then through the rollingmills where amidst an incessant din the deliberate steamhammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron and black halfnaked titans rushed the plastic bars like hot sealingwax between the wheels come on said horrocks in rauts ear and they went and peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyeres and saw the tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blastfurnace it left one eye blinded for a while then with green and blue patches dancing across the dark they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime were raised to the top of the big cylinder and out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace rauts doubts came upon him again was it wise to be here if horrocks did knoweverything do what he would he could not resist a violent trembling right under foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet it was a dangerous place they pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that crowned the place the reek of the furnace a sulphurous vapour streaked with pungent bitterness seemed to make the distant hillside of hanley quiver the moon was riding out now from among a drift of clouds halfway up the sky above the undulating wooded outlines of newcastle the steaming canal ran away from below them under an indistinct bridge and vanished into the dim haze of the flat fields towards burslem thats the cone ive been telling you of shouted horrocks and below that sixty feet of fire and molten metal with the air of the blast frothing through it like gas in sodawater raut gripped the handrail tightly and stared down at the cone the heat was intense the boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a thunderous accompaniment to horrockss voice but the thing had to be gone through now perhaps after all in the middle bawled horrocks temperature near a thousand degrees if you were dropped into it flash into flame like a pinch of gunpowder in a candle put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath why even up here ive seen the rainwater boiling off the trucks and that cone there its a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes the top side of its three hundred degrees three hundred degrees said raut three hundred centigrade mind said horrocks it will boil the blood out of you in no time eigh said raut and turned boil the blood out of you in no you dont let me go screamed raut let go my arm with one hand he clutched at the handrail then with both for a moment the two men stood swaying then suddenly with a violent jerk horrocks had twisted him from his hold he clutched at horrocks and missed his foot went back into empty air in midair he twisted himself and then cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together he clutched the chain by which the cone hung and the thing sank an infinitesimal amount as he struck it a circle of glowing red appeared about him and a tongue of flame released from the chaos within flickered up towards him an intense pain assailed him at the knees and he could smell the singeing of his hands he raised himself to his feet and tried to climb up the chain and then something struck his head black and shining with the moonlight the throat of the furnace rose about him horrocks he saw stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the rail the gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight and shouting fizzle you fool fizzle you hunter of women you hotblooded hound boil boil boil suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck and flung it deliberately lump after lump at raut horrocks cried raut horrocks he clung crying to the chain pulling himself up from the burning of the cone each missile horrocks flung hit him his clothes charred and glowed and as he struggled the cone dropped and a rush of hot suffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame his human likeness departed from him when the momentary red had passed horrocks saw a charred blackened figure its head streaked with blood still clutching and fumbling with the chain and writhing in agonya cindery animal an inhuman monstrous creature that began a sobbing intermittent shriek abruptly at the sight the ironmasters anger passed a deadly sickness came upon him the heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his nostrils his sanity returned to him god have mercy upon me he cried o god what have i done he knew the thing below him save that it still moved and felt was already a dead manthat the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in his veins an intense realisation of that agony came to his mind and overcame every other feeling for a moment he stood irresolute and then turning to the truck he hastily tilted its contents upon the struggling thing that had once been a man the mass fell with a thud and went radiating over the cone with the thud the shriek ended and a boiling confusion of smoke dust and flame came rushing up towards him as it passed he saw the cone clear again then he staggered back and stood trembling clinging to the rail with both hands his lips moved but no words came to them down below was the sound of voices and running steps the clangour of rolling in the shed ceased abruptly the purple pileus mr coombes was sick of life he walked away from his unhappy home and sick not only of his own existence but of everybody elses turned aside down gaswork lane to avoid the town and crossing the wooden bridge that goes over the canal to starlings cottages was presently alone in the damp pinewoods and out of sight and sound of human habitation he would stand it no longer he repeated aloud with blasphemies unusual to him that he would stand it no longer he was a palefaced little man with dark eyes and a fine and very black moustache he had a very stiff upright collar slightly frayed that gave him an illusory double chin and his overcoat albeit shabby was trimmed with astrachan his gloves were a bright brown with black stripes over the knuckles and split at the finger ends his appearance his wife had said once in the dear dead days beyond recallbefore he married her that iswas military but now she called him it seems a dreadful thing to tell of between husband and wife but she called him a little grub it wasnt the only thing she had called him either the row had arisen about that beastly jennie again jennie was his wifes friend and by no invitation of mr coombes she came in every blessed sunday to dinner and made a shindy all the afternoon she was a big noisy girl with a taste for loud colours and a strident laugh and this sunday she had outdone all her previous intrusions by bringing in a fellow with her a chap as showy as herself and mr coombes in a starchy clean collar and his sunday frockcoat had sat dumb and wrathful at his own table while his wife and her guests talked foolishly and undesirably and laughed aloud well he stood that and after dinner which as usual was late what must miss jennie do but go to the piano and play banjo tunes for all the world as if it were a weekday flesh and blood could not endure such goings on they would hear next door they would hear in the road it was a public announcement of their disrepute he had to speak he had felt himself go pale and a kind of rigour had affected his respiration as he delivered himself he had been sitting on one of the chairs by the windowthe new guest had taken possession of the armchair he turned his head sun day he said over the collar in the voice of one who warns sun day what people call a nasty tone it was jennie had kept on playing but his wife who was looking through some music that was piled on the top of the piano had stared at him whats wrong now she said cant people enjoy themselves i dont mind rational njoyment at all said little coombes but i aint agoing to have weekday tunes playing on a sunday in this house whats wrong with my playing now said jennie stopping and twirling round on the musicstool with a monstrous rustle of flounces coombes saw it was going to be a row and opened too vigorously as is common with your timid nervous men all the world over steady on with that musicstool said he it aint made for eavy weights never you mind about weights said jennie incensed what was you saying behind my back about my playing surely you dont old with not having a bit of music on a sunday mr coombes said the new guest leaning back in the armchair blowing a cloud of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying way and simultaneously his wife said something to jennie about never mind im you go on jinny i do said mr coombes addressing the new guest may i arst why said the new guest evidently enjoying both his cigarette and the prospect of an argument he was by the bye a lank young man very stylishly dressed in bright drab with a white cravat and a pearl and silver pin it had been better taste to come in a black coat mr coombes thought because began mr coombes it dont suit me im a business man i ave to study my connection rational njoyment his connection said mrs coombes scornfully thats what hes always asaying we got to do this and we got to do that if you dont mean to study my connection said mr coombes what did you marry me for i wonder said jennie and turned back to the piano i never saw such a man as you said mrs coombes youve altered all round since we were married before then jennie began at the tum tum tum again look here said mr coombes driven at last to revolt standing up and raising his voice i tell you i wont have that the frockcoat heaved with his indignation no vilence now said the long young man in drab sitting up who the juice are you said mr coombes fiercely whereupon they all began talking at once the new guest said he was jennies intended and meant to protect her and mr coombes said he was welcome to do so anywhere but in his mr coombes house and mrs coombes said he ought to be ashamed of insulting his guests and as i have already mentioned that he was getting a regular little grub and the end was that mr coombes ordered his visitors out of the house and they wouldnt go and so he said he would go himself with his face burning and tears of excitement in his eyes he went into the passage and as he struggled with his overcoathis frockcoat sleeves got concertinaed up his armand gave a brush at his silk hat jennie began again at the piano and strummed him insultingly out of the house tum tum tum he slammed the shop door so that the house quivered that briefly was the immediate making of his mood you will perhaps begin to understand his disgust with existence as he walked along the muddy path under the firsit was late october and the ditches and heaps of fir needles were gorgeous with clumps of fungihe recapitulated the melancholy history of his marriage it was brief and commonplace enough he now perceived with sufficient clearness that his wife had married him out of a natural curiosity and in order to escape from her worrying laborious and uncertain life in the workroom and like the majority of her class she was far too stupid to realise that it was her duty to cooperate with him in his business she was greedy of enjoyment loquacious and sociallyminded and evidently disappointed to find the restraints of poverty still hanging about her his worries exasperated her and the slightest attempt to control her proceedings resulted in a charge of grumbling why couldnt he be niceas he used to be and coombes was such a harmless little man too nourished mentally on selfhelp and with a meagre ambition of selfdenial and competition that was to end in a sufficiency then jennie came in as a female mephistopheles a gabbling chronicle of fellers and was always wanting his wife to go to theatres and all that and in addition were aunts of his wife and cousins male and female to eat up capital insult him personally upset business arrangements annoy good customers and generally blight his life it was not the first occasion by many that mr coombes had fled his home in wrath and indignation and something like fear vowing furiously and even aloud that he wouldnt stand it and so frothing away his energy along the line of least resistance but never before had he been quite so sick of life as on this particular sunday afternoon the sunday dinner may have had its share in his despairand the greyness of the sky perhaps too he was beginning to realise his unendurable frustration as a business man as the consequence of his marriage presently bankruptcy and after that perhaps she might have reason to repent when it was too late and destiny as i have already intimated had planted the path through the wood with evilsmelling fungi thickly and variously planted it not only on the right side but on the left a small shopman is in such a melancholy position if his wife turns out a disloyal partner his capital is all tied up in his business and to leave her means to join the unemployed in some strange part of the earth the luxuries of divorce are beyond him altogether so that the good old tradition of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably for him and things work up to tragic culminations bricklayers kick their wives to death and dukes betray theirs but it is among the small clerks and shopkeepers nowadays that it comes most often to a cutting of throats under the circumstances it is not so very remarkableand you must take it as charitably as you canthat the mind of mr coombes ran for a while on some such glorious close to his disappointed hopes and that he thought of razors pistols breadknives and touching letters to the coroner denouncing his enemies by name and praying piously for forgiveness after a time his fierceness gave way to melancholia he had been married in this very overcoat in his first and only frockcoat that was buttoned up beneath it he began to recall their courting along this very walk his years of penurious saving to get capital and the bright hopefulness of his marrying days for it all to work out like this was there no sympathetic ruler anywhere in the world he reverted to death as a topic he thought of the canal he had just crossed and doubted whether he shouldnt stand with his head out even in the middle and it was while drowning was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his eye he looked at it mechanically for a moment and stopped and stooped towards it to pick it up under the impression that it was some such small leather object as a purse then he saw that it was the purple top of a fungus a peculiarly poisonouslooking purple slimy shiny and emitting a sour odour he hesitated with his hand an inch or so from it and the thought of poison crossed his mind with that he picked the thing and stood up again with it in his hand the odour was certainly strongacrid but by no means disgusting he broke off a piece and the fresh surface was a creamy white that changed like magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowishgreen colour it was even an invitinglooking change he broke off two other pieces to see it repeated they were wonderful things these fungi thought mr coombes and all of them the deadliest poisons as his father had often told him deadly poisons there is no time like the present for a rash resolve why not here and now thought mr coombes he tasted a little piece a very little piece indeeda mere crumb it was so pungent that he almost spat it out again then merely hot and fullflavoured a kind of german mustard with a touch of horseradish andwell mushroom he swallowed it in the excitement of the moment did he like it or did he not his mind was curiously careless he would try another bit it really wasnt badit was good he forgot his troubles in the interest of the immediate moment playing with death it was he took another bite and then deliberately finished a mouthful a curious tingling sensation began in his fingertips and toes his pulse began to move faster the blood in his ears sounded like a millrace try bi more said mr coombes he turned and looked about him and found his feet unsteady he saw and struggled towards a little patch of purple a dozen yards away jol goo stuff said mr coombes elomore ye he pitched forward and fell on his face his hands outstretched towards the cluster of pilei but he did not eat any more of them he forgot forthwith he rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment on his face his carefully brushed silk hat had rolled away towards the ditch he pressed his hand to his brow something had happened but he could not rightly determine what it was anyhow he was no longer dullhe felt bright cheerful and his throat was afire he laughed in the sudden gaiety of his heart had he been dull he did not know but at anyrate he would be dull no longer he got up and stood unsteadily regarding the universe with an agreeable smile he began to remember he could not remember very well because of a steam roundabout that was beginning in his head and he knew he had been disagreeable at home just because they wanted to be happy they were quite right life should be as gay as possible he would go home and make it up and reassure them and why not take some of this delightful toadstool with him for them to eat a hatful no less some of those red ones with white spots as well and a few yellow he had been a dull dog an enemy to merriment he would make up for it it would be gay to turn his coatsleeves inside out and stick some yellow gorse into his waistcoat pockets then homesingingfor a jolly evening after the departure of mr coombes jennie discontinued playing and turned round on the musicstool again what a fuss about nothing said jennie you see mr clarence what ive got to put up with said mrs coombes he is a bit hasty said mr clarence judicially he aint got the slightest sense of our position said mrs coombes thats what i complain of he cares for nothing but his old shop and if i have a bit of company or buy anything to keep myself decent or get any little thing i want out of the housekeeping money theres disagreeables economy he says struggle for life and all that he lies awake of nights about it worrying how he can screw me out of a shilling he wanted us to eat dorset butter once if once i was to give in to himthere of course said jennie if a man values a woman said mr clarence lounging back in the armchair he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her for my own part said mr clarence with his eye on jennie i shouldnt think of marrying till i was in a position to do the thing in style its downright selfishness a man ought to go through the roughandtumble by himself and not drag her i dont agree altogether with that said jennie i dont see why a man shouldnt have a womans help provided he doesnt treat her meanly you know its meanness you wouldnt believe said mrs coombes but i was a fool to ave im i might ave known if it adnt been for my father we shouldnt have had not a carriage to our wedding lord he didnt stick out at that said mr clarence quite shocked said he wanted the money for his stock or some such rubbish why he wouldnt have a woman in to help me once a week if it wasnt for my standing out plucky and the fusses he makes about moneycomes to me well pretty near crying with sheets of paper and figgers if only we can tide over this year he says the business is bound to go if only we can tide over this year i says then itll be if only we can tide over next year i know you i says and you dont catch me screwing myself lean and ugly why didnt you marry a slavey i says if you wanted oneinstead of a respectable girl i says so mrs coombes but we will not follow this unedifying conversation further suffice it that mr coombes was very satisfactorily disposed of and they had a snug little time round the fire then mrs coombes went to get the tea and jennie sat coquettishly on the arm of mr clarences chair until the teathings clattered outside what was that i heard asked mrs coombes playfully as she entered and there was badinage about kissing they were just sitting down to the little circular table when the first intimation of mr coombes return was heard this was a fumbling at the latch of the front door eres my lord said mrs coombes went out like a lion and comes back like a lamb ill lay something fell over in the shop a chair it sounded like then there was a sound as of some complicated step exercise in the passage then the door opened and coombes appeared but it was coombes transfigured the immaculate collar had been torn carelessly from his throat his carefullybrushed silk hat halffull of a crush of fungi was under one arm his coat was inside out and his waistcoat adorned with bunches of yellowblossomed furze these little eccentricities of sunday costume however were quite overshadowed by the change in his face it was livid white his eyes were unnaturally large and bright and his pale blue lips were drawn back in a cheerless grin merry he said he had stopped dancing to open the door rational njoyment dance he made three fantastic steps into the room and stood bowing jim shrieked mrs coombes and mr clarence sat petrified with a dropping lower jaw tea said mr coombes jol thing tea tosestools too brosher hes drunk said jennie in a weak voice never before had she seen this intense pallor in a drunken man or such shining dilated eyes mr coombes held out a handful of scarlet agaric to mr clarence jo stuff said he ta some at that moment he was genial then at the sight of their startled faces he changed with the swift transition of insanity into overbearing fury and it seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel of his departure in such a huge voice as mrs coombes had never heard before he shouted my house im master ere eat what i give yer he bawled this as it seemed without an effort without a violent gesture standing there as motionless as one who whispers holding out a handful of fungus clarence approved himself a coward he could not meet the mad fury in coombes eyes he rose to his feet pushing back his chair and turned stooping at that coombes rushed at him jennie saw her opportunity and with the ghost of a shriek made for the door mrs coombes followed her clarence tried to dodge over went the teatable with a smash as coombes clutched him by the collar and tried to thrust the fungus into his mouth clarence was content to leave his collar behind him and shot out into the passage with red patches of fly agaric still adherent to his face shut im in cried mrs coombes and would have closed the door but her supports deserted her jennie saw the shop door open and vanished thereby locking it behind her while clarence went on hastily into the kitchen mr coombes came heavily against the door and mrs coombes finding the key was inside fled upstairs and locked herself in the spare bedroom so the new convert to joie de vivre emerged upon the passage his decorations a little scattered but that respectable hatful of fungi still under his arm he hesitated at the three ways and decided on the kitchen whereupon clarence who was fumbling with the key gave up the attempt to imprison his host and fled into the scullery only to be captured before he could open the door into the yard mr clarence is singularly reticent of the details of what occurred it seems that mr coombes transitory irritation had vanished again and he was once more a genial playfellow and as there were knives and meat choppers about clarence very generously resolved to humour him and so avoid anything tragic it is beyond dispute that mr coombes played with mr clarence to his hearts content they could not have been more playful and familiar if they had known each other for years he insisted gaily on clarence trying the fungi and after a friendly tussle was smitten with remorse at the mess he was making of his guests face it also appears that clarence was dragged under the sink and his face scrubbed with the blacking brushhe being still resolved to humour the lunatic at any costand that finally in a somewhat dishevelled chipped and discoloured condition he was assisted to his coat and shown out by the back door the shopway being barred by jennie mr coombes wandering thoughts then turned to jennie jennie had been unable to unfasten the shop door but she shot the bolts against mr coombes latchkey and remained in possession of the shop for the rest of the evening it would appear that mr coombes then returned to the kitchen still in pursuit of gaiety and albeit a strict good templar drank or spilt down the front of the first and only frockcoat no less than five bottles of the stout mrs coombes insisted upon having for her healths sake he made cheerful noises by breaking off the necks of the bottles with several of his wifes weddingpresent dinnerplates and during the earlier part of this great drunk he sang divers merry ballads he cut his finger rather badly with one of the bottlesthe only bloodshed in this storyand what with that and the systematic convulsion of his inexperienced physiology by the liquorish brand of mrs coombes stout it may be the evil of the fungus poison was somehow allayed but we prefer to draw a veil over the concluding incidents of this sunday afternoon they ended in the coal cellar in a deep and healing sleep an interval of five years elapsed again it was a sunday afternoon in october and again mr coombes walked through the pinewood beyond the canal he was still the same darkeyed blackmoustached little man that he was at the outset of the story but his double chin was now scarcely so illusory as it had been his overcoat was new with a velvet lapel and a stylish collar with turndown corners free of any coarse starchiness had replaced the original allround article his hat was glossy his gloves newishthough one finger had split and been carefully mended and a casual observer would have noticed about him a certain rectitude of bearing a certain erectness of head that marks the man who thinks well of himself he was a master now with three assistants beside him walked a larger sunburnt parody of himself his brother tom just back from australia they were recapitulating their early struggles and mr coombes had just been making a financial statement its a very nice little business jim said brother tom in these days of competition youre jolly lucky to have worked it up so and youre jolly lucky too to have a wife whos willing to help like yours does between ourselves said mr coombes it wasnt always so it wasnt always like this to begin with the missus was a bit giddy girls are funny creatures dear me yes youd hardly think it but she was downright extravagant and always having slaps at me i was a bit too easy and loving and all that and she thought the whole blessed show was run for her turned the ouse into a regular caravansery always having her relations and girls from business in and their chaps comic songs a sunday it was getting to and driving trade away and she was making eyes at the chaps too i tell you tom the place wasnt my own shouldnt a thought it it was so welli reasoned with her i said i aint a duke to keep a wife like a pet animal i married you for elp and company i said you got to elp and pull the business through she wouldnt ear of it very well i says im a mild man till im roused i says and its getting to that but she wouldnt ear of no warnings well its the way with women she didnt think i ad it in me to be roused women of her sort between ourselves tom dont respect a man until theyre a bit afraid of him so i just broke out to show her in comes a girl named jennie that used to work with her and her chap we ad a bit of a row and i came out ereit was just such another day as thisand i thought it all out then i went back and pitched into them you did i did i was mad i can tell you i wasnt going to it er if i could elp it so i went back and licked into this chap just to show er what i could do e was a big chap too well i chucked him and smashed things about and gave er a scaring and she ran up and locked erself into the spare room well thats all i says to er the next morning now you know i says what im like when im roused and i didnt ave to say anything more and youve been happy ever after eh so to speak theres nothing like putting your foot down with them if it adnt been for that afternoon i should a been tramping the roads now and shed a been grumbling at me and all her family grumbling for bringing her to povertyi know their little ways but were all right now and its a very decent little business as you say they proceed on their way meditatively women are funny creatures said brother tom they want a firm hand says coombes what a lot of these funguses there are about here remarked brother tom presently i cant see what use they are in the world mr coombes looked i dessay theyre sent for some wise purpose said mr coombes and that was as much thanks as the purple pileus ever got for maddening this absurd little man to the pitch of decisive action and so altering the whole course of his life the jilting of jane as i sit writing in my study i can hear our jane bumping her way downstairs with a brush and dustpan she used in the old days to sing hymn tunes or the british national song for the time being to these instruments but latterly she has been silent and even careful over her work time was when i prayed with fervour for such silence and my wife with sighs for such care but now they have come we are not so glad as we might have anticipated we should be indeed i would rejoice secretly though it may be unmanly weakness to admit it even to hear jane sing daisy or by the fracture of any plate but one of euphemias best green ones to learn that the period of brooding has come to an end yet how we longed to hear the last of janes young man before we heard the last of him jane was always very free with her conversation to my wife and discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety of topicsso well indeed that i sometimes left my study door openour house is a small oneto partake of it but after william came it was always william nothing but william william this and william that and when we thought william was worked out and exhausted altogether then william all over again the engagement lasted altogether three years yet how she got introduced to william and so became thus saturated with him was always a secret for my part i believe it was at the street corner where the rev barnabas baux used to hold an openair service after evensong on sundays young cupids were wont to flit like moths round the paraffin flare of that centre of high church hymnsinging i fancy she stood singing hymns there out of memory and her imagination instead of coming home to get supper and william came up beside her and said hello hello yourself she said and etiquette being satisfied they proceeded to talk together as euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting her servants talk to her she soon heard of him he is such a respectable young man maam said jane you dont know ignoring the slur cast on her acquaintance my wife inquired further about this william he is second porter at maynards the drapers said jane and gets eighteen shillingsnearly a pounda week mm and when the head porter leaves he will be head porter his relatives are quite superior people mm not labouring people at all his father was a greengrosher mm and had a chumor and he was bankrup twice and one of his sisters is in a home for the dying it will be a very good match for me mm said jane me being an orphan girl then you are engaged to him asked my wife not engaged maam but he is saving money to buy a ringhammyfist well jane when you are properly engaged to him you may ask him round here on sunday afternoons and have tea with him in the kitchen for my euphemia has a motherly conception of her duty towards her maidservants and presently the amethystine ring was being worn about the house even with ostentation and jane developed a new way of bringing in the joint so that this gage was evident the elder miss maitland was aggrieved by it and told my wife that servants ought not to wear rings but my wife looked it up in enquire within and mrs motherlys book of household management and found no prohibition so jane remained with this happiness added to her love the treasure of janes heart appeared to me to be what respectable people call a very deserving young man william maam said jane one day suddenly with illconcealed complacency as she counted out the beer bottles william maam is a teetotaller yes mm and he dont smoke smoking maam said jane as one who reads the heart do make such a dust about beside the waste of money and the smell however i suppose its necessary to some possibly it dawned on jane that she was reflecting a little severely upon euphemias comparative illfortune and she added kindly im sure the master is a hangel when his pipes alight compared to other times william was at first a rather shabby young man of the readymade black coat school of costume he had watery grey eyes and a complexion appropriate to the brother of one in a home for the dying euphemia did not fancy him very much even at the beginning his eminent respectability was vouched for by an alpaca umbrella from which he never allowed himself to be parted he goes to chapel said jane his papa maam his what jane his papa maam was church but mr maynard is a plymouth brother and william thinks it policy maam to go there too mr maynard comes and talks to him quite friendly when they aint busy about using up all the ends of string and about his soul he takes a lot of notice do mr maynard of william and the way he saves string and his soul maam presently we heard that the head porter at maynards had left and that william was head porter at twentythree shillings a week he is really kind of over the man who drives the van said jane and him married with three children and she promised in the pride of her heart to make interest for us with william to favour us so that we might get our parcels of drapery from maynards with exceptional promptitude after this promotion a rapidly increasing prosperity came upon janes young man one day we learned that mr maynard had given william a book smiles elp yourself its called said jane but it aint comic it tells you how to get on in the world and some what william read to me was lovely maam euphemia told me of this laughing and then she became suddenly grave do you know dear she said jane said one thing i did not like she had been quiet for a minute and then she suddenly remarked william is a lot above me maam aint he i dont see anything in that i said though later my eyes were to be opened one sunday afternoon about that time i was sitting at my writingdeskpossibly i was reading a good bookwhen a something went by the window i heard a startled exclamation behind me and saw euphemia with her hands clasped together and her eyes dilated george she said in an awestricken whisper did you see then we both spoke to one another at the same moment slowly and solemnly a silk hat yellow gloves a new umbrella it may be my fancy dear said euphemia but his tie was very like yours i believe jane keeps him in ties she told me a little while ago in a way that implied volumes about the rest of your costume the master do wear pretty ties maam and he echoes all your novelties the young couple passed our window again on their way to their customary walk they were arm in arm jane looked exquisitely proud happy and uncomfortable with new white cotton gloves and william in the silk hat singularly genteel that was the culmination of janes happiness when she returned mr maynard has been talking to william maam she said and he is to serve customers just like the young shop gentlemen during the next sale and if he gets on he is to be made an assistant maam at the first opportunity he has got to be as gentlemanly as he can maam and if he aint maam he says it wont be for want of trying mr maynard has took a great fancy to him he is getting on jane said my wife yes maam said jane thoughtfully he is getting on and she sighed that next sunday as i drank my tea i interrogated my wife how is this sunday different from all other sundays little woman what has happened have you altered the curtains or rearranged the furniture or where is the indefinable difference of it are you wearing your hair in a new way without warning me i clearly perceive a change in my environment and i cannot for the life of me say what it is then my wife answered in her most tragic voice george she said thatthat william has not come near the place today and jane is crying her heart out upstairs there followed a period of silence jane as i have said stopped singing about the house and began to care for our brittle possessions which struck my wife as being a very sad sign indeed the next sunday and the next jane asked to go out to walk with william and my wife who never attempts to extort confidences gave her permission and asked no questions on each occasion jane came back looking flushed and very determined at last one day she became communicative william is being led away she remarked abruptly with a catching of the breath apropos of tablecloths yes mm she is a milliner and she can play on the piano i thought said my wife that you went out with him on sunday not out with him mmafter him i walked along by the side of them and told her he was engaged to me dear me jane did you what did they do took no more notice of me than if i was dirt so i told her she should suffer for it it could not have been a very agreeable walk jane not for no parties maam i wish said jane i could play the piano maam but anyhow i dont mean to let her get him away from me shes older than him and her hair aint gold to the roots maam it was on the august bank holiday that the crisis came we do not clearly know the details of the fray but only such fragments as poor jane let fall she came home dusty excited and with her heart hot within her the milliners mother the milliner and william had made a party to the art museum at south kensington i think anyhow jane had calmly but firmly accosted them somewhere in the streets and asserted her right to what in spite of the consensus of literature she held to be her inalienable property she did i think go so far as to lay hands on him they dealt with her in a crushingly superior way they called a cab there was a scene william being pulled away into the fourwheeler by his future wife and motherinlaw from the reluctant hands of our discarded jane there were threats of giving her in charge my poor jane said my wife mincing veal as though she was mincing william its a shame of them i would think no more of him he is not worthy of you no mm said jane he is weak but its that woman has done it said jane she was never known to bring herself to pronounce that womans name or to admit her girlishness i cant think what minds some women must haveto try and get a girls young man away from her but there it only hurts to talk about it said jane thereafter our house rested from william but there was something in the manner of janes scrubbing the front doorstep or sweeping out the rooms a certain viciousness that persuaded me that the story had not yet ended please mm may i go and see a wedding tomorrow said jane one day my wife knew by instinct whose wedding do you think it is wise jane she said i would like to see the last of him said jane my dear said my wife fluttering into my room about twenty minutes after jane had started jane has been to the boothole and taken all the leftoff boots and shoes and gone off to the wedding with them in a bag surely she cannot mean jane i said is developing character let us hope for the best jane came back with a pale hard face all the boots seemed to be still in her bag at which my wife heaved a premature sigh of relief we heard her go upstairs and replace the boots with considerable emphasis quite a crowd at the wedding maam she said presently in a purely conversational style sitting in our little kitchen and scrubbing the potatoes and such a lovely day for them she proceeded to numerous other details clearly avoiding some cardinal incident it was all extremely respectable and nice maam but her father didnt wear a black coat and looked quite out of place maam mr piddingquirk who mr piddingquirkwilliam that was maamhad white gloves and a coat like a clergyman and a lovely chrysanthemum he looked so nice maam and there was red carpet down just like for gentlefolks and they say he gave the clerk four shillings maam it was a real kerridge they hadnot a fly when they came out of church there was ricethrowing and her two little sisters dropping dead flowers and someone threw a slipper and then i threw a boot threw a boot jane yes maam aimed at her but it hit him yes maam hard gev him a black eye i should think i only threw that one i hadnt the heart to try again all the little boys cheered when it hit him after an intervali am sorry the boot hit him another pause the potatoes were being scrubbed violently he always was a bit above me you know maam and he was led away the potatoes were more than finished jane rose sharply with a sigh and rapped the basin down on the table i dont care she said i dont care a rap he will find out his mistake yet it serves me right i was stuck up about him i ought not to have looked so high and i am glad things are as things are my wife was in the kitchen seeing to the higher cookery after the confession of the bootthrowing she must have watched poor jane fuming with a certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers but i imagine they softened again very quickly and then janes must have met them oh maam said jane with an astonishing change of note think of all that might have been oh maam i could have been so happy i ought to have known but i didnt know youre very kind to let me talk to you maam for its hard on me maam its harrrrd and i gather that euphemia so far forgot herself as to let jane sob out some of the fulness of her heart on a sympathetic shoulder my euphemia thank heaven has never properly grasped the importance of keeping up her position and since that fit of weeping much of the accent of bitterness has gone out of janes scrubbing and brush work indeed something passed the other day with the butcherboybut that scarcely belongs to this story however jane is young still and time and change are at work with her we all have our sorrows but i do not believe very much in the existence of sorrows that never heal in the modern vein an unsympathetic love story of course the cultivated reader has heard of aubrey vair he has published on three several occasions volumes of delicate versessome indeed border on indelicacyand his column of things literary in the climax is well known his byronic visage and an interview have appeared in the perfect lady it was aubrey vair i believe who demonstrated that the humour of dickens was worse than his sentiment and who detected a subtle bourgeois flavour in shakespeare however it is not generally known that aubrey vair has had erotic experiences as well as erotic inspirations he adopted goethe some little time since as his literary prototype and that may have had something to do with his temporary lapse from sexual integrity for it is one of the commonest things that undermine literary men giving us landslips and picturesque effects along the otherwise even cliff of their respectable life ranking next to avarice and certainly above drink this instability called genius or more fully the consciousness of genius such as aubrey vair possessed since shelley set the fashion your man of gifts has been assured that his duty to himself and his duty to his wife are incompatible and his renunciation of the philistine has been marked by such infidelity as his means and courage warranted most virtue is lack of imagination at anyrate a minor genius without his affections twisted into an inextricable muddle and who did not occasionally shed sonnets over his troubles i have never met even aubrey vair did this weeping the sonnets overnight into his blottingbook and pretending to write literary causerie when his wife came down in her bath slippers to see what kept him up she did not understand him of course he did this even before the other woman appeared so ingrained is conjugal treachery in the talented mind indeed he wrote more sonnets before the other woman came than after that event because thereafter he spent much of his leisure in cutting down the old productions retrimming them and generally altering this readymade clothing of his passion to suit her particular height and complexion aubrey vair lived in a little red villa with a lawn at the back and a view of the downs behind reigate he lived upon discreet investment eked out by literary work his wife was handsome sweet and gentle andsuch is the tender humility of good married womenshe found her lifes happiness in seeing that little aubrey vair had wellcooked variety for dinner and that their house was the neatest and brightest of all the houses they entered aubrey vair enjoyed the dinners and was proud of the house yet nevertheless he mourned because his genius dwindled moreover he grew plump and corpulence threatened him we learn in suffering what we teach in song and aubrey vair knew certainly that his soul could give no creditable crops unless his affections were harrowed and how to harrow them was the trouble for reigate is a moral neighbourhood so aubrey vairs romantic longings blew loose for a time much as a seedling creeper might planted in the midst of a flowerbed but at last in the fulness of time the other woman came to the embrace of aubrey vairs yearning hearttendrils and his romantic episode proceeded as is here faithfully written down the other woman was really a girl and aubrey vair met her first at a tennis party at redhill aubrey vair did not play tennis after the accident to miss mortons eye and because latterly it made him pant and get warmer and moister than even a poet should be and this young lady had only recently arrived in england and could not play so they gravitated into the two vacant basket chairs beside mrs baynes deaf aunt in front of the hollyhocks and were presently talking at their ease together the other womans name was unpropitiousmiss smithbut you would never have suspected it from her face and costume her parentage was promising she was an orphan her mother was a hindoo and her father an indian civil servant and aubrey vairhimself a happy mixture of kelt and teuton as indeed all literary men have to be nowadaysnaturally believed in the literary consequences of a mixture of races she was dressed in white she had finely moulded pale features great depth of expression and a cloud of delicately frise black hair over her dark eyes and she looked at aubrey vair with a look half curious and half shy that contrasted admirably with the stereotyped frankness of your common reigate girl this is a splendid lawnthe best in redhill said aubrey vair in the course of the conversation and i like it all the better because the daisies are spared he indicated the daisies with a graceful sweep of his rather elegant hand they are sweet little flowers said the lady in white and i have always associated them with england chiefly perhaps through a picture i saw over there when i was very little of children making daisy chains i promised myself that pleasure when i came home but alas i feel now rather too large for such delights i do not see why we should not be able to enjoy these simple pleasures as we grow olderwhy our growth should have in it so much forgetting for my own part has your wife got janes recipe for stuffing trout asked mrs baynes deaf aunt abruptly i really dont know said aubrey vair thats all right said mrs baynes deaf aunt it ought to please even you anything will please me said aubrey vair i care very little oh its a lovely dish said mrs baynes deaf aunt and relapsed into contemplation i was saying said aubrey vair that i think i still find my keenest pleasures in childish pastimes i have a little nephew that i see a great deal of and when we fly kites together i am sure it would be hard to tell which of us is the happier by the bye you should get at your daisy chains in that way beguile some little girl but i did i took that morton mite for a walk in the meadows and timidly broached the subject and she reproached me for suggesting frivolous pursuits it was a horrible disappointment the governess here said aubrey vair is robbing that child of its youth in a terrible way what will a life be that has no childhood at the beginning some human beings are never young he continued and they never grow up they lead absolutely colourless lives they arethey are etiolated they never love and never feel the loss of it they arefor the moment i can think of no better imagethey are human flowerpots in which no soul has been planted but a human soul properly growing must begin in a fresh childishness yes said the dark lady thoughtfully a careless childhood running wild almost that should be the beginning then we pass through the wonder and diffidence of youth to strength and action said the dark lady her dreamy eyes were fixed on the downs and her fingers tightened on her knees as she spoke ah it is a grand thing to liveas a man doesselfreliant and free and so at last said aubrey vair come to the culmination and crown of life he paused and glanced hastily at her then he dropped his voice almost to a whisperand the culmination of life is love their eyes met for a moment but she looked away at once aubrey vair felt a peculiar thrill and a catching in his breath but his emotions were too complex for analysis he had a certain sense of surprise also at the way his conversation had developed mrs baynes deaf aunt suddenly dug him in the chest with her eartrumpet and someone at tennis bawled love all did i tell you janes girls have had scarlet fever asked mrs baynes deaf aunt no said aubrey vair yes and they are peeling now said mrs baynes deaf aunt shutting her lips tightly and nodding in a slow significant manner at both of them there was a pause all three seemed lost in thought too deep for words love began aubrey vair presently in a severely philosophical tone leaning back in his chair holding his hands like a praying saints in front of him and staring at the toe of his shoelove is i believe the one true and real thing in life it rises above reason interest or explanation yet i never read of an age when it was so much forgotten as it is now never was love expected to run so much in appointed channels never was it so despised checked ordered and obstructed policemen say this way eros as a result we relieve our emotional possibilities in the hunt for gold and notoriety and after all with the best fortune in these we only hold up the gilded images of our success and are weary slaves with unsatisfied hearts in the pageant of life aubrey vair sighed and there was a pause the girl looked at him out of the mysterious darkness of her eyes she had read many books but aubrey vair was her first literary man and she took this kind of thing for geniusas girls have done before we are continued aubrey vair conscious of a favourable impressionwe are like fireworks mere dead inert things until the appointed spark comes and thenif it is not dampthe dormant soul blazes forth in all its warmth and beauty that is living i sometimes think do you know that we should be happier if we could die soon after that golden time like the ephemerides there is a decay sets in eigh said mrs baynes deaf aunt startlingly i didnt hear you i was on the point of remarking shouted aubrey vair wheeling the array of his thoughtsi was on the point of remarking that few people in redhill could match mrs mortons fine broad green others have noticed it mrs baynes deaf aunt shouted back it is since she has had in her new false teeth this interruption dislocated the conversation a little however i must thank you mr vair said the dark girl when they parted that afternoon for having given me very much to think about and from her manner aubrey vair perceived clearly he had not wasted his time it would require a subtler pen than mine to tell how from that day a passion for miss smith grew like jonahs gourd in the heart of aubrey vair he became pensive and in the prolonged absence of miss smith irritable mrs aubrey vair felt the change in him and put it down to a vitriolic saturday reviewer indisputably the saturday does at times go a little far he reread elective affinities and lent it to miss smith incredible as it may appear to members of the areopagus club where we know aubrey vair he did also beyond all question inspire a sort of passion in that sombreeyed rather clever and really very beautiful girl he talked to her a lot about love and destiny and all that bricabrac of the minor poet and they talked together about his genius he elaborately though discreetly sought her society and presented and read to her the milder of his unpublished sonnets we consider his byronic features pasty but the feminine mind has its own laws i suppose also where a girl is not a fool a literary man has an enormous advantage over anyone but a preacher in the show he can make of his hearts wares at last a day in that summer came when he met her alone possibly by chance in a quiet lane towards horley there were ample hedges on either side rich with honeysuckle vetch and mullein they conversed intimately of his poetic ambitions and then he read her those verses of his subsequently published in hobsons magazine tenderly ever since i have met thee he had written these the day before and though i think the sentiment is uncommonly trite there is a redeeming note of sincerity about the lines not conspicuous in all aubrey vairs poetry he read rather well and a swell of genuine emotion crept into his voice as he read with one white hand thrown out to point the rhythm of the lines ever my sweet for thee he concluded looking up into her face before he looked up he had been thinking chiefly of his poem and its effect straightway he forgot it her arms hung limply before her and her hands were clasped together her eyes were very tender your verses go to the heart she said softly her mobile features were capable of wonderful shades of expression he suddenly forgot his wife and his position as a minor poet as he looked at her it is possible that his classical features may themselves have undergone a certain transfiguration for one brief momentand it was always to linger in his memorydestiny lifted him out of his vain little self to a nobler level of simplicity the copy of tenderly ever fluttered from his hand considerations vanished only one thing seemed of importance i love you he said abruptly an expression of fear came into her eyes the grip of her hands upon one another tightened convulsively she became very pale then she moved her lips as if to speak bringing her face slightly nearer to his there was nothing in the world at that moment for either of them but one another they were both trembling exceedingly in a whisper she said you love me aubrey vair stood quivering and speechless looking into her eyes he had never seen such a light as he saw there before he was in a wild tumult of emotion he was dreadfully scared at what he had done he could not say another word he nodded and this has come to me she said presently in the same awestricken whisper and then oh my love my love and thereupon aubrey vair had her clasped to himself her cheek upon his shoulder and his lips to hers thus it was that aubrey vair came by the cardinal memory of his life to this day it recurs in his works a little boy clambering in the hedge some way down the lane saw this group with surprise and then with scorn and contempt recking nothing of his destiny he turned away feeling that he at least could never come to the unspeakable unmanliness of hugging girls unhappily for reigate scandal his shame for his sex was altogether too deep for words an hour after aubrey vair returned home in a hushed mood there were muffins after his own heart for his teamrs aubrey vair had had hers and there were chrysanthemums chiefly white onesflowers he lovedset out in the china bowl he was wont to praise and his wife came behind him to kiss him as he sat eating de lill jummuns she remarked kissing him under the ear then it came into the mind of aubrey vair with startling clearness while his ear was being kissed and with his mouth full of muffin that life is a singularly complex thing the summer passed at last into the harvesttime and the leaves began falling it was evening the warm sunset light still touched the downs but up the valley a blue haze was creeping one or two lamps in reigate were already alight about halfway up the slanting road that scales the downs there is a wooden seat where one may obtain a fine view of the red villas scattered below and of the succession of blue hills beyond here the girl with the shadowy face was sitting she had a book on her knees but it lay neglected she was leaning forward her chin resting upon her hand she was looking across the valley into the darkening sky with troubled eyes aubrey vair appeared through the hazelbushes and sat down beside her he held half a dozen dead leaves in his hand she did not alter her attitude well she said is it to be flight he asked aubrey vair was rather pale he had been having bad nights latterly with dreams of the continental express mrs aubrey vair possibly even in pursuithe always fancied her making the tragedy ridiculous by tearfully bringing additional pairs of socks and any such trifles he had forgotten with herall reigate and redhill in commotion he had never eloped before and he had visions of difficulties with hotel proprietors mrs aubrey vair might telegraph ahead even he had had a prophetic vision of a headline in a halfpenny evening newspaper young lady abducts a minor poet so there was a quaver in his voice as he asked is it to be flight as you will she answered still not looking at him i want you to consider particularly how this will affect you a man said aubrey vair slowly and staring hard at the leaves in his hand even gains a certain eclat in these affairs but to a woman it is ruinsocial moral this is not love said the girl in white ah my dearest think of yourself stupid she said under her breath you spoke nothing but cannot we go on meeting one another loving one another without any great scandal or misery could we not that interrupted miss smith would be unspeakably horrible this is a dreadful conversation to me life is so intricate such a web of subtle strands binds us this way and that i cannot tell what is right you must consider a man would break such strands there is no manliness said aubrey vair with a sudden glow of moral exaltation in doing wrong my love we could at least die together dearest she said good lord said aubrey vair i meanconsider my wife you have not considered her hitherto there is a flavourof cowardice of desertion about suicide said aubrey vair frankly i have the english prejudice and do not like any kind of running away miss smith smiled very faintly i see clearly now what i did not see my love and yours are very different things possibly it is a sexual difference said aubrey vair and then feeling the remark inadequate he relapsed into silence they sat for some time without a word the two lights in reigate below multiplied to a score of bright points and above one star had become visible she began laughing an almost noiseless hysterical laugh that jarred unaccountably upon aubrey vair presently she stood up they will wonder where i am she said i think i must be going he followed her to the road then this is the end he said with a curious mixture of relief and poignant regret yes this is the end she answered and turned away there straightway dropped into the soul of aubrey vair a sense of infinite loss it was an altogether new sensation she was perhaps twenty yards away when he groaned aloud with the weight of it and suddenly began running after her with his arms extended annie he criedannie i have been talking rot annie now i know i love you i cannot spare you this must not be i did not understand the weight was horrible oh stop annie he cried with a breaking voice and there were tears on his face she turned upon him suddenly and his arms fell by his side his expression changed at the sight of her pale face you do not understand she said i have said goodbye she looked at him he was evidently greatly distressed a little out of breath and he had just stopped blubbering his contemptible quality reached the pathetic she came up close to him and taking his damp byronic visage between her hands she kissed him again and again goodbye little man that i loved she said and goodbye to this folly of love then with something that may have been a laugh or a sobshe herself when she came to write it all in her novel did not know whichshe turned and hurried away again and went out of the path that aubrey vair must pursue at the crossroads aubrey vair stood where she had kissed him with a mind as inactive as his body until her white dress had disappeared then he gave an involuntary sigh a large exhaustive expiration and so awoke himself and began walking pensively dragging his feet through the dead leaves home emotions are terrible things do you like the potatoes dear asked mrs aubrey vair at dinner i cooked them myself aubrey vair descended slowly from cloudy impalpable meditations to the level of fried potatoes these potatoeshe remarked after a pause during which he was struggling with recollection yes these potatoes have exactly the tints of the dead leaves of the hazel what a fanciful poet it is said mrs aubrey vair taste them they are very nice potatoes indeed a catastrophe the little shop was not paying the realisation came insensibly winslow was not the man for definite addition and subtraction and sudden discovery he became aware of the truth in his mind gradually as though it had always been there a lot of facts had converged and led him there there was that line of cretonnesfour halfpiecesuntouched save for half a yard sold to cover a stool there were those shirtings at dbandersnatch in the broadway was selling them at dunder cost in fact surely bandersnatch might let a man live those servants caps a selling line needed replenishing and that brought back the memory of winslows sole wholesale dealers helter skelter grab why how about their account winslow stood with a big green box open on the counter before him when he thought of it his pale grey eyes grew a little rounder his pale straggling moustache twitched he had been drifting along day after day he went round to the ramshackle cashdesk in the cornerit was winslows weakness to sell his goods over the counter give his customers a duplicate bill and then dodge into the desk to receive the money as though he doubted his own honesty his lank forefinger with the prominent joints ran down the bright little calendar clacks cottons last for all time onetwothree three weeks an a day said winslow staring march only three weeks and a day it cant be tea dear said mrs winslow opening the door with the glass window and the white blind that communicated with the parlour one minute said winslow and began unlocking the desk an irritable old gentleman very hot and red about the face and in a heavy furlined cloak came in noisily mrs winslow vanished ugh said the old gentleman pockethandkerchief yes sir said winslow about what price ugh said the old gentleman poggithandkerchief quig winslow began to feel flustered he produced two boxes these sirbegan winslow sheed tin said the old gentleman clutching the stiffness of the linen wad to blow my nosenot haggit about a cotton one praps sir said winslow how much said the old gentleman over the handkerchief sevenpence sir theres nothing more i can show you no ties braces damn said the old gentleman fumbling in his ticketpocket and finally producing half a crown winslow looked round for his little metallic duplicatebook which he kept in various fixtures according to circumstances and then he caught the old gentlemans eye he went straight to the desk at once and got the change with an entire disregard of the routine of the shop winslow was always more or less excited by a customer but the open desk reminded him of his trouble it did not come back to him all at once he heard a fingernail softly tapping on the glass and looking up saw minnies eyes over the blind it seemed like retreat opening he shut and locked the desk and went into the little room to tea but he was preoccupied three weeks and a day he took unusually large bites of his bread and butter and stared hard at the little pot of jam he answered minnies conversational advances distractedly the shadow of helter skelter grab lay upon the teatable he was struggling with this new idea of failure the tangible realisation that was taking shape and substance condensing as it were out of the misty uneasiness of many days at present it was simply one concrete fact there were thirtynine pounds left in the bank and that day three weeks messrs helter skelter grab those enterprising outfitters of young men would demand their eighty pounds after tea there was a customer or solittle purchases some muslin and buckram dressprotectors tape and a pair of lisle hose then knowing that black care was lurking in the dusky corners of the shop he lit the three lamps early and set to refolding his cotton prints the most vigorous and least meditative proceeding of which he could think he could see minnies shadow in the other room as she moved about the table she was busy turning an old dress he had a walk after supper looked in at the ymca but found no one to talk to and finally went to bed minnie was already there and there too waiting for him nudging him gently until about midnight he was hopelessly awake sat black care he had had one or two nights lately in that company but this was much worse first came messrs helter skelter grab and their demand for eighty poundsan enormous sum when your original capital was only a hundred and seventy they camped as it were before him sat down and beleaguered him he clutched feebly at the circumambient darkness for expedients suppose he had a sale sold things for almost anything he tried to imagine a sale miraculously successful in some unexpected manner and mildly profitable in spite of reductions below cost then bandersnatch limited broadway joined the siege a long caterpillar of frontage a battery of shop fronts wherein things were sold at a farthing above cost how could he fight such an establishment besides what had he to sell he began to review his resources what taking line was there to bait the sale then straightway came those pieces of cretonne yellow and black with a bluishgreen flower those discredited skirtings prints without buoyancy skirmishing haberdashery some despairful fourbutton gloves by an inferior makera hopeless crew and that was his force against bandersnatch helter skelter grab and the pitiless world behind them whatever had made him think a mortal would buy such things why had he bought this and neglected that he suddenly realised the intensity of his hatred for helter skelter grabs salesman then he drove towards an agony of selfreproach he had spent too much on that cashdesk what real need was there of a desk he saw his vanity of that desk in a lurid glow of selfdiscovery and the lamps five pounds then suddenly with what was almost physical pain he remembered the rent he groaned and turned over and there dim in the darkness was the hummock of mrs winslows shoulders that set him off in another direction he became acutely sensible of minnies want of feeling here he was worried to death about business and she sleeping like a little child he regretted having married with that infinite bitterness that only comes to the human heart in the small hours of the morning that hummock of white seemed absolutely without helpfulness a burden a responsibility what fools men were to marry minnies inert repose irritated him so much that he was almost provoked to wake her up and tell her that they were ruined she would have to go back to her uncle her uncle had always been against him and as for his own future winslow was exceedingly uncertain a shop assistant who has once set up for himself finds the utmost difficulty in getting into a situation again he began to figure himself cribhunting again going from this wholesale house to that writing innumerable letters how he hated writing letters sirreferring to your advertisement in the christian world he beheld an infinite vista of discomfort and disappointment endingin a gulf he dressed yawning and went down to open the shop he felt tired before the day began as he carried the shutters in he kept asking himself what good he was doing the end was inevitable whether he bothered or not the clear daylight smote into the place and showed how old and rough and splintered was the floor how shabby the secondhand counter how hopeless the whole enterprise he had been dreaming these past six months of a bright little shop of a happy couple of a modest but comely profit flowing in he had suddenly awakened from his dream the braid that bound his decent black coatit was a little loosecaught against the catch of the shop door and was torn loose this suddenly turned his wretchedness to wrath he stood quivering for a moment then with a spiteful clutch tore the braid looser and went in to minnie here he said with infinite reproach look here you might look after a chap a bit i didnt see it was torn said minnie you never do said winslow with gross injustice until things are too late minnie looked suddenly at his face ill sew it now sid if you like lets have breakfast first said winslow and do things at their proper time he was preoccupied at breakfast and minnie watched him anxiously his only remark was to declare his egg a bad one it wasnt it was a little flavourybeing one of those at fifteen a shillingbut quite nice he pushed it away from him and then having eaten a slice of bread and butter admitted himself in the wrong by resuming the egg sid said minnie as he stood up to go into the shop again youre not well im well enough he looked at her as though he hated her then theres something else the matter you arent angry with me sid are you about that braid do tell me whats the matter you were just like this at tea yesterday and at suppertime it wasnt the braid then and im likely to be she looked interrogation oh what is the matter she said it was too good a chance to miss and he brought the evil news out with dramatic force matter he said i done my best and here we are thats the matter if i cant pay helter skelter grab eighty pounds this day three weekpause we shall be sold up sold up thats the matter min sold up oh sid began minnie he slammed the door for the moment he felt relieved of at least half his misery he began dusting boxes that did not require dusting and then reblocked a cretonne already faultlessly blocked he was in a state of grim wretchedness a martyr under the harrow of fate at anyrate it should not be said he failed for want of industry and how he had planned and contrived and worked all to this end he felt horrible doubts providence and bandersnatchsurely they were incompatible perhaps he was being tried that sent him off upon a new tack a very comforting one that martyr pose the goldinthefurnace attitude lasted all the morning at dinnerpotato piehe looked up suddenly and saw minnies face regarding him pale she looked and a little red about the eyes something caught him suddenly with a queer effect upon his throat all his thoughts seemed to wheel round into quite a new direction he pushed back his plate and stared at her blankly then he got up went round the table to hershe staring at him he dropped on his knees beside her without a word oh minnie he said and suddenly she knew it was peace and put her arms about him as he began to sob and weep he cried like a little boy slobbering on her shoulder that he was a knave to have married her and brought her to this that he hadnt the wits to be trusted with a penny that it was all his fault that he had hoped soending in a howl and she crying gently herself patting his shoulders said ssh softly to his noisy weeping and so soothed the outbreak then suddenly the crazy little bell upon the shop door began and winslow had to jump to his feet and be a man again after that scene they talked it over at tea at supper in bed at every possible interval in between solemnlyquite inconclusivelywith set faces and eyes for the most part staring in front of themand yet with a certain mutual comfort what to do i dont know was winslows main proposition minnie tried to take a cheerful view of servicewith a probable baby but she found she needed all her courage and her uncle would help her again perhaps just at the critical time it didnt do for folks to be too proud besides something might happen a favourite formula with her one hopeful line was to anticipate a sudden afflux of customers perhaps said minnie you might get together fifty they know you well enough to trust you a bit they debated that point once the possibility of helter skelter and grab giving credit was admitted it was pleasant to begin sweating the acceptable minimum for some halfhour over tea the second day after winslows discoveries they were quite cheerful again laughing even at their terrific fears even twenty pounds to go on with might be considered enough then in some mysterious way the pleasant prospect of messrs helter skelter grab tempering the wind to the shorn retailer vanishedvanished absolutely and winslow found himself again in the pit of despair he began looking about at the furniture and wondering idly what it would fetch the chiffonier was good anyhow and there were minnies old plates that her mother used to have then he began to think of desperate expedients for putting off the evil day he had heard somewhere of bills of salethere was to his ears something comfortingly substantial in the phrase then why not go to the moneylenders one cheering thing happened on thursday afternoon a little girl came in with a pattern of print and he was able to match it he had not been able to match anything out of his meagre stock before he went in and told minnie the incident is mentioned lest the reader should imagine it was uniform despair with him the next morning and the next after the discovery winslow opened shop late when one has been awake most of the night and has no hope what is the good of getting up punctually but as he went into the dark shop on friday he saw something lying on the floor something lit by the bright light that came under the illfitting doora black oblong he stooped and picked up an envelope with a deep mourning edge it was addressed to his wife clearly a death in her familyperhaps her uncle he knew the man too well to have expectations and they would have to get mourning and go to the funeral the brutal cruelty of people dying he saw it all in a flashhe always visualised his thoughts black trousers to get black crape black glovesnone in stockthe railway fares the shop closed for the day im afraid theres bad news minnie he said she was kneeling before the fireplace blowing the fire she had her housemaids gloves on and the old country sunbonnet she wore of a morning to keep the dust out of her hair she turned saw the envelope gave a gasp and pressed two bloodless lips together im afraid its uncle she said holding the letter and staring with eyes wide open into winslows face its a strange hand the postmarks hull said winslow the postmarks hull minnie opened the letter slowly drew it out hesitated turned it over saw the signature its mr speight what does he say said winslow minnie began to read oh she screamed she dropped the letter collapsed into a crouching heap her hands covering her eyes winslow snatched at it a most terrible accident has occurred he read melchiors chimney fell down yesterday evening right on the top of your uncles house and every living soul was killedyour uncle your cousin mary will and ned and the girlevery one of them and smashedyou would hardly know them im writing to you to break the news before you see it in the papersthe letter fluttered from winslows fingers he put out his hand against the mantel to steady himself all of them dead then he saw as in a vision a row of seven cottages each let at seven shillings a week a timber yard two villas and the ruinsstill marketableof the avuncular residence he tried to feel a sense of loss and could not they were sure to have been left to minnies aunt all dead xx began insensibly to work itself out in his mind but discipline was ever weak in his mental arithmetic figures kept moving from one line to another like children playing at widdy widdy way was it two hundred pounds aboutor one hundred pounds presently he picked up the letter again and finishing reading it you being the next of kin said mr speight how awful said minnie in a horrorstruck whisper and looking up at last winslow stared back at her shaking his head solemnly there were a thousand things running through his mind but none that even to his dull sense seemed appropriate as a remark it was the lords will he said at last it seems so very very terrible said minnie auntie dear auntietedpoor dear uncle it was the lords will minnie said winslow with infinite feeling a long silence yes said minnie very slowly staring thoughtfully at the crackling black paper in the grate the fire had gone out yes perhaps it was the lords will they looked gravely at one another each would have been terribly shocked at any mention of the property by the other she turned to the dark fireplace and began tearing up an old newspaper slowly whatever our losses may be the worlds work still waits for us winslow gave a deep sigh and walked in a hushed manner towards the front door as he opened it a flood of sunlight came streaming into the dark shadows of the closed shop bandersnatch helter skelter grab had vanished out of his mind like the mists before the rising sun presently he was carrying in the shutters and in the briskest way the fire in the kitchen was crackling exhilaratingly with a little saucepan walloping above it for minnie was boiling two eggsone for herself this morning as well as one for himand minnie herself was audible laying breakfast with the greatest eclat the blow was a sudden and terrible onebut it behoves us to face such things bravely in this sad unaccountable world it was quite midday before either of them mentioned the cottages the lost inheritance my uncle said the man with the glass eye was what you might call a hemisemidemi millionaire he was worth about a hundred and twenty thousand quite and he left me all his money i glanced at the shiny sleeve of his coat and my eye travelled up to the frayed collar every penny said the man with the glass eye and i caught the active pupil looking at me with a touch of offence ive never had any windfalls like that i said trying to speak enviously and propitiate him even a legacy isnt always a blessing he remarked with a sigh and with an air of philosophical resignation he put the red nose and the wiry moustache into his tankard for a space perhaps not i said he was an author you see and he wrote a lot of books indeed that was the trouble of it all he stared at me with the available eye to see if i grasped his statement then averted his face a little and produced a toothpick you see he said smacking his lips after a pause it was like this he was my unclemy maternal uncle and he hadwhat shall i call ita weakness for writing edifying literature weakness is hardly the worddownright mania is nearer the mark hed been librarian in a polytechnic and as soon as the money came to him he began to indulge his ambition its a simply extraordinary and incomprehensible thing to me here was a man of thirtyseven suddenly dropped into a perfect pile of gold and he didnt gonot a days bust on it one would think a chap would go and get himself dressed a bit decentsay a couple of dozen pairs of trousers at a west end tailors but he never did youd hardly believe it but when he died he hadnt even a gold watch it seems wrong for people like that to have money all he did was just to take a house and order in pretty nearly five tons of books and ink and paper and set to writing edifying literature as hard as ever he could write i cant understand it but he did the money came to him curiously enough through a maternal uncle of his unexpected like when he was sevenandthirty my mother it happened was his only relation in the wide wide world except some second cousins of his and i was her only son you follow all that the second cousins had one only son too but they brought him to see the old man too soon he was rather a spoilt youngster was this son of theirs and directly he set eyes on my uncle he began bawling out as hard as he could take im awayer he says take im away and so did for himself entirely it was pretty straight sailing youd think for me eh and my mother being a sensible careful woman settled the business in her own mind long before he did he was a curious little chap was my uncle as i remember him i dont wonder at the kid being scared hair just like these japanese dolls they sell black and straight and stiff all round the brim and none in the middle and below a whitish kind of face and rather large dark grey eyes moving about behind his spectacles he used to attach a great deal of importance to dress and always wore a flapping overcoat and a bigbrimmed felt hat of a most extraordinary size he looked a rummy little beggar i can tell you indoors it was as a rule a dirty red flannel dressinggown and a black skullcap he had that black skullcap made him look like the portraits of all kinds of celebrated people he was always moving about from house to house was my uncle with his chair which had belonged to savage landor and his two writingtables one of carlyles and the other of shelleys so the dealer told him and the completest portable reference library in england he said he hadand he lugged the whole caravan now to a house at down near darwins old place then to reigate near meredith then off to haslemere then back to chelsea for a bit and then up to hampstead he knew there was something wrong with his stuff but he never knew there was anything wrong with his brains it was always the air or the water or the altitude or some tommyrot like that so much depends on environment he used to say and stare at you hard as if he half suspected you were hiding a grin at him somewhere under your face so much depends on environment to a sensitive mind like mine what was his name you wouldnt know it if i told you he wrote nothing that anyone has ever readnothing no one could read it he wanted to be a great teacher he said and he didnt know what he wanted to teach any more than a child so he just blethered at large about truth and righteousness and the spirit of history and all that book after book he wrote and published at his own expense he wasnt quite right in his head you know really and to hear him go on at the criticsnot because they slated him mind youhe liked thatbut because they didnt take any notice of him at all what do the nations want he would ask holding out his brown old claw why teachingguidance they are scattered upon the hills like sheep without a shepherd there is war and rumours of war the unlaid spirit of discord abroad in the land nihilism vivisection vaccination drunkenness penury want socialistic error selfish capital do you see the clouds tedmy name you knowdo you see the clouds lowering over the land and behind it allthe mongol waits he was always very great on mongols and the spectre of socialism and suchlike things then out would come his finger at me and with his eyes all afire and his skullcap askew he would whisper and here am i what do i want nations to teach nations i say it with all modesty ted i could i would guide them nay but i will guide them to a safe haven to the land of righteousness flowing with milk and honey thats how he used to go on ramble rave about the nations and righteousness and that kind of thing kind of mincemeat of bible and blethers from fourteen up to threeandtwenty when i might have been improving my mind my mother used to wash me and brush my hair at least in the earlier years of it with a nice parting down the middle and take me once or twice a week to hear this old lunatic jabber about things he had read of in the morning papers trying to do it as much like carlyle as he could and i used to sit according to instructions and look intelligent and nice and pretend to be taking it all in afterwards i used to go of my own free will out of a regard for the legacy i was the only person that used to go and see him he wrote i believe to every man who made the slightest stir in the world sending him a copy or so of his books and inviting him to come and talk about the nations to him but half of them didnt answer and none ever came and when the girl let you inshe was an artful bit of goods that girlthere were heaps of letters on the hallseat waiting to go off addressed to prince bismark the president of the united states and suchlike people and one went up the staircase and along the cobwebby passagethe housekeeper drank like fury and his passages were always cobwebbyand found him at last with books turned down all over the room and heaps of torn paper on the floor and telegrams and newspapers littered about and empty coffeecups and halfeaten bits of toast on the desk and the mantel youd see his back humped up and his hair would be sticking out quite straight between the collar of that dressinggown thing and the edge of the skullcap a moment he would say a moment over his shoulder the mot juste you know ted le mot juste righteous thought righteously expressedaahconcatenation and now ted hed say spinning round in his study chair hows young england that was his silly name for me well that was my uncle and that was how he talkedto me at anyrate with others about he seemed a bit shy and he not only talked to me but he gave me his books books of six hundred pages or so with cockeyed headings the shrieking sisterhood the behemoth of bigotry crucibles and cullenders and so on all very strong and none of them original the very last time but one that i saw him he gave me a book he was feeling ill even then and his hand shook and he was despondent i noticed it because i was naturally on the lookout for those little symptoms my last book ted he said my last book my boy my last word to the deaf and hardened nations and im hanged if a tear didnt go rolling down his yellow old cheek he was regular crying because it was so nearly over and he hadnt only written about fiftythree books of rubbish ive sometimes thought tedhe said and stopped perhaps ive been a bit hasty and angry with this stiffnecked generation a little more sweetness perhaps and a little less blinding light ive sometimes thoughti might have swayed them but ive done my best ted and then with a burst for the first and last time in his life he owned himself a failure it showed he was really ill he seemed to think for a minute and then he spoke quietly and low as sane and sober as i am now ive been a fool ted he said ive been flapping nonsense all my life only he who readeth the heart knows whether this is anything more than vanity ted i dont but he knows he knows and if i have done foolishly and vainly in my heartin my heart just like that he spoke repeating himself and he stopped quite short and handed the book to me trembling then the old shine came back into his eye i remember it all fairly well because i repeated it and acted it to my old mother when i got home to cheer her up a bit take this book and read it he said its my last word my very last word ive left all my property to you ted and may you use it better than i have done and then he fell acoughing i remember that quite well even now and how i went home cockahoop and how he was in bed the next time i called the housekeeper was downstairs drunk and i fooled aboutas a young man willwith the girl in the passage before i went to him he was sinking fast but even then his vanity clung to him have you read it he whispered sat up all night reading it i said in his ear to cheer him its the last said i and then with a memory of some poetry or other in my head but its the bravest and best he smiled a little and tried to squeeze my hand as a woman might do and left off squeezing in the middle and lay still the bravest and the best said i again seeing it pleased him but he didnt answer i heard the girl giggle outside the door for occasionally wed had just a bit of innocent laughter you know at his ways i looked at his face and his eyes were closed and it was just as if somebody had punched in his nose on either side but he was still smiling its queer to think ofhe lay dead lay dead there an utter failure with the smile of success on his face that was the end of my uncle you can imagine me and my mother saw that he had a decent funeral then of course came the hunt for the will we began decent and respectful at first and before the day was out we were ripping chairs and smashing bureau panels and sounding walls every hour we expected those others to come in we asked the housekeeper and found shed actually witnessed a willon an ordinary halfsheet of notepaper it was written and very short she saidnot a month ago the other witness was the gardener and he bore her out word for word but im hanged if there was that or any other will to be found the way my mother talked must have made him turn in his grave at last a lawyer at reigate sprang one on us that had been made years ago during some temporary quarrel with my mother im blest if that wasnt the only will to be discovered anywhere and it left every penny he possessed to that take im away youngster of his second cousinsa chap whod never had to stand his talking not for one afternoon of his life the man with the glass eye stopped i thought you saidi began half a minute said the man with the glass eye i had to wait for the end of the story till this very morning and i was a blessed sight more interested than you are you just wait a bit too they executed the will and the other chap inherited and directly he was oneandtwenty he began to blew it how he did blew it to be sure he bet he drank he got in the papers for this and that i tell you it makes me wriggle to think of the times he had he blewed every hapenny of it before he was thirty and the last i heard of him washolloway three years ago well i naturally fell on hard times because as you see the only trade i knew was legacycadging all my plans were waiting over to begin so to speak when the old chap died ive had my ups and downs since then just now its a period of depression i tell you frankly im on the lookout for help i was hunting round my room to find something to raise a bit on for immediate necessities and the sight of all those presentation volumesno one will buy them not to wrap butter in evenwell they annoyed me id promised him not to part with them and i never kept a promise easier i let out at them with my boot and sent them shooting across the room one lifted at the kick and spun through the air and out of it flappedyou guess it was the will hed given it me himself in that very last volume of all he folded his arms on the table and looked sadly with the active eye at his empty tankard he shook his head slowly and said softly id never opened the book much more cut a page then he looked up with a bitter laugh for my sympathy fancy hiding it there eigh of all places he began to fish absently for a dead fly with his finger it just shows you the vanity of authors he said looking up at me it wasnt no trick of his hed meant perfectly fair hed really thought i was really going home to read that blessed book of his through but it shows you dont ithis eye went down to the tankard againit shows you too how we poor human beings fail to understand one another but there was no misunderstanding the eloquent thirst of his eye he accepted with illfeigned surprise he said in the usual subtle formula that he didnt mind if he did the sad story of a dramatic critic i wasyou shall hear immediately why i am not nowegbert craddock cummins the name remains i am still heaven help me dramatic critic to the fiery cross what i shall be in a little while i do not know i write in great trouble and confusion of mind i will do what i can to make myself clear in the face of terrible difficulties you must bear with me a little when a man is rapidly losing his own identity he naturally finds a difficulty in expressing himself i will make it perfectly plain in a minute when once i get my grip upon the story let me seewhere am i i wish i knew ah i have it dead self egbert craddock cummins in the past i should have disliked writing anything quite so full of i as this story must be it is full of is before and behind like the beast in revelationthe one with a head like a calf i am afraid but my tastes have changed since i became a dramatic critic and studied the mastersgrs gbs gas and the others everything has changed since then at least the story is about myselfso that there is some excuse for me and it is really not egotism because as i say since those days my identity has undergone an entire alteration that past i wasin those daysrather a nice fellow rather shytaste for grey in my clothes weedy little moustache face interesting slight stutter which i had caught in early life from a schoolfellow engaged to a very nice girl named delia fairly new she wascigarettesliked me because i was human and original considered i was like lambon the strength of the stutter i believe father an eminent authority on postage stamps she read a great deal in the british museum a perfect pairing ground for literary people that british museumyou should read george egerton and justin huntly mcarthy and gissing and the rest of them we loved in our intellectual way and shared the brightest hopes all gone now and her father liked me because i seemed honestly eager to hear about stamps she had no mother indeed i had the happiest prospects a young man could have i never went to theatres in those days my aunt charlotte before she died had told me not to then barnaby the editor of the fiery cross made mein spite of my spasmodic efforts to escapedramatic critic he is a fine healthy man barnaby with an enormous head of frizzy black hair and a convincing manner and he caught me on the staircase going to see wembly he had been dining and was more than usually buoyant hullo cummins he said the very man i want he caught me by the shoulder or the collar or something ran me up the little passage and flung me over the wastepaper basket into the armchair in his office pray be seated he said as he did so then he ran across the room and came back with some pink and yellow tickets and pushed them into my hand opera comique he said thursday friday the surrey saturday the frivolity thats all i think buti began glad youre free he said snatching some proofs off the desk and beginning to read i dont quite understand i said eigh he said at the top of his voice as though he thought i had gone and was startled at my remark do you want me to criticise these plays do something with em did you think it was a treat but i cant did you call me a fool well ive never been to a theatre in my life virgin soil but i dont know anything about it you know thats just it new view no habits no cliches in stock ours is a live paper not a bag of tricks none of your clockwork professional journalism in this office and i can rely on your integrity but ive conscientious scruples he caught me up suddenly and put me outside his door go and talk to wembly about that he said hell explain as i stood perplexed he opened the door again said i forgot this thrust a fourth ticket into my hand it was for that nightin twenty minutes time and slammed the door upon me his expression was quite calm but i caught his eye i hate arguments i decided that i would take his hint and become to my own destruction a dramatic critic i walked slowly down the passage to wembly that barnaby has a remarkably persuasive way he has made few suggestions during our very pleasant intercourse of four years that he has not ultimately won me round to adopting it may be of course that i am of a yielding disposition certainly i am too apt to take my colour from my circumstances it is indeed to my unfortunate susceptibility to vivid impressions that all my misfortunes are due i have already alluded to the slight stammer i had acquired from a schoolfellow in my youth however this is a digression i went home in a cab to dress i will not trouble the reader with my thoughts about the firstnight audience strange assembly as it isthose i reserve for my memoirsnor the humiliating story of how i got lost during the entracte in a lot of red plush passages and saw the third act from the gallery the only point upon which i wish to lay stress was the remarkable effect of the acting upon me you must remember i had lived a quiet and retired life and had never been to the theatre before and that i am extremely sensitive to vivid impressions at the risk of repetition i must insist upon these points the first effect was a profound amazement not untinctured by alarm the phenomenal unnaturalness of acting is a thing discounted in the minds of most people by early visits to the theatre they get used to the fantastic gestures the flamboyant emotions the weird mouthings melodious snortings agonising yelps lipgnawings glaring horrors and other emotional symbolism of the stage it becomes at last a mere deafanddumb language to them which they read intelligently pari passu with the hearing of the dialogue but all this was new to me the thing was called a modern comedy the people were supposed to be english and were dressed like fashionable americans of the current epoch and i fell into the natural error of supposing that the actors were trying to represent human beings i looked round on my firstnight audience with a kind of wonder discoveredas all new dramatic critics dothat it rested with me to reform the drama and after a supper choked with emotion went off to the office to write a column piebald with new paragraphs as all my stuff isit fills out so and purple with indignation barnaby was delighted but i could not sleep that night i dreamt of actorsactors glaring actors smiting their chests actors flinging out a handful of extended fingers actors smiling bitterly laughing despairingly falling hopelessly dying idiotically i got up at eleven with a slight headache read my notice in the fiery cross breakfasted and went back to my room to shave its my habit to do so then an odd thing happened i could not find my razor suddenly it occurred to me that i had not unpacked it the day before ah said i in front of the lookingglass then hullo quite involuntarily when i had thought of my portmanteau i had flung up the left arm fingers fully extended and clutched at my diaphragm with my right hand i am an acutely selfconscious man at all times the gesture struck me as absolutely novel for me i repeated it for my own satisfaction odd then rather puzzled i turned to my portmanteau after shaving my mind reverted to the acting i had seen and i entertained myself before the cheval glass with some imitations of jafferays more exaggerated gestures really one might think it a disease i saidstagewalkitis theres many a truth spoken in jest then if i remember rightly i went off to see wembly and afterwards lunched at the british museum with delia we actually spoke about our prospects in the light of my new appointment but that appointment was the beginning of my downfall from that day i necessarily became a persistent theatregoer and almost insensibly i began to change the next thing i noticed after the gesture about the razor was to catch myself bowing ineffably when i met delia and stooping in an oldfashioned courtly way over her hand directly i caught myself i straightened myself up and became very uncomfortable i remember she looked at me curiously then in the office i found myself doing nervous business fingers on teeth when barnaby asked me a question i could not very well answer then in some trifling difference with delia i clasped my hand to my brow and i pranced through my social transactions at times singularly like an actor i tried not tono one could be more keenly alive to the arrant absurdity of the histrionic bearing and i did it began to dawn on me what it all meant the acting i saw was too much for my delicatelystrung nervous system i have always i know been too amenable to the suggestions of my circumstances night after night of concentrated attention to the conventional attitudes and intonation of the english stage was gradually affecting my speech and carriage i was giving way to the infection of sympathetic imitation night after night my plastic nervous system took the print of some new amazing gesture some new emotional exaggerationand retained it a kind of theatrical veneer threatened to plate over and obliterate my private individuality altogether i saw myself in a kind of vision sitting by myself one night my new self seemed to me to glide posing and gesticulating across the room he clutched his throat he opened his fingers he opened his legs in walking like a highclass marionette he went from attitude to attitude he might have been clockwork directly after this i made an ineffectual attempt to resign my theatrical work but barnaby persisted in talking about the polywhiddle divorce all the time i was with him and i could get no opportunity of saying what i wished and then delias manner began to change towards me the ease of our intercourse vanished i felt she was learning to dislike me i grinned and capered and scowled and posed at her in a thousand ways and knewwith what a voiceless agonythat i did it all the time i tried to resign again and barnaby talked about x and z and y in the new review and gave me a strong cigar to smoke and so routed me and then i walked up the assyrian gallery in the manner of irving to meet delia and so precipitated the crisis ahdear i said with more sprightliness and emotion in my voice than had ever been in all my life before i became to my own undoing a dramatic critic she held out her hand rather coldly scrutinising my face as she did so i prepared with a newwon grace to walk by her side egbert she said standing still and thought then she looked at me i said nothing i felt what was coming i tried to be the old egbert craddock cummins of shambling gait and stammering sincerity whom she loved but i felt even as i did so that i was a new thing a thing of surging emotions and mysterious fixitylike no human being that ever lived except upon the stage egbert she said you are not yourself ah involuntarily i clutched my diaphragm and averted my head as is the way with them there she said what do you mean i said whispering in vocal italicsyou know how they do itturning on her perplexity on face right hand down left on brow i knew quite well what she meant i knew quite well the dramatic unreality of my behaviour but i struggled against it in vain what do you mean i said and in a kind of hoarse whisper i dont understand she really looked as though she disliked me what do you keep on posing for she said i dont like it you didnt use to didnt use to i said slowly repeating this twice i glared up and down the gallery with short sharp glances we are alone i said swiftly listen i poked my forefinger towards her and glared at her i am under a curse i saw her hand tighten upon her sunshade you are under some bad influence or other said delia you should give it up i never knew anyone change as you have done delia i said lapsing into the pathetic pity me augh delia pity me she eyed me critically why you keep playing the fool like this i dont know she said anyhow i really cannot go about with a man who behaves as you do you made us both ridiculous on wednesday frankly i dislike you as you are now i met you here to tell you soas its about the only place where we can be sure of being alone together delia said i with intensity knuckles of clenched hands white you dont mean i do said delia a womans lot is sad enough at the best of times but with you i clapped my hand on my brow so goodbye said delia without emotion oh delia i said not this goodbye mr cummins she said by a violent effort i controlled myself and touched her hand i tried to say some word of explanation to her she looked into my working face and winced i must do it she said hopelessly then she turned from me and began walking rapidly down the gallery heavens how the human agony cried within me i loved delia but nothing found expressioni was already too deeply crusted with my acquired self goodbaye i said at last watching her retreating figure how i hated myself for doing it after she had vanished i repeated in a dreamy way goodbaye looking hopelessly round me then with a kind of heartbroken cry i shook my clenched fists in the air staggered to the pedestal of a winged figure buried my face in my arms and made my shoulders heave something within me said ass as i did so i had the greatest difficulty in persuading the museum policeman who was attracted by my cry of agony that i was not intoxicated but merely suffering from a transient indisposition but even this great sorrow has not availed to save me from my fate i see it everyone sees it i grow more theatrical every day and no one could be more painfully aware of the pungent silliness of theatrical ways the quiet nervous but pleasing e c cummins vanishes i cannot save him i am driven like a dead leaf before the winds of march my tailor even enters into the spirit of my disorder he has a peculiar sense of what is fitting i tried to get a dull grey suit from him this spring and he foisted a brilliant blue upon me and i see he has put braid down the sides of my new dress trousers my hairdresser insists upon giving me a wave i am beginning to associate with actors i detest them but it is only in their company that i can feel i am not glaringly conspicuous their talk infects me i notice a growing tendency to dramatic brevity to dashes and pauses in my style to a punctuation of bows and attitudes barnaby has remarked it too i offended wembly by calling him dear boy yesterday i dread the end but i cannot escape from it the fact is i am being obliterated living a grey retired life all my youth i came to the theatre a delicate sketch of a man a thing of tints and faint lines their gorgeous colouring has effaced me altogether people forget how much mode of expression method of movement are a matter of contagion i have heard of stagestruck people before and thought it a figure of speech i spoke of it jestingly as a disease it is no jest it is a disease and i have got it bad deep down within me i protest against the wrong done to my personalityunavailingly for three hours or more a week i have to go and concentrate my attention on some fresh play and the suggestions of the drama strengthen their awful hold upon me my manners grow so flamboyant my passions so professional that i doubt as i said at the outset whether it is really myself that behaves in such a manner i feel merely the core to this dramatic casing that grows thicker and presses upon meme and mine i feel like king johns abbot in his cope of lead i doubt indeed whether i should not abandon the struggle altogetherleave this sad world of ordinary life for which i am so illfitted abandon the name of cummins for some professional pseudonym complete my selfeffacement anda thing of tricks and tatters of posing and pretencego upon the stage it seems my only resortto hold the mirror up to nature for in the ordinary life i will confess no one now seems to regard me as both sane and sober only upon the stage i feel convinced will people take me seriously that will be the end of it i know that will be the end of it and yet i will frankly confess all that marks off your actor from your common man i detest i am still largely of my aunt charlottes opinion that playacting is unworthy of a pureminded mans attention much more participation even now i would resign my dramatic criticism and try a rest only i cant get hold of barnaby letters of resignation he never notices he says it is against the etiquette of journalism to write to your editor and when i go to see him he gives me another big cigar and some strong whisky and soda and then something always turns up to prevent my explanation a slip under the microscope outside the laboratory windows was a waterygrey fog and within a close warmth and the yellow light of the greenshaded gas lamps that stood two to each table down its narrow length on each table stood a couple of glass jars containing the mangled vestiges of the crayfish mussels frogs and guineapigs upon which the students had been working and down the side of the room facing the windows were shelves bearing bleached dissections in spirits surmounted by a row of beautifully executed anatomical drawings in whitewood frames and overhanging a row of cubical lockers all the doors of the laboratory were panelled with blackboard and on these were the halferased diagrams of the previous days work the laboratory was empty save for the demonstrator who sat near the preparationroom door and silent save for a low continuous murmur and the clicking of the rocker microtome at which he was working but scattered about the room were traces of numerous students handbags polished boxes of instruments in one place a large drawing covered by newspaper and in another a prettily bound copy of news from nowhere a book oddly at variance with its surroundings these things had been put down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried at once to secure their seats in the adjacent lecture theatre deadened by the closed door the measured accents of the professor sounded as a featureless muttering presently faint through the closed windows came the sound of the oratory clock striking the hour of eleven the clicking of the microtome ceased and the demonstrator looked at his watch rose thrust his hands into his pockets and walked slowly down the laboratory towards the lecture theatre door he stood listening for a moment and then his eye fell on the little volume by william morris he picked it up glanced at the title smiled opened it looked at the name on the flyleaf ran the leaves through with his hand and put it down almost immediately the even murmur of the lecturer ceased there was a sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks in the lecture theatre a stirring a scraping of feet and a number of voices speaking together then a firm footfall approached the door which began to open and stood ajar as some indistinctly heard question arrested the newcomer the demonstrator turned walked slowly back past the microtome and left the laboratory by the preparationroom door as he did so first one and then several students carrying notebooks entered the laboratory from the lecture theatre and distributed themselves among the little tables or stood in a group about the doorway they were an exceptionally heterogeneous assembly for while oxford and cambridge still recoil from the blushing prospect of mixed classes the college of science anticipated america in the matter years agomixed socially too for the prestige of the college is high and its scholarships free of any age limit dredge deeper even than do those of the scotch universities the class numbered oneandtwenty but some remained in the theatre questioning the professor copying the blackboard diagrams before they were washed off or examining the special specimens he had produced to illustrate the days teaching of the nine who had come into the laboratory three were girls one of whom a little fair woman wearing spectacles and dressed in greyishgreen was peering out of the window at the fog while the other two both wholesomelooking plainfaced schoolgirls unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons they wore while dissecting of the men two went down the laboratory to their places one a pallid darkbearded man who had once been a tailor the other a pleasantfeatured ruddy young man of twenty dressed in a wellfitting brown suit young wedderburn the son of wedderburn the eye specialist the others formed a little knot near the theatre door one of these a dwarfed spectacled figure with a hunch back sat on a bent wood stool two others one a short dark youngster and the other a flaxenhaired reddishcomplexioned young man stood leaning side by side against the slate sink while the fourth stood facing them and maintained the larger share of the conversation this last person was named hill he was a sturdily built young fellow of the same age as wedderburn he had a white face dark grey eyes hair of an indeterminate colour and prominent irregular features he talked rather louder than was needful and thrust his hands deeply into his pockets his collar was frayed and blue with the starch of a careless laundress his clothes were evidently readymade and there was a patch on the side of his boot near the toe and as he talked or listened to the others he glanced now and again towards the lecture theatre door they were discussing the depressing peroration of the lecture they had just heard the last lecture it was in the introductory course in zoology from ovum to ovum is the goal of the higher vertebrata the lecturer had said in his melancholy tones and so had neatly rounded off the sketch of comparative anatomy he had been developing the spectacled hunchback had repeated it with noisy appreciation had tossed it towards the fairhaired student with an evident provocation and had started one of those vague rambling discussions on generalities so unaccountably dear to the student mind all the world over that is our goal perhapsi admit itas far as science goes said the fairhaired student rising to the challenge but there are things above science science said hill confidently is systematic knowledge ideas that dont come into the systemmust anyhowbe loose ideas he was not quite sure whether that was a clever saying or a fatuity until his hearers took it seriously the thing i cannot understand said the hunchback at large is whether hill is a materialist or not there is one thing above matter said hill promptly feeling he had a better thing this time aware too of someone in the doorway behind him and raising his voice a trifle for her benefit and that is the delusion that there is something above matter so we have your gospel at last said the fair student its all a delusion is it all our aspirations to lead something more than dogs lives all our work for anything beyond ourselves but see how inconsistent you are your socialism for instance why do you trouble about the interests of the race why do you concern yourself about the beggar in the gutter why are you bothering yourself to lend that bookhe indicated william morris by a movement of the headto everyone in the lab girl said the hunchback indistinctly and glanced guiltily over his shoulder the girl in brown with the brown eyes had come into the laboratory and stood on the other side of the table behind him with her rolledup apron in one hand looking over her shoulder listening to the discussion she did not notice the hunchback because she was glancing from hill to his interlocutor hills consciousness of her presence betrayed itself to her only in his studious ignorance of the fact but she understood that and it pleased her i see no reason said he why a man should live like a brute because he knows of nothing beyond matter and does not expect to exist a hundred years hence why shouldnt he said the fairhaired student why should he said hill what inducement has he thats the way with all you religious people its all a business of inducements cannot a man seek after righteousness for righteousness sake there was a pause the fair man answered with a kind of vocal padding butyou seeinducementwhen i said inducement to gain time and then the hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a question he was a terrible person in the debating society with his questions and they invariably took one forma demand for a definition whats your definition of righteousness said the hunchback at this stage hill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at this question but even as it was asked relief came in the person of brooks the laboratory attendant who entered by the preparationroom door carrying a number of freshly killed guineapigs by their hind legs this is the last batch of material this session said the youngster who had not previously spoken brooks advanced up the laboratory smacking down a couple of guineapigs at each table the rest of the class scenting the prey from afar came crowding in by the lecture theatre door and the discussion perished abruptly as the students who were not already in their places hurried to them to secure the choice of a specimen there was a noise of keys rattling on split rings as lockers were opened and dissecting instruments taken out hill was already standing by his table and his box of scalpels was sticking out of his pocket the girl in brown came a step towards him and leaning over his table said softly did you see that i returned your book mr hill during the whole scene she and the book had been vividly present in his consciousness but he made a clumsy pretence of looking at the book and seeing it for the first time oh yes he said taking it up i see did you like it i want to ask you some questions about itsome time certainly said hill i shall be glad he stopped awkwardly you liked it he said its a wonderful book only some things i dont understand then suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a curious braying noise it was the demonstrator he was at the blackboard ready to begin the days instruction and it was his custom to demand silence by a sound midway between the er of common intercourse and the blast of a trumpet the girl in brown slipped back to her place it was immediately in front of hills and hill forgetting her forthwith took a notebook out of the drawer of his table turned over its leaves hastily drew a stumpy pencil from his pocket and prepared to make a copious note of the coming demonstration for demonstrations and lectures are the sacred text of the college students books saving only the professors own you mayit is even expedient toignore hill was the son of a landport cobbler and had been hooked by a chance blue paper the authorities had thrown out to the landport technical college he kept himself in london on his allowance of a guinea a week and found that with proper care this also covered his clothing allowance an occasional waterproof collar that is and ink and needles and cotton and suchlike necessaries for a man about town this was his first year and his first session but the brown old man in landport had already got himself detested in many publichouses by boasting of his son the professor hill was a vigorous youngster with a serene contempt for the clergy of all denominations and a fine ambition to reconstruct the world he regarded his scholarship as a brilliant opportunity he had begun to read at seven and had read steadily whatever came in his way good or bad since then his worldly experience had been limited to the island of portsea and acquired chiefly in the wholesale boot factory in which he had worked by day after passing the seventh standard of the board school he had a considerable gift of speech as the college debating society which met amidst the crushing machines and mine models in the metallurgical theatre downstairs already recognisedrecognised by a violent battering of desks whenever he rose and he was just at that fine emotional age when life opens at the end of a narrow pass like a broad valley at ones feet full of the promise of wonderful discoveries and tremendous achievements and his own limitations save that he knew that he knew neither latin nor french were all unknown to him at first his interest had been divided pretty equally between his biological work at the college and social and theological theorising an employment which he took in deadly earnest of a night when the big museum library was not open he would sit on the bed of his room in chelsea with his coat and a muffler on and write out the lecture notes and revise his dissection memoranda until thorpe called him out by a whistlethe landlady objected to open the door to attic visitorsand then the two would go prowling about the shadowy shiny gaslit streets talking very much in the fashion of the sample just given of the god idea and righteousness and carlyle and the reorganisation of society and in the midst of it all hill arguing not only for thorpe but for the casual passerby would lose the thread of his argument glancing at some pretty painted face that looked meaningly at him as he passed science and righteousness but once or twice lately there had been signs that a third interest was creeping into his life and he had found his attention wandering from the fate of the mesoblastic somites or the probable meaning of the blastopore to the thought of the girl with the brown eyes who sat at the table before him she was a paying student she descended inconceivable social altitudes to speak to him at the thought of the education she must have had and the accomplishments she must possess the soul of hill became abject within him she had spoken to him first over a difficulty about the alisphenoid of a rabbits skull and he had found that in biology at least he had no reason for selfabasement and from that after the manner of young people starting from any startingpoint they got to generalities and while hill attacked her upon the question of socialismsome instinct told him to spare her a direct assault upon her religionshe was gathering resolution to undertake what she told herself was his aesthetic education she was a year or two older than he though the thought never occurred to him the loan of news from nowhere was the beginning of a series of cross loans upon some absurd first principle of his hill had never wasted time upon poetry and it seemed an appalling deficiency to her one day in the lunch hour when she chanced upon him alone in the little museum where the skeletons were arranged shamefully eating the bun that constituted his midday meal she retreated and returned to lend him with a slightly furtive air a volume of browning he stood sideways towards her and took the book rather clumsily because he was holding the bun in the other hand and in the retrospect his voice lacked the cheerful clearness he could have wished that occurred after the examination in comparative anatomy on the day before the college turned out its students and was carefully locked up by the officials for the christmas holidays the excitement of cramming for the first trial of strength had for a little while dominated hill to the exclusion of his other interests in the forecasts of the result in which everyone indulged he was surprised to find that no one regarded him as a possible competitor for the harvey commemoration medal of which this and the two subsequent examinations disposed it was about this time that wedderburn who so far had lived inconspicuously on the uttermost margin of hills perceptions began to take on the appearance of an obstacle by a mutual agreement the nocturnal prowlings with thorpe ceased for the three weeks before the examination and his landlady pointed out that she really could not supply so much lamp oil at the price he walked to and fro from the college with little slips of mnemonics in his hand lists of crayfish appendages rabbits skullbones and vertebrate nerves for example and became a positive nuisance to foot passengers in the opposite direction but by a natural reaction poetry and the girl with the brown eyes ruled the christmas holiday the pending results of the examination became such a secondary consideration that hill marvelled at his fathers excitement even had he wished it there was no comparative anatomy to read in landport and he was too poor to buy books but the stock of poets in the library was extensive and hills attack was magnificently sustained he saturated himself with the fluent numbers of longfellow and tennyson and fortified himself with shakespeare found a kindred soul in pope and a master in shelley and heard and fled the siren voices of eliza cook and mrs hemans but he read no more browning because he hoped for the loan of other volumes from miss haysman when he returned to london he walked from his lodgings to the college with that volume of browning in his shiny black bag and his mind teeming with the finest general propositions about poetry indeed he framed first this little speech and then that with which to grace the return the morning was an exceptionally pleasant one for london there was a clear hard frost and undeniable blue in the sky a thin haze softened every outline and warm shafts of sunlight struck between the house blocks and turned the sunny side of the street to amber and gold in the hall of the college he pulled off his glove and signed his name with fingers so stiff with cold that the characteristic dash under the signature he cultivated became a quivering line he imagined miss haysman about him everywhere he turned at the staircase and there below he saw a crowd struggling at the foot of the noticeboard this possibly was the biology list he forgot browning and miss haysman for the moment and joined the scrimmage and at last with his cheek flattened against the sleeve of the man on the step above him he read the list class i h j somers wedderburn william hill and thereafter followed a second class that is outside our present sympathies it was characteristic that he did not trouble to look for thorpe on the physics list but backed out of the struggle at once and in a curious emotional state between pride over common secondclass humanity and acute disappointment at wedderburns success went on his way upstairs at the top as he was hanging up his coat in the passage the zoological demonstrator a young man from oxford who secretly regarded him as a blatant mugger of the very worst type offered his heartiest congratulations at the laboratory door hill stopped for a second to get his breath and then entered he looked straight up the laboratory and saw all five girl students grouped in their places and wedderburn the once retiring wedderburn leaning rather gracefully against the window playing with the blind tassel and talking apparently to the five of them now hill could talk bravely enough and even overbearingly to one girl and he could have made a speech to a roomful of girls but this business of standing at ease and appreciating fencing and returning quick remarks round a group was he knew altogether beyond him coming up the staircase his feelings for wedderburn had been generous a certain admiration perhaps a willingness to shake his hand conspicuously and heartily as one who had fought but the first round but before christmas wedderburn had never gone up to that end of the room to talk in a flash hills mist of vague excitement condensed abruptly to a vivid dislike of wedderburn possibly his expression changed as he came up to his place wedderburn nodded carelessly to him and the others glanced round miss haysman looked at him and away again the faintest touch of her eyes i cant agree with you mr wedderburn she said i must congratulate you on your first class mr hill said the spectacled girl in green turning round and beaming at him its nothing said hill staring at wedderburn and miss haysman talking together and eager to hear what they talked about we poor folks in the second class dont think so said the girl in spectacles what was it wedderburn was saying something about william morris hill did not answer the girl in spectacles and the smile died out of his face he could not hear and failed to see how he could cut in confound wedderburn he sat down opened his bag hesitated whether to return the volume of browning forthwith in the sight of all and instead drew out his new notebooks for the short course in elementary botany that was now beginning and which would terminate in february as he did so a fat heavy man with a white face and pale grey eyes bindon the professor of botany who came up from kew for january and february came in by the lecture theatre door and passed rubbing his hands together and smiling in silent affability down the laboratory in the subsequent six weeks hill experienced some very rapid and curiously complex emotional developments for the most part he had wedderburn in focusa fact that miss haysman never suspected she told hill for in the comparative privacy of the museum she talked a good deal to him of socialism and browning and general propositions that she had met wedderburn at the house of some people she knew and hes inherited his cleverness for his father you know is the great eye specialist my father is a cobbler said hill quite irrelevantly and perceived the want of dignity even as he said it but the gleam of jealousy did not offend her she conceived herself the fundamental source of it he suffered bitterly from a sense of wedderburns unfairness and a realisation of his own handicap here was this wedderburn had picked up a prominent man for a father and instead of his losing so many marks on the score of that advantage it was counted to him for righteousness and while hill had to introduce himself and talk to miss haysman clumsily over mangled guineapigs in the laboratory this wedderburn in some backstairs way had access to her social altitudes and could converse in a polished argot that hill understood perhaps but felt incapable of speaking not of course that he wanted to then it seemed to hill that for wedderburn to come there day after day with cuffs unfrayed neatly tailored precisely barbered quietly perfect was in itself an illbred sneering sort of proceeding moreover it was a stealthy thing for wedderburn to behave insignificantly for a space to mock modesty to lead hill to fancy that he himself was beyond dispute the man of the year and then suddenly to dart in front of him and incontinently to swell up in this fashion in addition to these things wedderburn displayed an increasing disposition to join in any conversational grouping that included miss haysman and would venture and indeed seek occasion to pass opinions derogatory to socialism and atheism he goaded hill to incivilities by neat shallow and exceedingly effective personalities about the socialist leaders until hill hated bernard shaws graceful egotisms william morriss limited editions and luxurious wallpapers and walter cranes charmingly absurd ideal working men about as much as he hated wedderburn the dissertations in the laboratory that had been his glory in the previous term became a danger degenerated into inglorious tussles with wedderburn and hill kept to them only out of an obscure perception that his honour was involved in the debating society hill knew quite clearly that to a thunderous accompaniment of banged desks he could have pulverised wedderburn only wedderburn never attended the debating society to be pulverised becausenauseous affectationhe dined late you must not imagine that these things presented themselves in quite such a crude form to hills perception hill was a born generaliser wedderburn to him was not so much an individual obstacle as a type the salient angle of a class the economic theories that after infinite ferment had shaped themselves in hills mind became abruptly concrete at the contact the world became full of easymannered graceful gracefullydressed conversationally dexterous finally shallow wedderburns bishops wedderburn wedderburn mps professors wedderburn wedderburn landlords all with fingerbowl shibboleths and epigrammatic cities of refuge from a sturdy debater and everyone illclothed or illdressed from the cobbler to the cabrunner was a man and a brother a fellowsufferer to hills imagination so that he became as it were a champion of the fallen and oppressed albeit to outward seeming only a selfassertive illmannered young man and an unsuccessful champion at that again and again a skirmish over the afternoon tea that the girl students had inaugurated left hill with flushed cheeks and a tattered temper and the debating society noticed a new quality of sarcastic bitterness in his speeches you will understand now how it was necessary if only in the interests of humanity that hill should demolish wedderburn in the forthcoming examination and outshine him in the eyes of miss haysman and you will perceive too how miss haysman fell into some common feminine misconceptions the hillwedderburn quarrel for in his unostentatious way wedderburn reciprocated hills illveiled rivalry became a tribute to her indefinable charm she was the queen of beauty in a tournament of scalpels and stumpy pencils to her confidential friends secret annoyance it even troubled her conscience for she was a good girl and painfully aware from ruskin and contemporary fiction how entirely mens activities are determined by womens attitudes and if hill never by any chance mentioned the topic of love to her she only credited him with the finer modesty for that omission so the time came on for the second examination and hills increasing pallor confirmed the general rumour that he was working hard in the aerated bread shop near south kensington station you would see him breaking his bun and sipping his milk with his eyes intent upon a paper of closely written notes in his bedroom there were propositions about buds and stems round his lookingglass a diagram to catch his eye if soap should chance to spare it above his washing basin he missed several meetings of the debating society but he found the chance encounters with miss haysman in the spacious ways of the adjacent art museum or in the little museum at the top of the college or in the college corridors more frequent and very restful in particular they used to meet in a little gallery full of wroughtiron chests and gates near the art library and there hill used to talk under the gentle stimulus of her flattering attention of browning and his personal ambitions a characteristic she found remarkable in him was his freedom from avarice he contemplated quite calmly the prospect of living all his life on an income below a hundred pounds a year but he was determined to be famous to make recognisably in his own proper person the world a better place to live in he took bradlaugh and john burns for his leaders and models poor even impecunious great men but miss haysman thought that such lives were deficient on the aesthetic side by which though she did not know it she meant good wallpaper and upholstery pretty books tasteful clothes concerts and meals nicely cooked and respectfully served at last came the day of the second examination and the professor of botany a fussy conscientious man rearranged all the tables in a long narrow laboratory to prevent copying and put his demonstrator on a chair on a table where he felt he said like a hindoo god to see all the cheating and stuck a notice outside the door door closed for no earthly reason that any human being could discover and all the morning from ten till one the quill of wedderburn shrieked defiance at hills and the quills of the others chased their leaders in a tireless pack and so also it was in the afternoon wedderburn was a little quieter than usual and hills face was hot all day and his overcoat bulged with textbooks and notebooks against the last moments revision and the next day in the morning and in the afternoon was the practical examination when sections had to be cut and slides identified in the morning hill was depressed because he knew he had cut a thick section and in the afternoon came the mysterious slip it was just the kind of thing that the botanical professor was always doing like the income tax it offered a premium to the cheat it was a preparation under the microscope a little glass slip held in its place on the stage of the instrument by light steel clips and the inscription set forth that the slip was not to be moved each student was to go in turn to it sketch it write in his book of answers what he considered it to be and return to his place now to move such a slip is a thing one can do by a chance movement of the finger and in a fraction of a second the professors reason for decreeing that the slip should not be moved depended on the fact that the object he wanted identified was characteristic of a certain tree stem in the position in which it was placed it was a difficult thing to recognise but once the slip was moved so as to bring other parts of the preparation into view its nature was obvious enough hill came to this flushed from a contest with staining reagents sat down on the little stool before the microscope turned the mirror to get the best light and then out of sheer habit shifted the slip at once he remembered the prohibition and with an almost continuous motion of his hands moved it back and sat paralysed with astonishment at his action then slowly he turned his head the professor was out of the room the demonstrator sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum reading the q jour mi sci the rest of the examinees were busy and with their backs to him should he own up to the accident now he knew quite clearly what the thing was it was a lenticel a characteristic preparation from the eldertree his eyes roved over his intent fellowstudents and wedderburn suddenly glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer expression in his eyes the mental excitement that had kept hill at an abnormal pitch of vigour these two days gave way to a curious nervous tension his book of answers was beside him he did not write down what the thing was but with one eye at the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it his mind was full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics that had suddenly been sprung upon him should he identify it or should he leave this question unanswered in that case wedderburn would probably come out first in the second result how could he tell now whether he might not have identified the thing without shifting it it was possible that wedderburn had failed to recognise it of course suppose wedderburn too had shifted the slide he looked up at the clock there were fifteen minutes in which to make up his mind he gathered up his book of answers and the coloured pencils he used in illustrating his replies and walked back to his seat he read through his manuscript and then sat thinking and gnawing his knuckle it would look queer now if he owned up he must beat wedderburn he forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen john burns and bradlaugh besides he reflected the glimpse of the rest of the slip he had had was after all quite accidental forced upon him by chance a kind of providential revelation rather than an unfair advantage it was not nearly so dishonest to avail himself of that as it was of broome who believed in the efficacy of prayer to pray daily for a firstclass five minutes more said the demonstrator folding up his paper and becoming observant hill watched the clock hands until two minutes remained then he opened the book of answers and with hot ears and an affectation of ease gave his drawing of the lenticel its name when the second pass list appeared the previous positions of wedderburn and hill were reversed and the spectacled girl in green who knew the demonstrator in private life where he was practically human said that in the result of the two examinations taken together hill had the advantage of a mark to out of a possible everyone admired hill in a way though the suspicion of mugging clung to him but hill was to find congratulations and miss haysmans enhanced opinion of him and even the decided decline in the crest of wedderburn tainted by an unhappy memory he felt a remarkable access of energy at first and the note of a democracy marching to triumph returned to his debating society speeches he worked at his comparative anatomy with tremendous zeal and effect and he went on with his aesthetic education but through it all a vivid little picture was continually coming before his minds eyeof a sneakish person manipulating a slide no human being had witnessed the act and he was cocksure that no higher power existed to see it but for all that it worried him memories are not dead things but alive they dwindle in disuse but they harden and develop in all sorts of queer ways if they are being continually fretted curiously enough though at the time he perceived clearly that the shifting was accidental as the days wore on his memory became confused about it until at last he was not surealthough he assured himself that he was surewhether the movement had been absolutely involuntary then it is possible that hills dietary was conducive to morbid conscientiousness a breakfast frequently eaten in a hurry a midday bun and at such hours after five as chanced to be convenient such meat as his means determined usually in a chophouse in a back street off the brompton road occasionally he treated himself to threepenny or ninepenny classics and they usually represented a suppression of potatoes or chops it is indisputable that outbreaks of selfabasement and emotional revival have a distinct relation to periods of scarcity but apart from this influence on the feelings there was in hill a distinct aversion to falsity that the blasphemous landport cobbler had inculcated by strap and tongue from his earliest years of one fact about professed atheists i am convinced they may bethey usually arefools void of subtlety revilers of holy institutions brutal speakers and mischievous knaves but they lie with difficulty if it were not so if they had the faintest grasp of the idea of compromise they would simply be liberal churchmen and moreover this memory poisoned his regard for miss haysman for she now so evidently preferred him to wedderburn that he felt sure he cared for her and began reciprocating her attentions by timid marks of personal regard at one time he even bought a bunch of violets carried it about in his pocket and produced it with a stumbling explanation withered and dead in the gallery of old iron it poisoned too the denunciation of capitalist dishonesty that had been one of his lifes pleasures and lastly it poisoned his triumph in wedderburn previously he had been wedderburns superior in his own eyes and had raged simply at a want of recognition now he began to fret at the darker suspicion of positive inferiority he fancied he found justifications for his position in browning but they vanished on analysis at lastmoved curiously enough by exactly the same motive forces that had resulted in his dishonestyhe went to professor bindon and made a clean breast of the whole affair as hill was a paid student professor bindon did not ask him to sit down and he stood before the professors desk as he made his confession its a curious story said professor bindon slowly realising how the thing reflected on himself and then letting his anger risea most remarkable story i cant understand your doing it and i cant understand this avowal youre a type of studentcambridge men would never dreami suppose i ought to have thoughtwhy did you cheat i didntcheat said hill but you have just been telling me you did i thought i explained either you cheated or you did not cheat i said my motion was involuntary i am not a metaphysician i am a servant of scienceof fact you were told not to move the slip you did move the slip if that is not cheating if i was a cheat said hill with the note of hysterics in his voice should i come here and tell you your repentance of course does you credit said professor bindon but it does not alter the original facts no sir said hill giving in in utter selfabasement even now you cause an enormous amount of trouble the examination list will have to be revised i suppose so sir suppose so of course it must be revised and i dont see how i can conscientiously pass you not pass me said hill fail me its the rule in all examinations or where should we be what else did you expect you dont want to shirk the consequences of your own acts i thought perhapssaid hill and then fail me i thought as i told you you would simply deduct the marks given for that slip impossible said bindon besides it would still leave you above wedderburn deduct only the markspreposterous the departmental regulations distinctly say but its my own admission sir the regulations say nothing whatever of the manner in which the matter comes to light they simply provide it will ruin me if i fail this examination they wont renew my scholarship you should have thought of that before but sir consider all my circumstances i cannot consider anything professors in this college are machines the regulations will not even let us recommend our students for appointments i am a machine and you have worked me i have to do its very hard sir possibly it is if i am to be failed this examination i might as well go home at once that is as you think proper bindons voice softened a little he perceived he had been unjust and provided he did not contradict himself he was disposed to amelioration as a private person he said i think this confession of yours goes far to mitigate your offence but you have set the machinery in motion and now it must take its course ii am really sorry you gave way a wave of emotion prevented hill from answering suddenly very vividly he saw the heavilylined face of the old landport cobbler his father good god what a fool i have been he said hotly and abruptly i hope said bindon that it will be a lesson to you but curiously enough they were not thinking of quite the same indiscretion there was a pause i would like a day to think sir and then i will let you knowabout going home i mean said hill moving towards the door the next day hills place was vacant the spectacled girl in green was as usual first with the news wedderburn and miss haysman were talking of a performance of the meistersingers when she came up to them have you heard she said heard what there was cheating in the examination cheating said wedderburn with his face suddenly hot how that slide moved never it was that slide that we werent to move nonsense said wedderburn why how could they find out who do they say it was mr hill hill mr hill notsurely not the immaculate hill said wedderburn recovering i dont believe it said miss haysman how do you know i didnt said the girl in spectacles but i know it now for a fact mr hill went and confessed to professor bindon himself by jove said wedderburn hill of all people but i am always inclined to distrust these philanthropistsonprinciple are you quite sure said miss haysman with a catch in her breath quite its dreadful isnt it but you know what can you expect his father is a cobbler then miss haysman astonished the girl in spectacles i dont care i will not believe it she said flushing darkly under her warmtinted skin i will not believe it until he has told me so himselfface to face i would scarcely believe it then and abruptly she turned her back on the girl in spectacles and walked to her own place its true all the same said the girl in spectacles peering and smiling at wedderburn but wedderburn did not answer her she was indeed one of those people who seem destined to make unanswered remarks the end printed by morrison and gibb limited edinburgh transcribers note words in italics

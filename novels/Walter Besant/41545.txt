standing at the open window of my room in that palace to which fortune leads her choicest favouritesthe college or prison as some call it of the kings bench i was at the time a prisoner for debt with very little chance of ever getting out more fortunate than most of the tenants i was able to carry on my business for instance all that morning i had been engaged in composing a songit was afterwards sung with great applause at the dog and duck and on the bed reposed the instrument with which i earned the greater part of my daily breadmy faithful violin my window was on the groundfloor in the great building which was then new for the prison had been transferred from the other side two or three years before this building contains more than two hundred rooms and twice that number of prisoners many of the groundfloor rooms have been converted into shopschandlers grocers mercers hosiers you may buy anything in these shops except a good book i believe that there is no demand in the prison for such an article of commerce songbooks and jestbooks and cards on the other hand are constantly called for it was a day of bright sunshine outside on the grand paradeotherwise called king streetwhich is a broad footway flagged strolled up and down in the sunshine an endless procession they paced the pavement from east to west they turned and paced it again from west to east among them were a few neatly attired but by far the greater number men and women were slatternly untidy and slipshod their walknobody was ever seen to walk briskly in the prisonwas the characteristic scuffle easily acquired in this place the men were mostly in slippers some were in morning gowns very few had their heads dressed some wore oldfashioned wigs rusty and uncombed some the poorer set were barefooted and in such rags and tatters as would not be tolerated in the open streets the faces of the people as they passed were various there was the humorous face of the prisoner who takes fortune philosophically there was the face always resentful the face resigned the face vacuous the face of suffering the face sodden with drink the face vicious the face soured the face saddened the face like the clothes ragged and ruined everything but the face happythat cannot be found in the kings bench prison children ran about playing and shouting there were at this time many hundreds of children in the prison against the walltis surely twentyfive feet higher than is neededthe racquet and fives players carried on their games at the lower end of the parade some played the game called bumble puppy here and there tables were set where men drank and smoked pipes of tobacco and played cards though as yet it was only afternoon the people talked as they went along but not with animation now and then one laughed but the merriment of the college is very near the fount of tears it hath a sound hysterical some conversed eagerly with visitors by their eagerness you knew that they were newcomers what did they talk about the means of release yet so few do get out for the first three or four years of imprisonment when visitors call prisoners talk of nothing else after that time visitors cease to call and there is no more talk of release a man in the kings bench is speedily forgotten he becomes dead to the world dead and forgotten surely there is no more pitiless and relentless enemy than a creditor yet in church every sunday he asks and expects that mercy from his god which he himself refuses to his debtor on no other day in the year could the prison look more cheerful yet as i stood at the window there fell upon me such sadness as belongs only to the prison it is a longing to be free a yearning inconceivable for the green fields and the trees such moods are common in the prison i have seen men turn aside from their friends in the midst of a song in the height of the revelry and slink away from the company with drooping head and bowed shoulders it is indeed difficult not to feel this sadness from time to time i was young i had few friends for a reason that i shall tell you presently for aught that i could see there was nothing before me but a lifelong imprisonment nobody i say can understand the strength and the misery of this yearning for libertyfor airthat sometimes seizes the prisoner and rends him and will not let him go yet i was better off than many because though i could in no way pay the money for which i was imprisoned i was not without the means of a livelihood i had as i have said my fiddle so long as a man has a fiddle and can play it he need never want to play the fiddle is the safest of all trades because the fiddler is always wanted if a company is drinking they will call for the fiddler to lift up their hearts if there are girls with them they will call for the fiddler to make them dance if they would sing they want the fiddler to lead them off if they are sitting in the coffeeroom they call for the fiddler to enliven them grave discourse or gay young people or old they are always ready to call for the fiddler and to pay him for his trouble so that by dint of playing every evening i did very well and could afford to dine at the two shilling ordinary and to drink every day a glass or two of ale and to pay my brotherinlaw for the maintenance of alice and the boy among the prisoners were two who always walked together talked together and drank together the others looked askance upon them one who was called the captain wore a scarlet coat which might have been newer and a goldlaced hat which had once been finer he was a tall burly fellow with the kind of comeliness one may see in a horserider at a fair or a fellow who performs on a tightrope a man who carries by storm the hearts of village girls and leaves them all forlorn he swaggered as he walked and looked about him with an insolence which made me among others desirous of tweaking him by the nose if only to see whether his courage was equal to his swagger i have always since regretted that i lost the opportunity duels are not allowed in the college and perhaps in an encounter with the simpler weapons provided by nature i might have been equal to the captain his manners at the ordinary were noisy and if he had ever really carried his majestys commission as to which there were whispers it must have been in some branch of the service where the urbanities of life were not required further it was known that he was always ready to play with anyone and at any time of the day it was reported that he always won this reputation coupled with his insolent carriage caused him to be shunned and suspected his companion commonly known as the bishop was dressed in the habit of a clergyman he wore a frayed silk cassock and a gown with dirty bands his wig which wanted dressing was canonical his age might have been forty or more his cheeks were red with strong drink his neck was puffed his figure was square and corpulent his voice was thick he looked in a word what he was not a servant of the lord at all but of the devil at this period i had little experience or knowledge of the people who live by rogueries and cheats nor had i any suspicion when a stranger appeared that he was not always what he pretended to be at the same time one could not believe that the hulking fellow in a scarlet coat had ever received a commission from the king nor could anyone believe that the hoglike creature who wore a cassock and a gown and a clergymans wig was really in holy orders among the collegians there was one who pleased me though his raiment was shabby to the last degree by his manners which were singularly gentle and his language which was that of a scholar he scorned the vulgar idiom and turned with disgust from the universal verb or participle with which annoyance or dislike or disappointment was commonly expressed and he spoke in measured terms as one who pronounces a judgment i heard afterward that he wrote critical papers on new books in the gentlemens magazine but i never read new books unless they are books of music when he could afford to dine at the ordinary which was about twice a week he sat beside me and instructed me by his discourse he was a scholar of some college at cambridge and a poet i sometimes think that it may be a loss to the world not to know its poets there are without doubt some who regard poetry as musicians regard music now if the work of a purcell or a handel were to fall dead and unnoticed it would be a most dreadful loss to music and a discouragement for composers so that there may be poets of whom the world hears nothing whose verse is neglected and lost though it might be of great service to other poets or to mankind if verse can in any way help the world however one day when these two prisoners the captain and the bishop had left the ordinary and were brawling in the tavern hard by for a bottle of port my friend the scholar turned to me sir he said the prison ought to be purged of such residents they should be sent to the borough compter or the clink here we have gentlemen here we have tradesmen here we have craftsmen we are a little world here are the temptations of the world he looked across the table where some of the ladies of the prison were dining the tavern invites us the gaming table offers us a seat we have our virtues and our vices but we have not our crimes and as a rule we cannot boast among our company the presence of the robber the forger or the common rogue we have in a word no representative as a rule of the gallows the pillory the stocks the carttail and the whipping post i waited for he did not like to be interrupted sir he went on i am a poet as a child of the musesi thought they were unmarried but did not venture on that objectionit is my business to observe the crooked ways of men and the artful ways of women even though one may at times be misunderstoodas has once or twice happened one may be the temporary companion of a rogue without having to pick a pocket i remember the faces of those two meni saw them in a thieves kitchen whither i was taken in disguise by one who knows them the captain sir is a highwayman common and notorious he is now fiveandtwenty and his rope is certainly long out so that he is kept from tyburn tree by some special favour by mr merridew the thieftaker the other whom they call the bishop is a rogue of some education he may last longer because he is useful and it would be hard to replace him he was once usher in a suburban school at marybone and now writes lying threatening or begging letters for the crew he also concocts villainies he threatens to set the house on fire or to bring the householder into bankruptcy or in some way to injure him fatally unless he sends a certain sum of money he tells gentlemen who have been robbed that they can have their papers back but not their money by sending a reward his villainy is without any pity or mercy or consideration the captain is a mere robbera barabbas the bishop is worse he has the soul of a fiend in the body of a man but why i said are they here they are in hiding a sham debt has been sworn against them from their dejected faces and from what i have overheard them saying i learn that a true debt has been added for another detainer but indeed i know not their affairs except that they came here in order to be out of the way and that something has happened to disconcert their plans as honest men we must agree in hoping that their plans which are certainly dishonest may succeed in order that their presence among us may cease and so we may breathe again the air of the prison is sometimes close and even musty but we do not desire it to be mistaken for the reek of st giless or the stench of turnmill street however i troubled myself but little as to these two men and i know not how long they were in the prison had i known what they would do for me in the future i think i should have brained them there and then this afternoon the pair were talking together with none of the listlessness that belongs to the kings bench might as well get out at oncei heard fragmentsquite certain that he wont appearno more dangerif she will consent and so onphrases to which i paid no attention suddenly however they stopped short and both cried out together shes come herself i looked out of my window and beheld a vision the lady was alone she stood at the end of the parade and looked about her for a moment with hesitation because the scene was new to her she saw the ragged rout playing racquets drinking at their tables leaning against the pumps at each of which there is always a little gathering or strolling by in couples on the parade then she advanced slowly looking to the right and to the left she smiled upon the people as they made way for her no queen could have smiled more graciously yet not a queen for there was no majesty in her face which was inspired by and filled with venus herself the goddess of charm and grace and loveliness never was a face more lovely and more full of love as for her dress all that i can tell you is that i have never known at any time how this lady was dressed she carried i remember an ivoryhandled fan in her hand she seemed to beholders to be dressed in nothing but lace ribbons and embroidery her figure was neither tall nor short reasonably tall for a woman ought not to be six feet high so tall as not to be insignificant not so tall as to dwarf the men slender in shape and quick and active in her movements her eyes which i observed later changed every moment with her change of mood one would say that they even changed their colour which was a dark blue they could be limpid or melting or fiery or pitiful in a word they could express every fleeting emotion her features changed as much as her eyes one never knew how she would look until one had watched and known her in all her moods and passions her lips were always ready to smile her face was continually lit up by the sunshine of joy and happiness but this woman wanted joy as some women want love her voice was gentle and musical i speak of her as i knew her afterwards not as she appeared on this the first day of meeting i make no excuse for thus speaking of her because in truth the very thought of jennyi have too soon revealed her namemakes me long to speak of what she was out of the fulness of my heart i write about her and as you will understand presently i could love without wronging my wife and as much as a woman can be loved and yet in innocence and with the full approval of the other woman whom also i loved at the sight of this apparition the whole prison stared with open mouth who was this angel and for what fortunate prisoner did she come at the very outset when i could not dream that she would ever condescend to speak to me she seemed the most lovely woman i had ever beheld some women might possess more regular features no one sure was ever so lovely so bewitching so attractive it is as if i could go on forever repeating my words the women of the prisonpoor tattered drabs for the most partlooked after her with sighsoh to dress like that some of them murmured impudently to each other who gave her all that finery most of them only looked and longed and sighed oh to be dressed like her to look like her to smile like her to put on that embroidered petticoatthat frockthose glovesto carry that fanto possess that figurethat manner well to gaze upon the inaccessible may sometimes do us good the sight of this wonder made those poor women appear a little less slatternly they straightened themselves they tidied their hair the more ragged crept away as for the men they followed her with looks of wonder and of worship for my own part i understood for the first time that power of beauty which compels admiration worship and service when i am greatly moved by music that memory comes back to me in looking upon such a woman one asks not what has been her history what she is what she has done one accepts the heavenly cheerfulness of her smile the heavenly wisdom seated on her brow the heavenly innocence in her eyes the purity which cannot be smirched or soiled by contact with things of the world i continued to gaze upon her while she walked up the parade to my surprise this angelic creature stopped before the pair of worthiesthe bully in scarlet and the drunken divine what could she want with them they received her with profound salutations the bishop sweeping the ground with his greasy hat madam he said we did not expect that you would yourself condescend to such a place i wished to see you she replied curtly i seemed to remember her voice may we conduct you madam said the captain to the coffeeroom for more private conversation perhaps a glass or said the bishop for she refused the proffered glass with an impatient gesturecould such a woman drink with such men she refused i say with a shake of her head for greater privacy to our own room it is on the third floor no one will venture to intrude upon usand there is a chair i fear that in the neglect which is too common in this place the beds are not yet made he looked as if the morning wash had not been performed either what do i care sir she asked interrupting again whether your beds are made or not i shall stay here she withdrew a little nearer to the wall beside my window so as to be outside the throng of people we can talk i suppose undisturbed and unheard though so far as i care all the world may hear bless me the people look as if a woman was a rare object here she looked round at the crowd yet there are women among your prisoners well then what have you got to say speak up and quickly because i like not the place or the company you wrote to me now go on i wrote to you said the bishop asking a great favour i know that we have no reason to expect that or any other favour from you you have no reason but go on we came here you knowhis voice dropped to a whisper but i heard what he saidin order to escape a great danger i heard you told me the danger was in connection with a gentleman and a postchaise a villainous charge said the captain villainous indeed repeated the bishop i could prove to you in five minutes and quite to your satisfaction that the captain was engaged at newmarket on the day in question while i myself was conducting a funeral in place of the vicar in a country village thirty miles on the other side of london an excellent defence truly but i will leave that to the lawyers well the debt was sworn against you by mr merridew i pricked up my ears at this because this was the name of the man as you shall hear who swore a debt which never existed against me could there be two merridews that was mere form unfortunately other detainers are out against both of us i know not how they found out that we were here mr merridew refuses to take us out he says that he thinks our time is up and so he knows that we are safe he shuddered afterwards i understood why there is the danger that we may have to remain here till he takes us out as for our present necessities he drew out his purse and dangled ita long purse with a very few guineas in it you see madam to stay here where there is no opportunity of honest work is ruin and starvation honest work why if you go out you will only continue in your old courses they are at least honest and even pious courses said the bishop with a snuffle as you please but there is still the former danger no the gentleman understands now that he only mislaid his pocketbook mr merridew found it for him the drafts and notes were still in it fortunately the gentleman has redeemed the papers from mr merridew he will not take any further steps if i take you out she spoke to the captain you know what will happen better stay here in safety what else can a man do asked the captain you might go abroad go to americaanything is better than the road and the certain end she made a gesture with her hand easy to be understood if a man has a long rope what else can he expect and you she turned to the bishop what will become of you will you stay in london where you are known in every street i have had thoughts of trying ireland a good many things can be done in ireland the irish are a confiding people do what you please it is nothing to me what becomes of both of you i interfere becauseoh you know why and as for your futurethat i suppose will be arranged for you by your friend mr merridew putting together what my friend the starveling poet told me and what they themselves confessed they were clearly a pair of rogues and she knew it and she was going to help them charity covereth a multitude of sins yet surely it was remarkable that a gentlewoman should come to the kings bench prison in order to send two abominable criminals back to their old haunts any place is better than this said the captain much better than this echoed the bishop give me freedom while i live a short life but he was certainly past fortyand a free life for me how much is it then altogether for the pair of you the detainers not counting mr merridews amount to close upon seventy pounds then there are the costs and the fees oh she cried impatiently what is the good of setting you loose again why should i let loose upon the world such a pair of rogues why not keep you here so that you may at least die in your beds the bishop looked astonished at this outburst why he said slowly we are what we are that is true what else can we be nobody knows better than you what we are come now nobody i say knows better than you what we are yes she replied with a sigh i do know very welli wish i did not and nobody knows better than you he went on roughly that what we are we must continue to be what else can we do say no more she replied sighing again there is no help i suppose when i made up my mind to come here at all i made up my mind that i would take you outboth of you yetit is like walking over a grave i shivershe did actually shiver as she spoke i feel as if i were contriving a mischief for myself these signs always come truea mischief she repeated to myselfindeed she was as you shall afterwards learn as for the world you will certainly do as much mischief to that as you can as we can madam said the bishop with a smilehe was easy now that he knew her mind before he was inclined to be rough the world on the other hand is always trying to do a mischief to me but mischief to you madam cried the captain that mirror of gallantry a soldier is all gratitude and honour mischief to you impossible and a divine added the other with a grin is all truth fidelity and honesty his profession compels these qualities quite so well gentlemen of honour and truth you shall once more return to the scenes and the pursuits and the companions that you love moll and doll and poll impatiently await you at the black jack and i see only a short mile from that hospitable place another refugecall it the black jugwhere before long you will pass a few pleasant days of rest and repose before going forth in a glorious procession if we go forth in that procession murmured the bishop with lowering face there are other people quite as deserving who will sit there beside us go she said i have talked enough and more than enough with such as you go they bowed again and walked away now i heard this interview half of which i did not understand with amazement unspeakable the lady was going to release this pair of villainswhy out of the boundless charity of her benevolent heart she looked after the precious pair standing for a moment with her hand shading her eyes the light went out of her face a cloud fell upon it she sighed again her lips parted she caught her breath ah poor lady thy face was made for joy and not for sorrow what thought what memory was it that compelled the cloud and chased away the sunshine she turned her headshe moved away i was still standing at my window looking on as she passed she started and stopped short her face expressing the greatest possible bewilderment and amazement it is not she criedsurelynoyet the resemblance is so great sir i thoughtat firstyou were a gentleman of my acquaintance you are so much like him that i venture to ask you who you are a prison bird madam nothing more yes but you are so like that gentleman may i ask your name my name at your service madam is halliday my friends call me will halliday will halliday are you a brotherbut that cannot beof mr matthew halliday i am his first cousin matthew hallidays first cousin but he is rich does he allow you to remain in this place it is not only by the sufferance of my cousin matthew but by his desire that i am here by his desire yesi know something of your cousin sir it is by his desire i discover new virtues in your cousin the more i learn of him i suppose then that you are not on friendly terms with your cousin i am not indeed quite the contrary can you tell me the reason why because he desires my death therefore he has caused my arresthe and an attorney of the devilnamed probus oh probus i have heard of that probus sir i would willingly hear more concerning this matter and your cousin and mr probus if you will kindly tell me i must now go but with your permission i will come again it is not i assure you out of idle curiosity that i ask these questions the next day or the day after the captain and the bishop walked out of the prison when they were gone open talk went round the prison perhaps started by the poet that one was a highwayman and the other a sharperperhaps a forgera contriver of plots and plans to deceive the unwary i marvelled that they should have received the bounty of so fine a lady for indeed whether highwayman or sharper or honest men they were as foulmouthed a pair of reprobatesdrunken withalas we had in the prison and then i remembered suddenly the reason why i recognised the ladys voice and why there was something in the face also that i seemed to know i had been but once in my life to the theatre on that occasion there was an actress whose beauty and vivacity gave me the greatest possible delight one may perhaps forget the face of an actress playing a part because she alters her face with every part but her voice when it is a sweet voice one remembers the lady was that actress i remembered herand her name she was miss jenny wilmot of drury lane part i how i got into the kings bench chapter i i am turned out into the world in the year or thereabouts everybody knew the name of sir peter halliday merchant the house in which sir peter was the senior partner possessed a fleet of west indiamen which traded between the port of london and jamaica barbadoes and the other english islands taking out all kinds of stuffs weapons implements clothing wine silks gloves and everything else that the planters could want and returning laden with sugar in bags mahogany arrack and whatever else the islands produce our wharf was that which stands next to the tower stairs the countinghouse was on the wharf there the clerks worked daily from seven in the morning till eight at night as a boy it was my delight to go on board the ships when they arrived there i ran up and down the companion into the dark lower deck where the midshipmen messed and slept among the flying cockroaches which buzzed into their faces and the rats which ran over them and the creatures which infest a ship in hot latitudes and come on board with the gunnybags such as centipedes scorpions and great spiders and i would stand and watch the barges when they came alongside to receive the cargo then with a yeoheaveoh and a chantey of the sailors mostly meaningless yet pleasant to hear they tossed the bags of sugar into the barge as if they were loaves of bread and the casks of rum as if they had been pint pots or i would talk to the sailors and hear stories of maroon niggers and how the planters engaged the sailors to go ashore in search of these fierce runaways and shoot them down in the mountains and stories of shark and barra coota of hurricanos and islands where men had been put ashore to starve and die miserably of pirates of whom there have always been plenty in the caribbean sea since that ocean was first discovered strange things these sailors brought home with them coral pink and white preserved flyingfish creatures put in spirits carved cocoanuts everybody knows the treasures of the sailor arrived in port this i say was my delight as a boy thus i learned to think of things outside the narrow bounds of the countinghouse and the city walls marvellous it is to mark how while the pool is crammed with ships from all parts of the world the londoner will go on in ignorance of any world beyond the walls of the city or the boundaries of his parish therefore i say it was better for me than the study of molls geography to converse with these sailors and to listen to their adventures another thing they taught me it is well known that on board every ship there is one at least who can play the fiddle a ship without a fiddler is robbed of the sailors chief joy now ever since i remember anything i was always making music out of the whistle pipe the twanging jews harp the comb and paper but above all out of the fiddle i had a fiddle i found it in a garret of our house in great college street i made a sailor tell me how to practise upon it whenever one of our ships put into port i made friends with the fiddler on board and got more lessons so that i was under instruction in this rude manner for the greater part of the year and before i was twelve i could play anything readily and after the fashion rough and vigorous of the sailors with whom strength of arm reckons before style i belong to a family which for nearly two hundred years have been puritans some of them were preachers and divines under cromwell their descendants retained the strict observance of opinions which forbid mirth and merriment even among young people although they conformed to the church of england they held that music of all kinds the theatre dancing at the assembly reading poetry and tales and wearing of fine dress must be sinful because they call attention from the salvation of the soul the only thing about which the sinner ought to think why it was worse to let the mind dwell upon music than upon moneygetting i know not nor have i ever been able to discover it will be understood however that ours was a strict household it consisted of my father myself a housekeeper and five servants all godly we had long prayers morning and evening we attended the church of st stephen walbrook instead of our own parish church of st michael paternoster because there was no organ in it we went to church on sundays twice and twice in the week to the gift lectures of which there were two my father was a stern man of great dignity when he was lord mayor he was greatly feared by malefactors he was of a full habit of body with a large red face his neck swollen into rolls like all merchants in his position he drank a great deal of port of which he possessed a noble cellar i have often wondered why it was never discovered that i practised the fiddle in the garret to be sure it was only at those hours when my father was on the wharf when i had the door shut and the windows open the maids below thought i suppose that the sounds came from the next house however that may be i was never found out now this fondness for music produced an unfortunate result the sight of a book of arithmetic always filled me with a disgust unspeakable the sight of a book of accounts inspired me with loathing the daily aspect of my fathers clerks all sitting in a row on high stools and all driving the quill with heads bending over the paper made me even as a child believe theirs to be the most miserable lot that fortune has to offer her most unhappy victims i still think so give me any other kind of life make me a bargee a coalheaver a sailor before the mast an apothecary a schoolmasters usher in all these occupations there will be something to redeem the position but for the accountant there is nothing all day long he sits within four walls his pay is miserable his food is insufficient when in the evening he crawls away there is only time left for him to take a little supper and go to his miserable bed imagine therefore my loathing when i understood that at the age of sixteen i was to take my place among these unfortunates and to work my way towards the succession which awaited methe partnership held by my fatherby becoming a clerk like unto these others whom i had always pitied and generally despised from that lot however there was no escape all the partners from father to son had so worked their way the reason of this rule was that the young men in this way acquired a knowledge of the business in all its branches before they were called upon to direct its enterprise and to enter upon new ventures i daresay that it was a good practical rule but in my own case i found it almost intolerable i was unlike the clerks in one or two respects i had good food and plenty of it and i received no salary i had a cousin named matthew son of my fathers younger brother and partner alderman paul halliday citizen and lorimer who had not yet passed the chair matthew though his father was the younger son was three or four years older than myself he therefore mounted the clerks stool so many years before me he was a young man with a face and carriage serious and thoughtful to all appearance beyond his years he had a trick of dropping his eyes while he talked his face was always pale and his hands were always clammy other young men who had been at school with him spoke of him with disrespect and even hatred but i know not why in a word matthew had no friends among those of his own age on the other hand the older people thought highly of him my father spoke with praise of his capacity for business and of his industry and of the grasp of detail which he had already begun to show as for me i could never like my cousin and what happened when i was about eighteen years of age gave me no reason to like him any better i had been in the countinghouse for two years each day feeling like a week for duration but the question of rebellion had so far never occurred to me i could no longer practise in the garret while my father was in the countinghouse but i could get away on pretence of business to the ships and snatch an hour below with the fiddler and in the evening sometimes when my father was feasting with a city company or engaged in other business out of the house i could take boat across the river and run over to st georges fields there to have half an hour of play with a musician of whom you shall learn more called tom shirley after the manner of youths i never asked myself how long this would go on without discovery or what would be the result when it was discovered yet i knew very well that no quaker could be more decided as to the sinfulness of music than my father and my uncle had not the great and reverend samuel halliday d d preached before the protector on the subject of the snares spread by the devil to catch souls by means of music now one afternoon in the month of june when the countinghouse is more than commonly terrible a message came to me that my father wished to speak with me i found him in his own room his brother paul sitting with him his face showed astonishment and anger that of his brother presented some appearance of sorrowreal or not i cannot say my uncle paul was as often happens in a family a reduced copy of his elder brother he was not so tall not so portly not so red in the face not so swollen in the neck yet he was tall and portly and red and swollen he was shaking his head as i entered saying dear dear dear and in our family tooin our family son william said my father i have heard a serious thing what is that sir if i may ask i learn from my brother who had it from matthew from matthew my uncle interposed solemnly that you lose no opportunity of getting away from your desk to go on board our ships in the pool there to play the fiddle with the common sailorsto play the fiddlethe common fiddlelike a fellow with a bearwith the common sailors i hear that our captains and officers are all acquainted with this unworthy pastime of yours i hear further that you have formed an acquaintance with a certain fellow named shirley now a prisoner in the rules of the kings bench one who makes a sinful living by playing wanton music for lewd and wicked persons at what are called pleasure gardens whither resort such company as no godly youth should meet and i hear that you spend such time as you can spare under the tuition of this person he stopped my uncle took up the word all these things i am assured by my son matthew to be the case i have informed matthew that in my opinion it was right and even necessary that they should be brought before the notice of my brother i wait thy reply will said my father it is all quite true sir quite true i felt a little sinking of the heart because of the disappointment and sadness in his voice but he went on what is the meaning of it for my own part i see no good purpose to be gained by music on the other hand my grandfather the rev dr samuel halliday hath clearly shown in his book of godly discourses that music especially music with dancing is the surest bait by which the devil draws souls to destruction people i am aware will have music at our companys feasts music attends at the lord mayors banquets there is music at the lord mayors show there is music at many churches there is an organ but what hast thou to do with music will it is thy part to become a merchant bent on serious work and outside the countinghouse to become a magistrate what hast thou to do with music he spoke being much moved kindlybecausealas he loved his son sir i said it is all most true there is nothing that i love so much as music consider he went on there is no place for music in the life before thee all day long learning thy work in the countinghouse some time to succeed me in this room how is it possible for a young man who stoops to make music on catgut with a bow to become a serious merchant respected in the city indeed sir i do not know how will it be possible for you to advance the interests of the housenay to maintain the interests of the house when it is known that you are a common scraper in a crowd like a onelegged man with a jack in the green now i might even then have submitted and promised and given up my fiddle and so pleased my father and remained in his favour but this was one of those moments which are turningpoints in a mans life besides i was young i was inexperienced and an overwhelming disgust fell upon my soul as i thought of the countinghouse and the ledgers and the long hours in the dingy place driving the quill all day long so without understanding what the words meant i broke out impatiently sir i said with submission i would ask your leave to give up my place in this office give up give up he cried growing purple in the face does the boy know what he means illustration give up he cried growing purple in the face give up cried my uncle is the boy mad give up his prospects in this housethisthe soundest house in the whole city nephew will wouldst starve i will make a living by music make a livinga livingmake a livingby music what to play the fiddle in a tavern to play in the gallery while your father is feasting below nay sir but there are other ways hark ye will let this stop back to thy desk lest something happen my father spoke with sudden sternness nay sir but i am serious ayay serious then i am serious too understand then that i own no son who disgraces the city family to which he belongs by becoming a common musician choose take thy fiddle and give up methis officethine inheritancethine inheritance mind or lay down the fiddle and go back to thy desk there sir i am i hope serious enough he was my father was a masterful man at all times he was perfectly serious now the sons of masterful men are themselves often masterful i walked out of the countinghouse without a word i am conscious that there is no excuse for a disobedient son i ought to have accepted any orders that my father might choose to lay upon me but to part with my fiddle to give up music to abandon that sweet refreshment of the soul oh it was too much moreover no one knew better than myself the inveterate hatred with which my father and the whole of my family regarded what they called the tinkling cymbal which they thought leads souls to destruction had i seen any gleam of hope that there would be a relenting i would have waited but there was none therefore i cast obedience to the winds and left the room without a word had i known what awaited me the misfortunes which were to drag me down almost unto a shameful death in consequence of this act of disobedience i might have given way but perhaps not for in all my troubles there were two things which cheered and sustained me i enjoyed at all times so you shall learn the support of love and the refreshment of music had my father known of these misfortunes would he have given way i doubt it misfortune does not destroy the soul but music does so he would say and so think and conduct his relations with his own accordingly i walked out of the countinghouse at the door i met face to face the informer my cousin matthew who had caused all this trouble he was attired as becomes a responsible merchant though as yet only a clerk or factor with the other clerks he wore a brown coat with silver buttons white silk stockings silver buckles in his shoes silver braid upon his hat a silver chain with seals hanging from his fob with white lace ruffles and neckerchief as fine as those of his father or of any merchant on change he met me i say face to face and for the first time within my knowledge he grinned when he met me for he knew what had been said to me he grinned with a look of such devilish glee that i understood for the first time how much he hated me why i had never crossed him because i was the son of the senior partner whose place i was to take and of the richer man of the two partners his would be the subordinate position with a third only of the profits therefore my cousin hated me he i say noted my discomfiture now at that moment i was in no mood for mockery something in my face stopped his grinning he became suddenly grave he dropped his eyes he made as if he would pass by me and so into the house villain and maker of mischief i cried then i fell upon him i had but fists he had a stick i was eighteen he was fiveandtwenty he was heavier and taller well there is little credit because he was a poor fighter in two minutes i had his stick from him and in three more i had broken it over his head and his shoulders however had his wind and his strength equalled his hatred and desire that the stick should be broken over my shoulders instead of his the result would have been different you shall payyou shall payyou shall pay for this he gasped lying prostrate i kicked him out of my way as if he had been a dog and strode off my cheek aflame my hand trembling and my limbs stiffened with the joy of the fight and the victory come what might i had whipped my cousin like the cur he was a thing to remember i have never repented that act of justice the memory of it brought many woes upon me but i have never repented or regretted it and certain i am that to the day of his miserable death matthew never forgot it nor did i chapter ii a city of refuge my last recollection of the countinghouse is that of matthew lying in a heap and shaking his fist at me while behind my uncles face looks out amazed upon the spectacle from one door and the clerks in a crowd contemplate the discomfiture of mr matthew from another door then i strode off i say like a gamecock after a victory head erect cheek flushed legs straight ha i am always glad that i drubbed my cousin just once a righteous drubbing it was too if ever there was one it hanselled the new life after it there was no return possible and so homethough the house in college street could no longer be called a homei now had no homei was turned into the street however i went upstairs to my own roommine no longer i looked about in the cupboard i found a black box in which i placed everything i could call my own my music my linen and my clothes on the wall hung the miniature of my mother happily she had not lived to see the banishment of her son this i put in my pocket the fiddle i laid in its case then with my cudgel under my arm and carrying the fiddle in one hand and the box on my shoulder i descended the stairsnow i must confess with a sinking heartand found myself in the street i had in my purse five guineasthe son of a most solid and substantial merchant and i had no more than five guineas in the world what could i do to earn a living since i had been for two years in my fathers counting house i might be supposed to know something of affairs alas i knew nothing one art or accomplishment i possessed and one alone i could play the fiddle now that i had to depend upon my playing for a livelihood i began to ask whether i could play well enough at all events i could play vigorously but the die was cast i had made my choice and must make the best of it besides had i not drubbed my cousin matthew and that as they say with authority you have heard how my father accused me of intimacy with a person named shirley a resident in the rules of the kings bench that charge i could not deny indeed the person named shirley by all his friends called tom had been of late my master every spare hour that i had was spent with him practising with him and learning from him he taught a finer style than i could learn from the sailors when i went into the countinghouse i had no longer any spare hours except in the evening and then my master was engaged earning his bread in an orchestra still i could manage to visit him sometimes on sunday evenings when my father was generally occupied with friends who loved likewise to limit and make as narrow as they could the mercies of the almighty at this moment i could think of no one except tom shirley who could help me or advise me i therefore lugged my box and my violin to the three cranes and took boat across to moldstrand stairs from which it is an easy half mile by pleasant lanes love lane and gravel lane past loomans pond to st georges fields where tom shirley lived it was a little after noon when i arrived at the house it was one of three or four cottages standing in a row every cottage consisting of four or five rooms they are pleasing retreats each having a small front garden where lilacs laburnums hollyhock sunflowers tulips and other flowers and bushes grow in front of the garden flows languidly one of the many little streams which cross the fields and meadows of southwark a rustic bridge with a single handrail crosses the stream the region of st georges fields as is very well known has a reputation which in fact is well deserved the fact that it is covered with shallow ponds some of which are little better than mere laystalls causes it to be frequented on sundays and on summer evenings by the rude and barbarous people who come here to hunt ducks with dogsa horrid sport some of them even throw cats into the water and set their dogs at them the same people come here for prize fights but they say that the combatants have an understanding beforehand how long the fight is to last some come for quarterstaff practice some come for hockey or for football outside the fields there are many taverns and places of entertainment on the fields there is at least one the notorious dog and duck every evening except in winter these places are full of people who come to dance and drink and sing every kind of wickedness is openly practised here if a man would gamble here are the companions for him and here are rooms where he can play if he would meet women as deboshed as himself here they may be found it is unfortunate for southwark and its environs that everything seems to have conspired to give it a bad name first of all it was formerly outside the jurisdiction of the city so that all the villains and criminals of the city got across the water and found refuge here next the government of the place was not single but divided by the manors so that a rogue might pass from one manor into another and so escape thirdly the sanctuary of southwark tolerated after the reformation at st mary overies grew to accommodate as great a number as that in westminster where they only lately pulled down the gray old tower which looked like a donjon keep rather than the walls enclosing two chapels i know not whether there was such a tower at montagu close but within my recollection no officer of the law dared to arrest any sanctuary man in mint streettheir latest refuge nor did any person with property to lose venture into that street for first his hat would be snatched off then his wig then his silk handkerchief then he would be hustled thrown and kicked when he was permitted to get up it was without watch chain buckles shoes lace cravat ruffles fortunate if he was allowed to escape with no more injury the presence of these villains was alone enough to give the place a bad name but there was more prisons there must be but in southwark there were too many the kings bench prison the marshalsea the borough compter the clink the white lyon so many prisons in a place so thinly populated produced a saddening effect and besides there are those who live in the rules which are themselves a kind of prison but without walls in another part along the embankment the show folk used to live those who act those who write plays and songs those who dance and tumble mimes musicians buffoons and those who live by the bearbaiting badgerbaiting bullbaiting and cockthrowing which are the favourite sports of southwark these considerations are quite sufficient to account for the evil reputation which clings to the borough they do not however prevent it from being a place of great resort for those who come up from kent and surrey on business and they do not for obvious reasons prevent the place from being inhabited by the prisoners of the rules when i arrived tom shirley was playing on the harpsichord his head in a white nightcap his wig hanging on a nail as he played not looking at notes or keys his face was turned upwards and his eyes were rapt as one watched him his face changed in expression with the various emotions of the music no man certainly was more moved by music than tom shirley no man also could more certainly bring out the very soul of the music the inner thought of the composer he played as if he loved playing which indeed he did whether it was a country dance or a minuet or an oratorio or a roman catholic mass it was a fine face delicate in outline full of expression the face of a musician it lacked the firmness which belongs to one who fights he was no gladiator in the arena a face full of sweetness everyone loved tom shirley as for age he was then about fiveandtwenty i stood at the open door and looked in listening for at such moments he heard nothing there was another door opposite leading to the kitchen where his wife was engaged in some domestic work presently she lifted her head and saw me father she cried here is will he heard that brought his fingers down with a splendid chord and sprang to his feet will in the morning what is the meaningwhy this box i have come away tom i have left the countinghouse for good what you have deserted the money bags you have run away for the sake of music my father has turned me out and you have chosen music goodgoodwhat could you have done better wife hear this will has run away he will play the fiddle in the orchestra rather than become an alderman and lord mayor i want to live as you live tom if you can boy you shall now it was the humour of tom to speak of his own cottage and his manner of life as if both were stately and sumptuous very few he added proudly can live as we live he looked proudly round the room was about ten feet square low painted drab without ornament without curtains there were a few shelves a cupboard a small table two brass candlesticks a brass pair of snuffers four rushbottomed chairs and nothing more tom was dressed in an old brown coat with patches on the elbows the wrists frayed and the buttons gone to be sure he had a finer coat for the orchestra his stockings were of worsted darned in many places a woollen wrapper was round his neck everything proclaimed poverty of course people who are not poor do not live in the rules few he repeated are privileged to live as i live i have never known whether this was a craze or his humour to pretend that he fared sumptuously was lodged like a prince and received the wages of an ambassador perhaps it was mere habit a way of presenting his own life to himself by exaggeration and pretence which he had somehow grown to believe you ask will a thing difficult of achievement but graduallylittle by little one would never expect it all at once ay there we talk sense but first why hath sir peter behaved with this apparent harshness i would not judge him hastily therefore i say apparent because he found out at lastmy cousin matthew told himthat i came here to play the fiddle so he gave me the choiceeither to give up the countinghouse or to give up the music and i gave up the countinghouse tom i dont care what happens so that i get out of the countinghouse goodladgood and i drubbed my cousini paid him with his own stick and here i am he took my hand his honest face beaming with satisfaction at that moment his sister alice came back from making some purchases in the borough high street alice my dear he said will has been turned out of house and home by his fathersent out into the streets without a penny alice burst into tears when i think of alice at that moment my heart swells my eyes grow humid she was then fifteen an age when the child and the woman meet and one knows not whether to expect the one or the other when alice burst into tears it was the child who wept she had always loved me with a childish unconsciousness she was only beginning to understand that i was not her brother you know how sweet a flower will sometimes spring up in the most unlovely spot well in this place close to the dog and duck with prodigals and rakes and painted jezebels always before her eyes this child grew up sweet and tender and white as the snow i have never known any girl upon whom the continual sightnot to be concealedof gross vice produced so little effect it was as if the eyes of her soul involuntarily closed to the meaning of such things such sweetness such purity was stamped upon her face then as afterwards never surely was there a face that showed so plain and clear to read that the thoughts behind it were not earthly or common it is the soul of music that possesses her said her brother once she has imbibed that soul day by day will tis a saintly child sometimes i fear that she may be carried away like elijah well when i saw those tears i was seized with a kind of joyful compassion and so to speak happy shame to think that those tears were for me i drew her gently and kissed her why nothing better could have happened to him thou little simpleton said her brother warming up with his subject he became eloquent he shall do much betterfar betterthan if he had stayed in the countinghouse he shall not be weighed down with a load of riches he shall have to work in order to livebelieve me will art must be forced by necessity where there is no necessity there is no art when riches creep in art becomes a toy because he must work therefore he will be stimulated to do great things he shall never set his mind upon growing rich he shall remain poor not too poor said his wife gently indeed her poor shabby dress showed what she meant peace woman he shall be poor i say happy lad he shall be poor he shall never have money in a stocking and he shall never want any he shall live like the sparrows from day to day fed by the bounty of the lord who loveth the dog and duck said his wife the husband frowned to sum up will thy lot shall be the happiest that the world can give what he lifted his hand and his eyes grew brighter for the musician the curse of labour is remitted for him there is no longing after riches for him there is no flattery of great men for him there is no meanness for him there are no base arts for him there is no wriggling for him there are no back stairs for him there is no patronin a word will the musician is the only free man in the world in the rules you mean my dear this was his wifes correction will said alice shall you really become like tom truly alice if i can wife said tom will shall stay with us he can sleep in the garret we must find a mattress somewhere nay but i must pay my footing see tom i have five guineas i showed this mine of wealth he took one and gave it to his wife aha he laughed buy him a mattress and a blanket wife and this evening we will have a bowl of punch will we shall fare like kings and like the great ones of the earth chapter iii a way to live i think that tom shirley was the most goodnatured man in the whole world the most ready to do anything he could for anybody always cheerful always happy partly i suppose because he looked at everything through spectacles of imagination he joined however to his passion for music another which belonged to a lower world namely for punch yet he was not an intemperate man he showed neither purple cheeks nor a double chin nor a swollen neck nor a rubicund noseall of which were common sights on change and in the streets of london the reason why he displayed no signs of drink was that he could seldom gratify his passion for punch by reason of his poverty and that in eating which i believe also contributes its share to the puffing out of the neck and the painting of the nose such as may be seen on change he was always as moderate although he thought every meal a feast as became his slender means i do not know how he got into the kings bench but the thing is so easy that one marvels that so many are able to keep out they put him in and kept him there for a time when he was enabled to obtain the privilege of the rules he was as he boasted always rich because he thought he was rich his wife took from him every week the whole of his wages otherwise he would have given them away at one oclock alice laid the cloth and we had dinner tom lifted the knife and fork and held it over the cold boiled beef as if fearing to mar that delicate dish by a false or clumsy cut is there anything he said more delicious to the palate than cold boiled beef it must be cut delicately and with judgmentwith judgment will he proceeded to exercise judgment there was a cabbage on the table this delicacy he said is actually grown for usfor usin the gardens of lambeth marsh remark the crispness of it there is a solid heart for you there is colour there is flavour all this was i remember the grossest flattery oat cake he said breaking a piece some i believe prefer wheaten bread they do wrong viands must not be judged by their cost but by their fitness to others on the table and by the season remember will that with cold boiled beef oat cake is your only eating he poured out some beer into a glass and held it up to the light watch the sparkles hear the humming strong october thisit was the most common small beerhave a care will have a care and so on turning the simple meal into a banquet his wife and sister received these extravagances without a smile they were used to them the latter at least believed that they were the simple truth the poor girl was innocently proud of her humble home this cottage on st georges fields within the rules after dinner we talked as the subject was music tom was somewhat carried away yet there was method in his madness i said lad that there would be no art if there were no necessity tis poverty alone makes men became musicians and painters and poets where can you find a rich man who was ever a great artist i am no scholar but i have asked scholars this question and they agree with me that riches destroy art hardly may dives become even a connoisseur he may become a general or a statesman we do not take all from him we leave him somethingbut not the bestthat we keep for ourselveswe keep art for ourselves as for a rich merchant becoming a musician or a painterit is impossible one laughs at the very thought well that danger is gone tom so far as i am concerned ay the reason i take it is that art demands the whole mannot a bit of himthe whole manall his soul all his mind all his thoughts all his strength you must give all that to music will i ask nothing better another reason is that art raises a mans thoughts to a higher level than is wanted for trade it is impossible for a mans mind to soar or to sink according as he thinks of art or trade you will remember will for your comfort that your mind is raised above the city i will remember well then let us think about what is best to be done he pondered a little then he smiled put pride in pocket will now what would you like to write great music a worthy ambition it has been my own it is not for me to say whether my songs which are nightly sung at the dog and duck are great music or not posterity may judge lad it is one thing to love musicand another thing to compose it the latter is given to few the former to many it may be that it is thy gift but i know not meantime we must live i will do anything againput pride in pocket now there is a riverside tavern at bermondsey it is a place for sailors and their dolls a rough and coarse place it is at best they want a fiddler from six oclock till ten every night and later on saturdays i heard with a shiver to play in a sailors tavern it was my fathers prophecy everybody must begin will what a sailors tavern is no place for the son of a city merchant is it but that is gone thou art now nobodys sona child of the gutterthe world is thine oysterfree of all tieswith neither brother nor cousin to say thee nay lucky dog what we must make a beginningi sayin the gutter his eyes twinkled and smiled and i perceived without being told that he meant to try my courage so with a rueful countenance and a foolish sense of shame i consented to sit in the corner of a sanded room in a common riverside tavern and to make music for common sailors and their sweethearts why said tom that is well and now my lad remember there are no better judges of a fiddle than sailors they love their music as they love their lobscouse hot and strong and plenty give it elbow will they are not for fine fingering or for cunning strokes and effectsthey like the tune to come out full and sweet they will be thy masters as for dancing they like the time to be marked as well as the tune find out how they like to take it there is one time for a hornpipe and another for a jig as for pay i will not complete the sentence for such as myself there must be a day of small things but one need not confess how very small these things have been thus it was that i found an asyluma city of refugein the rules of the kings bench when i was turned out by my own people and in this way i became that despised and contemptible object a common fiddler i played not without glory every night to a company as low as could be found at least i thought so at the time later on it is true i found a lower company still and i dare say there are assemblies of men and women even lower my fellows at least were honest and their companions were at least what the men had made them we settled the business that very afternoon walking over to bermondsey the landlord said i was very young but if i could fiddle he did not mind that only it must be remembered in the pay so i was engaged to begin the next day in the evening i went with tom to the dog and duck where he played first fiddle in the orchestra and sat in the musicians gallery about this place more anon at twelve oclock the music ceased and i walked home with tom i remember it was then a fine clear night in september the wind blew chill across the marshes it had come up with the flow of the river the moon was riding high a strange elation possessed my soul for my independence was beginning four guineas in my pocket and a place with so many shillings a week to live upon nothing to do but to work at music and to live with the besthearted man in the whole world we got home alice had gone to bed toms wife was sitting up for us the bowl of punch was ready for us not too big a bowl because toms weakness where punch was concerned was well known he drank my success in one glass my future operas and oratorios in the second my joyful independence in the third and my happy release in the fourth that finished the bowl and we went to bed chapter iv love and music you need not be told how i lived for the next three or four years i took what came pride remained in pocket i fiddled a weddingparty to church and home again i fiddled the company of fellowship porters through the streets when they held their yearly feast i fiddled for sailors i fiddled at beanfeasts i fiddled for free masons i fiddled in taverns i fiddled here and there and everywhere quite unconcerned even though i was playing in the gallery of a city companys hall and actually saw my cousin sitting in state among the guests at the feast below and knew that he saw me and rejoiced at the sight in his ignorance of the consolations of music nothing in those days came amiss to me one who makes music for his livelihood has no cause to be ashamed of playing for anyone it does not seem an occupation such as one would choose to spend the evening in a chair stuck in a corner out of the way in a stinking room for rough fellows to dance hornpipes the work does not lift up the soul to the level which tom shirley claimed for the musician but this was only the potboiling work i had the mornings to myself when i could practise and attempt composition besides at eighteen the present if one belongs to a calling which has a career is of very little importance the real life lies before the boy lives for the future i was going in those days to be a great composer like handel i was going to write oratorios such as his majestic where majesty was wanted tender where love and pity must be depicted devout where piety was called for i would write besides in my ambition such things as were written by purcell and arne anthems for the church songs and madrigals and rounds and catches such as those with which my patron tom shirley delighted his world the profession of music is one which can only be followed by those who have the gift of music that is the definition of any art it can only be followed by those who have the gift of that art in any other calling a man may serve after a fashion who hath not been called thereto many men for example are divines who have neither learning nor eloquence northe lord help themreligion many lawyers have no love for the law many merchants hate the countinghouse but in music no one can serve at all unless he is a musician born he who without the gift would try to enter the profession breaks down at the outset seeing that he cannot even learn to play an instrument with feeling ease or judgment nay there are distinct ranks of music to each of which one is raised by nature as much as by study thus you have at the bottom the rank and file namely those who can play a single instrument next those who can compose and make simple music for songs in which all that is wanted is a tuneful and spirited air with an ordinary accompaniment next those who understand harmony and can make music of a higher character such as anthems partsongs and so forth lastly you have the composer in whose brains lies the knowledge of every instrument in the orchestra he is the king of musicians from him come the noble oratorios which delight our age and lift our souls to heaven from him come the masses which are sungi have the scores of severalin cathedrals of roman catholic countries it is not for an englishman to admire aught that belongs to rome but we must at least concede to the roman catholic the possession of noble music this then was my ambition for four years i continued to live with my friend tom shirley i held no communication with my father or any of my own people none of them made any attempt at reconciliation i believe they were honestly ashamed of me the new friends i made were good and faithful musical people have ever kindly hearts and are loyal to each other they do not backbite there is no room for envy where one man plays the fiddle and another the cornet we are all a company of brothers the time came when it was no longer necessary for me to play at taverns for the sailors when i was no longer compelled to attend weddings i obtained one after the other two posts neither of which was a very great thing but both together made it possible for me to live in some comfort the first was that of organist at st georges in the borough i had to attend the service and to play the organ twice on sunday the week day services and the gift lectures were conducted without any singing the church contains i believe the most fashionable congregation of south london and therefore the most critical i do not think however that while i sat in the organloft they had any reason to complain either of music or of choir there sat with me in the organloft alice who possessed a sweet clear and strong voice her brother tom who brought into the choir an excellent tenor mr ramage one of my fathers clerks who lodged behind the marshalsea gave us a bass of indifferent quality though he was now past fifty half a dozen boys and girls from the charity school of no great account for voices made up our choir i believe it was better than the average and i think that people came on sunday morning on purpose to hear the organ and the singing mr ramage or ramage as he was called in the countinghouse where no title is allowed to any below the rank of partner or partners son kept me acquainted with events in college street and on the wharf my father it was understood never mentioned my name the business of the firm was never more flourishing mr matthew was constantly called in for consultations and oh master will my old friend always concluded be reconciled what is itto give up playing the organ at church whyit is nothing someone else will play while you sit in state in your red velvet pew below give way to your father he is a hard man but he is just it also appeared from mr ramages information that it was perfectly well known by the clerks and by mr matthew who doubtless told my father the ways by which i had been making a living i had been seen by one marching ahead of a sailors weddingparty by another fiddling in the bermondsey tavern by a third in the gallery of a city company hall the countinghouse down to the messengers was humiliated there was but one feeling among the clerks i had brought disgrace upon the house they are sorry master will for your fathers sake it is hard for him so proud a manwith so much to be proud ofa quarter of a million some say think how hard it is for him it is harder for me ramage i replied to be driven to fiddle for sailors when all i ask is to be allowed to follow music in peace however tell the clerks that i am sorry to have disgraced them disgraced the clerks what did i say why theirs is the lowest kind of work that the world can find for men they were disgraced because their masters son played the fiddle for a living but i could not afford to consider their opinions ramage knew nothing about my other place or his entreaties would have been more fervent i had but one answer however i could not give up the only work that i cared for even to be reconciled to my father why i was born for music shall a man fly in the face of providence and scorn the gifts with which he is endowed my other place was none other than second fiddle tom shirley being the first fiddle of the dog and duck i have mentioned the pleasure gardens south of the river there are as londoners know very well a great many such gardens all alike in most respects that is to say there is in every one of them an avenue or walk lined by trees which at night are festooned by thousands of lights in coloured glass lamps hanging from tree to tree there is also in most a piece of water with swans or ducks upon it and all round it arbours where the company take tea or punch or wine there is a tavern where drink may be had suppers are served in the evening there is a floor for dancing in the open air with a place for the band and there is a long room with an organ at one end where the company promenade and listen and where on hot nights the band and the singers perform in many gardens there is also a bowlinggreen there is sometimes a swimming bath and in most there is a chalybeate spring the water of which is warranted to cure anything but especially rheumatism gout and the kings evil every one of these gardens employs an orchestra and engages the services of singers the number of musicians employed is therefore considerable there are certainly in the south of london alone more than a dozen gardens large enough to have a band beside the dog and duck there are the temple of flora the lambeth wells the cumberland gardens vauxhall gardens bermondsey spa st helena gardens finchs grotto cupids gardens restoration spring gardensis not that twelve and there are more so that it is not difficult for a young man who can play any instrument tolerably to get a place in the orchestra of some garden one would not choose such a position if fortune gave one a choice at the dog and duck there are visitors to whose pleasure we should be ashamed of ministering people whose proper place is the house of correction or bridewell they are allowed to attend these gardens with friends who should also be denied entrance they make the company noisy and disorderly we gave them music that was a great deal better than they deserved it was thrown away upon the majority we gave them songs that were innocent and tendertom shirley wrote and composed them himself we also had to give them other songs more suited to their gross and grovelling tastes it was part of toms humour to speak of the audience at the dog and duck as the most polite fashionable and aristocratic assembly in the world he declared that their taste in music was excellent their attention that of a connoisseur and their appreciation of his own songs all that he could desire i asked him once how he reconciled these things with their delight in the comic songs which were also provided for them the aristocracy he said must from time to time unbend they must from time to time laugh they laugh and they unbend when we give them a song to which in their more polite moments they would refuse to listen i knew very well that the company was chiefly composed of deboshed profligates prentices who daily robbed their masters in order to come to the gardens young gentlemen from the country prodigal sons from the temple and lincolns inn and tradesmen who were dissipating their capital if good music was played they talked and laughed at the singing of good songs they walked about or left the open platform for the dark lanes of the garden you are lucky will said tom to play for such an audience brings good luck with name and fame and riches it brought me fifteen shillings a week and as for name and fame i never heard of either i did not propose to write my own history but that of a woman to whom you have already seen me conversing yet my own history must be understood before hers can be related you have been told how for my obstinate adherence to music i was turned out of my fathers house how i found a refuge how i earned my livelihood by playing the fiddle now before i come to the events which connected my fortunes with those of the lady whom i call my mistressand that with my wifes consenti must tell one or two events which befell me the first of them was my courtship and my marriage in the courtship there was no obstacle the course of true love ran smoothly in my marriage there were no regrets no discords always a full deep current of affection on both sides a simple plain story in which nothing happened so far would to heaven that nothing had happened afterwards when a young man and girl live under the same roof when they share the same interests when they have the same affectionsalice herself could not love her brother more than i did when the home is happy in spite of poverty and its restrictions when the hearts of the two go out to each other spontaneously then the time must come when they will resolve upon becoming brother and sister or declared and open lovers when i think of this time this truly happy time i sometimes feel as if we were too hurried over it i sat beside alice every morning at breakfast and at dinner i played to her i composed songs for her i even wrote verses for the musici have some of them still and really though i do not pretend to be a poet there are things in them which i admire poets always speak of the warblers in the grove so did i love which rhymes to grove always burns and flamesdid so in my verses as to the rhymes i abolished the first and third which was a great relief without the necessity of rhyming one could easily become a poet i say that the situation being so pleasant and so happy i might have prolonged it but there comes a time when a man must take the last step the uncertainty is sweet can she love me will she perhaps say nay yet the pleasing pain the charming smart the raptured flamesi quote from my own verses which were really like many that i have seen used in songsbecome in time too much one must perforce go on to secure the happiness beyond in the morning when the weather was fine we would walk abroad among the fields and gardens that lie stretched out behind the river bank some of them are pretty gardens each with its hedge and bushes filled with flowers in the summer garden houses stand about here and there windmills vary the landskip the lanes are shaded by trees at the end of one is a great stone barn formerly part of king richards palace of which not another stone is left beside the river are lambeth palace and lambeth church with a few fishermens cottages over this rural place we strayed at our will now among the lanes picking wild flowers recalling scraps of songs listening to the skylark while the fresh breeze coming up the river with the tide fanned alices cheek and heightened the soft colour which was one of her charms sometimes we left the fields and walked along the high embankment watching the laden barges slowly going up or down and the sailing tiltboats bound for richmond or the fishermen in midstream with their nets or the wherries plying with their fares and the swans admiring in a word the life and animation of the river at westminster and above it chiefly however alice loved the fields where in the morning we were always alone save for a gardener here and there at work since the life that she saw around her was such as she sawmade up of debtors prisons noisy duckhunters prizefighters and drunken profligates what wonder if she loved to linger where she was apart from the vileness of men and women to meditate to muse to sing all alone for my companionship counted nothing was her greatest joy so it has continued even now she loves to wander alone beneath the treesthey are other trees under another skyand lift up her voice to heaven which answers by giving her thoughts always new and always holy it was in the middle of may the poets month when we were thus roaming in the fields alice carried a handful of hawthorn she sang as she went dear heart how she sang yet i know not what it was prayer it was praise it was adoration it was worship i know not what she sang the larks were dumb because they could not sing with her it was the time of which i have spokenthe time of uncertainty never had alice looked so heavenly sweet she carried her hat by the strings her hair fell about her shouldersfair soft hair like silk with a touch of gold in it her eyes gazed upwards when the light clouds flew across the blue as if they were things of this world trying to turn her eyes and thoughts away from the things of heaven i could endure the doubt no longer i laid my arm about her waist the song was troubled her eyes dropped oh she said what wilt thou i drew her closer the song broke off i kissed her head her brow her lips we said nothing she sang no more but the larks began their hymns of joy the clouds passed the sun came out in splendour the hedges seemed all to burst together into blossom thus it wasso easilyso sweetlydid we pass into the condition of lovers yet we had been lovers all the time chapter v wedding bells and the book of the play we were married without delay why should we wait i should be no richer for waiting and time would be passing we were married therefore it was impossible from time to time we should not be reminded of the lowly station in which we lived when one of my cousins was married what preparations what feasts arranged and provided what troops of guests what a noble company in the church what crowds afterwardsthe street filled with beggars come for the broken victuals the butchers with their din unmusical of marrowbones and cleavers the band of music playing outside the acclamation of the crowd when the bride was brought back from church the rooms full of guests all with wedding favours the lovingcup passing from hand to hand the kissing of the bridesmaids the merriment and coquetry over the bridecake and the weddingring all this i remembered and it made me sad for a moment not for long for beside me stood a bride sweeter far than was any cousin of mine and i was a musician and i was independent we walked over the fields to st georges church and were there married at ten oclock in the morning tom gave away his sister alice had no bridesmaids i had no groomsmen there was no crowd of witnesses there was no lovingcup we were married in an empty church and after marriage we walked home again to toms cottage he sat down and played a wedding march of his own composition made for the occasion there he said that is better than a wedding feastyet there shall be a wedding feast and of the best it was served at noon there was a duck pie a pair of soles a cowslip tarta very dainty dish and fried sweetbreads after dinner there was a bottle of port will said my brotherinlaw taking the last glass in the bottle who would be one of those unhappy creatures who cannot be married without crowds and noise and a great company here are we contented with ourselves we have been married we have had a royal banquetyour sweetbreads wife were a morsel for a king you are contented will quite for i was holding alice by the hand you never regret the fleshpots neveri have forgotten them this was not quite true but it passed i have sometimes thoughthe looked from me to alice and from alice to me againthat there might have been regrets there can be none now good hands upon it brother we shall miss alice shall we not wife but she will not be far off so a tear stood in his eye while he kissed his sister now he said enough of sentiment the day is before us i have got a man to take my place tonight and another to take yours on such an occasion will we must not spare and grudge we will see the sights of london and thenthennone of your pleasure gardenswe willbut i have a surprise for you we sallied forth never was a weddingday kept in so strange a fashion we took oars at the falcon stairs to the tower now alice had spent all her life in or about the rules of the kings bench but she had never seen london city or the sights of london to her everything was new we showed her the tower and the wild beasts and the arms and armour and the royal crown and sceptre after the tower we walked along thames street where are the custom house and billingsgate market and the steelyard and the monument we climbed up the monument for the sake of the view it was a clear day and we could discern in the distance lambeth palace and the church and perhaps even one was not sure the cottage which we had taken on the bank after this we went to see the guildhall and the famous giants then the bank of england and the royal exchange we looked at the shops in cheapside they are the richest shops in the world but the mercers and haberdashers do not put out in the window their costly stuffs to tempt the shoplifter you must imagine alice i told her the treasures that lie within some time if we ever become rich you shall come here and buy to your hearts content then we entered st pauls that solemn and magnificent pile here we heard part of the afternoon service the boys in their white surplices singing like angels so that the tears rolled down my girls facethey were tears of praise and prayer not of repentance from st pauls we walked up the narrow street called the old bailey and saw the outside of newgate now had we known what things we were to do and to suffer in that awful place i think we should have prayed for death but heaven mercifully withholds the future illustration we took oars at the falcon stairs to the tower it was then about five oclock we went to a coffeehouse and took some coffee and ratafia the animation of the place the brisk conversation the running about of the boys the fragrant odour of the coffee pleased us there were coffeehouses in the high street but they lacked the vivacity of this on ludgate hill where templars doctors of divinity and the mercers and goldsmiths of ludgate hill and fleet street were assembled together to talk and drink the fragrant beverage which has done so much to soften the manners of the better sort and now said tom for my surprise he called a coach and we drove not knowing whither he was taking us to drury lane we were to celebrate our weddingday by going to the play for my own part i had neverfor reasons which you will understandbeen allowed to go to the play to soberminded merchants the play was a thing abhorrent a hotbed of temptation the amusements of prodigals and profligates therefore i had never seen the play nor had alice or her sisterinlaw while tom who had once played in the orchestra had never seen the play since his debts carried him off to the kings bench we found good places in the boxes the house was not yet half full and the candles were not all lighted many of the seats were occupied by footmen waiting for their mistresses to take them in the pit the gentlemen who seemed to know each other were standing about in little knots conversing with the utmost gravity one would have thought that affairs of state were being discussed on the contrary we were assured they were arguing as to the merits or the blemishes of the piece now in its third night presently the musicians came in and the cheerful sound of tuning up began then the house began to fill up rapidly and the orange girls made their way about the pit with their baskets and walked about the back of the boxes calling out their fine chaney orangefine chaney orange why do i note these familiar things because they were not familiar to me because they are always connected in my mind with what followed the play was the country girl the story is about an innocent country girl an heiress who knows nothing of london or of the world her guardian wants to marry her himself for the sake of her money though he is fifty and she is twenty as he cannot do so without certain papers being drawn up he makes her believe that they are married by breaking a sixpence and brings her to london with him how she deceives him pretends this and that makes appointments and writes loveletters under his very nose wrings his consent to a subterfuge and marries the man she lovesthese things compose the whole play the first act i confess touched me little the young fellow the lover talks about the girl he loves her guardian is introduced there is no action and there were no women i felt no interest in the talk of the men there was an old rake and a young rake the soured and gloomy guardian and the lover they did not belong to my world either of the city or of st georges fields but in the second act the country girl herself appeared and with her as a foil and for companion the town woman now the country girl peggy by name instantly on her very first appearance ravished all hearts for she was so lovely with her light hair hardly dressed at all hanging in curls over her neck and shoulders her bright eyes her quick movements that no one could resist her she brought with her on the stage the air of the country one seemed to breathe the perfumes of roses and jessamine and she was so curious and so ignorant and so innocent she had been taken the evening before to the play she found the actors the goodliest properest men she liked them hugeously she wants to go out and see the streets and the people her curmudgeon of a guardian comes in and treats her with the barbarity of a natural bad temper irritated by jealousy there was a charming scene in which the country girl is dressed as a boy so that she may walk in the park without being recognised by her loverbut she is recognised and is kissed by the very man whom her guardian dreads there is another in which she is made to write a letter forbidding her lover ever to see her again this is dictated by the guardian when he goes to fetch sealingwax she writes another exactly the opposite and substitutes it now all this was done with so much apparent artlessness and so much real feminine cunning that the play was charming whenever the country girl was on the stage it was over too soon oh cried alice she is an angel sure how fortunate was the exchange of letters and how lucky that he was made without knowing it to grant his consent i hope that her lover will treat her well she will be a fond wife will do you not think and so she went on as if the play was real and the country girl came really from the country and the thing really happened the name of the actress i saw on the play bill was miss jenny wilmot i am not surprised looking back on that evening the wit and sparkle of her words seemed by the way she spoke them invented by herself on the spot she held the house in a spell when she left the stage the place became instantly dull and stupid when she returned the stage became once more bright we went back by water it was a fine evening a thousand stars were gleaming in the sky and in the water we were all silent as happens when people have passed a day of emotions at my brotherinlaws cottage we made a supper out of the remains of the dinner and after supper alice and i went away to the house we had taken at lambeth beside the church and so our wedded life began there was another incident connected with my wedding which turned out to be the innocent cause of a great deal that happened afterwards among my former friends in the city was a certain mr david camlet who had a shop in bucklersbury for the sale of musical instruments he allowed me the run of the place and to try different instruments it was he who first taught me to play the harpsicord and suffered me to practise in his back parlour overlooking the little churchyard of st pancras the good old man would also converse with mesay rather instruct me in the history of composers and their works of the latter he had a fine collection in brief he was a musician born and as we say to the finger tips a bachelor who wanted no wife or mistress one who lived a simple happy life among his instruments and with his music whether he was rich or not i do not know he knew the difficulties which surrounded me i used to tell him all my fathers prejudice against music my own dislike of figures and accounts my refuge in the highest garret when i wished to practiceonly at such times when my father was out of the house my beloved teacher in the kings bench rules he encouraged me and warned me he took the most kindly interest in my position counselling always obedience and submission even if by so doing i was forbidden to practise at all for a time offering his own parlour as a place of retreat where i could without fear of discovery practise as much as i pleased when i was turned out of the house i made haste to inform him what had happened he lifted up his hands in consternation what he cried you the only son of sir peter halliday knight alderman exlord mayor the greatest merchant in the city the heir to a plumwhat do i say three or four plums at the least the future partner of so great a business the future owner of a fleet and the finest and best appointed fleet on the seasand you throw all this away but i said i will be nothing but a musician thou shalt be a musician lad waitthou shalt have music for a hobby it is good and useful to be a patron of music to encourage musicians but i would be a musician by profession it is a poor profession will believe me it is a beggarly profession if you think of making money by itgive up that hope that day i had ringing in my ears certain glowing words of tom shirley upon the profession and i laughed what do i care about poverty if i can only be a musician mr camlet you have been so kind to me always do not dissuade me i have chosen my path i added with the grandeur that belongs to ignorance and i abide by my lot he sighed nay lad i will not dissuade thee poverty is easy to face when one is young it is hard to bear when one is old then we shall be friends still and i may come to see you sometimes when i am a great composer he took my hand will he said with humid eyes music is a capricious goddess it is not her most pious votary whom she most often rewards be a musician if she permits if not be a player only many are called but few are chosen of great composers there are but one or two in a generation tis an eager heart and an eager face the lord be good to thee will halliday from time to time i visited this kind old man telling him all that i did and hiding nothing at the thought of my playing at the riverside tavern for the sailors to dance he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks why he said it was but yesterday that i looked in at change because it does one good sometimes to gaze upon those who like the pillars of st pauls bear up and sustain this great edifice of london among the merchants will i saw thy respected father truly there was so much dignity upon his brow so much authority in his walk so much mastery in his voice so much consideration in his reception that i marvelled how a stripling like thyself should dare to rebel and to think that his son plays the fiddle in a sanded tavern for ragged jack tars to dance with their polls and molls i cannot choose but laugh pray heaven he never learn but he did learn my good cousin kept himself informed of my doings somehow and was careful to let my father know sir peter looks well mr camlet went on he is perhaps stouter than is good for him his cheeks are red but that is common and his neck is swollen more than i should like my own to be yet he walks sturdily and will wear yet no doubt many a long year london is a healthy place presently i was able to tell him that i was about to be married being in a position which seemed to promise a sufficiency he wished me hearty congratulations and begged to know the happy day and the place of our abode on the morning after our wedding before we had had time to look around us in our threeroomed cottageit was designed for one of the thames fisherman hardly had i found time to talk over the disposition of the furniture i perceived from the casement window marching valiantly down the lane from st georges fields my old friend mr david camlet the day was warm and he carried his wig and hat in one hand mopping his head with a handkerchief he comes to visit us my dear i said it is mr camlet what is he bringing with him for beside him a man dragged a handcart in which lay something large and square covered with matting he is the maker of musical instruments i explained alice what ifin the cart oh willif it were know that my great desire was to possess a harpsichord which for purposes of composition is almost a necessity but such an instrument was altogether beyond my hopes i might as well have yearned for an organ he stopped where the houses began and looked about him he made straight for our door which was open and knocked gently with his knuckles alice went out to meet him by this time he had put on his wig and stood with his hat under his arm the newly married lady of my young friend master will halliday he asked i knew it in such a matter i am never wrong virtue madam sits on thy brow love upon thy lips permit an old manyet a friend of thy worthy husbandso saying he kissed her with great ceremony then at length the room being rather dark after the bright sunshine he perceived me and shaking hands wished me every kind of happiness i am old he said and it is too late for me to become acquainted with love yet i am assured that if two people truly love one another to the bearing of each others burdens to working for each other then may life be stripped of half its terrors i say nothing of the blessing of children the support and prop of old age my children love each other always alice took my hand for better for worse in poverty and in riches love each other always i drew my girl closer and kissed her the old man coughed huskily twas a tender heart even at seventy alice gave him a chair she also brought out the wedding cake which she made herselfa better cake was never made and she opened the bottle of cherry brandy we had laid in for occasions he took a glass of the cordial to the health of the bride and ate a piece of bride cake to our good luck this fellow ought to be fortunate he said nodding at me he has given up all for the sake of music he ought to be rewarded he might have been the richest merchant on change but he preferred to be a musician and to begin at the lowest part of the ladder it is wonderful devotion sir i have never regretted my decision that is still more wonderful nonoi am wronghe laughedquite wrong if you were to regret it now you would be the most thankless dog in the world aha the recompense beginsin full measureoverflowingwith such a bride oh sir murmured alice blushing he took a second glass of cherry brandy and began a speech of some length of which i only remember the conclusion wherefore my friends since life is short resolve to enjoy all that it has to givetogether and to suffer all that it has to inflicttogether there is much to enjoy that is lawful and innocent the lord is mindful of his ownlove is lawful and innocent there is abiding comfort in love trust in each other raises the soul of him who trusts and of him who is trusted sweet music is lawful and innocent if there is ever any doubt if there is any trouble if any fail in love if the world becomes like a threatening sea you shall find in music new strength and comfort but why do i speak of the solace of music to will halliday and the sister of tom shirley therefore i say no more he stopped and rose alice poured out another glass of cherry brandy for him i nearly forgot what i came for such is the effect of contemplating happiness will i have thought for a long time that you wanted a harpsichord sir it has been ever beyond my dreams then i am gladbecause i can now supply that want i have brought with me dear ladand dear blooming bride as good an instrument as i have in my shop no better in all the world he went out and called his man we lifted the instrumentit was most beautiful not only in touch but also with its rosewood case we set it up and i tried it oh alice caught his hand and kissed it now will is happy indeed how can we thank you sufficiently play upon it he said play daily upon it play the finest music only upon it so shall your souls be raisedeven to the gates of heaven once more he drew my wife towards him and kissed her on the forehead then he seized my hand and shook it and before i had time or could find words to speak or to thank him he was gone marching down the hot lane with the firm step of thirty instead of seventy a noble gift dictated by the most friendly feeling yet it led to the first misfortune of my lifeone that might well have proved a misfortune impossible to be overcome then began our wedded life for two years we continued to live in that little cottage there our first child was born a lovely boy every evening i repaired to the dog and duck and took my place in the orchestra familiarity makes one callous i had long since ceased to regard the character of the company they might be as tom pretended the most aristocratic assembly in the world they might be the reverse the coloured lamps in the garden pleased me no more nor did the sight of those who danced or the pulling of corks and the singing of songs after supper in the bowers the ladies were no longer beautiful in my eyes i enquired not about the entertainment except for my own part i never looked at the fireworks all these things to one who has to attend night after night becomes part of the work and not of the entertainment and amusement of life the musician is a being apart he takes no part in the conduct of state or city he is not a philosopher or a theologian he is not a preacher or teacher he writes nothing either for instruction or for amusement in the pleasures of mankind he assists but having no share or part in them his place is in the gallery they cannot do without him he cannot live without them but he is a creature apart my mornings were my own sometimes i walked with alice on the terrace of lambeth palace or went down into the marsh and walked about the meadows we made no friends except among the humble fishermen to whose wives alice taught cleanliness sometimes after the child came i would leave alice for the morning and walk into the city perhaps i had a hope that i might meet my father i never did however i looked for him on change i walked in great college street but i never met him i knew beforehand that my reception would be of the coldestbut i wanted to see him and to speak with him i went down to billingsgate stairs and took boat and was rowed about the ships in the pool there i recognised our own ships they might have been my own but would never be mine now all these things i had thrown awayships wharf trade fortune it made me proud to think so yet i would have spoken to my father had i met him once i met matthew in the street and passed him touching shoulders he looked me full in the face with the pretence of not knowing me i commanded my temper and let him go without expostulation which would have led to a second fight for which i had no desire on two other occasions i saw him though he did not see me the first was on a certain afternoon in october when it grows dark about five i was strolling down garlickhithe near queenhithe as i passed the church of st jamess which stands a little back with steps i saw two figures conversing one was a man whom i knew at once for my cousin by his shoulders and by the shape of his head the other was a woman with a veil over her face i knew the man next by his voice our matthew had such a voiceoily and yet harsh if you loved me he said you would do this simple thing i will never do it she declared passionately you have deceived me i would not be an eavesdropper and i passed on matthew therefore had deceivedthe word may mean many thingsa woman matthew of all men however it was no concern of mine a third time i saw himor heard him because i did not see him it was in one of those taverns where small square pews are provided with high walls so that one cannot be heard i sat in one with tom shirley taking a pint of wine all round were the voices of people carrying on business in whispers and in murmurs suddenly i distinguished the voice of matthew the security is good he said there is no finer security in the city i want the money you can have some tomorrow night i was destined to hear a great deal more of that grating voice and the rest next week if i can get the papers signed it is a confidential business i suppose nothing is to be said our house does not like to borrow money but the occasion is pressing let us go i said to tom we shall learn presently all matthews secrets matthew your cousin matthew he is in one of the boxes i have heard his voice come tom chapter vi a city funeral thus we livedhumble folk if you pleasefar from the world of wealth or of fashion this happiness was too great to last we were to be stricken down yet not unto death the troubles began with the death of my father one morning when he ought to have been at his desk my old friend ramage came to see me master will he said the tears running down his cheeks master willtis now too late you will never be reconciled now what has happened i asked but his troubled face told me my master fell down in a fit last night coming home from the companys feast they carried him home and put him to bed but in the night he died in such a case as mine one always hopes vaguely for reconciliation so long as there is life without taking any steps one thinks that a reconciliation will come of its own accord i now believe that if i had gone to my father and put the case plainly my manifest vocation my incapacity for business if i had asked his permission to continue in the musical profession if i had further humbled myself so far as to admit that i deserved at his hands nothing less than to be cut off without a shilling he might have given way it is a terrible thing to know that your father has died with bitterness in his heart against his only son or i might have sent alice with the child surely the sight of that sweet girl the sight of the helpless child would have moved him i reproached myself in a word when it was too late sir said the clerk i do not believe that mr matthew or his father will send you word of this event or of the funeral they do not know where i live excuse me sir mr matthew knows where you live and everything that you have done since you left your home believe me mr will you have no greater enemy than your cousin he has constantly inflamed your fathers mind against you it was he who told my master that you were playing for sailors at a common tavern with a red blind and a sanded floor he told him that you were playing in the orchestra at the dog and duck for all the prentices and the demireps of town he told him that you had marrieda stop ramage lest i do my cousin a mischief how do you know all this i listen he replied from my desk i can hear plainly what is said in the countinghouse i listen i can do no good but sometimes it is well to know what goes on it may be usefulbut to listenwellramage is there more to tell this they do not intend to invite you to the funeral mr matthew will assume the place of the heir and his father will be chief mourner oh do you tell me old friend when it is to take place and i will be there so he promised though it was worth his situation if he were found out to have held any intercourse with me in the end it proved useful to have a friend in the enemys camp at the time i laughed at danger what had i to fear from matthews enmity the manner of my fathers death is common among merchants of the city of london their very success makes them liable to it the city customs favour feasting and the drinking of wine the richer sort ride in a coach when they should be walking for health it is seldom indeed that one may meet a citizen of quality walking in the fields of which there are so many and of such a wholesome air round london whether we go east to the fields of mile end and bow or north where not to speak of moorfields there are the fields this side of islington or on the west where are the fields of westminster and chelsea or south where the whole country is a verdant meadow with orchards i say that among the crowds who flock out on a summer evening to take the air and other refreshments in these fields one may look in vain for the substantial merchant he takes the air lolling in his coach he feasts every day drinking quantities of rich and strong wine such as port or lisbon he stays too much indoors the countinghouse is too often but a step from the parlour the consequence is natural at thirtyfive the successful merchant begins to swell and to expand his figure becomes arched or rounded perhaps his nose grows red at fortyfive his circumference is great his neck is swollen his cheek is red perhaps his nose has become what is called a bottle soon after fifty he is seized with an apoplexy it is whispered on change that such an one fell down stepping out of his companys hall after a feast into the road that he never recovered consciousness and that he is dead the age of fifty i take it is the grand climacteric of the london merchant on the day of the funeral then i presented myself with alice properly habited to take my place as chief mourner the house within was all hung with black cloth the hall and the stairs were thus covered it was evening at eight oclock candles placed in sconces feebly lit up the place at the door and on the stairs stood the undertakers men mutes bearing black staves with black plumes within the undertaker himself was busy serving out black cloaks tying the weepers on the hats distributing the gloves and the rosemary and getting ready the torches upstairs the room in which my fathers body lay had been prepared for the ceremony all the furniturebed chairs everythinghad been taken out there was nothing at all in the room but the coffin on trestles the wainscotted walls had been hung with black velvet which looked indeed funereal as it absorbed the light of fifty or sixty wax tapers and reflected none the tapers stood in silver sconces on the walls they showed up the coffin the lid of which not yet screwed down was laid so as to expose the white face of the deceased grave set serious and full of dignity i remembered how it looked fiery and passionate when my father drove me from his presence the candles also lit up the faces of the mourners in the midst of so much blackness their faces were white and deathlike on the breast of the dead man lay branches of rosemary on the lid of the coffin were branches of rosemary of which every person present carried a sprig on the lid of the coffin was also a large and capacious silver cup with two handles only one thing relieved the blackness of the walls it was a hatchment with the family shield everyone would believe so splendid is this coat of arms that our family must rank among the noblest in the land but the time has passed when the city fathers were closely connected by blood with the gentry and the aristocracy of the country of our family one could only point to the shield where we came from i know not nor how we obtained so fine a shield nor to what station of life my ancestors originally belonged family pride however is a harmless superstition not one of us i am sure would surrender that coat of arms or acknowledge that we were anything but a very ancient and honourable house when i entered the house accompanied by alice i found the hall and the steps and even the street itself which is but narrow crowded with the humbler class of mourners there was a whisper of surprise and more than one honest hand furtively grasped mine well there would be few such hands to welcome matthew i did not need to be told where the coffin lay i led my wife up the stairs and so into my fathers room which was the best bedroom on the first floor i found the various members of the family already assembled my uncle paul as i expected with matthew usurping my place at the head of the coffin my cousins of whom there were fiveandtwenty at least including my uncle pauls wife and two daughters showed signs of profound astonishment at the sight of the banished son the alderman for his part held up his hands in amazement and looked up to heaven as if to protest against this assertion of filial rights the girls who were as amiable as their brother matthew stared with more rudeness than one would expect even from a wappineer at alice they knew not perhaps that i had taken a wife to a natural curiosity on such a subject they affected a contempt which they took no pains to disguise there was a man standing behind my cousin whom i knew not nor did i understand by what right he stood among us at all a tall thin figure somewhat bowed with years a lean and wrinkled face his appearance filled me with distrust at the outsetlet no one deny that first thoughts are best thoughts he stooped and whispered something to my cousinwhose face seemed to show trouble of some kind but not grief matthew started and looked at me with astonishment i stepped forward drawing alice with me uncle paul i said i take my place as my fathers chief mourner my cousin glared at me as if threatening to dispute the point but he gave way and retired to my left hand thus alice beside me my uncle paul at my right and matthew at my left i waited the arrival of the funeral guests meantime the ladies moaned and wailed outside the womenservants on the stairs lifted up their lamentation the crying of the women at a funeral hath in it little reality of grief yet it penetrates to the soul of those who hear it as each new guest arrived the wail was raised anew the louder in proportion to the rank of the arrival in so much that when the lord mayor himself walked up the stairs the lament became a shriek the undertaker whispered in my ear that all were present i looked about me twas not in human nature to avoid a sense of honour and glory in looking upon so honourable a company they proclaimed by their presence the respect with which they regarded my father here beside our cousins were the lord mayor and aldermen the sheriffs the town clerk the recorder the common sergeant the remembrancer the dean of st pauls the master and wardens of his company and many of the greatest merchants on change they were there to do honour to my fathers memory and i was there to receive them as my fathers son despite the respect in which i had failed it was not a time however for regrets i lifted the great cup i say and looked around the wailing ceased all eyes were turned to me as i drank from the cupit was hypocras a drink much loved at city feasts then i handed it to alice who drank and gave it back to me then to my uncle the alderman after whom it went round down below in the hall there was the solemn drinking of wine we drank thus to the memory of the dead in old times i am assured the mourners drank to the repose of the soul just gone out of the body for memory or for repose it is an old custom which one would not willingly neglect after the ceremony the ladies began once more their wailing and groaning they make too much of this custom it is not in reason that girls like my cousins amelia and sophia should be so torn and lacerated by grief as their wails betokened indeed i saw them after the funeral talking and laughing as they went away we then descended the stairs and waited below while the men went up to finish their work and to shut out the face of the dead man for ever from the world they brought out the coffin the housekeeper with one last wail of griefone hopes there was some sincerity in itlocked the door of the death chamber she locked it noisily so that all might hear she turned the handle loudly so that all might be sure that the door was shut she had before put out the wax candles out of respect for the late occupant the room would not be opened or used again for years it would remain as it was with the black velvet hangings and the silver sconces this is one of the privileges accorded to wealthan empty honour but one that is envied by those who cannot afford to spare a room what can the dead man know or feel or care while the black velvet grows brown and shabby and the silver sconces become yellow and the sunbeams through the shutters slowly steal round the room and except for the dancing of the motes in the sunlight there is no motion or sound or touch of life or light in the solitude and silence of the chamber it is giving death to deathnot the life for which we pray for which we hope and trust the pall was of velvet with a gold fringe and gold embroidery i knew it for the parish pall bequeathed by some pious person for the use of parishioners when all was ready the undertaker marshalled the procession first marched two conductors with staves and plumes then followed six men in long black coats two and two then one bearing the standard with black plumes then eighteen men in long black cloaks as before all being servants to the deceased then the minister of the parish after him an officer of arms carrying a knights sword and target helm and crest with him another officer of arms carrying the shield both in their tabards or embroidered coats then the body the pall being borne by six merchants between men carrying the shields of the city of the company and of bridewell christs hospital st bartholomews and st thomass of which the deceased was a governor then i followed as chief mourner with my wife after me the alderman my uncle and his lady then came matthew with him should have walked one of his sisters but there stepped out of the crowd a woman in black holding a handkerchief to her face who she was i knew not after them came the rest of the cousins then followed the lord mayor and the city fathers and lastly the clerks porters stevedores bargemen and others in the service of the house in our hands we carried as we went lighted torches a considerable number of people came out to see the funeral they lined the street which by the flames of the torches was lit up as if by daylight the faces at the windows the crowds in the street the length of the procession filled my soul with pride though well i knew that i was but a castaway from the affections of the dead man whom these people honoured the procession had not far to go the parish church that of st michael paternoster royal is but a short distance down the street it is the church in which whittington was buried his tomb and his ashes being destroyed in the great fire a hundred years ago the church like the house was hung with black and lit by wax candles and our torches the rector read the service with a solemnity which i believe affected all hearts after the reading of that part which belongs to the church we carried the body to the churchyard at the backa very small churchyard there we lowered the coffin into the gravei observed that the mould seemed to consist entirely of skulls and bonesand when dust was given to dust and ashes to ashes we dashed our torches upon the ground and extinguished the flames then in darkness we separated and went each his own way i observed that the lady who walked with matthew left him when the ceremony was over the weeping of the women ceased and the whispers of the men everybody talked aloud and cheerfully no more mourning for my father pity and regret were buried in the grave with him they became the dust and ashes which were strewed upon the coffin he had gone hence to be no more seen to be no more wept over but as you shall shortly hear the dead man still retained in his hands the power of doing good or evil matthew spoke to me as we left the churchyard cousin he said with more civility than i expected if you can come to the countinghouse tomorrow morning you will learn your fathers testamentary dispositions the will is to be opened and read at ten oclock chapter vii the reading of the will we will make him sell his reversionary interestthe voice was curiously harsh and gratingand you will then be able to take the whole you know how sometimes one hears things in a mysterious way which one could not hear under ordinary circumstances i was standing in the outer countinghouse in the room assigned to the accountants in the inner countinghouse i knew my cousin was sitting without being told any thing more i guessed that the voice belonged to the tall lean man who was present at the funeral and that he was addressing matthew and that he was talking about me and without any reason i assumed a mental attitude of caution they were going to make me sell something were they when i was called into the room i found that i was so far right inasmuch as the only two persons in the room were my cousin and the lean man who by his black dress i perceived to be an attorney now i daresay that there are attorneys in the city of london whose lives are as holy as that of any bishop or divine at the same time it is a matter of common notoriety that the city contains a swarm of verminif i may speak plainlywho are versed in every kind of chicanery who know how to catch hold of every possible objection and who spend the whole of their creeping lives in wresting twisting and turning the letter of the law to their own advantage under the pretense of advantage to their clients these are the attorneys who suggest and encourage disputes and lawsuits between persons who would otherwise remain friends there are those who keep cases running on for years eating up the estates when they fasten upon a man it is the spider fastening on a big fat fly they never leave him until they land him in a debtors prison naked and destitute i have observed that a course of life such as that indicated above presently stamps the face with a look which cannot be mistaken the eyes draw together the mouth grows straight and hard the lips become thin the nose insensibly even if it be originally a snub becomes like the beak of a crowthe creature which devours the offal in the street the cheeks are no longer flesh and skin but wrinkled parchment the aspect of the man becomes in a word such as that of the man who sat at the table a bundle of papers before him i knew i say that mr probuswhich was his namewas an attorney at the outset his black coat his wig his general aspect left no doubt upon my mind and from the outset i disliked and distrusted the man the last time i had entered this room was to make my choice between my father and my music the memory of the dignified figure in the great chair behind the table his voice of austerity his expectation of immediate obedience made my eyes dim for a moment not for long because one would not show any tenderness before matthew with some merchants the countinghouse is furnished with no more than what is wanted in this wharf it was a substantial house of brick in which certain persons slept every night for the better security of the strongroom in the cellars below the principal room that which had been my fathers had two windows looking out upon the river the room was carpeted family portraits hung upon the walls the furniture was solid mahogany no one who worked in such a room could be anything but a substantial merchant my cousin looked up and sulkily pointed to a chair at this time matthew halliday presented the appearance of a responsible city merchant his dress was sober yet of the best nobody had whiter ruffles at his wrist or at his shirtfront nobody wore a neckcloth of more costly lace his gold buttons gold buckles and gold laced hat proclaimed him an independent person he carried a large gold watch and a gold snuffbox he wore a large signetring on his right thumb his face was grave beyond his years this morning it presented an appearance which in lesser men is called sulky i knew the look well from old experience it meant that something had gone wrong all my life long i had experienced at the hands of this cousin an animosity which i can only explain by supposing a resentment against one who stood between himself and a rich mans estate as a boyi was four or five years younger than himselfhe would take from me and destroy things i cherished he invented lies and brought false accusations against me he teased pinched bullied me when no one was looking when i grew big enough i fought him at first i got beaten but i went on growing and presently i beat him then if he attempted any more false accusations he knew that he would have to fight me again a consideration which made him virtuous cousin he said coldly this gentleman is mr probus the new attorney of the house mr littleton his late attorney is dead mr probus will henceforth conduct our affairs unworthily said mr probus that is my concern matthew replied with great dignity i hope i know how to choose and to appoint my agents sirmr probus turned to meit has ever been the business of my life to study the good of my fellow man my motto is one taken from an ancient sourceyou will allow one of the learned profession to have some tincture of latin the words areaheminteger vitae scelerisque probus that is to say probusprobus attorneyatlaw vitae lived integer respected scelerisque and trusted such sir should your affairs ever require the nice conduct of one who is both guide and friend to his clients you will ever find me now mr matthew sir my honoured patron i await your commands we are waiting cousin said matthew for my father as soon as he arrives mr probus will read the will the contents are known to mein general termssuch was the confidence reposed in me by my honoured unclein general terms i believe you will find that any expectations you may have formed pardon me sir interrupted the attorney not before the reading of the will will be frustrated that is all i intended to say of course there may be a trifle indeed i hope there may prove to be some trifling legacy perhaps a shilling ha ha the attorney looked more forbidding when he became mirthful than when he was serious then some of my cousins arrived and sat down we waited a few minutes in silence until the arrival of my uncle the alderman with his wife and daughters the ladies stared at me without any kind of salutation the alderman shook his head nephew he said i am sorry to see you here i fear you will go away with a sorrowful heart i am sorrowful already because my father was not reconciled to me i shall not be any the more sorrowful to find that i have nothing it is what i expect now sir you may read my fathers will as soon as you please in spite of my brave words i confess that for alices sake i did hope that something would be left me then all took chairs and sat down with a cough of expectation there was no more wailing from the ladies mr probus took up from the table a parchment tied with red tape and sealed he solemnly opened it this he said is the last will and testament of peter halliday knight and alderman late lord mayor citizen and lorimer my uncle interposed one moment sir then he turned to me repentance nephew though too late to change a parents testamentary dispositions may be quickened by the consequences of a parents resentment it may therefore be the means of leading to the forgivenessahemand the remissionahemof more painful consequencesahemat the hands of providence i inclined my head now sir once more this will was made four years ago when the late mr littleton was the deceased gentlemans attorney it was opened three months ago in order to add a trifling codicil which was entrusted to my care i will now read the will there is no such cumbrous and verbose document in the world as the will of a wealthy man it was read by mr probus in a harsh voice without stops in a singsong monotonous delivery which composed the senses and made one feel as if all the words in the dictionary were being read aloud at last he finished perhaps i said someone will tell me in plain english what it means plain english sir let me tell you mr probus replied that there is no plainer english in the world than that employed by lawyers i turned to my uncle will you sir have the goodness to explain to me i cannot recite the whole as for the main pointsmr probus will correct me if i am wrongmy lamented brother leaves bequests to found an almshouse for eight poor men and eight poor widows to bear his name he also founds at his parish church an annual lecture to bear his name he establishes a new years dole to bear his name of coals and bread for twenty widows of the parish he has founded a school for twelve poor boys to bear his name he has ordered his executors to effect the release of thirty poor prisoners for debt in his name is there more mr probus he also founds a scholarship for a poor and deserving lad to assist him at cambridge the same scholarship to bear his name and to be in the gift of his company what does he say about me i am coming to that mr probus replied he devises many bequests to his nephews and nieces his cousins and his personal friends with mourning rings to all there are i believe two hundred thus honoured two hundredi think mr paul that it is a long time since the city lost one so rich and so richly provided with friends but what does he say about me i insisted patience he then devises the whole of his remaining estate all his houses investments shares stocks all his furniture and plate to his nephew matthew i expected it and nothing said about me at all it is estimated that the remainder after deducting the monies already disposed of will not amount to more than l because there is a reservation oh it is provided that the sum of l be set aside that it be placed in the hands of trustees whom he namesthe master of his company and the clerk of the company this money is to accumulate at compound interest until one of two events shall happeneither the death of his son in which case mr matthew will have it all or the death of mr matthew in which case the son is to have it all in other words this vast sum of money with accumulations will go to the survivor of the two i received this intelligence in silence at first i could not understand what it meant i think sir mr probus addressed the alderman we have now set forth the terms of this most important document in plain language we ought perhaps to warn mr william against building any hopes upon the very slender chance of succeeding to this money we have herehe indicated matthewhealth strength an abstemious life on the other hand we havehe indicated mewhat we see i laughed at all events i was a more healthy subject to look at than my cousin who this morning looked yellow instead of pale the span of life the attorney went on accorded to my justly esteemed client will probably be that usually assigned to those who honour their parentssay eighty or even ninety you sir will probably be cut off at forty i believe that it is the common lot in your class above all things do not build upon the chances of this reversion suddenly the words i had heard came back to me what were they we will make him sell his reversion sell his reversion then the reversion must not be sold mr probus went on too long you may destroy the effect of your words by too much repetition a shadowy chance he said a shadowy chance i dont know why should not my cousin die before me besides it means that my father in cutting me off would leave a door for restitution only an imaginary door sirnot a real door a very real door i shall live as long as i can my cousin will do as he pleases mr probus the shadowy chance as you call it is a chance that is worth a large sum of money if i would sell my reversion mr probus started and looked suspicious but i shall not sell it i shall wait matthew might die tomorrowtoday even fie siroh fieto desire the death of your cousin this indeed betokens a bad hearta bad heart how dreadful is the passion of envy how souldestroying is the thirst for gold i rose i knew the worst do not mr probus went on give i entreat you one thought to the thing before your cousins life lies stretched what i may call a charming landskip with daisies in the grass andandthe pretty warblers of the grove it is a life i see very plainly full of goodness which is heavenly wealth stored up for future use and of success on change which is worldly wealth happy is the city which owns the possessor of both the moralist ceased and began to tie up his papers when his strident voice dropped the air became musical again so to speak however the harsh voice suited the sham piety cousin matthew i rose since there was nothing to keep me longer could i remember in your sevenandtwenty years of life one single generous act or one single worthy sentiment then i could believe this fustian about the length of days and the heavenly wealth live as long as you can i desire never to see you again and never to hear from you again go your own way and leave me to go mine the whole company rose they parted right and left to let me pass as the saying is they gave me the cold shoulder with a wonderful unanimity there was a common consent among them that the man who had become a fiddler had disgraced the family as for matthew he made no reply even with looks he did not however present the appearance of joy at this great accession to wealth something was on his mind that troubled him my uncle the alderman spoke for the family nephew he said believe me it is with great sorrow that we see thee thus cast out yet we cannot but believe the acts of my brother to be righteous i rejoice not that my son has taken thine inheritance i lament that thou hast justly been deprived the will cuts thee off from the family he looked round a murmur of approval greeted him a disinherited son who is also a fiddler by profession cannot be said to belong to a respectable city family we wish thee wellin thy lower sphereamong thy humble companions farewell i passed through them all with as much dignity as i could assume alas i heard him saying as i stepped out alas that cousins should so differ from each other in grainin grain illustration i passed through them all his daughters my dear cousins turned up their noses coughed and flattened themselves against the wall so that i should not touch so much as a hoopand i saw these affectionate creatures no more untilmany things had happened chapter viii the temptation one morning about six weeks after the funeral i was sitting at the harpsichord picking out an anthem of my own composition the theme was one of thanksgiving and praise and my heart was lifted to the level of the words all around was peace and tranquillity on the river bank outside alice walked up and down carrying our child now nearly a year and a half old the boy crowed and laughed the mother would have been singing but she would not disturb me at work can mortal man desire greater happiness than to have the work of his own choice the wife who is to him the only woman in the world a strong and lovely child and a sufficiency earned by his own work as for my chance of ever getting that huge fortune by my cousins death i can safely aver that i never so much as thought of it we never spoke of it we put it out of our minds altogether i heard steps outside steps which disturbed me i turned my head it was mr probus the attorney he stood hat in hand before alice mr williams wife i believe he was saying and his child a lovely boy indeed madam i bring you newsnothing less in short than a fortunea fortunefor this lovely boy indeed sir are you a friend of my husband a better friend i warrant madam than many who call him friend he is within sir will you honour our poor cottage he stood in the open door mr will he said i have your permission to enter at sight of him the whole of the anthem vanished harmony melody solo chorus it was as if someone was singing false as if all were singing false i put down my pen sir i said i know not if there is any business of mine which can concern you dear sir he tried to make his grating voice mellifluous he tried to smile pleasantly do not pray treat me as if i was an adviser of the will by which your father deprived you of your inheritance i do not say that you were nevertheless i cannot understand what business you have with me i come from your cousin you have never i fear regarded your cousin with kindly feelingsthis was indeed reversing the positionbut of that we will not speak i come at the present moment as a messenger of peacea messenger of peace there is scripture in praise of the messenger of peace i forget it at the moment but you will know it your good lady will certainly know it alice who had followed him placed a chair for him and stood beside him i bear the olivebranch like the turtledove he continued smiling i bring you good tidings of peace and wealth they should go together wealth and peace pray sir proceed with your good tidings alice laid her hand on my shoulder husband she said it would be no good tidings which would deprive us of the happiness which we now enjoy think well before you agree to anything that this gentleman or your cousin may offer so she left us and carried the boy out again into the fresh air now sir we are alone he looked about him curiously a pretty room he said but small one would take it for the cottage of a fisherman i believe there are some of these people in the neighbourhood the prospect either over the river or over the marsh is agreeable the trees are pleasant in the summer the dog and duck which is i believe easily accessible is a cheerful place and the company is polite and refined especially that of the ladies no one however would think that a son of the great sir peter halliday exlord mayor and alderman west india merchant was living in this humble place your good tidings sir at the same time the position has its drawbacks you are almost within the rules and though not yourself a prisoner you are in the company of prisoners again sir your good tidings i come to them scelerisque probus is my motto probus attorney at law trusted by all now sir you shall hear what your cousin proposes listen to me for a moment you can hardly get on i imagine even in so small a way as this appears to be under fifty pounds a year it would be difficult and in your profession improperly hard and unjustly despised it is difficult i believe to make much more it is difficult to make much more ha as your cousin said they must be pinchedthis unfortunate couplepinched at times did my cousin say that assuredly he was thinking especially of your good lady whom he remarked at the funeral well your cousin will change all that a heart of gold mr william all pure goldi coughed doubtfullyconcealed i admit by a reserved nature which often goes with our best and most truly pious men especially in the city of london i do assure you a heart of gold he played his part badly his cunning eyes his harsh voice the words of praise so out of keeping with his appearance and manneras if such a man with such a face could be in sympathy with hearts of goldstruck a note of warning besides matthew with a heart of gold well sir i interrupted him what have you come to say in plain words then this mr matthew has discovered a way of serving you now my dear sir i pray your attention he leaned back and crossed his legs your father showed a certain relentinga disposition to consider you as still a member of the family by that provision as to survival which you doubtless remember so i interpret that clause in the will and with this view has put you in as the possible heir to the money which is now accumulating in the hands of trustees mr matthew now a partner in the business will it is assumed provide for his heirs out of the business on his death your fathers fortune will come to you if you are living if you die first it will go to your cousin in the latter event there will be no question of your son getting aught so i understand your cousin therefore argues in this way first he is only a year or two older than yourself next he is in full possession of his health and strength there is nothing to prevent his living to eighty i believe a greatgrandmother of his not yours lived to ninetysix it is very likely that he may reach as great an age you will allow that perhaps why then we are agreed as for you musicians i am told seldom get past forty they gradually waste away andand wither like the blasted sprig in july oh you will certainly leave this world at fortyenviable personwould that i could have done soyou will exchange your fiddle for a harpthe superior instrumentand your threecornered hat for a crownthe external sign of promotionlong before your cousin has been passed the chair all this is very likely mr probus yet i am coming to my proposal what mr matthew says is this my cousin is cut out of the will it is not for me to dispute my uncles decision still what he wants just now is ready moneya supplementa supplementto what he earns well for he stopped here and looked about the room with an air of contempt a pleasant room he said going back but is it the room which your fathers son should have for a lodging rushbottomed chairs no carpet dear me mr william it is well to be a philosopher however we shall change all that i waited for him to go on without further interruption in a word sir i am the happy ambassadorprivileged if ever there was onecharged to bring about reconciliation and cousinly friendship again he overdid it your cousin sent me in a word to propose that you should sell him your chances of inheritance that is why i am here i say mr william that you may if you please sell him your chance of the inheritance he proposes to offer you l downl i saythe enormous sum of threethousandpoundsfor your bare chance of succeeding well sir what do you say to this amazing this astounding piece of generosity i said nothing only suddenly there returned to my mind the words i had overheard in the outer countinghouse we will make him sell his reversion what connection had these words with me there was no proof of any connection no proof except that jumping of the wits which wants no proof with l mr probus continued you can take a more convenient residence of your ownhere or elsewhere near the dog and duck or further removed you can live where you please with the interest which would amount to l a year at least and what you make by your honest labour you will be for one of your profession rich it will be a noble inheritance for your children why sir you are a made man he threw himself back in his chair and puffed his cheeks with the satisfaction that naturally follows on the making of a man i was tempted i saw before me a life of comparative ease with l a year there would be little or no anxiety for the future mr probus perceived that i was wavering he pulled a paper out of his pockethe slapped it on the table and unrolled it he looked about for ink and pen you agree he asked with an unholy joy lighting up his eyes whytherei knew you would i told mr matthew that you would happy man three thousand pounds and all your own and all for nothing where is the ink because siri can be your witnessthat cousin of yours i may now tell you is stronger than any bullsign here then sirherehe will live for ever his eagerness which he could not conceal to obtain my signature startled me again i remembered the words we will make him sell his reversion stop mr probus i said not so quick if you please not so quick why dear sir you have acceded you have acceded where is the ink not at all if you would like better terms i might raise it another fifty pounds not even another fifty will persuade me at that moment i heard alice singing the lord my pasture shall prepare and lead me with a shepherds care the lordnot mr probus i took the words for a warning we shall not want any ink i said nor any witness because i shall not sign not sign not sign but mr williamsirsurelyhave a caresuch an offer is not made every day you will never again receive such an offer hark ye mr probus by that clause in his will my father signified his desire although he would punish me for giving up the cityto show that he was not implacable and that if it be heavens will that i should survive my cousin i should then receive his forgiveness and once more be considered as one of the family sir i will not for any offer that you may make act against my fathers wish i am to wait god knows i desire not the death of my cousini wait it is my fathers sentence upon me i shall obey my father he forgives me after a term of yearslong or shorti know not he forgives me by that clause i am not cursed with my fathers resentment oh he talks like a madman with l waiting for him to pick up i repeat sir in this matter i shall leave the event to providence in obedience to my fathers wishes inform my cousin if you please of my resolution more he said because he was one of those tenacious and obstinate persons who will not take no for an answer besides as i learned afterwards he was most deeply concerned in the success of his mission he passed from the stage of entreaty to that of remonstrance and finally to that of wrath sir he said i perceive that you are one of those crackbrained and conceited persons who will not allow anyone to do them good you throw away every chance that offers you stand in your own light you bring ruin upon your family very well i said very well indeed i waste my words upon you why then waste more you are unworthy of the name you bear you are only fit for the beggarly trade you follow well sir when misery and starvation fall upon you and yours remember what you have thrown away i laughed his cunning face became twisted with passion sir he said all this talk is beside the mark there are ways do not think that we are without ways and means then he swore a great round oath we shall find a way somehow to bring you to reason well mr integer vitae scelerisque probus i said if you contemplate rascality you will have to change your motto he smoothed out his face instantly and repressed the outward signs of wrath mr will he said forgive this burst of honest indignation you will do of course what you think fit sir i wish you a return to better sense i think i may promise youhe paused and clapped his forefinger to his nose i am sure that i can so far trespass on the forbearance of your cousin as to promise that this offer shall be kept open for three weeks any day within the next three weeks you shall find at my office the paper ready for your signature after that time the chance will be gonegonegone for ever he threw the chance across the river with a theatrical gesture and walked away what did it mean why did matthew want to buy my share we might both live for forty years or even more neither could touch that money till the others death he might desire my early death in which case all would be his but to buy my shareit meant that if i died first he would have paid a needless sum of money for it and that if he died first it would not be in his power to enjoy that wealth i asked ramage on the sunday why matthew wanted it he said that merchants sometimes desire credit and that perhaps it would strengthen matthew if it were known that this great sum of money would be added to his estate whenever either his cousin or he himself should die and with this explanation i must be content there was another possibility but that i learned afterwards we will make him sell his reversion what was the meaning of those words perhaps they did not apply to me but i was sure that they did like a woman i was certain that they did and for a womans reasonwhich is none chapter ix the claim and the arrest you have heard how my old friend david camlet musical instrument maker of dowgate street presented meor my wifeon our marriage with a handsome harpsichord shortly after my fathers death this good old gentleman also went the way of all flesh a melancholy event which i only learned by receiving a letter from mr probus imagine if you can my amazement when i read the following sir i have to call your immediate attention to your debt of fiftyfive pounds for a harpsichord supplied to you by david camlet of dowgate street deceased i shall be obliged if you will without delay discharge this liability to me as attorney for the executors and remain sir your obedient humble servant ezekiel probus why said alice mr camlet gave us the instrument it was a free gift it was if mr probus will acknowledge the fact mr probus is it that man with the harsh voice who talked lies to you the same and much i fear wife that he means no good by this letter but mr camlet gave us the harpsichord had the letter been received from any other person i should have considered it as of no importance but the thought that it came from mr probus filled me with uneasiness what had that worthy attorney said there are wayswe shall find a way to bring you to reason my dear said alice since we have had the instrument for two years without any demand for payment we ought to be safe better go and see the man it was with very little hope that i sallied forth not only was this man a personal enemy but he was an attorney what must be the true nature of that profession which so fills the world with shuddering and loathing is it one asks impossible to be an honest attorney this one at all events was as great a villain as ever walked they are a race without pity without scruple without turning either to the right or to the left when they are in pursuit of their prey they are like the weasel who singles out his rabbit and runs it down being turned neither to one side nor the other their prey is always money they run down the man who has money when they have stripped him naked they leave him whether it is in a debtors prison or in the street when he is once stripped they regard him no longer other men take revenge for human motives for wrongs done and endured these men know neither revenge nor wrath they do not complain of wrongs you may kick them you may cuff them it is nothing they want your money and that they will have by one way or another i took boat from st mary overies stairs as i crossed the river a dreadful foreboding of evil seized me for i perceived suddenly that somehow or other mr probus was personally interested in getting me to sell my reversion how could he be interested i could not understand but he was i remembered the persuasion of his manner his anxiety to get my signature his sudden manifestation of disappointment when i refused why matthew was now a partner with a large income and the fortune which my father left him matthew had no expensive tastes why should mr probus be interested in his affairs next asked the silent reasoner in my brain what will happen when you declare that you cannot pay this debt this man will show no mercy you will be arrestedyou will be taken to prison at this thought i shivered and a cold trembling seized all my limbs and you will stay in the prison till you consent to sell your reversion at which i resumed my firmness neverneverwould i yield whatever an accursed attorney might say or do to me mr probus wrote from a house in white hart street it is a small street mostly inhabited by poulterers which leads from warwick lane to newgate market a confined place at best with the rows of birds dangling on the hooks not always of the sweetest and the smell of the meat market close by and the proximity of the shambles it is a dark and noisome place the house which had a silver pen for its sign was narrow and of three stories none of the windows had been cleaned for a long time and the door and doorposts wanted paint as i stood on the doorstep the words again came back to me we will make him sell his reversionary interest the door was opened by an old man much bent and bowed with years his thin legs his thin arms his bodyall were bent on his head he wore a small scratch wig he covered his eyes with his hand on account of the blinding light yet the court was darkened by the height of the houses above and the dangling birds below he received my name and opened the door of the front room i observed that he opened it a very little way and entered sliding as if afraid that i should see something he returned immediately and beckoned me to follow him he led the way into a small room at the back not much bigger than a cupboard which had for furniture a high desk and a high stool placed at a window so begrimed with dirt that nothing could be seen through it there was no other furniture the old man climbed upon his stool with some difficulty and took up his pen he looked very old and shrivelled his brown coat was frayed his worsted stockings were in holes his shoes were tied with leather instead of buckles there was no show of shirt either at the wrist or the throat he looked in fact what he was a decayed clerk of the kind with which as a boy i had been quite familiar it is a miserable calling only redeemed from despairbecause the wages are never much above starvationpointby the chance and the hope of winning a prize in the lottery no clerk is ever so poor that he cannot afford at least a sixteenth share in this annual bid for fortune i never heard that any clerk within my knowledge had ever won a prize but the chance was theirs once a year the chance returnsa chance of fortune without work or desert presently the old man turned round and whispered i know your face i have seen you beforebut i forget where are you in trade have you got a shop no i have no shop you come from the country no a bankrupt perhaps no going to make him your attorney he shook his head with some vehemence and pointed to the door with his pen fly he said there is still time i am not going to make him or anyone else my attorney you come to borrow money if soagain he pointed to the door with the feathery end of the quill fly there is still time then you owe him money young manthere is still time buy a stone at the paviorsspend your last penny upon it then tie it round your neck and drop into the river ah it is too latetoo late for just then mr probus rang a bell follow me sir follow me ah that paving stone mr probus sat at a table covered with papers he did not rise when i appeared but pointed to a chair you wish to see me mr william he began may i ask with what object i come in reply to your letter mr probus my letter my letter he pretended to have forgotten the letter i write so many and sometimesayaysurely the letter about the trifling debt due to the estate of david camlet deceased yesyes i am administering the worthy mans estate one of manyvery manywho have honoured me with their confidence that letter mr probus is the reason why i have called you are come to discharge your obligation it is what i expected you are not looking well mr william i am sorry to observe marksare they of privationon your face our worthy cousin on the other hand has a frame of iron he will live i verily believe to ninety never mind my cousin mr probus he will live as long as the lord permits when last i saw you sir you foolishly rejected a most liberal offer well youth is ignorant we live and learn some day too late you will be sorry now sir for this debt fiftyfive pounds ay fiftyfive pounds and my costs which are trifling i have come to tell you mr probus that your letter was written under a misapprehension truly under a misapprehension of what kind pray the harpsichord was a gift made by mr david camlet i did not buy it mr probus lifted his eyebrows a gift really you have proof no doubt of this assertion certainly well produce your proofs if you have proofs as you say i shall be the first to withdraw my clients claim but makers of musical instruments do not usually give away their wares what are your proofs sir my word first tatata your word by such proof every debtor would clear himself what next the word of my wife who with me received the instrument from mr camlet receiving the instrument does not clear you of liabilitywhat else the fact that mr camlet never asked me for the money an oversight had he in a word intended the instrument for a gift he would have said so now sir what other proofs have you i was silent i had no other proof he turned again to the book he had before consulted it was the ledger and there in mr camlets own handwriting firm and square was an entry to will hallidaya harpsichord l in another book was an entry to the office that the instrument had been delivered of course i understand now what the old man meant by the entry he wanted to note the gift and the value and unfortunately he entered it as if it was a business transaction well sir asked mr probus i said nothing my heart felt as heavy as lead i was indeed in the power of this man there are such things as conspiracy he went on severely you have told me for instance that you and your wife are prepared to swear that the instrument was a gift i might have indicted you both for a conspiracy in which case tyburn would have been your lot for the sake of your excellent cousin and the worthy mr peter your uncle sir i refrain from the indictment though i fear i might be charged with compounding a felony but mercy before all things charity mercy and long suffering these are the things that chiefly nourish the human soul not guineas i remained still silent not knowing what to do or to say and seeing this abyss yawning before me come sir he said with changed voice you owe fifty pounds and costs if it were to myself i would give you time i would treat you tenderly but an attorney must protect his clients therefore i must have that money at once give me time to consult my friends alas all my friends could not raise fifty pounds between them you have none you have lost your friends pay me fifty pounds and costs let me see the executors perhaps they will hear reason for what purpose they must have their own the long and the short of it mr william halliday is that you must pay me this money man i have not got so much money in the world he smiledhe could not disguise his satisfaction then mr william hallidayhe shut the ledger with a slami fear that my clients must adoptmost unwillingly i am surethe measures sanctioned by the law his eyes gleamed with a malicious satisfaction i only trust that the steps we shall have to take will not disturb the mind of my muchrespected client your cousin you will have to choose your prison and you will remain in thethe paradise of your choice until this money with costs is paid as for your choice the situation of the fleet is more central that of the bench is more rural beyond the new prison there are green fields the smell of the hay perhaps comes over the wall should you find a lengthened residence necessary i believe that the rooms though small are comfortable ah how useful would have been that three thousand pounds which you refusedat such a juncture as this if there is nothing more to be said i got up not knowing what i said and bewildered with the prospect before me heaven forbid sir he continued sweetly that i should press you unduly i will even considering the tender heart of your cousin extend to you the term i will grant you twentyfour hours in which to find the money you may as well give me five minutes i have no means of raising the sum i am sorry to hear that for the sake of my clients however i can only hopehe pushed back the papers and rose with a horrible grin of malice on his facethat you will find the air of the prison salubrious there have been cases of infectious fevergaol fever lately perhaps the kings bench and the fleet are equal in this respect smallpox also is prevalent in one but i forget which many persons live for years in a prison i hope i am sure that you will passmanymanyhappy years in that seclusion i listened to none of this illomened croaking but hastened to leave him at the door i passed the old clerk go to the kings bench he whispered not to the fleet where hell call every day to learn whether you are dead there is still time he pointed to his throat while he noisily opened the door round the neck at the bottom of the river the lying is more comfortable than in the kings bench i had entered the house with very little hope i left it with despair i walked home as one in a dream running against people seeing nothing hearing nothing when i reached home i sat down in a kind of stupor my dear i said presently recovering we are lostwe are ruined i shall starve in a prison thou wilt beg thy bread the boy will be a gutter brat tell me alice took my hand oh tell me allmy dear can we be lost if we are together we shall not be together tomorrow i shall be in the prison for how long god only knows since he knows my dear keep up your heart when was the righteous man forsaken come let us talk there may be some means found if we were to paythough we owe nothingso much a week alice it is not the debt there is no debt it is revenge and the hope i did not finishwhat i would have added was the hope that i may die of gaol fever or something my dear be brave and let us arrange first i lose my situation in the church and at the gardens next we must provide for the child and for thyself outside the prison no my dear if the lord permits us to live any other way the child shall not be brought up a prison bird chapter x the arrest in this distress i again consulted tom who knew already the whole case in my opinion will he said the best thing for you is to run away let alice and the boy come here run away whither could i run go for a few days into hiding they will come here in search of you cross the riverseek a lodging somewhere about aldgate which is on the other side of the river they will not look for you there meantime i shall inquireoh i shall hear of something to carry on with for a time you might travel with a show probus does not go to country fairs or you might go to dublin or to york or to bath and play in the orchestra of the theatre we will settle for you afterwardswhat to do meantime pack thy things and take boat down the river this seemed good advice i promised i would think of it and perhaps act upon it some might think it cowardly to run away but if an enemy plays dishonest tricks and underhand practices there is no better way perhaps than to run away now had i been acquainted with these tricks i should have remained where i was in toms house where no sheriffs officer could serve me with a writ i should have remained there i say until midnight when i could safely attempt the flight unfortunately i thought there was plenty of time i would go home and discuss the matter with alice i left the house therefore and proceeded across the fields without any fear or suspicion as i approached the bank i saw two fellows waiting about still i had no suspicion and without the least attempt to escape or to avoid them i fell into the clutches of my enemy mr william halliday said one stepping forward and tapping my shoulder you are my prisoner sir at the suit of mr ezekiel probus for the debt of fiftyfive pounds and costs as i made no resistance the fellows were fairly civil i was to be taken it appeared first to the borough compter they advised me to leave all my necessaries behind and to have them sent on to the kings bench as soon as i should be removed there and so i took leave of my poor alice and was marched off to the prison where they take debtors first before they are removed to the larger prison the borough compter is surely the most loathsome fetid narrow place that was ever used for a prison criminals and debtors are confined together rogues and innocent girls the most depraved and the most virtuous there is a yard for exercise which is only about twenty feet square for fifty prisoners at night the men are turned into a room where they have to lie edgeways for want of space there is no ventilation and the air in the morning is more horrible than i can describe my heart aches when i think of the cruelty of that place it is a cruel place because no one ever visits it no righteous justice of the peace no godly clergyman there is no one to restrain the warder and he goes on in the same way not because he is cruel by nature but because he is hardened by daily use and custom i stayed in that terrible place for two nights paying dues and garnish most exorbitant at the end of that time i was informed that i could be removed to kings bench at once so i was taken to the court and my business was quickly despatched as a fine for being poor i had to pay dues which ought not to be demanded of any prisoner for debtat least we ought to assume that a debtor wants all the money he has for his maintenance thus the marshal demanded four shillings and sixpence on admission the turnkey eighteenpence the deputy marshal a shilling the clerk of the papers a shilling four tipstaffs ten shillings between them and the tipstaff for bringing the prisoner from the court six shillings these dues paid i was assigned a room on the groundfloor of the great building it was shared with another and my imprisonment began it was matthews revenge and mr probuss first plan of reduction to submission but i did not submit thus i was trapped by the cunning of a man whom i believe to have been veritably possessed of a devil that there are such men we know very well from holy writ their signs are a wickedness which shrinks from nothing a pitiless nature a constant desire for things of this world and lastly as happens always to such men the transformation of what they desire when they do get it into dust and ashes or its vanishing quite away never to be seen touched or enjoyed any more these signs were all visible in the history of mr probus as you shall hear possessed beyond a doubt by a foul fiend was this man whom then i had every reason to hate and fear now i cannot but feel a mingled terror and pity when exemplary punishment overtakes and overwhelms one who commits crimes which make even the convicts in the condemned cell to shake and shudder his end was horrible and terrible but it was a fitting end to such a life tom shirley came with alice to visit me in my new lodging he looked about him cheerfully the new place he said is more airy and spacious than the old prison on the other side of the road where i spent a year or two this is quite a handsome court the building is a palace the recreation ground is a park but without trees or grass the three passages painted green remind me somehow of spring gardens the numbers of people make me think of cheapside or ludgate hill the shops no doubt contain every luxury the society if mixed is harmonious in a word tom i am very lucky to get here there might be worse places and hark ye lad if there is not another fiddler in the bench you will make in a week twice as much in the prison as you can make out of it nothing cheers a prisoner more than the strains of a fiddle this gave me hope i began to see that i might live even in this place there are one or two objections to the place this optimist philosopher went on i have observed for instance a certain languor which steals over mind and body in a prison some have compared it with the growth they call mildew have a care will practise daily i have known a musician leave this place fit for nothing but to play for jack in the green look at the people as they pass yonder pretty fellow is too lazy to get his stockings darned that fellow slouching after him cannot stoop to pull up his stockings that other thrusts his feet into his slippers without pulling up the heels there goes one who has worn i warrant you his morning gown all day for years he cannot even get the elbows darned keep up thy heart lad before long we will get thee into the rules he visited my room ha he said neat clean commodious with a fine view of the parade with life and activity before ones eyes he forgot that he had just remarked on the languor and the mildew of the prison observe the racquet players there are finer players here than anywhere else i believe and those who do not play at racquets may find recreation at fives and those who are not active enough for fives may choose to play at bumble puppy well will alice will come back to me with the boy she can come here every morning if you wish patience lad patience we will get thee before long within the rules it is possible by the warders permission to go into the rules but the prisoner must pay down l for the first l of his debts and l for every subsequent l now i had not ten shillings in the world when i look back upon the memory of that time when i think of the treatment of prisoners and of the conduct of the prison and when i reflect that nothing is altered at the present day i am amazed at the wonderful apathy of people as regards the sufferings of othersit may become at any time their own case at their carelessness as concerns injustice and oppressionyet subject every one to the same oppression and cruelty what for instance is more monstrous than the fact that a man who has been arrested by writ has to pay fees to the prison for every separate writ if he has no money he is still held liable so that even if his friends are willing to pay his debts with the exorbitant costs of the attorney there are still the fees to be paid and even if the prisoners friends are willing to release him there is still the warden who must be satisfied before he suffers his prisoner to go again what can be more iniquitous than the license allowed to attorneys in the matter of their costs many a prisoner originally arrested for a debt of four or five pounds or even less finds after a while that the attorneys costs amount to twenty or thirty pounds more he might be able to discharge the debt alone the costs make it impossible the creditor might let him go the attorney will never let him go the friends might club together to pay the debt they cannot pay the costs the attorney abates nothing hoping that compassion will induce the mans friends to release him in some cases they do in others the attorney finds that he has overreached himself and that the prisoner dies of that incurable disease which we call captivity at first sight the parade and the open court of the prison present an appearance of animation the men playing racquets have a little crowd gathered round them there are others playing skittles children run about shouting there are the shrill voices of women quarrelling or arguing the crowd is always moving about there are men at tables smoking and drinking the tapsters run about with bottles of wine and jugs of beer there are women admitted to see their friends husbands and brothers and to bring them gifts alas when i rememberthe sight comes back to me in dreamsthe sadness and the earnestness in their faces and the compassion and the lovethe womans love which endures all and survives all and conquers alli wish that i had the purse of croesus to set these captives free even though it would enrich the attorney whose wiles have brought them to this place one has not to look long before the misery of it is too plainly apparent above the show of cheerful carelessness one sees the wives of the prisoners their husbands play racquets and drink about and of an evening sit in the tavern bawling songs the poor women ragged and draggled come forth carrying their babes to get a little air their faces are stamped with the traces of days and weeks and years of privation the prison has destroyed the husbands sense of duty to his wife he will not if he can work for his family he lives upon such doles as he can extract from his family or hers worse still men lose their sense of shame they say what they please and care not who hears they introduce companions and care not what is said or thought about them things are said openly that no christian should hear things are done openly that no christian should witness or should know there are many hundreds of children within these accursed walls god help them if they understand what they hear and what they see in the prison there are many kinds of debtors there is the debtor who is always angry at the undeserved misery of his lot sometimes his wrongs drive him mad in earnest then the poor wretch is removed to bedlam where he remains until his death there is next the despairing debtor who sits as one in a dream and will never be comforted there is the philosophical debtor who accepts his fate and makes the best of it there is the meek and miserable debtorgenerally some small tradesman who has been taught that the greatest disgrace possible is that which has actually fallen upon him there is the debtor who affects the beau and carries his snuffbox with an air there is the debtor who was a gentleman and can tell of balls at st jamess there is the ruffler who swaggers on the parade looking out for newcomers and inviting those who have money to play with him as for the women they are like the men there are the wives of the prisoners who fall for the most part into a draggled condition like their husbands there are ladies who put on sumptuous array and flaunt it daily on the parade stories are whispered about them there are others about whom it is unnecessary to tell stories in a word it is a place where the same wickedness goes on as one may find outside there is a chapel in the middle of the great building service is held once a week but the attendance is thin there is a taproom which is crowded all day long here men sit over their cups from morning till evening there is a coffeeroom where tea and coffee can be procured and where the newspapers are read this is a great place for the politicians of whom there are many in the prison indeed i know not where politics are so eagerly debated as in the kings bench the kings bench prison is a wonderful place for the observation of fortune and her caprices there was a societycall it not a clubconsisting entirely of gentlemen who had been born to good estates and had suffered ruin through no fault of their own these gentlemen admitted me to their company we dined together at the ordinary and conversed after dinner one of them born to an easy fortune was ruined by the discovery of a parchment entitling him to another estate there was a lawsuit lasting for twenty years he then lost it and found that the whole of his own estate had gone too another a gentleman of large estate married an heiress her extravagancies ran through both her own fortune and her husbands she lived with him in the prison and daily being now a shrew as well as a slattern reproached him with the ruin she herself had caused there was a young fellow who had fallen among lawyers and been ruined by them he now studied law intending as soon as he got out to commence attorney and to practise the tricks and rogueries he had learned from his former friends another had bought a seat in the house of commons and a place with it but at the next election he lost his seat and his place too and another was a great scholar in arabic his captivity affected him not one whit because he had his books and could work in the prison as well as out with such companions i endeavoured to keep aloof from the drinking and roystering crew which made the prison disorderly and noisy yet as i will show you directly i was the nightly servant of the roysterers you have heard of tom shirleys judgment that in every debtors prison the collegians if they do not as many do go about in filthy rags and tatters are all slatterns some can afford to dress with decency and cleanliness not to speak of fashion which would be indeed out of place in the kings bench even those care not to observe the customs of the outside world the ruffles are no longer white or no longer visible the waistcoat is unbuttoned the coat is powdered the wig is uncurled those who wear their own hair leave it hanging over the ears instead of tying it neatly with a black ribbon behind this general neglect of dress corresponds with the universal neglect of morals which prevails throughout the prison everything conspires to drag down and to degrade the unfortunate prisoner the hopelessness of his lot the persecution of his enemies the uncertainty about the daily bread the freedom with which drink is offered about by those who coll it ie in the language of the place who have money the temptation to do as others do and forget his sorrows over a bowl of punch speedily contaminate the prisoner and make him in all respects like unto those around him i have said already that if it is bad for men it is worse for women let me draw a veil over this side of the kings bench suffice it to say that one who has written on the prisons has declared that if diana herself and her nymphs were to be imprisoned for twelve months in the kings bench at the end of that time they would all be fit companions for messalina it is not only from their rags that the poverty of the prisoners is betrayed one may learn from their hollow cheeks their eager eyes their feeble gait that manytoo manyare suffering from want of food it is true that the law of the land gives to every prisoner a groatfourpence a dayto be paid by the detaining creditor yet the groat is not always paid and can only be obtained if the creditor refuses it by legal steps which a man destitute of money cannot take what attorney will take up the case of a man without a farthing if the debtor wins his case how is he to pay the attorney and costs out of fourpence a day if he wishes to plead in forma pauperis the law allows the warder to charge six shillings and eightpence for leave to go to the court and half a crown for the turnkey to take him therewhat prisoner on the poor side can pay these fees so that when a prisoner is really poor he cannot get his groats at all for the creditor will not pay them unless he is obliged again there are other ways of evading the law if a debtor surrenders in june there is no court till november and the creditor need not pay anything till the order of the court is issued there are a few doles and charities but these amount to no more than about l a year say two pounds a week or six shillings a day now there are prisoners as a rule how many of these are on the poor side and how far will six shillings a day go among these starving wretches there are also the boxes into which a few shillings a day are dropped but how far will these go among so many it is within my certain knowledge that many would die of sheer starvation every week were it not for the kindness of those but one step above them if for instance one would understand what poverty may mean he must visit the common side of the kings bench prison those who have visited the courts and narrow lanes of wapping report terrible stories of rags and filth but the people by hook or by crook get food in the prison there is neither hook nor crook the prisoner unless he knows a trade which may be useful in that place unless he can repair shoes and clothes unless he can shave and dress the hair cannot earn a penny look at these poor wretches slinking about the courts hoping to attract the compassion of some visitor see them uncombed unwashed unshaven their long hair hanging over their ears a horrid bristling beard upon their chin their faces wan with insufficient food their eyes eagerly glancing here and there to catch a look of pity a dole or a loan if you follow them to the misery of the common side where they are thrust at night you will see creatures more wretched still these can go abroad even though skewers take the place of buttons these have shoeswhich once had toes these have beds of a kind there are others who have no beds but lie on the floor who have no blankets and never take off their rags who go barefooted and bareheaded remember that their lifelong imprisonment was imposed upon them because they could not pay a debt of a pound or two their pound or two by reason of the attorneys costs and the wardens fees has grown and swelled till it has reached the amount of l or l or anything you will no one can release them the only thing to be hoped is that cold and starvation may speedily bring them to the endthe long sleep in the graveyard of st georges church i speedily found that i could manage to live pretty well by means of my fiddle almost every evening there was some drinking party which engaged my services i played for them the old tunes to which they sang their songs about wine and womenbawling them at the top of their voices they paid me as much as i could expect by good luck there was no other fiddler in the place a harpist there was and a fluteplayer we sometimes agreed together to give a concert in the coffeeroom i continued this life for about six months making enough money every week to pay my way at the ordinary perhapsi know notthe prison was already beginning to work its way with me and to reduce me as tom shirley said to the condition of a fiddler to jack in the green i had a visit after some three months from mr probus he came one day into the prison i saw him standing on the pavement looking round him some of the collegians knew him they whispered and looked at him with the face that means death if that were possible one man stepped forward and cursed him dog he said if i had you outside this accursed place i would make an end of you sir said mr probus at whose heels marched a turnkey you do me an injustice for which you will one day be sorry am i your detaining creditor the man cursed him again i know not why and turned on his heel then i stepped forward did you come here to gloat over your work mr probus mr william i hope you are well sir the prison air i find is fresh from the fields you look better than i expected to be sure it is early days you are only just beginning you will be sorry to hear that i am very well i would have speech in a retired place mr william you want once more to dangle your bribe before me i understand sir very well what you would say then let me say it here your cousin i may say deplores deeply this new disgrace to the family he earnestly desires to remove it i am again empowered to purchase an imaginary reversion mr william he will now make it l will that content you nothing will content me there is some secret reason for this persecution you wantyounot my cousinto get access to this great sum of money well mr probus my opinion is that my cousin will die before me and since i am firmly persuaded upon that point and since i believe that you think so too my answer is the same as before then he said stay here and rot he looked round the prison it is a pleasant place for a young man to spend his days is it not all his daystill an attack of gaol fever or smallpox visits the place eh eh eh then you will be sorry i shall never be sorry mr probus to have frustrated any plots and designs of yours be assured of thatand for the rest do your worst he slowly walked away without a word but all the devil in his soul flared in his eyes as he turned you do wrong said the turnkey who had accompanied him tis the keenest of his kind not another attorney in all london has brought us not to speak of the fleet and newgate more prisoners than mr probus for hunting up detainers and running up the costs he has no equal he is my detaining creditor i said the turnkey shrugged his shoulders young gentleman he said i see that you are a gentleman although you are a fiddlertake advice agree with his terms quickly whatever they are he made you an offertake it before he lands you in another court with new writs and more costs in fact the very next day i heard that there was another writ in the name of one john merridew sheriffs officer for fifty pounds alleged to have been lent to me by him as for mr john merridew i knew not even the name of the man and i had never borrowed sixpence of anyone i showed the writ to my friend the turnkey he read it with admiration i told you so he said what a man he is and merridew toomerridew and you never borrowed the money and never saw the man what a man what a man merridew too under his thumb theres ability for you theres resource i murmured something not complimentary indeed i knew nothing at that time of merridew ah he means to keep you here until you accept his offer better take it now then hell let you go for his costs he wont give up the costs what a man it is and youve never set eyes on john merridew have you what a man he knows john merridew you see why between themhe looked at me meaningly and laid his hand upon my shoulder take my advice sir take my advice and accept that offer of his elsei dont say mind but merridewmerridewhe placed his thumb upon the left side of my neck and pressed it manymanyhave gone that waythrough merridew and probus rules merridew end of book i part ii out of the frying pan into the fire chapter i release you have read how a certain lady came to the prison how she spoke with two prisoners of the baser sort in a manner familiar and yet scornful and how she addressed me and appeared moved and astonished on hearing my name i thought little more about her save as an agreeable vision in the midst of the rags and sordidness of the prison now growing dailyalasmore familiar and less repulsive for this is the way in the kings bench she came however a second time and this time she came to visit me it was in the morning alice was in my room with her the boy now in his second year so strong that he could not be kept from pulling himself up by the help of a chair she was showing me his ways and his tricks rejoicing in the wilfulness and strength of the child i was watching and listening my pride and happiness in the boy dashed by the thought that he must grow up to be ashamed of his father as a prison bird prison has no greater sting than the thought of your childrens shame for the time went on and day after day only made release appear more impossible how could i get out who had no friends and could save no money i had now been in prison for nearly a year i began to look for nothing more than to remain there for all my life while i was looking at the boy and sadly thinking of these things i heard a quick light step outside followed by a gentle tap at the door and lo there entered the lady who had spoken with those two sons of belial and with me i said i would come again she smiled and it was as if the sunshine poured into the room she gave me her hand and it was like a hand dragging me out of the slough of despond your room she said is not so bad considering the place this lady is your wife madam your most respectful so she curtseyed low and alice did the like then she saw the child oh she cried the pretty boy the lovely boy she snatched him and tossed him crowing and laughing and covered him with kisses oh the light soft silky hair she cried oh the sweet blue eyes oh the pretty face master will halliday you are to be envied even in this place your cousin matthew hath no such blessing as this matthew is not even married indeed perhaps if he is this as well as other blessings has been denied him she replied with a little change in her face as if a cloud had suddenly fallen but it quickly passed i could observe that alice regarded her visitor with admiration and curiosity this was a kind of woman unknown to my girl who knew nothing of the world or of fine ladies they were outside her own experience the two women wore a strange contrast to each other alice with her serious air of meditation and her grave eyes might have sat to a painter for the spirit of music or for st cecilia herself or indeed for any saint or muse or heathen goddess who must show in her face a heavenly sweetness of thought with holy meditation all the purity and tenderness of religion lay always in the face of alice our visitor on the other hand would have sat more fitly for the queen of love or the spirit of earthly love truly she was more beautiful than any other woman whom i had ever seen or imagined i thought her beautiful on the stage but then her face was covered with the crimson paint by which actresses have to spoil their cheeks off the stage it was the beauty of venus herself a beauty which invited love a beauty altogether soft in every point soft and sweet and caressing eyes that were limpid and soft a blooming cheek which needed no paint which was as soft as velvet and as delicately coloured as a peach lips smiling rosy red and soft her hands her voice her laugh everything about this heavenly creature i say invited and compelled and created love you think that as one already sworn to love and comfort another woman i speak with reprehensible praise well i have already confessedit is not a confession of shamethat i loved her from the very first from the time when she spoke to me first i am not ashamed of loving her alice knows that i have always loved her you shall hear presently why i need not be ashamed and why i loved her if i may say so as a sister it is possible to love a woman without thoughts of earthly love to admire her loveliness to respect her to worship her yet not as an earthly lover such love as petrarch felt for laura i felt for this sweet and lovely woman she gave back the child to his mother mr will halliday she said it is not only for the child that thou art blessed above other menlooking so intently upon alice that the poor girl blushed and was confused sure she said it is a face which i have seen in a picture she was a witch she drew all hearts to her yet not like circe to their ruin and undoing and if she was soft and kind of speech she was also generous of heart she was always as i was afterwards to find out helping others how she helped me you shall hear meantime i must not forget that her face showed a most remarkable virginal innocence it seemed natural to her face a part of it that it should proclaim a perfect maidenly innocence of soul i know that many things have been said about her for my own part i care to know nothing more about her than she herself has been pleased to tell me i choose to believe that the innocence in her face proclaimed the innocence of her life and with this innocence a face which was always changing with every mood that crossed her mind moved by every touch of passion sensitive as an aeolian harp to every breath of wind she sat down on the bed i told you that i would come again she said do not take me for a curious and meddlesome person madam she turned to alice i come because i know something about your husbands cousin matthew if you will favour me i should like to know the meaning of this imprisonment and what matthew has to do with it so i told the whole story the clause in my fathers will the attempt made to persuade me to sell my chance of the succession the threats used by mr probus the alleged debt for his harpsichord and the alleged debt to one john merridew she heard the whole patiently then she nodded her head probus i know though he does not happily know me of the man merridew also i know something he is a sheriffs officer by trade but he has more trades than one probus is an attorney but he too has more trades than one my friends this is the work of probus i see probus in it from the beginning i conjecture that merridew for some consideration has borrowed money from probus more than he can repay therefore he has to do whatever probus orders mr probus is matthews attorney yes an attorney does not commit crimes for his client unless he is well paid for it i do not know what it means except that matthew wants money which does not surprise me matthew is a partner in the house of halliday brothers he has beside a large fortune which should have been mine yet matthew may want money i am not a lawyer but i suppose that if you sell your chance to him he can raise money on the succession i suppose so probus must want money too else he would not have committed the crime of imprisoning you on a false charge of debt well we need not waste time in asking why the question is first of all how to get you out alice clutched her little one to her heart and her colour vanished by which i understood the longing that was in her to get me out madam i have no friends in the world who could raise ten pounds nevertheless mr will a body may ask how much is wanted to get you out there is the alleged debt for the harpsichord of fiftyfive pounds there is also the alleged debt due to mr john merridew of fifty pounds there are the costs and there are the fines or garnish without which one cannot leave the place say perhaps in all a hundred and fifty pounds it is not much i think i can find a manshe laughedwho out of his singular love to you will give the money to take you out you know a man madame i protestthere is no one in the whole worldwho would do such a thing yet if i assure you oh madame will alice fell on her knees and clasped her hand see it is herself herself illustration alice fell on her knees and clasped her hand but whywhy i asked incredulous because she is all goodness alice cried the tears rolling down her face all goodness madame laughed yes i am indeed all goodness get up dear woman and go on thinking that if you can all goodness and she laughed scornfully a hundred and fifty pounds she repeated yes i think i know where to get this money are we dreaming i asked but will she became very serious i must be plain with you it is certain to me that the man probus has got some hold over your cousin otherwise he would not be so impatient for you to sell your reversion some day i will show you why i think this learn moreover that the man probus is a man of one passion only he wants money he wants nothing else it is his only desire to get money if anybody interferes with his money getting he will grind that man to powder you have interfered with him he has thrust you into prison do not believe that when you are out he will cease to persecute you what am i to do then if you come to terms with him he will at once cease his persecution come to terms with him his terms must mean a great sum of money for himself not for youor for your cousin else he would not be so eager i can never accept his terms i said he will go on then if it is a very large sum of money he will stick at nothing then what am i to do keep out of his way for believe me there is nothing that he will not attempt to get you once more in his power consider he put you in here knowing that you are penniless he calculates that the time will come when you will be so broken by imprisonment that you will be ready to make any terms nayhe thinks that the prison air will kill you the lord will protect us said alice madame looked up with surprise they say that on the stage she said what does it mean it means that we are all in the hands of the lord without his will not even a sparrow falleth to the ground madame shook her head at least she said we must do what we can to protect ourselves she rose i am going now to get that money you shall hear from me in a day or two perhaps it may take a week before you are finally released but keep up your hearts she took the child again and kissed him then she gave him back to his mother you are a good woman she said your face is good your voice is good what you say is good but remember add to what you call the protection of the lord a few precautions to stand between such an one as probus and the money that he is hunting is like standing between a tigress and her prey he will have no mercy there is no wickedness that he will hesitate to devise what he will do next i know not but it will be something that belongs to his master the devil the lord will protect us alice repeated laying her hand on the flaxen hair of her child we stared at each other when she was gone will asked alice with suffused eyes and dropping voice is she an angel from heaven an angel doubtlessbut not from heavenyet my dear it is the actress who charmed us when we went to the playon our weddingday it is miss jenny wilmot herself oh if all actresses are like her yet they saywill she shall have at least our prayers three or four days laterthe time seemed many yearsan attorney came to see me not such an attorney as mr probus a gentleman of open countenance and pleasant manners he came to tell me that my business was done and that after certain dues were paidwhich were provided fori could walk out of the prison sir i said i beg you to convey to miss jenny wilmot my benefactress my heartfelt gratitude i will mr halliday i perceive that you know her name let me beg you not to wait upon her in person to be sure she has left drury lane and you do not know her present address it is enough that she has been able to benefit you and that you have sent her a becoming message of gratitude but sir one word of caution she bids you remember that you have an implacable enemy take care therefore take care chapter ii how i got a new place so i was free for twentyfour hours i was like a boy on the first day of his holidays i exulted in my liberty i ran about the meadows and along the embankment i got into a boat and rowed up and down the river but when the first rapture of freedom was spent i remembered that free or within stone walls i had still to earn a living i had but one way i must find a place in an orchestra at the dog and duck where my brotherinlaw still led there was no place for me there are however a great many taverns with gardens and dancing and singing places and bands of music i set off to find one where they wanted a fiddle i went i believe the whole round of themfrom the temple of flora to the white conduit house and from bermondsey spa to the assembly rooms at hampstead had all the world turned fiddler everywhere the same replyno vacancy meantime we were living on the bounty of my brotherinlaw whose earnings were scanty for his own modest house then i thought of the organ of course my place at st georges borough was filled up there are about a hundred churches in london however most of them have organs i tried every one and always with the same result the place was filled i thought of my old trade of fiddling to the sailors would you believe it there was not even a tavern parlour where they wanted a fiddle to make the sailors dance and drink had mr probus been able to keep me out of everything alice did her best to sustain my courage she preserved a cheerful countenance she brushed my coat and hat in the morning with a word of encouragement she welcomed me home when i returned footsore and with an aching heart why even in the far darker time that presently followed she preserved the outward form of cheerfulness and the inner heart of faith the weeks passed on my bad luck remained i could hear of no work not even temporary work i began to think that even the prison where i could at least earn my two or three shillings a day was better than freedom i began also to think that mr probus must have all the orchestras and musicgalleries in his own power together with all the churches that had organs my shoes wore out and could not be replaced my appearance was such as might be expected when for most of the time i had nothing between bread and cheese and beer for breakfast and bread and cheese and beer for supper and i think that the miserable figure i presented was often the cause of rejection chancesay providencehelped me i was walking sadly enough by charing cross one afternoon being weary hungry and dejected when i heard a voice cry out will halliday will halliday are you deaf i turned round it was madame my benefactress my patroness she was in a hackney coach illustration i turned around it was madam come in she cried stopping her driver come in with me i obeyed nothing loth why she said looking at me what is the matter your cheeks are hollow your face is pale your limbs are shaking worse stillyou are shabby what has happened i could make no reply your sweet wifeand the lovely boy they are well when a man has been living for many weeks on insufficient food when he has been turned away at every application he may be forgiven if he loses on small provocation his selfcontrol i am not ashamed to say that her kind words and her kind looks were too much for me in my weak condition i burst into tears she laid her hand on my arm will she said as if she were a sister you shall tell me allbut you shall go home with me and we will talk i observed that the coachman drove up st martins lane and through a collection of streets which i had never seen before it was the part called st giless a place which is a kind of laystall into which are shot every day quantities of the scum dirt and refuse of this huge and overgrown city i looked out of the window upon a crowd of faces more villainous than one could conceive possible stamped with the brand of cain they were lying about in the doorways at the open windows for it was the month of september and a warm day and on the doorsteps and in the unpaved unlit squalid streets never did i see so many ragged and naked brats never did i see so many cripples so many hunchbacks so many deformed people they were of all kindsbandylegged knockkneed those whose shins curve outward like a bow roundbacked oneeyed blind lame they are the beggars said my companion their deformities mean drink they mean the mothers who drink and drop the babies about beggars and thievesthey are the people of st giless i wonder you come this way are you not afraid they will not hurt me i wish they would she added with a sigh a strange wish i was soon however to understand what she meant certainly no one molested us or stopped the coach we passed through these streets into high street holborn and to st giless church where the criminal on his way to tyburn receives his last drink then by another turn into a noble square with a garden surrounded by great houses of which the greatest was built for the unfortunate duke of monmouth the coachman stopped before one of these houses on the east side of the square it was a very fine and noble mansion indeed i threw open the door of the coach and handed madame down the steps this is my house she said will you come in with me i followed marvelling how an actress could be so great a lady but still i remembered how she spoke familiarly to those two villains in the kings bench prison the doors flew open within a row of a dozen tall hulking fellows in livery stood up to receive madame she walked through them with an air that belonged to a duchess then she turned into a small room on the left hand and threw herself into a chair so she said with these varlets i am a great lady here and in your company will i am nothing but she paused and sighed i will tell you another time i think i was more surprised at the familiarity with which she addressed me than with the splendour of the place this room for instance though but little was lofty and its walls were painted with flowers and birds silver candlesticks each with two branches stood on the mantelshelf which was a marvel of fine carving a rich carpet covered the floor there were two or three chairs and a table in white and gold a portrait of madame hung over the fireplace forgive me my friend she sprang from the chair and pulled the bell rope before we talk you must take some dinner she gave her orders in a quick peremptory tone as one accustomed to be obeyed in a few minutes the table was spread with a white cloth and laid out with a cold chicken a noble ham a loaf of bread and a bottle of madeira you may imagine that i made very little delay in sitting down to these good things heavens how good they were after the prolonged diet of bread and cheese madame looked on and waited her chin in her hand when i desisted at length she poured out another glass of madeira tell me she said your sweet wife and the lovely boyare they as hungry as you i shook my head sadly we shall see presently what we can do meantime tell me the whole story i told her briefly that my story was nothing at all but the story of a man out of employment who could not find any and was slowly dropping into shabbiness of appearance and weakness of body no work why i supposed you would go back tototo something in the city though my father was a knight and a lord mayor i am a simple musician by trade i am not a gentleman i like you all the better she replied smiling i am not a gentlewoman either the actress is a rogue and a vagabond so is the musician i suppose i stared was she then still an actressand living in this stately palace you are a musician do you then want to find work as a fiddler that is what i am looking for let us consider do you play like aagentleman or like one of the calling i am one of the calling when i tell you that i used to live by fiddling for sailors to dance say no moresay no more they are the finest critics in the world if you please them it is enough why should i not engage you myself youengageme youmadame friend will she laid her hand on mine there are reasons why i wish you well and would stand by you if i could i will tell you another day what those reasons are let me treat you as a friend when we are alone i am not madame i am jenny there are some women who if they said such a thing as this would be taken as declaring the passion of love no one could look at jennys face which was all simplicity and candour and entertain the least suspicion of such a thing nay i can only marvel i said for i still thought that i was talking to some great lady i think that i must be dreaming since you know not where you are this is the soho assembly and i am madame vallance i seemed to have heard of madame vallance you know nothing that is because you have been in the kings bench i will now tell you what nobody else knows that madame vallance is jenny wilmot i have left the stage for a time to avoid a certain person here if i go among the company i can wear a domino and remain unknown do you know nothing about us we have masquerades galas routseverything come with me i will show you my ball room she led me up the grand staircase from the hall into a most noble room on the walls were hung many mirrors between the mirrors were painted cupids and flowers rout seats were placed all round the room the hanging candelabra contained hundreds of candles at one end stood a music gallery will she said go upstairs and play me something i obeyed i found an instrument which i tuned then i stood up in the gallery and played she stood below listening well played she cried now play me a dance tune see if you can make me dance i played a tune which i had often played to the jolly sailors i know not what it is called it is one of those tunes which run in at the ears and down to the heels which it makes as light as a feather and as quick silver for nimbleness in a minute she was dancingwith such grace such spirit such quickness of motion as if every limb was without weight and her fair face smiling and her blue eyes dancingnever was there such a figure of grace as for the step it was as if invented on the spot but i believe that she had learned it afraid of tiring her i laid down the violin and descended into the hall she gave me both her hands will she said you will make my fortune if you consent to join my orchestra there never was such playing those sailors how could they let you go now listen i can pay you thirty shillings will you come the treasury pays every saturday morning you shall have besides four weeks in advance spend it in generous food after your long lent saywill you accept it is too much jenny i took her hand and kissed it first you take me out of prison then you give me the means of living how can i thank you sufficiently how repay there is nothing to repay i will tell you another time why i take an interest in you when the most beautiful woman in the world stop will i warn you there must be no lovemaking i suppose she saw the irresistible admiration in my eyes oh i am not angry but compliments of that kind generally lead to lovemaking they all try it but it is quite uselessnow she added with a sigh and you of all men must not i made no reply not knowing what to say there is another face in your home will that is far more beautiful than mine think of that face enough said i protest i began she laid her hand upon my lips there must be no compliments she said her voice was severe but her smiling eyes forgave i left her and hastened home with dancing feet i was returning with an engagement of thirty shillings a week i had four weeks pay in my pocket fortune once more smiled upon me i ran in and kissed my wife with an alacrity and a cheerfulness which rejoiced her as much as it astonished her i threw down the money take it my dear i said there is more to come we are saved again oh alicewe are savedand by the same hand as before i have heard of madame vallance said tom presently she comes from no one knows where she keeps herself secluded at the assemblies she always wears a mask the people say she is generous some think she is rich others that the expense of the place must break her i hope she is another croesus i said i hope that the river of pactolus will flow into her lap i hope she will inherit the mines of golgonda i hope she will live a thousand years and marry a prince and we will drink her health in a bowl of punch this very night chapter iii the masquerade i commenced my duties in the music gallery on one of the nights devoted to the amusement called the masquerade it was an amusement new to me and to all except those who can afford to spend five guineas besides the purchase of a dress on the pleasure of a single night i understand the masquerade has taken a great hold upon the fashionable world and upon those who have money to spend and are eager for the excitement of a new pleasure givegive is the cry of those who live day by day for the pleasure of the moment truly in a masquerade there is everything the novelty or the beauty of the disguise the music the dancing the revelry after supper the gambling the pursuit of beauty in disguiseit is wonderful to reflect in the quiet corner of the earth in which i write that across the atlantic in london city there are thousands who are never happy save when they are crowded together seeking such excitement as is afforded by the masquerade the assembly the promenade and the pleasure garden here we have no such excitements and we want none life for us flows in a tranquil stream for them it flows away in waterfalls and cataracts leaping to the sea madame managed her masquerades as she did everything with the greatest care she arranged everything the selection of the music the decorations the supper even the chalking of the floor the doors were thrown open at eleven long before that hour the square was filled with people some were come to see the fashionable throng arrivethe fine dresses of the ladies and the masquerading of the men some were come to pick the pockets of the others there was no confusion the hackney coaches and the chairs were directed by madames servants who stood outside to arrive by one road and to depart by another thus one after the other without quarrelling or fighting drove to the doors deposited their company and departed the same order was observed in the departure for my own part as there was nothing to do before eleven i amused myself by going round and seeing the rooms all lit up with candles in sconces or by candelabra and painted with flowers and fruit and cupids even to the ceiling and hung with costly curtains it is a large and spacious house of commanding appearance built by an earl of carlisle there is a grand staircase broad and stately when a welldressed company are going up and down it looks like the staircase of a palace on the landing i found flowers in pots and bushes in tubs which gave the place a rural appearance and so might lead the thoughts of the visitor insensibly into the country there are a great many rooms in the original house which has been very handsomely increased by the addition of two large chambers one above the other built out at the back over part of the garden one of these new rooms was the ball room which i have already mentioned the other room below it equally large but not so high was used as the supperroom it had its walls painted with dancing satyrs and fauns gilded pilasters raised an inch or so relieved the flatness of the wall this was the supperroom for the moment it had nothing in it but long narrow tables arranged down the room in rows the servants were already beginning to spread upon them the napery and lay the knives and forks for supper on the groundfloor on the right hand of the entrance hall was a large room used as a card room here stood a long table covered with a green cloth for the players of those games which require a bank or a large company they are hazard lansquenet loo faro and i know not how many more but whatever their names they all mean the same thing and only one thing viz gambling along the wall on either side were small tables for parties of two or four who came to play quadrille whist piquet ecarte and the likegames more dangerous to the young and the beginner than the more noisy gambling of the crowd candles stood on all the small tables and down the middle of the great table there were also candles in sconces on the wall as yet none of them were lit while i was looking round the empty room madame herself came in dressed in white satin and carrying her domino in her hand i look into every room she said before the doors are open but into this room i look two or three times every evening you come to look at the players i have a particular reason for coming here i will tell you some time or otherperhaps tonight will if so it will be the greatest surprise of your lifethe very greatest surprise yesi watch the players their faces amuse me when i see a man losing time after time and remaining calm and unmoved i say to myself there is a gentleman play is the finest test of good breeding when a man curses his luck curses his neighbour for bringing him bad luck bangs the table with his fist and calls upon all the gods to smite him dead i say to myself that is a city spark i fear i am a city spark when i see two sitting together at a table quiet and alone i ask myself which is the sharper and which is the flat by watching them for a few minutes i can always find outone of them always is the sharper you see and the other always the flat and if you watch them for a few minutes you can always find out beware of this room will be neither sharper nor flat she turned and went off to see some other room looking out at the back i saw that the garden had been hung with coloured lamps and looked gay and bright it was a warm fine evening there would be many who would choose the garden for a promenade other rooms there were the blue room the star room the red room the chinese room i know not what nor for what they were all used but the time approached i climbed up the steep stairs and took my place in the music gallery where already most of the orchestra were assembled like them i tuned my violin and then waited the arrival of the company they came by tickets which included supper each ticket cost five guineas and admitted one gentleman or two ladies including supper it seems a monstrous price for a single evening but the cost of the entertainment was enormous the ticket itself was a beautiful thing representing venus with cupids they were gazing with interest upon a nymph lying beside a fountain she had as yet nothing upon her and she was apparently engaged in thinking what she would wear for the evening a pretty thing prettily drawn but five guineas for a single evening as soon as the doors were thrown open a line of footmen received the company took their tickets and showed them into the tearoom where that refreshment was offered before the ball commenced when this room was full the doors leading to the ballrooms and the other rooms were also thrown open and the company streamed along the great gallery which was lined with flowering shrubs here was stationed a small string band playing soft and pleasing music then they crowded up the grand staircase when most of the masqueraders were within the ballroom and before they had done looking about them and crying out for astonishment at the mirrors and the candelabra and the lights we struck up the music in the gallery and as soon as order was a little restored the minuets began for my own part i love to look upon dancing the countrydance expresses the happiness of youth and the gladness of life the hey and jig are rustic joys which cannot keep still but must needs jump about to show their pleasure but the minuet expresses the refinement the courtesies the politeness of life it is artificial but the politeness of fashion in the civilized world must be acknowledged to be an improvement on mere nature which is too often barbarous in its expression and coarse in its treatment i know not any of our music which could be played to such a dance of savages as the guinea traders report from the west coast and the bight of benin the company flowed in fast all except a few who kept about the doors and did not venture in the crowd were in masquerade dress and even those who were not carried dominoes in their hands one would have thought the whole world had sent representatives to the ball there were pigtailed chinese dervishes in turbans american indians with tomahawks arabs in long silken robes negroes and negresses proud castilians scots in plaid monks and romish priests nuns and sisters milkmaids in dowlass ploughboys in smocks lawyers soldiers and sailors there were gods and goddesses venus came clad much like her figure in the books diana carried her bow the graces endeavoured to appear as they are commonly represented apollo came with his lyre mars with his shield and spear vulcan with his lame leg hercules with his club there were dozens of cupids there were dozens of queens cleopatra dido mary queen of scots and queen elizabeth there were famous kings as henry the fifth henry the eighth charles the first and charles the second there were potentates as the pope the sultan the grand cham prester john and the emperor of china there were famous women mostly kings favourites as the fairhaired editha fair rosamund jane shore the most beautiful of london maidens and merry nell gwynne once an orange girl there were half a dozen ladies representing joan of arc in armour there was a bearward leading a man dressed as a bear who made as if he would hug the women at which they screamed in pretended affright and danced to the music of a crowd there were gipsies and fortunetellers there were two girlsnobody knew who they wereone of whom danced on a tightrope while the other turned somersaults there were harlequin columbine pantaloon and clown as if straight from drury lane there was the showman who put his show in a corner and loudly proclaimed the wonders that were within there was the cheap jack in another corner who pretended to sell everything there was the itinerant quack who bawled his nostrums for prolonging life and restoring youth and arresting beauty there was the orange girl of drury lane impudent and ready with an answer and a joke to anything there were dancinggirls who ran in and out cleared a space danced then ran to another place and danced again i learned afterwards that the dancers and tumblers with many of the masks were actors actresses and dancinggirls hired from the theatre by madame herself in order to ensure vivacity and activity and movement in the evening if these things were neglected or left to the masquers themselves the assembly would fall quite flat very few persons having the least power to play any part or keep up any character punchinello for instance trod the floor with a face like a physician for solemnity the clown could not dance or laugh or make other people laugh and so with the women they thought their part was played as soon as they were dressed meantime the music played on without stopping after the minuets we proceeded to the country dance but you must not think that at the masquerade we conducted our dancing with the same order and form as an ordinary assembly i looked down upon a scene which was quite unlike the ordinary assembly and yet was the most beautiful the most animated the most entrancing that i had ever witnessed the room was like a flowerbed in july filled with flowers of every colour it was enough at first to look at the whole company as one might look upon a garden filled with flowers presently i began to detach couples or small groups first i observed the fair domino who lured on the amorous youthdressed perhaps as a monkby running away and yet looking backa parthian amazon of love she must be young he thought with such a sprightly air and so easy a step she must be beautiful with such a figure to match her face she must be rich with such a habitwith those gold chains and bracelets and pearls presently the young fellow caught his goddess he spoke to her and he led her to a seat among the plants where they could sit a little retired and apart but from the gallery i could see them he took her hand he pressed her saying i know not what presently she took off her domino and disclosed loveliness the youth fell into raptures she held him off she put on her domino again she rose he begged for a little more discourseit was a pretty pantomimeshe refused she went back to the general company they remained together all the night when they went away in the morning he led her out whispering and one hopes that this was the beginning of a happy match the removal of the domino to let the gentleman see the masked face was i observed very common yet it was not always that the little comedy ended as they say happily sometimes the lady after showing her face would run away and exchange a kerchief or a mantle with a friend so as to mystify and bewilder her pursuer who could not tell what had become of his lovely partner such were the little comedies performed before the eyes of the spectators from the music gallery as for the rest the mountebanks pranced and the dancinggirls and the tumblinggirls capered and they all laughed and sang and gave themselves wholly to the mirth and merriment of the moment some of the men i observed were drunk when they arrived others pretended to be drunk in order that they might roll about and catch hold of the girls it has always been to me a marvel that women do not mark their displeasure at the intrusion upon their pleasures of men who are drunk they mar all the enjoyment of society whether at the theatre or at such assemblies as this or in the drawingroom ladies of fashion have it in their power to put an end to the habit at a stroke of the pen so to speak namely by forbidding the presence at their assemblies of gentlemen in liquor they should be refused admission however great their position even if their breast is ablaze with stars there were many stars present and with them ladies whose headdresses were covered with diamonds it was rumoured that madame retained in her service for these occasions a body of stout fellows on the watch for any attempt upon the jewels it was also rumoured that there were rl ps present at the masquerade the young d of yk for instance it was said positively was among the company but so disguised that none could recognise him some of the ladies wore no dominoes but these persons i observed did not leave their partners and took no share in the merriment indeed they seemed for the most part not to laugh at the fun i suppose they found it somewhat low and vulgar in our gallery they were well known that is the duchess of q with the rubies the lady with the diamond spray in her hair is lady h the lady with the strings of pearls round her neck and arms is the lady florence d and so forthwith scandalous stories and gossip which belonged i thought more to the footmen in the hall than to the music gallery we had no such talk at the dog and duck perhaps however the reason for our reticence in that favourite retreat and rendezvous of the aristocracy was that there were no women at the dog and duck whose lives were not scandalous the stories therefore would become monotonous at one a procession was formed for supper there was no order or rank observed because there were plenty of persons who masqueraded as noblemen and it would take too long to examine into their claims the small band of stringed instruments of which i have spoken headed the procession played the company into the supperroom and played while they were taking supper there was not room for more than half in the supperroom the rest waited their turn it is a rest for us said the first violin we shall get some supper downstairs eat and drink plenty for what we have done already is a fleabite compared with what we have to do it was indeed they came back their cheeks flushed their eyes bright with wine some of them too tipsy to stand rolled upon the rout seats and so fell fast asleep i observed that the great ladies and the gentlemen with them did not return after supper their absence removed some restraint and the gentlemen who had arrived without a masquerade dress did not come back after supper the company was thinner but it was much louder there was no longer any pretence of keeping up a character the quack left off bawling his wares the showman deserted his show the fortunetellers left their tents the hermit left his cell the dancing and tumbling girls joined in the general throng there were many sets formed but little regular dancing all were broken up by rushes of young men more than half drunk they caught the girls and kissed themnothing loth though they shrieked it was a proof that the gentlewomen had all gone that no one resented this rudenesseither a partner or the girl herself the scene became an orgy all together were romping touzling laughing shrieking and quarrelling still the music kept up still we played with unflinching arm and all the spirit which can be put into them the most stirring dance tunes at last they left off trying to dance some of the women lay back on the rout seats partly with liquor overcome and partly with fatigue men were sprawling unable to get up bottles of wine were brought up from the supperroom and handed round the men grew every minute noisier the women shrieked louder and more shrillyperhaps with cause and every minute some slipped away and the crowd grew thinner till there were left little more than a heap of drunken men and weary women at last word came up that it was five oclock the time for closing the conductor laid down his violin the nights work was over we would go the people below clamoured for more music but in vain then they too began to stream out noisily as i passed the supperroom i saw that half a dozen young fellows had got in and were noisily clamouring for champagne the waiters who were clearing the supper took no notice then one of them with a bludgeon set to work and began to smash plates glasses dishes bottles windows in a kind of a frenzy of madness or mischief half a dozen stout fellows rushed at him carried him out of the supperroom and so into the square outside it was a fitting end for the masquerade while i was looking on i was touched on the arm by a mask i knew her by her white satin dress for madame i had seen her from time to time flitting about the room sometimes with a partner sometimes alone she was conversing one moment with a gentleman whose star betokened his rank and the next with one of her paid actors or actresses directing the sports i had seen her dancing two minuets in succession each with a grace and dignity which no other woman in the room could equal a noisy end will is it not we always finish this way the young fellow who smashed the glass is lord st osyth tomorrow morning he will have to pay the bill tis a goodnatured fool see they are carrying out the last of the drunken hogs faugh how drunk they are i have watched you all the evening madame believe me there were none of the ladies who approached you in the minuet naturally will for i have danced it on the stage where we can at least surpass the minuet of the assembly what do they understand of action and carriage and how to bear the body and how to use the arms and how to handle the fan but it was not to talk about my dancingwilli said that perhaps i should be able to show you something or to tell you somethingthat might astonish you come with me but firsti would not have you recognised put on this dominothere were a good many lying aboutsonow follow me and prepare for the greatest surprise of your whole life in the hall there were still many waiting for their carriages and chairs outside there was a crowd now closing in upon the carriages and now beaten back by madames men who were armed with clubs and kept the pickpockets and thieves at bay and there was a good deal of bawling cursing and noise madame led the way into the cardroom play had apparently been going on all night the candles on the table were burning low the players had nearly all gone the servants were taking the shillings from under the candlesticks at the long table two or three were still left they were not playing they were settling up their accounts a young fellow got up as we came in whats the good of crying harry he said to his companion ive dropped five hundred wellbetter luck tomorrow poor lad said madame that morrow will never come tis a pretty lad i am sorry for him he will end in a debtors prison or he will carry a musket in the ranks they were settling one by one with the player who had held the bank for the evening there were no disputes they had some system by means of which their loses or gains were represented by counters the business of the conclusion was the paying or receiving of money as shown by their counters which were accepted as money for instance if a person took so many counters he incurred so much liability but i do not understand what were the rules the man who held the bank was i heard afterwards one of those who live by keeping the bank against all comers he was an elderly man of fine manners extremely courtly in his behaviour and his dress one by one he received the players of whom there were a dozen or so and examined their liabilities or their claims there was left but one of the players a man whose back was turned to me sir he said politely i am grieved indeed to keep a gentleman waiting so long let me now release you i hope sir that the balance will prove in your favour it pleases me believe me that a gentleman should leave my table the winner so sir thank you i perceive sir that your good fortune has deserted you for this evening i trust it is but a temporary cloud after all it is a triflea bagatellea mere matter of one hundred and fiftyfive guineasone hundred and fiftyfive your honour is not perhaps good at figures but should you choose to verify the other man whose back and shoulders were still the only part of him presented to my view snatched the paper and looked at it and threw it on the table it is right sir i suppose it is right the luck was against me as usual the luck never is for me i knew the voice and started madame whispered in my ear softly the greatest surprise of your life one hundred and fiftyfive guineas said the gentleman who kept the bank if you are not able to discharge the liability tonight sir i shall be pleased to wait upon you tomorrow no no i can pay my way stillpay my way he pulled out a long purse filled with guineas your luck will certainly turn sir before long why i have seen instances damn it sir leave me and my affairs alone my luck never will turn dont i know my own affairs the voice could be none other than my cousin matthews i was startled my head which had been filled with the noise of the music and the excitement of the revelry became clear at once and attentive and serious my cousin matthew impossible not to know that voice he poured out the guineas on the table and began to count them dividing them into heaps of ten then he counted them over again very slowly and at last with greatest reluctance passed them over to the other player who in his turn counted them over taking up the pieces and biting them in order to see if they were good i thank you sir he said gravely i trust that on a future occasion matthew waved his hand impatiently the other turned and walked down the room the candles were mostly out by this time only two or three were left on the point of expiring the room was in a kind of twilight matthew turned his headit was my cousin he seemed not to see us he sank into a chair and laid his head in his hands groaning no one was left in the room except madame matthew and myself madame stepped forward the table was between her and my cousin as for me i kept in the background watching and listening what might this thing mean matthew the sober upright religious london citizen matthew the worthy descendant of the great puritan preacher matthew the denouncer of wicked musicians matthew the scourge of frivolity and vice matthew my supplanter matthew in a gaming room matthew playing all night long and losing a hundred and fiftyfive guineas in a single night what was one to believe next jenny bent over the table she still kept on her domino mr matthew halliday she said he lifted his head stupidly i congratulate you mr matthew halliday she went on you have passed a most pleasant and profitable evening a hundred and fiftyfive guineas it is nothing of course to a rich merchant like yourself who are you he asked what concern is it of yours i am one who knows you one who knows you already and too well he stood up i am going mistress he saidunless you have something else to say mr hallidayyou lost two hundred guineas last night and on sunday you lost four hundred zounds miss or mistress how do you know i know because i am told you are a very rich man mr halliday are you not you must be to lose so much every night you must be very rich indeed you have whole fleets of your own and quays and warehouses filled with goodsand you inherited a great fortune only two years ago he sank back in a chair and gazed stupidly upon her how speeds your noble trade how fares it with your fleets how much is left of your great fortune he growled but made no reply curiosity and wonder seized him and held him besides what reply could he make who are you he asked i will tell you perhaps how do you stand with mr probus he sprang to his feet again this is too much how dare you speak of my private affairs what do you know about mr probus how long is it mr halliday since you agreed with mr probus that your cousin should be locked up in a debtors prison there to remain till he died or sold his birthright he answered with a kind of roar as if he had no words left he stood before herthe table betweenhalf in terrorhalf in rage who was this woman besides he was already very nearly beside himself over the long continuance of his bad luck who are you he asked again what do you know about my cousin i will tell you directly who i am about your cousin matthew i warn you solemnly the next attempt you make upon his life and liberty will bring upon your headyoursnot to speak of the othersthe greatest disaster that you can imagine or can dread the greatest disaster she repeated solemnly that you can imagine or can dread she looked like a prophetess standing before him with hand raised and with solemn voice this is fooling what do you know who are you i cannot tell what kind of disaster it will bethe greatestthe worst possibleit will be be warned keep mr probus at arms length or he will ruin youhe will ruin you unless he has ruined you already you cannot frighten me with bugaboo stories if you will not tell me who you are i shall go she tore off her glove does this hand she said remind you of nothing on the third finger of the white hand was a weddingring which i had never seen there before he stared at the hand perhaps he suspected i think he did no one who had once seen that hand could possibly forget it she tore off her domino you have doubtless forgotten matthew by this time the faceof your wife he cursed her he stood up and cursed her in round terms i dont know why he accused her of nothing but he cursed her she was the origin and cause of his bad luck i would have interfered let belet be she said the time will surely come when the ruin which i have foretold will fall upon him let us wait till then that will be sufficient punishment for him i see it comingi know not when i see it coming let him curse he desisted he ran out of the room without another word she looked after him with a deep sigh i told you will that i had a surprise for youthe greatest surprise of your life i will tell you more tomorrow if you will come in the afternoon you shall hear more about matthew my husband matthew get you gone now and home to bed with all the speed you may goodnight cousin willcousin will i left her as i was bidden i walked home through the deserted streets of early morning my brain was burning matthew the gambler matthew the husband of jenny matthew the gambler whyeverything shouted the word as i passed the narrow streets of soho the water lapping the arches of westminster bridge the keen air blowing over the bank all shouted the wordsmatthew the gambler matthew the husband of jenny matthew the gambler and when i lay down to sleep the words that rang in my ear were matthew my husbandcousin willcousin will chapter iv who she was you now know will said jenny when i called next day why i have been interested in you since i first saw you not on account of your good looks sir though i confess you are a very pretty fellow nor on account of your playing which is spirited and true but because you are my first cousin by marriage she received me sitting in the small room on the left of the hall the great house was quite empty save for the servants who were always clearing away the remains of one fete and arranging for another their footsteps resounded in the vacant corridors and their voices echoed in the vacant chambers jenny i have been able to think of nothing else i could not sleep for thinking of it i am more and more amazed i knew you would be well will i wanted to have a long talk with you i have a great deal to say first i shall give you some teabelieve me it is far better for clearing the head after a night such as last night than madeira i have a great deal to tell youi fear you will despise mebut i will hide nothing i am resolved to hide nothing from you meantime the words kept ringing in my ears matthew a gambler the religious matthew to whom music was a snare of the devil and the musician a servant of the devil the steady matthew the irreproachable matthew yet since i had always known him to be a violator of truth a slanderer and a backbiter why not also a gambler why not also a murderera forgeranything i was to find out before long that he was quite ready to become the former of these also upon temptation yet the thing was wonderful even after i had actually seen it and proved it and again matthew married not to a sober and godly citizens daughter but to an actress of drury lane theatre matthew to whom the theatre was as the mouth of the bottomless pit who could believe such a thing as for what follows jenny did not tell me the whole in this one afternoon i have put together as if it was all one conversation what took several days or perhaps several weeks you think it so wonderful will jenny said reading my thoughts in my face for my own part it is never wonderful that a man should gamble or drink or throw himself away upon an unworthy mistress every man may go mad it is part of mans nature women never save for love and jealousy and the like men are so made madness seizes them down they go to ruin and the grave it is strong drink with some and avarice with some and gaming with some your cousin matthew is as mad as an abram man she was silent for a while then she went on again i have written it down much as if all that follows was a single speech it was broken up by my interruptions and by her pauses and movements for she was too quick and restless to sit down while she was speaking she would spring from her chair and walk about the room she would stand at the window and drum at the panes of glass she would stand over the fireplace she would look in the round mirror hanging on the wall she had a thousand restless ways sometimes she stood behind me and laid a hand on my shoulder as if she was ashamed for me to look upon her it was a wonderful tale she told me more wonderful that a woman who had gone through that companionship should come out of it filled through and through like a sponge with the knowledge of wickedness and found in childhood with those who practise wickedness yet should be herself so free from all apparent stain or taint of it surely unless the face the eyes the voice the language the thoughts can all lie together this woman was one of the purest and most innocent of heavens creatures it is not always the knowledge of evil that makes a woman wicked else if you think of it there would be no good woman at all among us consider it is only a question of degree a child born in the mint or in fullwoods rents or in st giless or in turnmill street learns one would think everything that is vile but children do not always inquire into the meaning of what they hear most things that they see or hear may pass off them like water from a ducks back their best safeguard is their want of curiosity besides it is not only in st giless that children hear things that are kept from them in the respectable part of the city in cheapside itself they can hear the low language and the vile sayings and the blasphemous oaths of the common sort children are absorbed by their own pursuits and thoughts the grownup world the working world does not belong to them they see and see not they hear and hear not they cannot choose but see and hear yet they inquire not into the meaning will she said i would i had never heard your name it has been an unlucky name to meand perhaps it will be more unlucky still i know not if she was here foretelling what certainly happened afterwards your cousin matthew is no common player who carries a few guineas in his pocket and watches them depart with a certain interest and even anxiety and then goes away this man is a fierce thirsty insatiable gambler there is a play called the gamester in which the hero is such an one he plays like this hero with a thirst that cannot be assuaged he plays every night he has i believe already ruined himself yet he cannot stop he would play away the whole world and then would stake his soul unless he had first sold his soul for money to play with soul if he has any soulbut i know not you amaze me jenny indeed i am overwhelmed with amazement i cannot get the words out of my head matthew a gambler matthew a gambler yesmatthew a gambler he has been a gambler in a small way for many years when he got possession of your fathers money and the management of that house he became a gambler in a large way i say that i believe he is already wellnigh ruined you have seen him on one night will he is at the same game every night i have had him watchedi know his luck is such as the luck of men like that always isagainst him continually he never wins or if ever then only small sums as will serve to encourage him there is no evening in the week not even sunday when he does not play i have reason to knowi will tell you why presentlythat he has already lost a great fortune the fortune that my father left to him it should have been mine then my poor will it never will be yours for it is gone i learned six months ago that his business is impaired the credit of the house is shaken worse than this willshe laid her hand on my armhe had then already borrowed large sums of mr probus and as he could not pay he was borrowing more there is the danger for you what danger you musicians live in the clouds why does matthew continue to borrow money he pretends that he wants to put it into the business really he gambles with it why does probus continue to lend him money probus does not suspect the truth in the hope that he will presently have such a hold over matthew that he will get possession of the business become a partner and turn out matthew and your uncle it looks splendid all these ships the wharf covered with goods but the ships are mortgaged and their cargoes are mortgaged and the interest on probuss loans can only be paid by borrowing more in a very short time will the bubble will burst the situation is already dangerous it will then become full of peril why dangerous to me i have borrowed no money you are a very simple person will they put you into the kings bench yet you dont understand i do matthew wanted to borrow money on the security of that succession probus would have lent him money on that security probus would have had another finger in the pie he did not know then what he will very soon find out that all the money he has already advanced to his rich client is lost then it was a mere temptation to matthew to put you under pressure now it will become a necessity to make you submit a necessity for both and they are a pair of equal villains last night you warned matthew jenny your words seemed to be no common warning you know something or you would not have pronounced that solemn warning every woman is a prophetess she replied gravely oh i can sometimes foretell things not always not when i wish not as i wish the prophecy comes to me i know not how it comes and i cannot expect it or wait for it last night suddenly i saw a vision of villainy i know not what it was directed against you and aliceand the villainsamong them was matthewwere driven back with whips they fled howling will this vision makes me speak this kind of talk was new to me i confess it made me uneasy well you now know the truth your cousin has defamed and slandered you without relenting and without ceasing so long as it was possible to do you a mischief with your father he did it he has robbed you of your inheritance well you can now if you please revenge yourself revenge myself how you will not only revenge yourself you may make it impossible for your cousin to do you any further injury does he wish to do me any further injury will i suppose that you are a fool because you are a musician wish a man like that who has injured you as much as he could and as often as he could will go on it is the nature of such a man to injure others his delight and his nature he craves for mischief almost as he craves for gambling you are bitter againstyour husband jenny i am very bitter against him i have reason but about the revenge of what kind is it you may do this his father the alderman has withdrawn from any active partnership in the business which is conducted entirely by matthew he passes now an idle life beside clapham common with his gardens and his greenhouses go to this poor gentleman tell him the truth let him learn that his son is a gambler that he is wasting all that is left to waste that his losses have been very heavy already and that the end is certain bankruptcy you can tell your uncle that you saw yourself with your own eyes matthew losing a hundred and fiftyfive guineas in the cardroom of a masquerade this will terrify him though at first he will not believe it then he will cause the affairs of the house to be examined and he will find out if accountants are any use how much has been already wasted mind will i invent nothing all this i know the house is wellnigh ruined how do you know all this jenny not by visions certainly i know it from information it is i assure you the bare truth the house is already wellnigh ruined i fear i cannot tell my uncle these things it would be a kindness to him in the end will let him learn the truth before the worst happens i shook my head revenge is not a pleasing task to go to my uncle with such a tale seemed a mean way of returning matthews injuries i do not counsel revenge then she went on again divining my thoughts call it your safety when you have alarmed your uncle into calling for an explanation go and see the man probus see probus why i would separate probus from his client go and tell the mango and tell him without reference to his past villainies that his client matthew is an incurable gambler and that all the money probus has lent to him has been lost over the gaming table tell probus the thought of speaking to probus except as to a viper was not pleasant i have made inquiries about probus she knew everything this woman he is of the tribe they call bloodsuckers they fasten upon their victim and they never let go till such time as there is no more blood to suck there is some blood left probus will never think of you while he is saving what he can of his own tell the moneylender this i say and what with probus on the one hand maddened by his loss and his own father on the other wellnigh terrified to death matthew will have enough to do would you like me to do this jenny i should like it done she replied turning away her face would you like to do it yourself jenny i am a woman women must not do violent things jenny there is more revenge than precaution in this there may be some revenge but there is also a good deal of prudence i cannot do it jenny are you afraid will to be sure a musician is not a soldsonowill forgive me you are not afraid forgive me i shall leave them to work out their destruction in their own way whatever way that may be but that way may be hurtful to you my poor willeven fatal to you i shall leave them alone their punishment will surely fall upon them they will dig a trap to their own undoing will i have heard that kind of talk before i have used those words myself upon the stage she threw herself into an attitude and declaimed with fire think not allora that i dread their hate nor hate nor vile conspiracy shall turn me still on their own presumptuous heads shall fall the lightning they invoke for mine for lower hangs yon black thunder cloud and even louder i hear the rumbling of the angry earth wait but a moment then the flash shall shoot then shall the thunder roar the earth shall gape and where they stood there shall be nothingness that is your position will for my own part if i were you i should prefer safety and i should not object to revenge it is true jenny perhaps for my own part i have known a monstrous number of wicked people on whom no lightnings fell and for whom the earth did never gape nothing has happened to them so long as they were gentlemen with the baser sort of course there is tyburn and i dare say that feels at the end like the gaping of the earth and the flash of lightning and the roar of the thunder all together even with them some escape i would have quoted the psalmist but refrained because by this time i had made the singular discovery that jenny seemed to have no knowledge of religion at all if one spoke in the common way of mans dependence she looked as if she understood nothing or she said she had heard words to that effect on the stage if one spoke indirectly of the christian scheme she showed no response had i mentioned the psalmist she would have asked perhaps who the psalmist was or where his pieces were played she never went to church she never read any books except her own parts she was sharp and clever in the conduct of affairs she was not to be taken in by rogues how could such a woman considering our mode of education and the general acknowledgment of christianity even in an atheistical age that prevails in our books escape some knowledge or tincture of religion do not call it revenge she insisted in your own safety you should strike and without delay i repeat it i cannot put it too strongly before you there is a great danger threatening when probus finds that the money is really gone he will become desperate he will stick at nothing since he knows now that nothing will persuade me to sell that chance of succession he will perhaps desist he will never desist if you were dead the thought lies in both their minds if you were dead then that money would be matthews do you think mr probus will murder me not with his own hands stilldo you think will that when two villains are continually brooding over the same thought villainy will not follow if i were you i would take this tale to the alderman first and to probus next and i should then keep out of the way for six months at least no i said they shall be left to themselves perhaps i was wrong had i told my uncle all the bankruptcy would have been precipitated and probuss claim would have been treated with all the others and even if that large sum had fallen it would have been added to the general estate and divided accordingly it was in the afternoon the sun was sinking westward it shone through the window upon jenny as she restlessly moved about the roomdisquieted by all she had to tell me i remember how she was dressed in a frock of light blue silk with a petticoat to match her hair hung in its natural curls covered with a kerchiefthe soft evening sunlight wrapped her in a blaze of light and colour and oh the pity of it to think that this divine creature was thrown away upon my wretched cousin the pity of it tell me jenny i said how you became his wife yes will i will tell you she replied humbly dont think that i ever loved himnor could i endure his caressesbut he never offered anythe only man who never wanted to caress me was my husbandto be sure he did not love meor anyone elsehe is incapable of love he is a worm his hand is slimy and cold his face is slimy his voice is slimy but i thought i could live with him perhaps if not i could always leave him she paused a little as if to collect herself every actress she went on has troops of lovers there are the gentlemen first who would fain make her their mistress for a month those who would make her their mistress for a year and those who desire only the honour and glory of pretending that she is their mistress and then there are the men who would like nothing better than to marry the actress and to live upon her salarybelieve me of all these there are plenty lastly there is the gentleman who would really marry the actress all for love of her and for no other consideration i thought at first that your cousin matthew was one of these how did you know him he was brought into the green room one night by some gambling acquaintance i remarked his long serious face i thought he was a man who might be trusted he asked permission to wait upon me well for she stopped i thought i say that he was a man to be trusted he did not look like one who drank he did not follow other actresses about with his eyes i say will that i thought i could trust him he came to my lodging he told me that he was a rich city merchant he asked me what i should like if i would marry him and he promised to give it to methatand anything else if you did not love himjenny i did not love him i will tell you i wanted to get away from the man i did love and so i wanted above all to be taken away from london and the theatre into the country never to hear anything more about the stage had he done what he promised will i would have made a good wife to him although he is a slimy worm but he did not he broke his word on the very morning when we came out of church how he began by saying that he had a little explanation to offer he said that when he told me he was a rich merchantthat indeed was his reputation but his position was embarrassed he wanted money he wished not to borrow any he therefore thought that if he married an actressthat class of persons being notorious for having no honourhis very words to me actually his very words an hour after leaving the churchhe intended to open a gaminghouse at which i was to be the decoy now you understand why i call him a villain and a wretch and a slimy worm jenny i left him on the spot after telling him what he wasi left himi left the theatre as well i had a friend who found me the money to take this place under another name i have seen the man many times herelast nightand once i called upon him and i made him give me the money to get you out of the prison will matthew found that money of course he did i had nonei went to him and reminded him that he had contributed nothing to the maintenance of his wife and that he must give me whatever the sum was he was obliged to give it otherwise i should have informed the clerks of the countinghouse who i was i laughed well but jenny there was another man you are persistent sir why should i tell you well i will confess this man protested a great deal less than the others he was a noble lord if that matters he was quite different from all the rest he never came to the green room drunk he never cursed and swore he never shook his cane in the face of footman or chairman he was a gentle creatureand he loved me and would have married me welli told him who and what i wasi will tell you presentlythat mattered nothing he would carry me away from them all i would have married him will and we should have been happy but his sister came to see me and she went on her knees crying and imploring me to refuse him because in the history of their family there had never been any such alliance as that with an actress of no family would i bring disgrace into a noble family if i refused he would forget me and she would do all in her power for me if ever i wanted a friend it was for his sakeif i loved him i would not injure him and so she went on and she persuaded me willbecause you see when people pride themselves about their families it is a pity to bring the gutter into itwith newgate and tyburn isnt it jenny what has newgate got to do with it wait and i will tell you i gave way it cost me a great deal willmore than you would believebecause i had never loved anyone beforeand when a woman does love a man the tears rose in her eyesand then it was that your cousin came to the theatre poor jenny and she always seemed so cheerful so lively so happy her face might have been drawn to illustrate miltons lallegra how could she look so happy when she had this unhappy love story and this unhappy marriage to think upon will she cried passionately i am the most unhappy woman in the world i made no reply indeed i knew not what there was to say matthew was a villain there can be few worse villains jenny was in truth a most injured and a most unhappy woman it was growing twilight what followed was told or most of it because i have set down the result of two or three conversations in one by the light of the fire in a low voice a low musical voicethat seemed to rob the naked truth of much of its horrors i told my lord will she said what i am going to tell you because i would not have him ignorant of anything or find out anythingafterwardsbut there was no afterwardswhich he might think i should have told him before he has a pretty gift of drawing he makes pictures of things and people with a pencil and a box of watercolours i made him take certain sketches for me he did so wondering what they might mean here she rose opened a drawer in a cabinet and took out a little packet tied up with a ribbon first i begged him to sketch me one of the little girls who run about the streets in soho there are hundreds of them they are barefooted bareheaded dressed in a sack in a flannel petticoat in anything they have no schooling they are not taught anything at all their parents and their brothers and sisters and their cousins and their grandparents are all thieves and rogues together what can they become what hope is there for them see she took one of the pictures out and gave it to me by the firelight i made out a little girl standing in the street in her carriage there was something of the freedom of a gipsy in the woods her hair blew loose in the wind her scanty petticoat clung to her little figure she was barelegged barefooted bareheaded can you see it will wellwhen i had got all the pictures together i asked the artist to sit down as i have asked you today and when he was sat down i had the bundle of pictures in my hand and i said to him my lord this is a very pretty sketchi like it all the better because it shows what i was like at that age you jenny yes my lord i myself that little girl is myself well he cried out on the impossibility of the thing but i assured him of the truth of what i said then i took up the next picture it represented the entrance of a court in soho round this entrance were gathered a collection of men and women with the most evil faces possible these my lord i said are the people who were once my companions when they and i were young together but not now he asked not now i told him save that they all remember me and consider me as one of themselves and come to the theatre in order to applaud me the highwaymen going to the pit the petty thieves and pickpockets and footpads to the gallery well at first he looked serious then he cleared up and kissed my hand he loved me for myself he said and as regards the highwaymen and such fellows he would very soon take me out of their way but jenny will i am telling you what i told his lordship believe me it does not cost me to tell you half as much as it did to tell that noble heart for he loved me will and i loved him again her eyes glistened by the red light of the fire she took up a third picture it represented a publichouse over the door swung the sign of a black jack the first story projected over the groundfloor and the second story over the first beside the publichouse stood a tall church this i told my lord is the black jack tavern it is the house of call for most of the rogues and thieves of soho the church is st giless church as for my own interest in the house i was born there my mother and sister still keep the place between them it is in good repute among the gentry who frequent it for its kitchen where there is always a fire for those who cook their own suppers and for the drinks which are excellent if not cheap what is the use of keeping cheap things for thieves lightly got lightly spent there is nothing cheap at that house my mother enjoys a reputation for being a receiver of stolen goodsa reputation well deserved as i have reason to believe the goods are all stowed away in a stone vault or cellar once belonging to some kind of housei know not what i groaned that is how my lord behaved then he kissed my hand again jenny he said it is not the landlady of the black jack that i am marrying but jenny wilmot he asked me to tell him more will you hear more i will hear all you desire to tell me jenny once i had a father he was a gipsy but since he had fair hair and blue eyes he was not a proper gipsy i do not know how he got into the caravan with the gipsies perhaps he was stolen in infancy or picked up on a doorstep however i do not remember him my mother speaks of him with pride but i do not know why by profession he was a footpad andandshe faltered for a momenthe met the fate that belongs to that calling see she showed me a drawing representing the triumphal march to tyburn my mother speaks of it as if it was the fitting end of a noble career i have never been quite able to think so too and will if i must confess i would rather that my father had not been not formed the leading figure in that procession i interposed but go on jenny she took up another picture and handed it to me it was a spirited sketch representing a small crowd a pump and a boy held under the pump i had two brothers this was one he was a pickpocket what could be expected he was caught in the act and held under a pump but they kept him so long that it brought on a chill and he died the other brother is now in the plantations of jamaica she produced another picture it represented an orange girl at drury lane she carried her basket of oranges on her arm she had a white kerchief over her neck and shoulders and another over her head her face was full of impudence cleverness and wit that will is the first step upwards of your cousins wife from the gutter to the pit of drury lane as an orange girl there was a step for me yes i looked like that i behaved like that i was as shameless as that i used to talk to the men in the pit as they talkyou know the kind of talk and now will confess you are heartily ashamed of me jenny like the noble lord i kissed her fingers believe me i am not in the least ashamed of you the next step was to the stage that will was pure luck the manager heard me imitating the actors and actressesand himself he saw me dancing to please the other girlsi used to dance to please the people in the black jack he took a fancy in his head that i was clever he took me from among the other girls he gave me instruction and presently a speaking part that is the whole history i have told you alli never told these things to matthewwhy should i but to my lord i told all yesand he was not ashamed nobut he did not like the applause of the rogues and the orange girls while the highwaymen applauded in the pit and the pickpockets in the gallery the orange girls were telling all the people that once i was one of them with my basket of oranges like the restand so it was agreed that i was to leave the stage and go away into the country out of the way of all the old set and then then i could no longer oblige my lord i left it to oblige myself and to marry matthew she sat down and buried her face in her hands but i loved my lord she said i loved my lord chapter v the black jack jenny finished her story much as you have heard it though some has been forgotten and now she said i will take you to the very place where i was born you shall see for yourself the house and my mother and my sister and the company among whom i was brought up wait for a moment while i change my dress i cannot go like this and i do not want all of them to learn where i now live she returned in a few minutes dressed in the garb of an orange girl of drury everybody knows how these girls are attired a frock of the commonest linseywoolsey a kerchief over her head tied under her chin another kerchief round her neck and bosom her sleeves coming down to her elbows on her arm a round deep basket filled with oranges but no orange girl ever had so sweet a face so fine a carriage hands and arms so white nor could any disguise deprive this lovely creature of her beauty or rob her face of its pure and virginal expression that such a being should come out of the black jack but then we find the white lily growing beside a haystack or a pigsty and none the less white and delicate and fragrant the tavern called the black jack stands over against the west front of st giless church at the corner of denmark street with a double entrance which has proved useful i believe on the appearance of constables or bow street runners the church which is large and handsome worthy of better parishioners stands in the midst of a quarter famous for harbouring producing and encouraging the most audacious rogues and the most impudent drabs that can be found in the whole of london as for the church of course they never enter it as for religion they have never learned any as for morals they know of none as for the laws they defy them as for hanging whipping and imprisonment they heed them no more than other folk heed the necessity of death or the chances of pain and suffering before death releases them every man must die they say few people among them live naturally more than forty years or so fever smallpox ague carry off most of their class before forty if therefore one takes part in the march to tyburn at fiveandthirty one does but lose two or three years of life then again there is the punishment of the lashthat seems very terrible but every man rich or poor has to endure pain very often pain worse than that of the lash certainly the agony of the whip is not worse than that of rheumatism or gout it is sooner over it makes no man any the older it does not unfit him for his work after a day or two he is none the worse for it as for imprisonment a prison if your friends look after you may be made with the help of a few companions as cheerful a place as the kitchen of the black jack with drinking and singing and tobacco this kind of talk is the religion of roguedom and since it is so we may cease to wonder why these people are not deterred by the severity of their punishments for no punishment can deter when it is not feared that is beyond question and since after punishment the rogue is still regarded as a rogue whom no one will employ punishment does not convert nor does the prison chaplain effect any miracles in conversion because no one listens to his exhortations over against the church of st giless the tavern of the black jack lifts its shameless head the projecting upper windows bend threatening brows against the west end of the church with its pillars of white stone the house has villainy written large over all the front it is covered with yellow places breaking away in lumps and showing the black timbers behind the roof of red tiles is sunken in parts many of the windows are broken and stuffed with rags the ground floor consists of a long low room at one end is a bar with a counter behind it casks of beer and rum and shelves with bottles containing cordials there is a door behind the bar opening to a cellar staircase and is said to communicate with a subterranean passage leading one knows not whither it is also rumoured that the cellar into which no one but the landlady of the black jack and her daughter has ever penetrated is a large stone vault with pillars and arches the remains of some roman catholic building the kitchen or public room is on the ground floor about twelve inches below the level of the street it is entered by two steps the window is garnished with red curtains which on wintry evenings give the place a warm and cheerful look the bright colour promises a roaring fire and lights and drink both in the summer and winter the place is always cheerful because it is always filled with company three or four candles in sconces light up the room and in addition a generous fire always burning every night adds to the light of the place the fire is kept up partly for warmth partly for the convenience of those who bring their suppers with them and cook them on the fire also for their convenience fryingpans and gridirons are lying ready beside the fireplace and for the convenience of the punchdrinkers a huge kettle bubbles on the hob two tables stand for those who take their supper here as the food principally in favour consists of bloaters red herrings sprats mackerel pigs fry pork fat bacon beefsteak and onions liver and lights and other coarse but savoury dishes the mingled fragrance makes the air delightful and refreshing as the windows are never open the air is never free from this fragrance added to which is the reek or stench of old beer rum gin and rank tobacco taken in the horrid manner of the lower classes by means of a clay pipe not in the more courtly fashion of snuff nor must one forget thepahthe companythe people themselves the men and women the boys and girls who frequent this tavern nightly taking all into account i think it would be difficult outside newgate to find a more noisome den than the kitchen or barroom of the black jack all round the room ran a bench the company sat on the bench every man with a pipe of tobacco and a mug of drink the walls were streaming one felt inclined to run awayout into the fresh air for breath the space in the middle was mostly kept open for a fight perhaps for a dance perhaps if a fiddler could be found every evening i believe there was a fight either between two men or between two women or between two boys what would an englishman of the baser sort become if he were forbidden to fight i describe what i saw after we entered when jenny pushed open the door and the breath of that tavern ascended to my nostrils i trembled and hesitated strong at first isnt it said jenny cousin will to stand here and breathe the air that comes up carries me back to my childhood you are ready to face it after a little one grows accustomed they like it the people inside she stood with the handle of the half opened door in her hand now she said you shall visit the rogues delight the thieves kitchen the black jack the favourite house of call for the gallows bird you shall see what manner of woman is the old lady my mother and what sort of woman is the young lady my sister i am ready jenny i replied with an effort one would join a forlorn hope almost as readily dont mind me take no notice whatever i say or do she whispered i must humour the wretches it is more than twelve months since i have been among them they may resent my absence however you keep quiet and say nothing call for drink if you like and pretend to be an old hand in the place jenny threw up her head opened her lips laughed loudly and impudently looked round her with an impudent stare became in a word once more one of the brazen young queans who sell oranges and exchange rude jokes with the gentlemen in the pit of drury lane theatre it was a wonderful change i saw a girl who would perhaps be beautiful if she had preserved any rags or the least appearance of feminine modesty as for jennys sweet and attractive look of innocence that had vanished she had in fact resumed her former self and more than her former self i saw her as she had been was there ever before known such a thing that a girl who had never been taught what was meant by feminine modesty should be able to assume at will the look of one brought up in a conventall innocence and ignoranceand at will be able to put it off and go back to her former self noit is impossible the innocence of jennys face proclaimed the innocence of jennys soul follow me she said keep close or expect a pewter plate or a pot hurled at your head they love not strangers she pushed open the door she descended the steps i followed the room was quite full and the reek of it made me sick and faint for a moment but to the worst of stinks one quickly grows hardened by cried a voice from out of the smoke its madame lawks motherthis was a girls voicetis jenny why jenny we all thought you was grown too proud for the black jack goodevening all she cried with a loud coarse laugh she added as a finishing stroke of art a certain click or choking in the middle of the laugh such as one may hear among the lowest sort of women as they walk along the street how are you mother you did not expect me to come in tonight did you hows business how are you doll adding up the figures on the slate as usual how are you boys i havent seen any of you at the theatre for a spell thats because ive been resting actresses must rest sometimes where have i been thats my business who with thats my business too nowshe brandished her basket and walked about among them shaking her petticoats in the way of the impudent orange girlschoose a fine chaney orange choose a fine chaney orange one for your sweetheart my curly boy here is a fine one pay me when i come again doll chalk up to the gentleman an orange for his girl one for this pretty country girl take it my beauty i will tell your fortune presentlya lover and a pile of gold and babies as sweet as this orange so she got rid of her oranges offering and presenting them here and there with the impudence of the craft she assumed yet with something of her own inimitable grace which she could not quite put off then she turned to me sit down here she ordered lads she said ive brought you a friend of mine hes a fiddler by trade if you like he will fiddle for you till he puts fire into your toes and springs into your heels who is he cried a voice through the smoke i now recognised the bishop formerly of the kings bench prison the reverend gentlemans face was redder and his cheek fuller than when last i saw him he seemed however in better case he had gotten a new cassock his bands and his cuffs were of whiter hue his wig was better shaped and better dressed it came i make no doubt from some place where are deposited the wigs snatched from the passengers in hackney coaches or even in the streets his looks however were certainly more prosperous than when i had seen him last he did not recognise me which was as well beside him sat the captain also more prosperous to all appearance he wore a purple coat and a fawncoloured waistcoat he had rings on his fingers and his hat was laced with gold he wore gold buckles buttons silver gilt and white silk stockings he looked what he wasa ruffian a robber and a swashbuckler he had a girl on his knee and one arm round her waist she was a handsome redfaced wench dressed up in all kinds of finery somewhat decayed and second hand a pipe was between the gallant captains lips and a glass of punch was in his right hand twas a picture of rogues paradise warmth light fire clothes drink tobacco good company and a fine girl what more can a man want whos your man repeated the bishop we are not going to have strangers here spying on us for what we do who is he who is he whats that to you i shall bring anybody i like to the black jack if you dont like your company bishop get up and go he growled but made no attempt to rise ifshe appealed to the company generallyi choose to bring my fancy man here am i to ask the bishops leave then before there was time for a reply mother bustle about let every man call for what he wants score it to me this evening i pay for all her mother a fat old woman of fifty red faced with the look of callous indifference that belongs to such a woman sat behind the bar a piece of knitting in her hand she got up grumbling oh ay she said when jenny comes you must all get drunk at her expense shed better give me the money to keep for her wellwhat shall it be doll stir about stir aboutyou leave it all to me ask the gentlemen what they will take and the ladies too whatever they like jenny pays tonight whatever they likethats jennys waywhatever they like so that it ruins my poor girl doll the other daughter made no response she was continually occupied with the slate and i suppose she was slow at calculation for she kept adding up over and over again wiping out with her wet finger and adding up again the black jack refused credit as a rule most of the company had to pay for what they called for on the spot but there were a few to whom limited credit was granted as a privilege the girl called doll i remarked was not in the least like her sister she had black hair and a somewhat swarthy complexion and appeared to belong as indeed she did to the people called gipsies the mother had also the same black hair and dark skin strange that a girl of jennys complexion with her fair hair blue eyes and peachlike skin should come of the same stock i sought in vain for any likeness between jenny and this girl i thought that she might present the same features with a difference debased but i could find none she wore a red kerchief tied round her head a red ribbon tied round her neck a red scarf tied round her waist in her way she was a handsome girl in her manners she showed no inclination to oblige the company or to be civil to them she paid no heed when her mother bade her stir about on the contrary she went on with her sums on the slate it was jenny who ran round laughing and joking with the men ordering punch for one and gin for another most of the company regarded her with bewilderment it was long since she had been among them they knew something about her she was the daughter of the house she had been an orange girl at drury she had been an actress at the same theatre some of them had seen her there then she disappeared and no one knew where she was one young fellow there was who sat on the bench with hanging head he had apparently no friends among the company here cried jenny is a lad half awake what art doing here friend the lad shook his head mournfully hast any money he shook his head again jenny pulled out a piece of silver go she said get food andshe whisperedcome back here no more goget thee home again and so let me believe she saved one lad that night from the gallows for he got up slowly and walked out there was another lad also from the country whose fresh cheek and country dress betokened the fact he sat sheepishly as a new comer jenny stopped before him and pray what do they call thee sirrah jack twill serve what lay is it jack oh shoplifting he nodded for mr merridew she whispered he nodded again drink punch jack and forget thyself awhile some of the men were dressed like the captain but not so fine the buttons had been cut off their coats and their shoes had lost the buckles there were boys among them boys who had none of the innocence of childhood their faces betrayed a life of hunting and being hunted they were always on the prowl for prey or were running away and hiding they had all been whipped held under the pump thrown into ponds clapped in prison they were all doomed to be hanged in their habits of drink as in their crimes they were grown up in truth there were no faces in the whole room which looked more hopeless than those of the boys the women of whom there were nearly as many as there were men were either bedizened in tawdry finery or they were in rags some wearing no more than a frock stiffened by the accumulation of years black leather stays and a kerchief for the neck with another for the head their hair hung about their shoulders loose and undressed it was not unbecoming in the young but in the older women it became what is called rats tails with most of the men their dress was simple and scanty shirts were scarce stockings without holes in them were rare buttons had mostly vanished most of them i observed further had an anxious hungry look not the look of a creature of prey which has always in it something that is noble but the look of one insufficiently fed i believe that the ordinary lot of the rogue is even on this earth miserable beyond expression uncertain as to food cruelly hard in cold weather in the matter of raiment in a little while they were all happy happier i am sure than they had been for a long time while they drank and while they talked i observed among them a veritable brotherhood the most successful roguehe in gold lacewas hail fellow with the most ragged and although the successful rogue stood the nearest to the gallows and he knew it and the other rogue knew it yet the beginner envied the success of his brother as a soldier envies the successful general they drank and laughed they drank more and they laughed more then the captain called silence for a song now you fiddler he cried with a curse sit up man and show us how you can play the tune the captain told me was the warbling of the lark i struck up that air which every frequenter of vauxhall or even the dog and duck knows very well and the captain began his song now in such a company i expected a song in praise of roguery and robbery or at least something of the kind introduced in gays opera on the contrary the song which the captain gave us was a sentimental ditty which you may hear at any pleasure garden on a summer evening it was all about the flames of love which could only be extinguished by chloe and a broken heart and darts and groves and in fact a song such as would be sung in a concert before a party of ladies the fellow had a good voice and rolled out his lovesick strains to the admiration of the women some of whom even shed tears this is the kind of song they like not the song in praise of a highwaymans life because in matters of imagination these women are but poorly provided and they always see the reality beyond the words and if they love the man his certain end makes them unhappy but hearts and flames and love that if you please which is unreal seems real when he finished jenny sprang to her feet i will dance for you lads she turned to me play upthe hey she ran into the middle of the room bowed to the people as if she had been on the stage and danced with such grace and freedom and simplicity that it ravished my heart her sister i observed went on adding up figures on the slate without paying the least attention to the performance ah said her mother growing confidential thus would she dance when she was quite a little thing on the stones in front of the church when the fiddler played in the house a clever girl she was even then a clever girl you are her friend i hope sir that you are going to behave handsome by my girl you look like one of the right sort make over while there is time i will keep the swag for youyou may trust the poor girls mother many a brave fellow she might have had many a brave fellow they come and goi wish you a long rope young man if so be youre kind to my girl life is shortwhat odds so long as tis merry where do you work if i may ask jenny will tell you perhaps i replied i dont know i dont know since she left off the orange line jenny hasnt been the same to her old mother not to tell her things i mean and to take her advice i should have made her rich by this time if she had taken my advice many people like to have their own way dont they they do sirthey doto their loss she took another pull at the punch and began to get maudlin and to shed tearswhile she enlarged upon what she would have done had jenny only listened to her i gathered from her discourse that the old gipsy woman like the whole of her tribe was without a gleam or a spark of virtue or goodness her nature was sordid and depraved through and through with such a motherpoor jenny suddenly the old woman stopped short and sat upright with a look of terror good lord she murmured its mr merridew at sight of the newcomer standing on the steps a dead silence fell upon the whole company all knew him by name those who knew his face whispered to each other all quailed before him down to the meanest little pickpocket they knew him and feared him every face became white even the faces of the women who shook with terror on account of the men i observed the girl on the captains knee catch him by the hand and place herself in front of him as if to save him then his arm left her waist and she slipped down and sat humbly on the bench beside her man thus there was some human affection among these poor things but the captains face blanched with terror and the glass that he was lifting to his lips remained halfway on its journey the bishops face could not turn white in any extremity of fear but it became yellowwhile his eyes rolled about and he grasped the table beside him in his agitation doll i observed after a glance to learn the cause of the sudden silence went on sucking her fingers rubbing out the figures on the slate and adding them up again who is it i whispered to jenny hush its the thieftaker they are all afraid that their time has come if he wants one of them he will have to get up and go wont they fight then do they sit still to be taken fight mr merridew as well walk straight to tyburn the man was a large and heavy creature having something of the look of a prosperous farmer his face however was coarse and brutal and he looked round the terrified room as if he was selecting a pig from a herd with as much pity and no more this was the man whose perjuries had added a new detainer to my imprisonment i could have fallen upon him with the first weapon handy but refrained he came into the room your place stinks mother he said and its so thick with tobacco and the steam of the punch that a body cant see across to be sure mr merridew the old woman apologised if wed known you were coming there would have been a large company would there not well sir you see us here as we are as orderly and peaceful a house as your worship would desire the fellow grinned orderly truly mother it is a quiet and a wellconducted company isnt it these are quiet and wellconducted girls are they not he chucked one of the girls under the chin as much as you likethere said the girl impudently so long as you keep your fingers off my neck at this playful allusion to his profession that of sending people to the gallows mr merridew laughed and patted the girl on the cheek my dear he said if you were on my list you should get rich and you should have the longest rope of any one the man jenny told me afterwards is the greatest villain in the whole world he is a thieftaker by profession you mean he informs and takes the reward yes but he makes the thing which he sells he lays traps for pickpockets and such small fry and while he has them in his power he encourages them to become bigger rogues who will be worth more to him do you understand a highwayman is worth about eighty pounds reward to him a man returned from transportation before his time is worth no more than forty he does not therefore give up the returned convict until he has returned to his highway robberies all those fellows you saw last night are in his power the captain is a returned convict whose time must before long be up for merridew only allows a certain amount of rope he says he cannot afford more as for the bishop he will go on longer he is useful in many other ways he can write letters and forge things and invent villainies he persuades the young fellows to take to the road i think he will be suffered to go on as long as his powers last why was your mother so terrified jenny hesitated becausei told you but you do not understandbecause she too is in his power for receiving stolen goods my mother is what they call a fence oh she shook herself impatiently they are all rogues together i wonder i can ever hold up my head to think of the black jack and the company there the captain sprang to his feet with an effort at ease and politeness what will your honour think of us he cried gentlemen mr merridew is thirsty and no one offers him a drink call for it sircall for the best this house affords punch mother the great man replied thank you captain then the bishop not to be outdone got up too gentlemen he said let us all drink to the health of mr merridew he is our truest friend now gentlemen together after me he held up his hand they watched the sign and all together drank and shoutedhollow shouts they wereto the health of the man who was going to sell them all to the hangman i wondered that they had not run upon him with their knives and despatched him as he stood before them unarmed but this they dared not do mr merridew acknowledged the compliment boys and gallant riders he said i thank you there was a friend of ours whom i expected to find here but i do not see him he looked round the room curiously i think he enjoyed the general terror no matter i shall find him at the spotted dog every one breathed relief no one then of that company was wanted the captain sat down and drank off a whole glass of punch the rest of the men looked at each other as sailors might look whose ship has just scraped the rock i like to look in friendly as it might be mr merridew went on especially when i dont want anybodyjust to see you enjoying yourselves happy and comfortable together as you should be theres no profession more happy and comfortable is there thats what i always say even to the ungrateful plenty to eat no work to do no masters over you girls and drink and music and dancing every night find me another trade half so prosperous mother ill take a second glass of punch i drink your healthsall of youbless you the fellow looked so brutal and so cunning that i longed to kill him as one would kill a noxious beast a long rope and a merry life he went on it is not my fault gentlemen that the rope is not longer the expenses are great and the profits are small meantime go on and prosper you are all safe under my care without me who knows what would happen to all this goodly company a long rope i say and a merry life he tossed off his glass and went out when he was gone the talk began again but it was flat the mirth had gone out of the party it was as if the angel of death himself had passed through the room i played to them but only the boys would dance jenny asked them to sing but only the girls would sing and truth to say the poor creatures efforts were not musical they drank but moodily the captain took glass after glass but his arm had left the girls waist she now sat neglected on the bench beside him the bishop sobered by the fright said nothing but sat with his eyes fixed upon the sanded floor shuddering he thought his time had come and the shock made him for the moment reflect yet what was the good of reflecting they were in the hands of a relentless monster he would sell them when it was worth his while to put younger men in their place they tried to forget this but from time to time his presence or the absence of one of their company reminded them and then they were subdued for a time it filled me with pity it made me think a little better of them that they should be capable of being thus affected jenny touched my arm come she said let us be gone so without any farewells she led the way out the old woman by this time was sound asleep beside her half finished glass and doll was still adding up the figures on her slate putting her finger in her mouth rubbing out and adding up again outside the tall white spire of st giless looked down upon us in the churchyard the white tombs stood in peace and overhead the moon sailed in splendour jenny drew a long breath she caught one of the rails of the churchyard and looked in curiously will she said shuddering i am ashamed of myself because the manners and the talk come back to me so easily once i am with them i become one of them again i tremble when the man merridew appears it is as if he will do me too a mischief some day i cannot forget the old times and the old talk yet i know how dreadful it is look at the graves will under them they sleep so quiet they never move they dont hear anything and beside them every night collects this company of gaolbirds and tyburn birds why they dont shiver and shake when mr merridew looks in let us get back jenny i shuddered like all the rest will i have seen that manthat monsterthat wretchfor whom no punishment is enoughthree times each time i have felt that like the rest of those poor rogues my own life was in his hands do you think he can do me a mischief why do i ask i know that he will i am never wrong what mischief jenny could he do i dont know it is a prophetic feeling but who knows what such a villain may be concocting goodnight you happy people in the graves goodnight i drew her away and walked with her to her own door in the square will she asked what do you think of me now whatever i think jenny i am all wonder and admiration that you arewhat you arewhen i seewhat you might have been she burst into tears she flung her empty basket out into the road oh she cried if i could escape from them if i could only escape from them for ever i should think nothing too terrible if only i could escape from them a month or two later i remembered those words nothing too terrible if only she could escape from them chapter vi a warning and another offer as soon as we had once more found the means of keeping ourselves we went back to our former abode under the shadow of lambeth church on the bank looking over the river on one side and over the meadows and orchards of lambeth marsh on the other the air which sweeps up the river with every tide is fresh and strong and pure good for the child not to speak of the childs mother while the people few in number are generally honest though humble for the most part they are fishermen here i should have been happy but for the thought suggested by jenny that my cousin and his attorney probus were perhaps devising some new means of persecution and that the man merridew who had perjured himself concerning me already whose sinister face i had gazed upon with terror so visibly was the mark of cain stamped upon it was but a tool of the attorney yet what could they devise if they swore between them another debt my patron jenny promised to provide me with the help of a lawyer what else could they do it is a most miserable feeling that someone in the world is plotting your destruction you know not how however on sunday afternoonit was in november when the days are already short we had a visit from my fathers old clerk ramage he was restless in his manner he was evidently in some anxiety of mind after a few words he began mr will he said i have much to say i have come i fear to tell you something that will make you uneasy i will leave you alone said alice taking up the child no madam no i would rather that you heard you may advise oh madam i never thought the day would come that i should reveal my masters secrets i eat his bread i take his wages and i am come here to betray his most private affairs then do not betray them mr ramage said alice follow your own conscience it ought to be your bread and your wages mr will and would have been but for tales and inventions sir in a word there is villainy afloat what kind of villainy i know all they do sir there is that sum of one hundred thousand pounds in the hands of trustees payable to the survivor of you two that is the bottom of the whole villainy well they are mad to make you sell your chance i know that mr matthew more than a year ago offered mr probus a thousand pounds if he could persuade you to sell it for three thousand that is why he was so eager this was exactly how jenny read the business yes he reported that you would not sell he said that if it was made worth his while he would find a way to make you that is why he put me in the kings bench i suppose that was agreed upon between them sir if ever there was an infamous conspiracy this was one probus invented it he said that he would keep you there till you rotted he said that when you had been there four or five months you would be glad to get out on any terms you were there for a year or more probus sent people to report how you were looking he told mr matthew with sorrow that you were looking strong and hearty then you were taken out they were furious they knew not who was the friend an attorney named dewberry had done it that was all they could find out i know not what this mr dewberry said to mr probus but certain i am that they will not try that plan any more i am glad to hear so much mr will there is more behind i know very well what goes on i say a little while after the death of your father when the alderman retired and mr matthew was left sole active partner he began to borrow money of mr probus who came often to see him i could hear all they said from my desk in the corner of the outer countinghouse ay ay i remember your desk sitting there i heard every word and i am glad mr willi ought to be ashamed but i am glad that i listened well he began to borrow money of mr probus at per cent on the security of the business anyone would lend money to such a house at per cent he said he wanted to put the money into the business to buy new ships and to develop it this made me suspicious why because our house in your fathers time sir wanted no fresh capital it developed and grew on its own capital this i knew the business wanted no new capital what did he borrow the money for then i know not indeed he bought no new ships he never meant to buy any mr will to my certain knowledgehere his voice deepened to a whisper he wanted for some reason or other more ready money i am certain that he has got through all the money that your father left him i know that he has sold some of the ships he has mortgaged the rest the business of the house decays and sinks daily he has got rid of all the money that mr probus advanced him it was l for which he is to pay per cent on l tis a harpya sharka common rogue how has he lost this money i pretended not to know but as you have heard i knew perfectly well that sir i cannot tell you i have no knowledge how a man can in three years get through such an amazing amount of money and do so much mischief to an old established business but the case is as i tell you this is very serious ramage does my uncle know he does not sir that poor man will be a bankrupt in his old age it will kill him it will kill him and i must not tell him remember that most of what i tell you is what i overheard i think that my uncle ought to know i remembered jennys advice here was another opportunity i should have told him but i neglected this chance as well i cannot tell him sir there is however more this concerns you mr will yesterday in the afternoon mr probus came to the countinghouse he came for the interest on his money mr matthew told him shortly that it was not convenient to pay him mr probus humbly explained that he had need of the money for his own occasions now mr matthew had been drinking he often goes to the tavern of a forenoon and returns with a red face and heavy shoulders perhaps yesterday he had been drinking more than was usual with him otherwise he might not have been so plainspoken with his creditor mr probus he said it is time to speak the truth with you i cannot pay you the interest of your moneyeither today or at any other time cannot cannot pay mr halliday what do you mean i say sir that i cannot pay your interest and that your principal the money you lent meyesyour lis gone youll never get a penny of it and then he laughed scornfully i heard mr probuss step as he sprang to his feet i heard him strike the table with his open hand his face i could not see sir he cried explain where is my money gone i say everything is gone your money my money all that i could raisemy ships are sold the business is gone the creditors are gathering probus i shall be a bankrupt in less than three months i have worked it out i can play one against the other but only for three months then the house must be bankrupt the housebankruptthis househalliday brothers you had a hundred thousand of your own when you succeeded you had credit you had a noble fleet and a great business and theres your fathers money in the business as well it cant be gone it is gonei tell youall gonemy money probusinteger vitaethats gone and your money old scelerisque probus thats gone too all goneall gone to be sure he was three parts drunk i heard mr probus groan and sink back into his chair then he got up again tell me he said again tell me you poor drivelling drunken devilill kill you if you laugh tell me where is the money gone i dont know his voice was thick with drink i dont know its all gone everythings gone i lent you the money to put into the businessit must be in the business still it never was in the business i tell you probusits all gone there was silence for a few minutes then mr probus said softly mr halliday we are old friendstell me that you have only been playing off a joke upon me you are a little disguised in liquor i can pass over this accident the money is in the business you know in this fine old business where you put it when you borrowed it its all goneall gone he repeated man why wont you believe i tell you that everything is gone make me a bankrupt at once and you will share with the creditors oh yes you will be very lucky you will divide between you the furniture of the countinghouse and the empty casks on the quay then mr probus began to curse and to swear and to threaten he would throw mr matthew into prison and keep him there all his life he would prosecute him at the old bailey he called him thief scoundrel villain mr matthew laughed in his drunken mood he would not explain how the money was lost he only repeated that it was goneall gone mr willi know that he was speaking the truth i had seen things doneyou cannot hide things from an old accountant who keeps the books cargoes sold at a sacrifice for ready money ships sold our splendid fleet thrown away there were six tall vessels in the west india trade one was cast away the underwriters paid for her where is that money where are the other five ships sold where is that money our coffers are empty there is no running cash at the bank the wharf is deserted clerks are dismissed creditors are put off i know that what mr matthew said was true but for the life of me i cannot tell what he has done with the money unless he has thrown it into the river then i think that mr matthew took more drink for he made no more reply and mr probus after calling him hog and beast and other names of like significance left him when he came out of the countinghouse he was like one possessed of a devil his face distorted his eyes bloodshot his lips moving his hands trembling sir although he is a villain i felt sorry for him he has lost all that he cared for all that he valued and since he is now old and can make no more money he has lost perhaps his means of livelihood ramage paused alice brought him a glass of beer her own homebrewed thus refreshed he presently went on again after two days probus came again to the countinghouse mr matthew was sober probus he said i told you the other day when i was drunk what i should have kept from you if i was sober however now you know what i told you was the truth is it all true it is all true everything is gone but howhowhow i heard his lamentable cry and i could imagine his arm waving about this way and that way enough that it is all gone mr matthew i think he sat down because he groanedwhich a man cannot do properlythat is to say movingly unless he is sittingi have been thinkinggood god of what else could i think you can keep yourself afloat for three months more you sayheavens halliday brothers to go in three months and my money wherewherewhere has it gone in about three monthsor may be sooner the end must come mr matthew he lowered his voice there is one chance leftone chancei may get back my moneyby that one chance what chance the money is all gone if we can make your cousin part with his chance of the succession we can raise money on it before the bankruptcywe can divide it between us put it out of your thoughts my cousin is the most obstinate selfwilled brute that ever lived you couldnt bend him with the kings bench prison you cannot bend him now i will try again he is still poor he plays the fiddle at some wretched gardens i believe he lives where he did beforei know where to find him i will try again if i succeed we could raise say l upon the succession it should be more but you are both young let me see that will be l for me l interest due to me that makes l for me and l for you no friend probus you have lent me l that you shall take and no more if you are not content with that you shall have none remember that the money must be raised by me for my own use not by you get him to sign if you canand you shall have back all your money but without any interest if you think you are going to get all this money for yourself let me tell you that you are mistaken mr matthew can be as hard asas your father sometimes he was hard now well the pair wrangled over these terms for a long time at last it was arranged that if mr probus can persuade you to sign the paper which he is to bring you he is to take l and interest on that and not on the alleged l at per cent and mr matthew is to pay you the sum required to buy out when they had completed this arrangement mr probus started another line of discourse now listen to this mr will because it concerns you very closely if he said your cousin were to dieactually to die he wont die i wish he would i saidif he were to dieyou would then immediately take over l together with the interest at per cent already accumulated for three years namely about l that would put all square again you could get back some of your ships and your credit whats the use man i have told youmy cousin is a selfish unfeeling obstinate brute he wont die i said if he were to die that is what i said if he were to die then there was silence for a space probus said mr matthew i believe you are a devil tell me what you mean we cant make him die by wishing i was only supposing if he were to diestrange things have happenedwould you be disposed to let me take the half of that moneysay l if he were to die mr matthew repeated have you heard by accident that he is ill has he taken smallpox or gaol fever i did hear that was gaol fever in newgate some time ago no on the contrary i believe that he is in perfect health at present still he might die anybody may die you know why do you say that he may die i only put the case anybody may die what do you say about my proposal you call it a proposalmanyou look like a murdererare you going to murder him certainly not wellwhat do you say wellif you are not going to murder him what do you mean men die of many complaints besides murder some men get themselves into the clutches of the law when ramage said this i became suddenly aware of a great gulf opening at my feet with a prospect of danger such as i had never before contemplated i thought that the man might swear upon me some crime of which i was innocent and so bring it home to me by a diabolical artifice that i should be accused found guilty and executed i reeled and turned pale alice caught my hand have faith my dear she said yet the thought was like a knife piercing me through and through i could not afterwards shake it off and i made up my mindi know not whythat the charge would take the form of an accusation of forgery probus said mr matthew i will have nothing to do with this sir you need not give me your word only your simple word that if your cousin refuses to sign the paper i shall lay before him so that you cannot raise money on that successionand if within two months of this day your cousin dies so that you will succeed before you are bankrupt i am to take half that money in full discharge of all my claims that is all i will leave you now to think the matter over he went away the next day he returned bringing with him a man whom i had never seen before mr matthew he said i have brought you a gentleman whose acquaintance with our criminal law is vastprobably unequaled his name sir is merridew his honour says no more than what is true said mr merridew i know more than most i understand you want me to advise you on a little matter of prosecution well sir i can only say that if you want a friend put out of the way so to speak nothing is easier for them that knows how to work the job and can command the instruments it is only a question of pay then they talked in whispers and i heard no more when they were gone mr matthew began to drink again that is all mr will but have a care you now know what to expect sir there will be no pity from any of them have a care go away go to some place where they cannot find you sir the man probus is mad he is mad with the misery of losing his money there is nothing that he will not do he is a moneylender his money is all in all to him his profession and his pride and everything and he has lost his money go out of his way is that all ramage yes sir that is all i had to say then my old friend you have come just in time for if i mistake not there is mr probus himself walking across the meadow with the intention of calling here you could not have chosen a better time indeed that was the case the man was actually walking quickly across the marsh now ramage i said it would be well for you to hear what he has to say go into the kitchen and wait with the door ajargo alice my dear stay here with me remember will she said it was your fathers last command to sell it would be to sell your fathers forgivenessa dreadful thing the man stood at the open door ramage was right he looked truly dreadful anxiety was proclaimed in his face with eagerness and courage he reminded me of a weasel which for murderous resolution is said to surpass the whole of the animal creation he came in blinking after the light and offered me his hand but i refused it fie he said fie mr will this is ill done you confuse the attorneys zeal for his clients with an act of hostility to yourself put that out of your thoughts i pray why do you come here mr probus i said to myself it is not easy to catch a man of mr williams reputation at home his society being eagerly sought after i will therefore visit him on sunday not in the morning when he will be lifting the hymn in church but in the afternoon i came here straight from st georges borough where i sometimes repair for morning service a holy discourse mr william moving and convincing his eyes kept shifting to and fro as he spoke very likely but we will not talk about sermons look ye mr probus your presence here is not desired say what you have to say and begone hot youth ah i envy that fine heat of the blood once i was just the same myself he must have been a good deal changed then since that time he went on i will not stay long i am once more a peacemaker it is a happy office it is an office that can be discharged on the sabbath sweetly the river flows beneath your feet ah a peacemaker i come from your cousin again to make another offer yes that is my object i am again prepared to offer you terms which i believe no one else in the world would propose to you mr william i will give you the sum of four thousand pounds downequivalent to an annual income of two hundred pounds a year if you will sell your reversion no mr matthew can use the money to advantage while it lies locked up it is of no use to anyone no such obstinacy was never known before i believe why sir i offer you an annual income of two hundred pounds a yeartwo hundred pounds a year you can leave this wretched little cottage overhanging a marsh you can move into a fashionable quarter and live like a person of quality you can abandon your present mode of life which i take to be repellent to every person of virtuethat of musician to the dog and duck or some other resort of the profligate oh we know where you are and what you do instead of servant you will be master you madam will no longer be a household drudge you will have your cook your maids your page to carry your prayerbook to church no he hesitated a little the sham benevolence dying out of his face and the angry look of baffled cunning taking its place mr probus was a bad actor he took out a parchment sign it mr williamhere he unrolled it and indicated the place let us have no more shilly shally willy nilly talk it is for your good and for my clients and yours too mr probus my dear said alice do not exchange words any longer you have said no already it is my husbands last word sir there i should have stopped it is always foolish to reveal to an enemy what one has discovered i think that up to that moment mr probus was only anxious that is to say he was crazy with anxiety but he could not believe that his money was all gone because he had no knowledge or suspicion in what way it had gone things that appear impossible cannot be believed i think that he would have assured himself of the fact in some other way before proceeding to the wickedness which he actually had in his mind he would have waited and i could have eluded him some way or other as it was the mere statement of matthew drunk drove him half mad with fear but there was still the chance that matthew sober would have spoken differently no according to alice was my last word not quite the last word i said hark ye mr probus the sum waiting for me when matthew dies is one hundred thousand pounds with accumulations of interest is it not if he were to die tomorrowto be sure it is not likelybut he may be murdered or he may put himself within the power of the law and so be executed mr probus turned ghastly white and shook all over then i should come in for the whole of that money which is much better than four thousand pounds whereas if i were to die tomorroweither by the operation of the law or by some other manner matthew would have the whole and you would get back the twentyfive thousand pounds you have lent my cousin with a noble addition if you do get it that ismr probus i think that you will not get it i think you will never get any more of your money back at all i dont know sir what you mean or what you know he stammered i know more than you think i know where your money has gone he jumped up where where where tell me it has gone into the bottomless gulf that they call the gaming table mr probus it has been gambled away the ships of my fathers fleet the cargoes the accumulated treasures the credit of the business the private fortune of my cousin your own money lent to matthew it has all gone irrecoverably gone the gaming table he groaned the gaming table i never thought of that sir do you know what you meanthe gaming table no one but a moneylender knows all that may be meant by the gaming table i know what i say matthew told you the truth everything has gone ruin stares him in the faceyour money is gone with the rest the gaming table and i never suspected it the gaming table he fell into a kind of trance or fit with open mouth white cheeks and fixed eyes this lasted only for a few moments mr probus i went on i cannot say that i am sorry for your misfortunes but i hope we shall never meet again he got up slowly his face was full of despair i confess that i pitied him for he gave way altogether to a madness of grief gone he cried nonononot goneit cant be gone he threw himself into a chair and buried his face in his hands he sobbed he moaned when he lifted his head again his features were distorted it is my all he cried oh you dont know what it is to lose your all i can never get any morei am old i have few clients lefti get no new ones the old cannot get new clients my character is not what it was they cry out after me in the street they say i lend money at cent per centwhy not they call me old cent per cent if i lose this money i am indeed lost we cannot help you mr probus oh yes do what i ask you sell your chance you will never outlive your cousin you will save my life think of saving a mans life as for your cousin let him go his own way i hate him it is you you mr william i have always loved no he turned to alice and fell on his knees persuade him madam you are all goodness oh persuade himthink of your child you can make him rich with a stroke of a penthink of that oh think of that the tears ran down his cheeks sir i think only of my husbands father and of his wishes which are commands enough saidthere was too much said alreadyyour money is gone mr probus gone he repeated but no longer in terms of entreaty he was now fallen into the other extreme he was blind and mad with rage and despair nonoits not gone i will get it out of you those who threw you into prison can do worseworse you have brought it on yourself it is your ruin or mine once more with trembling fingers he held out the paper for me to sign no he stayed no longer he threw out his arms again it was as if his breath refused to come and he turned away he looked like a brokendown man crawling bent with hanging head along the road as soon as he was gone ramage opened the door and came out cautiously mr will he cried for heavens sake sir for your dear ladys sake for the childs sake get out of the way nothing else will serve he is desperate and he is as cunning as the devil himself to get back his money he will shrink from nothing indeed ramage i said i think you are right i will take a holiday for awhile when the bankruptcy comes he said there will be no more danger because all the money would be divided among the creditors better to run away than to be ruined i promised to think of flight indeed my mind was shaken i was not afraid of open villainy but of that which might be concealed and designed in secret it would perhaps be best to go where the man could not find me so ramage departed when he saw me again it was in a very different place the bell of lambeth church began to toll it seemed to me like a funeral knell though it was the bell for the afternoon service the wind came up from the river chilled with the november air my heart sank my dear said alice let us go to church oh the mark of the evil spirit is stamped upon the unhappy mans forehead let us pray not for ourselves but for gods mercy upon a wandering soul i followed her as she led the way carrying the child alas how long before i could sit with her again to hear the prayers of the church among godly folk chapter vii jennys advice after this plain warning after knowing the nature of the design against me after the savage threats of the man probus i ought to have hesitated no longer i should have taken alice and the child to her brother tom and should then have retired somewhere until the inevitable bankruptcy relieved me from fear of conspiracy once before i had suffered from delay yet had i not learned the perils of procrastination i had formed in my mind an idea that they would try in some way to fix upon me the crime of forgery and i thought that this would take time so that i was not hurried i confess that i was disquieted but i was not hurried on monday morning i repaired to soho square and laid the whole business before jenny will she said after hearing all and asking a few questions this seems a very serious affair you have to deal with a man driven frantic by the loss of all his money the money that he has spent his life in scraping together he throws out hints about your possible death in the countinghouse and makes a bargain in case you die he threatens you with some mysterious revenge i believe he will trump up some charge of forgery he is quite unscrupulous now i will tell you something the man merridews perjury about your alleged debt put me on the scent probus works through merridew first of all merridew owes him moneymore than he can pay this debt goes on rolling up this puts merridew in his power what probus orders merridew must do is there always behind every villain a greater villain i suppose so the greater the rogue the safer he is merridew goes to the shopkeepers and offers to return them stolen goodsat a price it is one of his ways of making money then he finds out their necessities most shopkeepers are always in want of money then merridew takes them to probus who lends them money oh at first there was never such a kind friendon the easiest terms they can pay when they please then they want a little more and so they go on when their debt has risen to half the value of their stock probus wants to be paid then he sells them up the father of the family becomes bankrupt and goes into a prison for the rest of his days what becomes of the children i know notno one knows i dare say some of them go to st giless this is what jenny told me i know not if it is true but i think it must be well you see that probus pulls the strings and sets merridews arms and legs at work and merridew has all the rogues under his thumb now you understand why the position is serious she considered for a few minutes will she said for sure they will talk it over at the black jack when anything is arranged it is generally done in the kitchen and in the morning she looked at the clock it is now nearly one if i were to go round she considered again doll will be there they may be there too but this time they must not recognise me wait a bit will she left me and presently came back dressed not as an orange girl but as a common person such as one may see anywhere in st giless she had on a linsey woolsey frock a dirty white apron all in holes a kerchief round her neck another over her head tied under her chin a straw hat also tied under her chin and woollen mittens on her hands one cheek was smudged as by a coal and her left eye was blackened no one would have recognised her on her arm she carried a basket carefully covered up now she said im a woman with a basket full of stolen goods for mother wilmot i let her out by the gardendoor which opened on to hogs lane presently she returned from what she told me this was what passed she found her mother nodding over knitting and her sister doll busy with the slate the kitchen was wellnigh empty because most of the frequenters were abroad picking up their living like the sparrows they pick it up as they can from pockets and doorways and from shop bulks doll she whispered pretend not to know me turn over the things in the basket what is it jenny she looked round the room there were only two or three sitting by the fire no one who knows me she said tell me doll has mr merridew been hereand when why hes only just gone him and the bishopand the captainand another onea gentleman he looked like all in black all in black was he tall and thin and stooping so yes theyve been talking over it all the morning what is it doll youve got ears like gimlets i sometimes think it must be pleasant to be able to hear so much that goes on i can hear a thing if i like the bishop dont like it jenny she dropped her voice its business for getting a man out of the way theyll have to give evidence at the old bailey and hes afraid how is the man to be put out of the way i dont know theres money on it but theyre afraid why are they afraid because theyre going to make a man swing if he doesnt swing they will i suppose its an innocent man doll how should i know it isnt one of themselves if the case breaks down theyll have to swing mr merridew promised them so much for i heard him he means it tooand they know it i heard him if you do break down he says after all you will be no worse off than you are at present for your times up and you know it both of you so if you break down you will be arrested for conspiracy and detained on my information on a capital charge after whichhe made so with her finger on her neck well what did they say doll the bishop said it would be easier and quicker to knock him on the head at once mr merridew wouldnt hear of it he said if they obeyed him they should have two years more rope if not they knew what to expect so they went away with him looking mighty uneasy when is it to be doll lord sister you are mighty curious tis no affair of yours best know nothing i say only a body must hear things and it makes the time pass knowing what to expect can you find out when it is to be if i learn i will tell you its all settled i know that we shall have the pair of them giving evidence in the old bailey doll laughed at the thought all st giless will go to the court to hearall them that dare so they went away with mr merridew jenny repeated thoughtfully yes after a mug of purl but the bishop went away shaking not on account of the crime i suppose but with the thought of being crossexamined in the old bailey and the terror that he might be recognised but the only london prison that knew him was the kings bench jenny took up her basket and went away just outside the door she met a young country fellow he had come up from some village in consequence of trouble concerned with a girl jenny had had speech with him already as you have heard at the black jack jack she said you dont remember me i was at the black jack some time ago in the evening they called me madam now you remember ay he said looking at her curiously but i shouldnt know you again you are dressed different jack why dont you go home a man must live he replied youll be hanged for sure and certain one of these days youll be hanged now jack ill give you a chance let us sit here by the rails and talkthen people wont suspect youve seen mr merridew today i thought so he told you that he might want you on some serious job i thought so your looks are still innocent jack now tell me all about itand ill give you money to take you home again out of the way and safe jack had very little to tell he had been in the kitchen that morning mr merridew called himbade him not to go away said that he should want him perhaps for a good job so he waited then a gentleman came in he was in blacka long and lean figure jack would know him again and they all fourbut not jacktalked very earnestly together then the gentleman went away and presently mr merridew also went away with the bishop and the captain very good jack i will see you tomorrow morning againjust in the same place dont forget if anything else occurs you will tell me poor jack i should be sorry to see so proper a fellow hanged so she nodded and laughed and pressed his hand and left him she came home she joined me again there was something hatching that was certain perhaps she said the plot is not directed against you merridew is always finding out where a house can be broken or a bale of stuff stolen then what did probus want there the long lean man in black was not probus perhaps she considered again after all will i think the best thing is for you to disappear they are desperate villains get out of their way your friend ramage gave you the best advice possible if all he says is true matthew cannot hold out much longer once he is bankrupt your death will no longer help probus where could you go i told her that i thought of dublin where i might get into the orchestra of the theatre so after a little discussion it was settled jenny always generous undertook to provide for alice in my absence and gave me a sum of money for present necessities i stayed there all day in the evening i played at a concert in the assembly room after the concert i took supper with jenny during supper jenny entertained me with a fuller description of the wretches from whose hands she was trying to rescue me there was no turn or trick of villainy that jenny did not know she made no excuses for knowing so muchit was part of her education to hear continually talk of these things they make up disguises in which it is impossible to recognise them they arrange that respectable people shall swear to their having been miles away at the time of the crime they practise on the ignorance of some on the cunning of others they prey upon mankind and all the time behind every villain stands a greater villain behind the humble footpad stands the captain behind the captain stands the thieftaker behind the thieftaker stands the moneylender himself unseen it would surely be to the advantage of the law could it tackle the greater villains first a cartload of gentlemen like mr probus on its way to tyburn would perhaps be more useful than many cartloads of poor pickpockets and hedgelifters sometimes however as this history will relate justice with tardy step overtakes a probus and that with punishment so dreadful that he is left incapable of any further wickedness now she said when probus wants money he squeezes merridew then he lays information against some poor wretch who expected a longer rope in order to get at these wretches he has to encourage them to break the law so you see if he has to make a payment to probus he must manufacture criminals as i said there cannot be many things worse than the making of criminals for the satisfaction of the moneylender i hardly understood at the time the full villainy of this system in fact i was wholly absorbed in my own particular case what was going to be done about midnight i bade this kindest of women farewell remember will she said trust nothing to chance take boat down the river before daybreak there is sure to be a holyhead coach somewhere in the morning in a month or two you can come back again in safety yesi was to come back in safety in that time but not as jenny meant i shouldered my trusty club and marched off chapter viii a successful conspiracy my way home lay through dean street as far as st anns church then i passed across leicester fields and through green street at the southeast angle of the fields into st martins lane all this part of the way is greatly infested at night by lurking footpads from the choice purlieus of seven dials and soho of footpads however i had very little fear they are at best a cowardly crew even two or three together and a man with a stout cudgel and some skill at a quarterstaff or singlestick need not be afraid of them generally two or three passengers will join together in order to get across the fields which are especially the dangerous part on many nights it was so late when i left the square that even footpads highwaymen pickpockets and all were fairly home and in bed before i walked through the streets this evening by bad luck i was alone i found no other passengers going my way but i had no fear i poised my cudgel and set out expecting perhaps an encounter with a footpad but nothing worse and it was not yet late as hours go in london there were still people in the streets what had happened was this as soon as probus learned the truth about the gamingtablea fatal thing it was to disclose my knowledgehe understood two things first that his money was irrevocably gone and second that if i revealed the truth to the alderman in his suburban retreat he must needs investigate the position of things in which case bankruptcy would be precipitated after that whether i died or signed the agreement or refused to sign it would matter nothing to him whereas on the other hand if my signature could be obtained before the bankruptcy then money could be raised upon the succession and if i were to die then the whole of the money would be paid on the day of my death to matthew whatever was done must therefore be done as soon as possible therefore he resolved that the plot should be carried into execution on the very monday evening he caused the cottage to be watched by one of the girls who frequented the black jack she followed me all the way from lambeth to soho square and she carried intelligence where to find me to the tavern where probus himself with merridew the bishop and the captain was now waiting they understood that i was playing at a concert they therefore sallied out about the time when the concert would be finishing and waited for me in the square at eleven oclock i sallied forth i walked down dean street they ran down greek street to meet me at the other end where there are fewer people but i heard this afterwards changed their minds and got over the fields into green street behind the mews where they resolved to wait for me the bishop posted himself on one side the captain on the other mr probus and mr merridew waited a little further down the street it was a dangerous plot that they were going to attempt i am not surprised that neither the bishop nor the captain had much stomach for the play at this place which has as bad a reputation as any part of london there are seldom any passengers after nightfall after midnight none it is dark the houses are inhabited by criminal and disorderly peoplebut all this is well known to everybody i walked briskly along anticipating no danger of this kind suddenly i heard footsteps in front of me and behind me there was a movement in the quiet street by such light as the stars gave i saw before me the rascally face of the bishop i lifted my cudgel i half turnedcrashi remember nothing more when i came to my senses or to some part of my senses i found myself lying on a sanded floor my head was filled with a dull and heavy pain my eyes were dazed to open them brought on an agony of pain for awhile the voices i heard were like the buzzing of bees i grew better i was able to distinguish a little but i could not yet open my eyes the first voice that i recognized was that of mr probusthe rasping harsh terrifying voicewho could mistake it a bad case gentlemen he was saying a very bad case it was fortunate that i was passing on my way if only to identify the prisoner dear me i knew his honoured father gentlemen i was his fathers unworthy attorney his father was none other than sir peter halliday the young man was turned out of the house for misconduct a bad casewho would have thought that sir peters son would die at tyburn then there was another voice rich and rolling like a low stop of the organi knew that too it was the voice of the bishop my name mr constable is carstairs samuel carstairs the rev samuel carstairs doctor of divinity sanctae theologiae professor sometime of trinity college dublin i am an irish clergyman at present without cure of souls i was walking home after certain godly exercisesin the black jacki supposewhen this fellow ran out in front of me crying your money or your life i am not a fighting man sir but a servant of the lord i gave him my purse entreating him to spare my life as he took it some other gentleman unknown to me ran to my assistance and knocked the villain down perhaps mr constable you would direct his pockets to be searched the purse contained seventeen guineas i felt hands in my pocket something was taken out ha cried the doctor let the money be counted i heard the click of coin and another voice cried seventeen guineas well said mr probus there cannot be much doubt after that i rejoice said the doctor not so much that the money is foundthough i assure you worthy sir i could ill afford the lossas because it clearly proves the truth of my evidenceif that is to say there could be any question as to its truth or anyone with the hardihood to doubt it at this point i was able to open my eyes the place i knew for a round house the constable in charge sat at a table a book before him entering the case mr probus stood beside him shaking his virtuous head with sorrow the doctor was holding up his hands to express a good clergymans horror of the crime mr merridew was standing on the other side of the constable and beside him the captain who now stepped forward briskly my name he said is ferdinando fenwick i am a country man from cumberland i was walking with this gentlemanhe indicated mr merridew we were walking together for purposes of mutual protection for i have been warned against this part of london when i saw the action described by this pious clergyman the man ran forward raising his cudgel i have brought it with meyou can see sir that it is a murderous weapon i saw the gentleman here whose name i did not catch carstairsby your leave sirsamuel carstairsthe rev samuel carstairsdoctor of divinitysanctae theologiae professor thank you sir i saw him hand over his purse the villain raised his cudgel again i verily believe he intended to murder as well as to rob his victim i therefore ran to the rescue and with a blow of my stick felled the ruffian the constable looked doubtfully at mr merridew whom he knew by sight as everybody connected with the criminal part of the law certainly did he knew him as sheriffs officer nominally thieftaker by secret profession thiefmaker as matter of notoriety at the courts from him he looked at mr probus but more doubtfully because he knew nothing about him except that he was an attorney which means to such people as the constable devil incarnate he also looked doubtfully at the captain whose face perhaps he knew considering that the captain had been living for eight years at least in and about st giless and robbing about all the roads that run out of london perhaps the constable did know him by sight well he said i suppose sir john will look into it tomorrow as for this gentleman who says he isi remember here mr probus slipped something into his hand it is not for me the worthy constable added to remember anything besides i may be wrong well gentlemen you will all attend tomorrow morning at bow street and give your evidence before sir john fielding so they went away and i lay on the floor still wondering stupidly what would happen next just then two watchmen came in one was leading or dragging or carrying a young gentleman richly dressed but so drunk that he could neither stand nor speak the other brought with him a poor creaturea womanyoungonly a girl stilldressed in rags and tatters shivering unwashed uncombed weak and emaciated a deplorable object the constable turned to the first case give the gentleman a chair he said put him before the fire reach me his watch and his purse search his pockets watchman please your honour said the watchman i have searched his pockets we came too late sir nothing in them the town is full of villainsfull of villains said the officer with honest indignation well put him in the chair a gentleman can send for guineas if he hasnt got any guineas did he assault you watchman i thought sowelllet him sleep it off whos this woman the watchman deposed to finding her walking about the deserted streets because she had nowhere to go has she got any money then just put her in the strong roomand carry this poor devil in after her if that story holdswelllay him on the benchand take care of his head they pushed the girl into the strongroom carried me after her laid me down on a wide stone bench without any kind of pillow or covering then they went out locking the door behind them i suppose that i should have suffered more than i did had it not been for the stupefying effect of the blow upon my head i have only a dim recollection of the night the place was filled with poor wretches men and women who could not afford to bribe the constable in this land of freedom to be a poor rogue is hanging matter to be a rogue with money in pocket and purse is quite another thing that rogue goes free the rogue runs the gauntlet first he may get off by bribing the watchman if he fails to do that he may bribe the constable or if the worst happens he may then bribe the magistrate i understand however that this has been changed and that there are now no justices who take bribes now if the watchman brings few cases to the constable and those all poor rogues he may lose his place and if the constable pockets all the bribes and brings the magistrate none he may lose his place so that it is mutually agreed between the three that each is to have his share all mankind are for ever seeking and praying for justice and behold this is all we have got in the boasted eighteenth century i suppose however that in such a case as mine a charge of highway robbery in which the prisoner was taken redhanded no constable would dare to take a bribe from time to time in the night we were disturbed by the grating of the key in the lock as the door was opened for the admission of another poor wretch then these interruptions ceased and we were left in quiet when the day broke through the bars of the only window i could look round upon the people my companions in misfortune there were three or four women in tawdry fineryvery poor and miserable creatures who would be happier in the worst prison than in the way they lived two or three pickpockets and footpads one or two prentices who would be sent to bridewell and flogged for being found drunk there was very little talk mostly the wretches sat in gloomy silence they had not even the curiosity to ask each other as to the offenses with which they were charged as the light increased the women began to whisper they exhorted each other to courage before them all in imagination stood the dreadful whippingpost of bridewell some of them have had an experience of that punishment it takes but two or three minutes they said then it soon passes off mind you screech as if they were murdering you that frightens the alderman and brings down the knocker dont begin to fret about it they were talking about their whippings in bridewell perhaps sir john will let you go sometimes he does my head pained and i closed my eyes again at about eight oclock the doors were flung wide open everyone started shuddered and stood up now then cried a harsh voice out with you out i say i was still giddy with last nights blow my hair was stiff with blood my head ached but i was able to walk out with the others the constables arranged us in a kind of procession and put the handcuffs on every one then we were marched through the streets two by two guarded by constables to bow street office the magistrate of which was then sir john fielding there was some slight comfort in the thought that he was blind he could not be prejudiced against me by my appearance for my face was smeared with blood my hair was stiff with blood there was blood on my coat and where there was not blood there was the mud of the street in which i had lain senseless the business of the court was proceeding the magistrate sat at a table his eyes were bandaged the eyes of justice should be always bandaged over his head on the wall hung the lion and the unicorn the prisoners were placed in a railed space the witnesses in another those in my case i observed were in readiness and waiting three or four bow street runners were standing in the court there was a dock for the prisoner facing the magistrate the cases took little time there is a dreadful sameness about the charges the women were despatched summarily and sent off to bridewell they received their sentences with cries and lamentations which stopped quickly enough when they found that they could not move the magistrate the pickpockets were ordered to be whipped the other rogues were committed to prison they were destined for the most part to transportation beyond the seas it is useful for the country to get rid of its rogues it seems also humane to send them to a country where they may lead an honest life alas the humanity of the law is marred by the execution of the sentence for though the voyage does not last more than six or eight weeks the gaol fever taken on board the ship the sea sickness the stench the dirt the foul air of the ship commonly kill at least a third of the poor creatures thus sent out as for those who are left many of them run away from their masters make their way to a port get on board a ship and are carried back to london where they are fain to go back to their old companions and resume their old habits and get known to mr merridew and his friends and so at last find themselves in the condemned cells my case came on at last i was placed in the dock facing the magistrate the clerk read to him the notes of the case provided by the chief constable your name prisoner he asked i am william halliday i said only son of the late sir peter halliday formerly lord mayor of london i am a musician now in the employment of madam vallance proprietor of the assembly rooms in soho square the magistrate whispered to his clerk then the evidence was given one after the other they manfully stood up kissed the book and committed perjury sir john fielding asked the doctor several questions he was evidently doubtful his clerk whispered again he pressed the doctor as to alleged profession and position however the man stuck to his tale the fact that the purse was found in my pocket was very strong then the captain told his story mr merridew did not attempt any disguise he was too well known in court he stated that he was a sheriffs officernamed merrideweverybody in the court gazed upon him with the greatest curiosity the women whispering and looking from him to me who is he they asked each other what has he done do you know himdo you the surprise at the appearance of a stranger in the dock charged on the evidence of the worthy sheriffs officer caused general surprise however mr merridew took no notice of the whispering he was apparently callous he took it perhaps as proof of popularity and admiration he gave his evidence in the manner of one accustomed to bear witness as indeed he was having perhaps given evidence oftener than any other living man he stated that he had joined a stranger to walk from the tottenham court road to charing cross each carrying a cudgel for selfdefence that he observed the action described by the worthy and learned doctor of divinity from ireland that his companion this gallant young gentleman rushed out to the rescue of the clergyman and so forth so he retired with a front of iron mr probus added to the evidence which you have already heard the statement that he came accidentally upon the party and after the business was over that he happened to have been attorney to the late sir peter halliday that he recognized the robber as the unnatural son of that good man turned out of his fathers home for his many crimes and vices and that in the interest of justice and respect for the laws of his country he went out of his way and was at great personal loss and inconvenience in order to give this evidence the magistrate put no questions to him he turned to me and asked if i had anything to say or any evidence to offer i had none exceptthat i was no highwayman but a respectable musician and that this was a conspiracy you will have the opportunity said sir john of proving the fact meantime in the face of this evidence conspiracy or not i have no choice but to commit you to newgate there to remain until your trial they set me aside and the next case was called so you understand there are other ways of compassing a mans death besides simple murder it is sufficient to enter into a conspiracy and to charge him with an offence which by the laws of the country is punishable by death chapter ix newgate a man must be made of brass or wroughtiron who can enter the gloomy portals of newgate as a prisoner without a trembling of the limbs and a sinking of the heart not even consciousness of innocence is sufficient to sustain a prisoner for alas even the innocent are sometimes found guilty once within the first doors i was fain to lay hold upon the nearest turnkey or i should have fallen into a swoon a thing which they tell me happens with many for the first entrance into prison is worse to the imagination even than the standing up in the dock to take ones trial in open court there is in the external aspect of the prison in the gloom which hangs over the prison in the mixture of despair and misery and drunkenness and madness and remorse which fills the prison an air which strikes terror to the very soul they took me into a large vaulted anteroom lit by windows high up with the turnkeys private room opening out of it and doors leading into the interior parts of the prison the room was filled with people waiting their turn to visit the prisoners they carried baskets and packages and bottles their provisions in a word for the prison allows the prisoners no more than one small loaf of bread every day some of the visitors were quiet sober people some were women on whose cheeks lay tears some were noisy reckless young men who laughed over the coming fate of their friends spoke of tyburn fair of kicking off the shoes at the gallows of dying game of newgate musicmeaning the clatter of the irons of whining and snivelling and so forth they took in wine or perhaps rum under the name of wine there were also girls whose appearance and manner certainly did not seem as if sorrow and sympathy with the unfortunate had alone brought them to this place some of the girls also carried bottles of wine with them in baskets i was then brought before the governor who i thought would perhaps hear me if i declared the truth but i was wrong he barely looked at me he entered my name and occupation and the nature of the crime with which i was charged then he coldly ordered me to be taken in and ironed the turnkey led me into a room hung with irons what side he asked i told him i knew nothing about any sides why he said i thought all the world knew so much theres the state side if you go there you will pay for admission three guineas for garnish and a pair of light irons one guinea for rent of a bed half a guinea a week and for another guinea you can have coals and candles plates and a knife will that suit you he looked disdainfully at the dirt and blood with which i was covered as if he thought the state side was not for the likes of me alas i replied i cannot go to the state side i thought not by the look of you well theres the masters side next the fee for admission is only thirteen and sixpence irons half a guinea the rent of a bed or part of a bed half a crown and as for your food what you like to order and pay for no credit at this tavern which is the sign of the clinking iron will that suit you no i can pay nothing then why waste time asking questions theres the common side youve got to go into that and very grateful you ought to be that there is a common side at all for such a filthy beast as you my choice must needs be the last because i had no money at all not a single solitary shillingmy obliging friends when they put their purse into my pocket as a proof of the alleged robbery abstracted my ownwhich no doubt the worthy professor of sacred theology had in his pocket while he was explaining the nature of the attack to the constable the turnkey while he grumbled about waste of timea prisoner ought to say at once if he had no money officers of the prison were not paid to tell stories to every ragged filthy footpad the common side was as good as any other on the way to tyburn what could a ragamuffin covered with blood and filth expectpicked out a pair of irons they were the rustiest and the heaviest that he could find as he hammered them on he said that for half a crown he would drive the rivet into my heel only that he would rob his friend jack ketch of the pleasure of turning off a poor whining devil who came into newgate without a copper damme he cried as he finished his work if i believe you ever tried to rob anyone i did not i replied at which he laughed recovering his good temper and opening a door shoved me through and shut it behind me the common side of newgate is a place which though i was in it no more than two hours or so remains fixed in my memory and will stay there as long as life remains the yard was filled to overflowing with a company of the vilest the filthiest and the most shameless that it is possible to imagine they were pickpockets footpads shoplifters robbers of every kind they were in rags they were unwashed and unshaven some of them were drunk some of them were emaciated by insufficient fooda penny loaf a day was doled out to those who had no money and no friends that was actually all that the poor wretches had to keep body and soul together the place was crowded not only with the prisoners but with their friends and relations of both sexes the noise the cursings the ribald laugh the drunken song the fighting and quarrelling can never be imagined and in the narrow space of the yard which is like the bottom of a deep well there is no air moving so that the stench is enough at first to make a horse sick i can liken it to nothing but a sty too narrow for the swine that crowded it so full of unclean beasts was it so full of noise and pushing and quarrelling so full of passions jealousies and suspicions ungoverned was it or i would liken it to a chamber in hell when the sharp agony of physical suffering is for a while changed for the equal pains of such companionship and such discourse as those of the common side i stood near the door as the turnkey had pushed me in staring stupidly about some sat on the stone bench with tobaccopipes and pots of beer some played cards on the bench some walked about there were women visitors but not one whose face showed shame or sorrow to such people as these newgate is like an occasional attack of sickness a whipping is but one symptom of the disease imprisonment is the natural cure of the disease hanging is only the natural common and inevitable end when the disease is incurable just as death in his bed happens to a man with fever while i looked about me a man stepped out of the crowd garnish he cried holding out his hand then they all crowded round crying garnish garnish i held up my hands i assured them that i was penniless the man who had first spoken waved back the others with his hand friend he said if you have no money off with your coat then i know not what happened because i think i must have fallen into a kind of fit when i recovered i was lying along the stone bench my coat was gone my waistcoat was gone my shirt was in rags my shoeson which were silver buckles were gone and my stockings which were of black silk my head was in a womans lap well done she said i thought youd come round twas the touching of the wound on your head brutes and beasts you are all of you all of you one comfort is youll all be hanged and that very soon itll be a happy world without you come nan one of the men said you know its the rule if a gentleman wont pay his garnish he must give up his coat give up his coat youve stripped him to the skin and him with an open wound in his head bleeding again like a pig the people melted away they offered no further apology but the coat and the rest of the things were not returned my good samaritan to judge by her dress and appearance was one of the commonest of common womenthe wife or the mistress of a gaolbird the companion of thieves the accomplice of villains yet there was left on her still whatever the habit of her life this touch of human kindness that made her come to the assistance of a helpless stranger no christian could have done more forasmuch said christ as you did it unto one of these you did it unto me when i read these words i think of this poor woman and i pray for her lie still a minute she said i will stanch the bleeding with a little gin she pulled out a flat bottle it is good gin i will pour a little on the wound that cant hurtso but it did hurt now my pretty gentleman for you are a gentleman though maybe only a gentleman rider and woundily in want of a wash take a sip for yourself dont be afraid take a long sip i brought it here for my man but hes dead he died in the night after a fight in the yard here he got a knife between his ribs she spoke of this occurrence as if such a conclusion to a fight was quite in the common way look here sir youve no business in this place havent you got any friends to pay for the masters side now youre easier and the bleeding has stopped can you stand do you think i made a shift to get to my feet shivering in the cold damp november air she had a bundle laying on the bench tis my mans clothes she said take his coat and shoes you must else with nothing but the boards to sleep upon youll be starved to death now i must go and tell his friends that my man is dead wellhe wont be hanged i never did like to think that i should be the widow of a tyburn bird she put on me the warm thick coat that had been her husbands she put on his shoes i was still stupid and dull of understanding but i tried to thank her some weeks afterwards when i was at length released i ventured back into the prison in hopes of finding the name and the residence of the womansamaritan if ever there was one the turnkeys could tell me nothing the gaol was full of women they said my friend was named nan they were all nans she was the wife of a prisoner who died in the place they were always dying on the common side that was nothing they all know each other by name but it was six weeks ago prisoners change every day they are brought in they are sent out to be hanged pilloried whipped or transported in a word they knew nothing and would not take the trouble to inquire what did it matter to these men made callous by intimacy with suffering that a woman of the lower kind had done a kind and charitable action nevertheless we have christs own assurancehis wordshis promise the womans action will be remembered on the day when her sins shall be passed before a merciful judge her sins alas she was what she was brought up to be her sins lie upon the head of those who suffer her and those like to her to grow up without religion or virtue or example or admonition by this time i was growing faint with hunger as well as with loss of blood and fatigue i had taken nothing for fourteen hours namely since supper the evening before the attack the first effect of hunger is to stop the power of thought there fell upon me a feeling of carelessness as if nothing mattered the night in the watchhouse the appearance before the magistrate my reception on the common side all passed across my brain as if they belonged to someone else i rose with difficulty but staggered and fell back upon the bench my head was light i seemed strangely happy this lightness of head was quickly followed by a drowsiness which became stupor how long i lay there i know not i remember nothing until a heavy hand was laid on my shoulder come it was the voice of a turnkey this is not the kind of place for an afternoon nap in november come this way a lady wants to see you he led me to the door of the common side and threw it open in the waitingroom was none other than jenny herself how had she learned what had happened oh my poor will she cried the tears running down her cheeks this is even worse than i expected but first you must be made comfortable here you fellow she called the turnkey take him away i will pay for everything let him be washed and get his wound dressed give him a clean shirt and get him at once new clothes if your ladyship pleases change these rusty irons for the lightest you have put him into the best cell that you have on the state side get a dinner for him anything that is quickestcold beefhambreada bottle of madeira goquick she stamped her foot with authority she put into the mans hand enough money to pay for half a dozen prisoners on the state side now flydont crawlflyone would think you were all asleep a pretty place this is to sleep in the man knocked off my heavy irons and substituted a pair of lighter ones highly polished and even ornamental he took me away and washed me it was in the turnkeys room on the right hand of the entrance he also with some dexterity dressed my wound dressed and cleaned my hairit was filled with clotted blood he fitted me with new clothes and in less time than one would think possible i was taken back looking once more like a respectable person even a gentleman if i chose to consider myself entitled to claim that empty rank i found jenny waiting for me in the best cell that newgate could offer on the state side a meal was spread for me with a bottle of wine before we say a word will sit down and eat heavens you have had nothing since our supper last night i checked an impulse to thank her i drove back the swelling in my heart readeri was too hungry for these emotions i had first to satisfy starving nature while i ate and drank jenny talked you shall tell me the whole story presently will meantime go on with your dinner you must want it my poor friend now let me tell you why i am here you know i was uneasy about the conspiracy that was hatching i feared it might be meant for you so great was my uneasiness that i bade my sister to keep watching and listening this morning about one oclock i went to the black jack myself to learn if she had discovered anything well she had discovered everything she said that at eleven oclock this morning the two fellows called the bishop and the captain whom i had taken out of the kings bench came to the black jack laughing and very merry they called for a mug of purl and a pack of cards that while they played they talked out loud because there was no one in the house except themselves doll they disregarded as they always do because doll is generally occupied with her slate and her scores which she adds up as wrong as she can they said that it was as good as a play to see the attorney playing the indignant friend of the family and how their own evidence could not possibly be set aside and the case was as good as finished and done with that the fellow went off to newgate as dumb as an ox to the shambles and the poor devil had no money and no friends and must needs swing and the whole job was as clean and creditable piece of work as had ever been turned out it must be hanging nobody could get him off then they fell to wondering as well what mr probus had done it for and what he would get by it and whether a speculation which pleased them most he had not put himself into mr merridews power in which case they might have the holy joy of seeing the attorney himself when his rope was out sitting in the cart and they congratulated each other on their own share in the job ten guineas apiece down and a promise of more when the man was out of the way with a long extension of time i condense jennys narrative which was long and i alter the language which was wandering when doll told me all this she concluded i had no longer any doubt that the man whom they had succeeded in placing in newgate was none other than yourself my poor willso i took a coach and drove here i then told her exactly how everything had happened i hope she said that matthew if he is in the conspiracy does not know what has been done besides the chief gainer will be probus not matthew remember will it is just a race if he can compass your death before matthew becomes bankrupt then he will get back all his moneyall his money think of that if not he will lose the whole well will he thinks nobody knows except himself he is mistaken we shall seewe shall see so she fell to considering again if there is a loophole of escape she went on he will wriggle out let us think what do we know we only know through ramage i replied is that enough to prove the conspiracy i know what those two men are who are the leading witnesseshow can i prove it i know that they were suborned by probus and that they are in the power of merridew how can i prove it i know that probus has talked to my cousin about my possible death but what does that prove i know that he will benefit by my death to the amount of many thousands but how can i prove it my mouth will be closed where are my witnesses you cant prove anything will and therefore you had better not try jenny the tears came to my unmanly eyes leave me go break the news to alice and prepare her mind to see me die i will break the news to alice but i will not prepare her mind to see you die for my dear cousin you shall not die she spoke with assurance she was standing up and she brought her hand down upon the table with a slap which with her flashing eyes and coloured cheek inspired confidence for the moment you shall not die by the conspiracy of these villains how to prevent them it would be easy if their friends would bear evidence against them but they will not they will sit in the court and admire the tragic perjuries of the witnesses there is one rule among my people which is never broken no one must peach on his brother shall dog bite dog if that rule is broken it is never forgivenneverso long as the offender lives then what can we do the short way would be to buy them but in this respect they cannot be bought they will rob or murder or perjure themselves with cheerfulness but they will not peach on their brother money will not tempt them jealousy might but there are no women in this case revenge might but there is here no private quarrel besides they are all in the hands of the man merridew to thwart him would bring certain destruction on their heads and if there was any other reason they are naturally anxious to avoid a court of justice they would rather see their own children hanged than go into a court to give evidence true or false then i must suffer jenny nay will i said not so muchi was only putting the case before myself i see many difficulties but there is always a way outalways an end always an end i repeated oh jenny what an end a newgate fit was on me that is a fit of despondency which is almost despair all the inmates of newgate know what it means the rattling of the irons the recollection of the trial to come a word that jars and the newgate shuddering seizes a man and shakes him up and down till it is spent jenny made me drink a glass of wine the fit passed away i feel i said at last as if the rope was already round my neck my poor alice my poor child thou wilt be the son of a highwayman and a tyburn bird to the third and fourth generation i know nothing about generations jenny interrupted all i know is that you are going to be saved why man consider probus knows nothing about me these conspirators know nothing about madame vallance none of them have the least suspicion and must not have that you know jenny of the black jack now i shall try to get a case as to the conspiracy clear without attacking the loyalty of the gang to each other i have thought of such a plan and i know an attorney you have seen him he is tolerably honest he shall advise usi will send him here be of good cheer will i go to fetch alice put on a smiling countenance to greet her come you are a man lift the drooping spirit of the woman who loves you keep up her heart if not your own she came back at about five the day was already over the yards and courts of the prison were already dark my cell was lit with a pair of candles when jenny brought alice and her brother tom to see me alice poor child fell into my arms and so lay for a long time unable to speak for the sobs that tore her almost in pieces yet unwilling to let me see her weakness tomthe good fellowassumed the same air of cheerfulness which he had learned to show in the kings bench he sniffed the air approvingly he looked round with pretended satisfaction ha he said this place hath been misrepresented the room is convenient if small the furniture solid the air is not so close as one might expect for a brief residencea temporary residencea man might mighti say he cleared his throat the tears came into his eyes he sank into a chair oh will will he cried breaking down and unable to pretend any longer then no one spoke indeed all our hearts were full it is not so much on your account will said jennyi observed that she wore a domino and indeed she never came to the prison after the first visit without a domino a precaution by no means unusual because ladies might not like to be seen in newgate and in any case it might arouse suspicions if jenny were recognised i say it is not on your account so much as for the sake of this dear creature madamalicei implore youtake courage we have the proofs of the conspiracy in our hands it is a black and hellish plot the only difficulty is as to the best means of using our knowledge and here i confess for the moment i am not certain alice recovered herself and stood up holding my hand i cannot believe she said that such wickedness as this will be permitted to succeed it would bring shame and sorrow on children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generations you all talk about generations said jenny for my part i think of you that are alive not those who are to come well so far it has not succeeded for the conspirators are known to me and i am wills cousinand this they know not they stayed talking till nine oclock when visitors had to leave the prison jenny cheered all our hearts she would hear of no difficulties all was clear all was easy she had the conspirators in her power tomorrow she would return with her honest and clever attorney so alice went away with a lighter heart and i was left for the night alone in my cell with a gleam of hope in the morning that gleam left me and the day broke upon the place of gloom and brought with it only misery and despair in the forenoon jenny returned with her attorney he was the man who had already acted for me his name was dewberry he was possessed of a manner easy and assured which inspired confidence in face and figure he was attractive and he betrayed no eagerness to possess himself of his clients money i observed also at the outset that like all the rest he was the servant who would if he could become the lover of jenny now mr halliday he said i have heard some part of your story from madame vallance i want next to hear your own version so i told it while he listened gravely making notes it is certainly he said a very strong point that your death would give probus the chance of recovering his money your cousin could then pay him off if he wished in full whether he would do so is another question if bankruptcy arrives and finds you still living all the creditors would be considered together madame he turned to jenny you who have so fine a head for management let us hear your opinion i think of nothing else she said yet i cannot satisfy myself i have thought that my sister doll might warn the captain that both he and the bishop would be exposed in court but what would happen they would instantly go off with the news to merridew and then an information against doll and my mother for receiving stolen goods and what would happen then you know very well mr dewberry they would have to buy their release by forbidding the exposure why they are the most notorious receivers living or suppose doll plainly told them that her sister jenny knew the whole casethey dont know at presentat least i think notwhere i ambut they can easily find outthat i knew the whole case and meant to expose them what would happen next murder my masters i should be found on my bed with my throat cut and a letter to show that it was done by one of my maids jenny for heavens sake do not run these risks not if i can help it will do you know what i think ofbesides it is a doubt whether matthew would be more rejoiced to see the conspiracy succeed and you put out of the way or to witness the conviction of probus for conspiracy softlysoftly madam said the attorney we are a long way yet from the trial even of mr probus jenny i said your words bring me confidence if you feel all the confidence that there is in newgate it will not be enough will for the confidence that you ought to have but we must work in silence if our friends only knew what we are talking here why thenthe lord help the landlady of the black jack and her two daughters jenny and doll you must be aware sir said mr dewberry that it is absolutely necessary for us to preserve silence upon everything connected with your defence you must not communicate any details upon the subject to your most intimate friends and relations he means alice said jenny we must have secrecy you may trust a man whose life is at stake yes now the principal witnesses are the pretended divine and the pretended country gentleman they rest in the assurance that none of their friends will betray them we must see what can be done if we prove that your irish divine is a common rogue we make his evidence suspected but we do not prove the conspiracy the fellow might brave it out and still swear to the attempted robbery then as to the other worthy we may prove that he is a notorious rogue still he may swear stoutly to his evidence we must prove in addition that these two rogues are known to each other that can be proved by any who were in the kings bench prison with them and we must connect them with probus and merridew i can prove that as well said jenny that is if she paused if your witnesses will give evidence madam i would not pour cold water on your confidencebutwill your witnesses go into the box jenny smiled i believe she said that i can fill the court with witnesses i want more than beliefi want certainty there is another way said jenny if we could let mr probus understand that the sudden and unexpected appearance of a new set of creditors would force on bankruptcy immediately mr dewberry interposed hastily madam i implore you there is no necessity at all sir this lady would actually sacrifice her own fortune and her future prospects in your cause for his safety and for his lifeeverything i assure you dear madam there is no need your affairs want only patience and they will adjust themselves to throw them also upon your husbands other liabilities would not help this gentleman for this reason there are a thousand tricks and subtleties which a man of mr probuss knowledge may employ for the postponement of bankruptcy until after the trial of our friend here you know not the resources of the law in a trained hand i mean that supposing mr probus to reckon on the success of this conspiracyin which i grieve to find a brother in the profession involved he may cause these delays to extend until his end is accomplished or defeated a man of the law madam has great powers i groaned another point is that unless i am much mistaken this conspiracy is intended to intimidate and not to be carried out mr probus will offer you i take it your liberty on condition of your yielding in the matter of that money never i declared i will die first then it remains to be seen if he will carry the thing through so they went on arguing on this side and on that side which line of action was best which was dangerous in the end as you shall see jenny took the management of the case into her own hands with results which astonished mr dewberry as well as the court myself and the four heroes of the conspiracy five weeks i learned would elapse before my case would be tried in court it was a long and a tedious time to contemplate in advance meantime i was kept in ignorance for the most part of what was being done afterwards i learned that jenny carried on the work in secrecy so that not only the conspirators might not have the least suspicion but that even mr dewberry did not know what was doing until she placed the case complete in his hands a few days before the trial jenny contrived all jenny paid for all what the case cost her in money i never learned she spared nothing neither labour nor travel nor money meantime i lived on now in hope now in despondency to go outside among my fellow prisoners was to increase the wretchedness of prison every morning alice brought provisions for the day tom brought me my violin and music so that i was not without some consolations as i remember this gloomy period i remember with thankfulness how i was stayed and comforted by two women of whom one was a saint and the other waswell heaven forbid that i should call her a sinner in whom i never found the least blemish but not at least a christian the first offered up prayers for me day and night wrestling in prayer like jacob for the open manifestation of my innocence alice was filled with a sublime faith the lord whom she worshipped was very near to her he would destroy his enemies he would preserve the innocent the wicked would be cast down and put to perpetual shame never have i witnessed a faith so simple and so strong yet to all seeming to the conspirators themselves i had not a single witness whom i could call in my defence that a man was poor favoured the chance of his becoming a robber that a brotherinlaw also a prisoner in the rules should be ready to say that i was incapable of such an action could not help what could we allege against the clear and strong evidence that the four perjured villains would offer when they should stand up and swear away my life have courage said alice help cometh from the lord he will have mercy upon the child andoh willwillhe will have mercy upon the father of the child mr dewberry came often he had little to tell me jenny had gone away jenny had not told him what she was doing sir he said but for the confidence i have in that incomparable woman and in her assurances i should feel anxious for as yet and we are within a fortnight of the trial i have not a single witness who can prove the real character of the pretended divine and the pretended country gentleman but since madam assures us he produced his snuffbox and offered it whythen sirin that casei believe in the success of your defence chapter x the same offer thus i passed that weary and anxious imprisonment the way of getting through the day was always the same soon after daylight i went out and walked in the yards for half an hour the early morning indeed was the only time of the day when a man of decent manners could venture abroad even on the state side at that time the visitors had not yet begun to arrive the men were still sleeping off their carouse of the evening before only a few wretches to whom a dismal foreboding of the future a guilty conscience an aching heart would not allow sleep crept dolefully about the empty yards restlessly sitting or standing if they spoke to each other it was with distracted words showing that they knew not what they said alas the drunken orgies of the others caused them at least some relief from the terrible sufferings of remorse and looking forward it is not often that one can find an excuse for drunkenness after this melancholy walk i returned to my cell where i played for an hour or two afterwards reading or meditating but always my thoughts turned to the impending trial i represented myself called upon to make my own defence i read it aloud i failed to impress the jury the judge summed up the jury retired cold beads stood upon my forehead i trembled i shook the verdict was guilty the judge assumed the black capverily i suffered every day despite the assurance of jenny and mr dewberry all the tortures of one convicted and condemned to death if my heart were examined after my death sure i am that a black cap would be found engraven upon it to show the agonies which i endured about one oclock alice arrived sometimes with tom sometimes alone as for tom he had quickly rallied and had now completely accepted the assurance that an acquittal was certain his confidence would have been wonderful but for the consideration that it was not his own neck that was in danger but that of his brotherinlaw the child was not allowed to be brought into the prison for fear of the fever which always lurks about the wards and cells and corridors in the afternoon while we were talking jenny herself when she was not on her mysterious journeys came wearing a domino about four oclock tom departed and a little after alice then i was left alone to sleep and reflection for twelve hours this was the daily routine on sunday there was service in the chapel made horrid by the condemned prisoners in their pew sitting round the empty coffin and by the ribaldry and blasphemous jests of the prisoners themselves not even in the chapel could they refrain one afternoon there was a surprise we were sitting in conversation together alice and jenny with my brotherinlaw tom and myself when we received a visit from no less a person than mr probus himself that prince of villains had the audacity to call in person upon me he stood in the doorway his long lean body bent wearing a smile that had evidently been borrowed for the occasion i sprang to my feet with indignation my arm was gently touched jenny sat beside me but a little behind hush she whispered let him say what he has to say sit down do not answer by a single word mr probus looked disconcerted to see me resume my chair and make as if i neither saw nor heard you did not expect mr halliday to see me here i made no reply i am astonished i confess to find myself here after all that has passed respect for the memory of my late employer and client sir peter halliday must be my excusemy only excuse respect and if i may be permitted to add compassioncompassion madamhe bowed to alice compassion sir is a christian virtue she said with such emphasis on the adjective as to imply astonishment at finding that quality in mr probus assuredly madamassuredly which is the reason why i cultivate itsometimes to my own lossmy own loss sir alice went on you cannot but be aware that your presence here is distasteful will you be so good as to tell us what you have to say certainly madam i think i have seen you before you are mr william hallidays wife this gentleman i have not seen before he is my brother your brotherand the lady who prefers to wear a domino for jenny had made haste to replace that disguise no doubt it is proper in newgatebut is it necessary among friends this lady is my cousin said alice she will please herself as to what she wears your cousin we are therefore as one may say a family party the defendant his wife his brotherinlaw his cousin this is very good this is what i should have desired above all things had i prayed upon my way hither a family party mr probus said alice if this discourse is to continue beware how you speak of prayers never had i seen her face so set so full of righteous wrath with so much repression the man quaked under her eyes i come to business he said i fear there is a spirit of suspicion even of hostility abroad let that pass i hope indeed to remove it now if you please give me your attention he was now the lawyer alert and watchful your trial mr halliday takes place in a short timea few days i do not know what defence you will attempti hope you may be successfuli have thought upon the subject and i confesswelli can only say that i do not know what kind of defence will be possible in a case so clear and so well attested hush jenny laid her hand again on my arm hush she whispered i restrained myself and still sat in silence let me point out to youin a moment you will understand whyhow you stand you know of course yet it is always well to be clear in ones mindthe principal evidence is that given by those two gentlemen from the country the young squire of cumberlandor is it westmorelandand the clergyman of the sister kingdom i have naturally been in frequent communication with those two gentlemen i find that they are both kept in london to the detriment of their own affairs that they would willingly get the business despatched quickly so that they would be free to go home again that they bear no malicenone whatever one because he is a clergyman and therefore practises forgiveness as a christian duty the other because he is a gentleman who scorns revenge and besides was not the attacked but the attacking party so far says the noblehearted gentleman from desiring to hang the poor wretch i would willingly suffer him to go at large this is a disposition of mind which promises a great deal i have never found a more happy disposition in any witness before no resentment no revenge no desire for a fatal termination to the trial it is wonderful and rare so i came over to tell you what they say and to entreat you to make use of this friendly temper while it lasts they mighti do not say they willbut they might be induced to withdraw altogether from the trial in which case the prosecution would fall to the ground for the case depends wholly upon their evidence for myself as you know i arrived by accident upon the scene and was too late to see anything mr merridew tells me that what he saw might have been a fight rather than a robbery i ought not to have revealed this weak point in the evidence but i am all for mercyall for mercy so i say that if their evidence is not forthcoming the prosecution must fall through and then dear sir liberty would be once more your happy lot he stopped and folded his arms i had not offered him a chair partly because he was mr probus and i would not suffer him to sit in my presence partly because there was no chair to offer him these gentlemen sir said tom are willing we understand to retire from the case i would not say willing i would rather say not unwilling do they tom asked demand money as a bribe as a price for retiring no sir these gentlemen are far above any such consideration i believe they would be simply contented with such a sum of money as would meet their personal expenses and their losses by this prolonged stay and to how much may these losses and expenses taken together amount i hear that his reverence has lost a valuable lectureship which has been given to another in his absence and that the squire has sustained losses among his cattle and his horses also owing to his absence and the combined figures sir which would cover these losses i cannot say positively probably the clergymans losses would be represented by l and the squires by l there would be my own costs in the case as wellbut they areas usuala trifle and suppose we were to pay this money tom continued what should we have to prove that they would not give their evidence sirthere you touch me on the tenderest pointthe pundonor as the spaniards say you should lodge the money with any person in whom we could agree as a person of honourand after the case for the prosecution had broken downnot beforehe should give me that money observe that on the part of these two simple gentlemen there is trust even in an attorneyin myself i said nothing for as the man knew that i could not find a tenth part of the sum i knew there was something behind what it was i guessed very well and in fact mr probus immediately showed what it was mr halliday he said i believe that i know your circumstances i have on one or two occasions had to make myself acquainted with them i shall not give offence if i suppose that you cannot immediately raise the sum of l even to save your life he spoke to me but he looked at alice he cannot certainly said alice either immediately or in any time proposed quite so now this is a case of life or deathlife or death sir life or death madam an honourable lifea long life for your husband or a shameful deatha shameful death shameful to him shameful to you shameful to your child or children hush whispered jenny laying a repressive hand again upon my shoulder for again i was boiling over with indignation what the author and contriver of this shameful death was to come and call attention to the disgrace of which he was the sole cause had i been left to myself without alice or jenny i would have brained the old villain but i obeyed and sat in silence answering nothing consider madamhe continued to address alicethis is not a time for false pride or for obstinacy or even for standing out for better terms once more i make the same offer which i made before let him sell his chance of a certain succession of which he knows let him do that and all his difficulties and troubles will vanish like the smoke of a bonfire i tell you plainly madam that i can control the appearance of this evidence without which the prosecution can do nothing i will control it if he agrees to sell your husband shall walk out on the day of the trial a free man he drew out of his pocket a pocketbook and from that a document which i remembered wellthe deed of sale or transfer nobody replied alice looked at me anxiously i remained silent and dogged two years agoor somewhere about that timei made the same proposal to him i offered him l down for his share of an estate which might never be hisor only after long yearsi offered him l down it was a large sum of money he refused a day or two afterwards he found himself in the kings bench prison i would recall that coincidence to you four or five weeks ago i made a similar offer this time i proposed l down he refused again blind to his own interest a few days afterwards he found himself within these walls on a capital charge a third time and the last time i make him another offer this time i raise the sum to l in order to cover the losses of those two witnesses and in addition to the money which is a large sum enough to carry you on in comfort and in credit i offer your husband the crowning gift of life lifedo you hear woman life and honour and creditlifelifelifei say his face was troubled his accents were eager he was not acting he felt that he was offering me far more than anything he had ever offered me before hush whispered jenny keeping me quiet againfor all the time i was longing to spring to my feet and to let loose a tongue of fiery eloquence but to sit quite quiet and to say nothing was galling take it will take it said tom if the gentleman can do what he promises take it life and libertyi saybefore all sir said aliceher voice was gentle but it was strong her face was sweet but it was firm the man saw and listenedand misunderstood i know the mind of my husband in this matter for reasons which you understand he will not speak to you the money that was devised by his father to the survivor of the twohis cousin or himselfhas always been accepted by him as a proof that at the end his father desired him to understand that he was not wholly unforgiven that there was a loophole of forgiveness but he did not explain what that was that should my husband who has no desire to see the death of his cousin survive mr matthew he will receive the fortune as a proof that a life of hard and honest work has been accepted by his father in full forgiveness sir my husband considers his fathers wishes as sacred nothingno pressure of povertyno danger such as the present will ever make him consent to sign the document you have so often submitted to him thenmr probus put back his paperif this is your last wordrememberyou have but a few days left nothing can save younothingnothingnothing you have but a few days before you are condemneda week or two more of life is this your last word it is our last word sir said alice she is rightwill is right cried tom hark yemr attorney there is foul play here we may find it out yet with the help of god shall i put him out of the door alice he will go of his own accord tom will you leave us sir yes i will leave you he shook his long forefinger in my face ha i leave you to be hanged you shall have your miserable neck twisted like a chicken and your last thought shall be that you threw your life awaynothat by dying you give your cousin all so he flung out of the room and left us looking blankly at each other then jenny spoke you did well will to preserve silence in the presence of the wretch we all do well to preserve silence about your defence you dear people i have counted up the cost it will be more than at first i thought because the case must be made complete so complete that there can be no doubt i promise you she took off her domino her face was very pale i remember now that there was on it an unaccustomed look of nobility such as belongs to one who takes a resolution certain to involve her in great trouble and at the expense of selfsacrifice or martyrdom i promise you she said that cost what it may the case shall be complete chapter xi the impending trial the timethe awful timethe day of fatedrew nearer despite the assurances both of jenny and of her attorney there were moments when anticipation and doubt caused agonies unspeakable sometimes i have thought that these agonies were cowardly i should be ashamed of them but no one knows who has not suffered in the same way the torture of feeling ones self in the absolute power of a crafty conspiracy directed by a man as relentless as a weasel after a rabbit or an eagle after a heron not out of hatred or revenge but after money the only object of his life the real spring of his wickedness after my experience i can briefly say as david in his old age said let me fall into the hands of the lord for his mercies are great but let me not fall into the hands of man presently it wanted but a week then six days then five you should now said mr dewberry prepare and write out your defence that is to say your own speech after the trial is over take no thought about the evidence your counsel will crossexamine the witnesses against you he will also examine those for you trust your counsel for doing the best with both heaven help two or three of them when mr caterham has done with them mr caterham k c our senior counsel was reported to be the best man at the old bailey bar with him was mr stanton a young man still quite young but with a brain of fire and a front of brass you must not leave your defence to the eloquence of the moment which may fail you write it down write it plainly fully and without passion state who you are what your occupation what your salary what your rent what your daily habits we shall have called witnesses to establish all these points then tell the court exactly what you have told me do not try to be eloquent or rhetorical the plain facts plainly told will impress the jury and will affect the judges charge far more than any flights of eloquence on your part what the judge wants is to get at the truth remember that behind his habitual severity of manner mr justice parker who will try your case is bent always upon discovering if possible the truth sit down therefore and relate the facts exactly as they were take care to marshal them in their best and most convincing manner many a good cause has been wasted by a careless and ignorant manner of presenting them in your case first relate the facts as to the alleged assault next inform the court who and what you are thirdly relate the circumstances of your relations with mr probus fourthly state the reasons why he would profit by your death next call attention to the conversation overheard by mr ramage then show that he has on more than one occasion threatened you and that he has actually imprisoned you in the kings bench in the hope of moving you i think that you will have a very moving story to tell supported as it will be by the evidence which has gone before but you have no time to lose such a statement must not be put together in a hurry when it is finished i will read it over and advise you what was important to me in this advice was the necessity of ordering or marshalling the facts to one not accustomed to english composition such a necessity never occurred and without such advice i might have presented a confused jumble a muddled array of facts not dependent one upon the other the importance of which would have been lost however armed with this advice i sat down and after drawing up a schedule or list of divisions or headings or chapters i set to work trying to keep out everything but the facts no one will believe how difficult a thing it is to stick to the mere facts and to put in nothing more indignation carried me beyond control from time to time i went out of my way to point to the villainy of probus i called the vengeance of heaven upon him and his colleagues i appealed to the unmerited sufferings of my innocent wife to the shameful future of my innocent offspringand to other matters of a personal kind all of which were ruthlessly struck out by the attorney with the result that i had with me when i went into court as plain and clear a statement of a case as ever was presented by any prisoner this statement i read and reread until i knew it by heart yet i was advised not to trust to memory but to take the papers into court and to seem to read all this shows the care which was taken by our everwatchful attorney lest anything should happen to hinder the development of the case as he intended and hoped among other things he called upon mr probus nominally on account of another matter i believe he said that you are the attorney of mr matthew halliday i have that honour yes i observed the fact in reading an affidavit of yours in connection with a case in which i am engaged for the defence the case of mr william halliday now in newgate on a charge of highway robbery defence he has then a defence a defence certainly he has a defence and counsel we have engaged mr caterham k c and mr stanton both of whom you probably know as counsel for the defence my dear sir we have a very good defence indeed let me see you arrived on the spot i observe after the alleged attack was committed certainly my affidavit and my evidence before sir john were only as to the identity of the robber quite so but we need not concern ourselves here with the defence of mr william halliday i come to speak about the affairs of mr matthew well sir what about his affairs i hear that they are in a very bad way oh sir indeed i do not wish to ask any questions i only repeat what i hear in the city it is there freely stated that the firm is ruined that their ships are sold and that their business is gone they are injurious and false reports it is possible i hope so meantime however i have come to communicate to you a matter which perhaps you do not know but which it is important that you should know the person chiefly concerned gives me permission to speak of it perhaps you do know it already perhaps your client has not concealed it from you do you for instance know that mr matthew halliday is a married man mr probus started married he cried married no certainly not it is evident that you do not know your clients private history he has been married two years and more he does not however cohabit with his wife they are separatedby consent matthew married they are separated i say such separation however does not release the husband from the liability of his wifes debts has his wifehas mrs matthewcontracted debts he looked very uneasy his wifeshe is a client of minehas contracted very large debts she may possibly make an arrangement with her creditors but she may not in the latter case she will send them to your client who will hand them over to you they will demand payment without delay failing payment they will take all the steps that the law permitsalso without delay that is why i thought it best to communicate the facts to you my client authorized me to do so mr probus made no answer he could not understand what this meant if it is your interest to postpone bankruptcy mr probus it may be wiser for some reason or other to force it on i only came to tell you of this danger which threatens your clientnot you of course but your client whose wife is mine mr probus made at first no reply he was thinking what this might mean he was of course too wary not to perceive that the threat of forcing on bankruptcy was part of the defence though in an indirect manner have you he asked presently any knowledge of the amount of these debts i believe they amount to over l mr probus groaned aloud i thought i would prepare your mind for the blow which may happen any day let me see the trial takes place next wednesdaynext wednesday i dare say the creditors will wait till after that event goodmorning mr probus he was going away when mr probus called him back you are aware sir that i made the prisoner a handsome offer i have been told that you made a certain offer i offered him the very large sum of l if he would sell his succession if he consents the principal witnesses in the case shall not appear mr probus as the case stands now i would not take l for the price of his chance again he was going away and again mr probus called him back we were speaking he said of the defence of that unhappy young man mr william halliday of course i am concerned in the matter only as an accidental bystanderand of course an old friend of the family there is to be a defence you say assuredly i have always understood that the young man was quite poor and that his wifes friends were also quite poor that is true but a man may be quite poor yet may have friends who will fight every point rather than see the man condemned to deathand on a false charge false quite false i assure you sir you surprise me to be sure i did not see the assault yet the evidence was most clear two gentlemen unknown to each otheranother unknown to both who witnessed the affairhow can such evidence as that be got over well mr probus it is not for me to say how it will be got over you are i believe giving evidence on what may be called a minor point you will therefore be in the court on the occasion of the trial i can say nothing of course but i should advise all persons engaged in the case to abstain from appearing if possible i am assured that things quite unexpected will take place meantime to return to the point for which i came hereadvise your client to prepare himself to meet claims rising out of his wifes debts to the sum of many thousands how many thousands did you say forty thousand i believe good heavens sir what can a woman be doing to get through such an enormous sum indeed i cannot inform you it is an age in which women call themselves the equals of men your client mr probus has got through a great deal more than that in the same time including i believe the l which you lent him and which he cannot repay what do you know about these affairs sir nothingnothing i shall see you in court on the day of the trial mr probus he went away leaving as he intended his brother in the law in an anxious condition and having said nothing that would lead him to suspect that the conspiracy was entirely discovered and would be laid open in court then came the last day before the trial in the afternoon all my friends were gathered together in my cell the attorney had read for the last time my statement of defence he looked through it once more i do not believe he said that the case will get so far whatever happens mr halliday you will do well to remember that you have to thank madame here and i do not believe it will be possible for you to thank her enough until you find out for yourself the sacrifices she has made for you and the risks she is running on your behalf i can but hope madame that the sacrifices may be made up to you and that the risks may prove illusory she smiled but it was a wan smile whatever the result she said believe me sir i shall never regret either the sacrifices if you call them such or the risks if by either we can defeat this most abominable conspiracy i was in hopes said the attorney that mr probus might be terrified and so might withdraw at the last moment it is easy to withdraw he has only to order the two principal witnesses not to attend when the case falls to the ground as we are now free from all anxiety i sighed well from all but the very natural anxiety that belongs to a prison and to the uncertainty of the law it is better for us that he should put in all the witnesses when we can establish our charge of conspiracy i marvel indeed greatly that a man so astute should not perceive that defence where a kings counsel and a junior of great repute are engaged must mean a serious case and that a serious case only means denial of the main charge else there would be no defence at all well he rosei drink your health mr halliday in this excellent madeira and a speedy release to you and i will said tom pouring out another glass i too drink a speedy release to you so they went away then jenny got up cousin will she said sadly i have done all i could for you if the black jack knew tonight what would be said in court tomorrow there would be murder they will all be in courtevery oneto hear the splendid perjuries of the bishop and the captain those two worthies expect a brave day indeed it will be a great day for them yet not quite in the manner they anticipate well tis the last night in prison will tomorrow thou wilt be back again in the cottage beside the river happy will happy alice as for me she sighed wearily why jenny as for youwhat can happen to you nothing can happen to me she replied dolorously then why so sad because from the outset i have foreseen something dark and dreadful but i knew not what i see myself in a strange placebut i know not where i look around at the places which i knowand i cannot see myself i am neither at drury lane nor the garden nor am i at soho square i look in the grave but i am not there i am to livebut i know not where or how all is to be changed jenny alice caught her hand this reading of the future it is wicked since the lord hath not thought fit to reveal what is to happen she repeated stupidly as one who understands not since the lordwhat lordwhat do you mean alice how can i help it i can read the future sometimes it is like a printed book to me wellno matter farewell will sleep sound tonight tomorrow we shall meet in the court goodnight dear woman she threw her arms round alice kissed her and went away and as for what passed between husband and wifewhat tender things were saidwhat prayers for faithon the eve of the day of life or death of honour or of shame shall they too be written on a page which is open to every curious eye and to every mocking eye chapter xii the trial it is a most terrible thing for a man of sensibility to stand in the dock of the old bailey before the awful array of judges lord mayor sheriffs and aldermen i know very well that most of the hardened wretches that stand there have no sense of terror and little of anxiety for them the judge is like that fabled sister who cuts the thread of life they have come to the end of their rope their time is up they are fatalists in a stupid way the sentence is passed they bear no malice against the informer the game has been played according to the ruleswhat more can a man desire tyburn awaits them and afterwards they neither know nor do they care early on the morning of the trial mr dewberry came to see me he was cheerful and rubbed his hands with great satisfaction the case he said is complete never was a case more complete or more astonishing as you shall see he would not explain further he said that walls even in newgate have ears that i must rely upon his word sir he said so much i will explain because it may give you ease never has a man gone forth to be tried for his life with a greater confidence in the result than you ought to have and with that assurance enter the court with a light heart they knocked off my irons before going into court thus relieved i was marched along a dismal passage leading from the prison to the old bailey the court was crowded not so much out of compliment to me but because it was bruited abroad among the rogues of st giless that two of their body were that day about to achieve greatness they were truly but not in the way that was expected the crowd in fact consisted chiefly of pickpockets and thieves with their ladies and the heroes of the day were the bishop and the captain at first a prisoner entering the court sees nothing when the mist before his eyes clears away he observes the jury being sworn inone after the other they lift the great chained bible and kiss its leathern cover black with ten thousand kisses and take their seats he observes the counsel arranging their papers the officers of the court standing about and the crowd in the gallery and about the doors the box for the witnessesmy heart sank when i saw sitting together my four enemies looking calm and assured as if there was no doubt possible as to the results nay the captain seemed unable to repress or to conceal the pride he felt in imagination at thinking of the figure he should cut mr ramage my own witness i saw modestly sitting in a corner tom shirley another witness for me if he would prove of any use was also there as i entered the dock mr probus turned and his lips moved as if he was speaking to tom i could not hear what he said but i knew it without the necessity of ears he said sir i saw you in newgate three weeks ago your friend might have saved his life had he accepted my offer it is now too late then he turned his hatchet face to me and grinned wellhe grins no longer under the dock stood alice and with her closely veiled jenny herself they took my hands alice held the right and jenny the left courage my dear said alice it will soon be over now it is all over already whispered jenny there is such evidence as will astonish youand the whole world she kissed my hand and dropped a tear upon it i was to learn afterwards what she meant and what were her own sacrifices and perils in bringing forward this evidence then mr dewberry came bustling up that is your lawyer mr caterham kings counsel now arranging his papers i was with him yesterday he will make a great casea very great caseout of this the attorney arranges it all and the higher branch gets the credit of it all never mind that is your junior behind mr stanton theres a head for you theres an eye i can always tell what they think of the case by the way they arrange their papers the counsel in front of him is serjeant cosins kings counsel an able manoh yesan able man he conducts the prosecution we shall open his eyes presently he thinks he has got an ordinary case to conduct he will see he will see then the judges came in the lord mayor mr justice parker the aldermen the recorder and the sheriffs the lord mayor sat in the middle under the great sword of justice but the case was conducted by mr justice parker who sat on his right hand i looked along the row of faces on the bench they all seemed white cold stern hard and unforgiving despite assurances my heart sank low i pass over the reading of the indictment my pleading and the opening of the case the prosecutor said that although it was a most simple case which would not occupy the attention of the court very long it was at the same time one of the most flagrant and audacious robberies that had ever been brought before the court of the old bailey that the facts were few that he was not aware of any possible line of defence oh yes observed my counsel smiling a very possible line of defence that he for one should be prepared to receive any line of defence that could be set up but he thought his learned brother would not waste the time of the court he then rehearsed the history of the facts and proceeded to call the witnesses first he called samuel carstairs doctor of divinity i do not intend to set down the whole of the evidence given by him or by the others because you already know it the doctor with alacrity stepped into the witnessbox he was clean shaven in a new wig a silken cassock snow white bands and a flowing gown but that his face was red and his neck swollen and his appearance fleshy and sensualthings which may sometimes be observed even among the city clergyhe presented the appearance of a prosperous ecclesiastic for my own part i can never satisfy myself whether he was in holy orders at all one hopes for the sake of the church that he was not after kissing the testament with fervour he turned an unblushing front to the prosecutor he said that he was a clergyman a doctor of divinity formerly of trinity college dublin and some time the holder of certain benefices in the neighbourhood of that city he deposed that on the night in question he was making his way through leicester fields to charing cross at the time of nine in the evening or thereabouts that suddenly a young man rushed out of some dark recess and flourished a cudgel over him crying your money or your life that being a man of peace as becomes his profession he instantly complied with the demand and handed over his purse that he also cried out either on account of the extremity of his fear or for help that help came in the shape of a stranger who felled the ruffian that they called the watch carried the senseless robber to the guardhouse and that the witnesss purse was found in his pocket my counsel deferred crossexamining this witness for the present next came the captain he too stood unabashed while he poured out his tale of perjury he assumed the style and title of a gentleman from the north mr ferdinando fenwick and he entirely bore out the previous witnesss evidence my counsel also deferred his crossexamination of this witness mr merridew was the third witness he followed suit he deposed that he was a sheriffs officer he had seen the assault and the rescue he had also helped to carry the robber to the round house this witnesss crossexamination was also deferred mr probus attired in black velvet with fine lace ruffles and neckerchief so that his respectable appearance could not but impress the jury said that he was passing the watchhouse by accident about midnight having been summoned by a client when he saw an unconscious figure carried in that he followed from motives of humanity hoping to be of use to some fellow christian that he then perceived to his amazement that the robber was none other than the son of his old friend and employer the late sir peter halliday alderman and exlord mayor that he saw the worthy clergymans purse taken from his pocket so that there could be no doubt of his guilt he also added that it was four years and more since sir peter had turned his son out of doors since when he believed that the young man had earned a precarious living by playing the fiddle to sailors and such low company then the crossexamination began my counsel asked him first whether he knew any of the three preceding witnesses he did not they were strangers to him had he never seen the man merridew he never had did not merridew owe him money he did not he was now attorney to mr matthew halliday had he ever taken the man merridew to mr hallidays countinghouse he had not in fact mr probus you know nothing at all about mr merridew nothing and nothing about the other two men nothing i come now mr probus to a question which will astonish the court will you tell me in what way the prisoners death will benefit you in no way oh in no way come sir think a little collect yourself i pray you you are attorney to mr matthew halliday you have lent him money no answer please answer my question no answer never mind i shall find an answer from you before long meantime i inform the jury that you have lent him l on the condition that he pays per cent interest on l the sum to be repaid that is the exact description of the transaction i believe he replied unwillingly if you please to say so very well now your client has spent or lost the whole of his money and yoursdo not deny the fact because i am going to prove it presently he cannot pay you one farthing in fact before long the firm of halliday brothers will become bankrupt there was a movement and a whisper among the aldermen and sheriffs on the bench is this true or not no answer my lud i press for an answer this is a most important question i can find an answer from another witness but i must have an answer from the witness now in the box answer the question immediately sir said the judge i do not know you do not know come sir have you been informed or have you not by mr matthew halliday himself of his position i have not you have not mark his answer gentlemen of the jury do not forget his statement he says that he knows nothing and has been told nothing of his clients present unfortunate condition let us go on the late sir peter halliday left a large sum of moneyl i believeto the survivor of twoeither his son or his nephew that is true if halliday brothers becomes bankrupt your claim would rank with those of the other creditors i suppose so in which case you would get little or nothing of the l but if the prisoner could be persuaded to sell his chance of succession before the declaration of bankruptcy your client could raise money on that succession out of which you could be paid in full if he consented yes if he consented you have already made three several attempts to make him sell have you not acting by my clients instructions the first time when he refused you threatened revenge did you not i did not you then clapped him in a debtors prison on a trumpedup charge of debt it was a debt due to an estate placed in my hands the prisoner denied the debt said that the instrument was given to him by the owner did he not perhaps but you put him in prison and kept him there i did acting for my clients the executors the next time you called upon him and offered to buy his share was about six weeks ago it was acting on instructions from my client he refused you then threatened him again i did not two days afterwards the alleged robbery took place at which you were an accidental observer accidental i said soaccidental now if this case should prove fatal to the prisoner on his death your client not a bankrupt would take the whole of the l he would you would then expect to be paid no answer i say you would then expect to be paid i should hope to be in full i should hope so then you would be the better by l by the execution of the prisoner if you put it so i should you made a third and last attempt a few days ago to obtain his consent i did acting on my clients instructions when he was in newgate there were present two other friends of the prisoner you then offered if he would sign the document to withdraw the principal witnesses i did not i put it in another way you promised if he would sign that the principal witnesses should not appear i did not you swear that you did not i swear that i did not you say that you have no power to withdraw witnesses i have no power to withdraw witnesses you have no power over the case at all none mr caterham sat down serjeant cosins stood up you might be the better by the prisoners death you are not however in any way concerned with the case except as an accidental observer not in any way and you are not in any way acquainted with the witnesses who are chiefly concerned not at all mr probus sat down mr caterham called again the rev dr samuel carstairs my lud he began i must ask that none of the witnesses in this case be allowed to leave the court without your ludships permission the bishop entered the box but with much less assurance than he had previously assumed and the crossexamination began i then understood what jenny meant when she talked of making the case complete he swore again that his name was carstairs that he had held preferment in the county of dublin he named in fact three places he had never used any other name he was not once called onslow at another time osborne at another oxborough he knew nothing about these names he had never been tried at york for fraud or at winchester for embezzlement he had never been whipped at the carttail at portsmouth as these lies ran out glibly i began to take heart i looked at probus he was sitting on the bench his fingers interlaced cold drops of dew rising upon his forehead and nose but the bishop held out bravely that is with a brazen impudence you know doctor i believe the black jack a tavern is it no sir i do not one of my profession should not be seen in taverns yet surely you know the black jack close to st giless church no sir i am a stranger in london do you know the nickname of the bishop no oh you never were called the bishop no do you know the gallant gentleman who rescued you no i do not you do not know him never met him i suppose at the black jack never never do you know the other witness mr merridew no i do not where were you staying for the night when this romantic incident happened for the first time the bishop hesitated iiforget he said come come you cannot forget so simple a thing you know where were you staying it was in a street off the strandi forget its namei am a stranger to this city wellwhere did you stay last night in the same streeti forget its name not at the black jack st giless he was pressed upon this point but nothing could be got out of him he stuck to the pointhe had forgotten the name of the street and he knew nothing of the black jack so he stood down the captain was called by the name he gave himselfferdinando fenwick he said he had never been known by any other name that he had no knowledge of the name of tom kestever he had never heard that name nor did he know of any occasion on which the said tom kestever had been ducked for a pickpocket flogged for a rogue imprisoned and tried on a capital charge for cattle lifting oh jenny the case was well got up truly he too had never heard of the black jack and stoutly stood it out that he was a gentleman of cumberland asked what village or town of cumberland he named whitehaven as the place in which he was born and had his propertyto wit five farms contiguous to the town and two or three messuages in the town when this evidence was concluded a juryman rose and asked permission of the court to put a question to the witness which was granted him those farms he said are contiguous to whitehaven yes and you were born in that town what was your father by occupation he was a draper my lord said the juryman i am myself a native of whitehaven i am the son of the only draper in the town i am apparently about the same age as the witness i have never seen him in the town there is no reputable tradesman of that name in the town or anywhere near it there are gentlefolk of the name but in northumberland i wish sir said the counsel that i had you in the box the statement of a juryman is not evidence the prosecuting counsel interposed i fear my learned brother said the judge that when the jury retire it will become a strong piece of evidence whatever direction i may give them the serjeant declined to reexamine this evidence then my counsel called mr merridew who very reluctantly got into the box again he denied solemnly that he knew either of the preceding witnesses he denied that he knew the black jack he owned with a pretence at pride that he had frequently served his country by informing against rogues and had taken the reward to which he was entitled he denied that he encouraged young fellows to become highwaymen in hopes of securing the higher reward he denied that he knew mr probus he swore that he should not benefit by the conviction of the prisoner you observe that the object of the counsel was to make everyone plunge deeper into the mire of perjury his case was strong indeed or he would not have followed this method the counsel then called half a dozen witnesses in succession they were turnkeys from york winchester reading and portsmouth and other places they identified the rev dr samuel carstairs dd as a person notoriously engaged in frauds for which an educated person was necessary he had been imprisoned for two years at winchester for embezzlement for a twelvemonth with a flogging at york for fraud he was whipped through the high street of portsmouth and down to point and back again for similar practices they also identified the captain as a rogue from tender years hardly a whippingpost anywhere but knew the sound of his voice hardly a prison in which he had not passed some of his time and now the case looked brighter everyone was interested from the aldermen to the jury it was a case of surprises only serjeant cosins stood with his papers in his hand looking perplexed and annoyed so far there was no doubt about the two fellows the authors of the charge being notorious and arrant rogues a very pitiful figure they cut as they sat side by side on the witnesses bench even their own friends in the gallery were laughing at them for the admiration of the rogue is for successful roguery while for detected roguery he has nothing but contempt then the counsel called john ramage he said that he was an accountant in the countinghouse of messrs halliday brothers that in that capacity he knew the position of the house that in two years the managing partner mr matthew halliday had reduced the business to a state of insolvency that they might become bankrupts at any moment that creditors were pressing and the end could not be far off he went on to state that he revealed the secrets of his office because he was informed that the knowledge was necessary for the defence of mr william halliday and that the safety and innocence of his late masters only son were of far more importance to him than the credit of the house and here the tears came into his eyes this however was the least important part of the case for he went on to depose that the position of his desk near the door of mr matthews office enabled him to hear all that went on that mr probus was constantly engaged with mr matthew that every day there were complaints and quarrels between them that mr probus wanted his money back and that mr matthew could not pay him that every day they ended with the regret that they could not touch this sum of money waiting for the survivor that every day they sighed to think what a happy event it would be for them both if mr william halliday were dead that one day mr probus said that there were many ways for even a young man to die he might for instance fall into the hands of the law to this mr matthew gave no reply but when he was alone began to drink that mr probus returned the next day with mr merridew who said that the job was easy and should be done but he should expect to stand in he said that the thing would cost a good deal but that for a thousand pounds he thought that mr will hallidays case might be considered certain when i heard this the witness said i hastened to lambeth where mr will was living with his wife i could not see him because he was playing for madame vallances assembly i therefore went again to lambeth the next day which was sunday and i told him all while i was telling him mr probus himself came so they put me in the kitchen where i could hear what was said mr probus made another effort to persuade mr will to sell his chance of succession then he went away in a rage threatening things so i implored mr will to get out of the way of the villains he promised but it was too late the next thing i hear is that he has been charged with highway robbery mr willthe best of men i now thought my case was going pretty well there were however other witnesses to my amazement jennys mother appeared she was dressed up as a most respectable widow with a white cap a black dress and a white apron she curtseyed to the court and kissed the book with a smack as if she enjoyed it she said that she was a widow and respectable that she kept the black jack which was much frequented by the residents of st giless the counsel did not press this point but asked her if she knew the rev dr carstairs she replied that she knew him under other names as a frequenter of her house off and on for many years that he was familiarly known as the bishop that she did not inquire into the trades of her customers but that it was understood that the bishop was one of those who use their skill in writing for various purposes for threatening persons who have been robbed for offering stolen property for sale for demanding money for forging documents and other branches of roguery demanding a knowledge of writing she showed her own knowledge of the business by her enumeration of the branches she said further that the gentleman had slept at the black jack every night for the last two months that he had a bed there took his meals there and carried on his business there as regards mr ferdinando fenwick she knew him as the captain or as tom kestever and she identified him in the same way and beyond any power of doubt as for merridew she knew him very well he was a thieftaker by profession he gave his man a good run and then laid information against him he encouraged young rogues and showed them how to advance in their profession and she deposed that on a certain day merridew came to the house where the bishop and the captain were drinking together and sat with them that all their talk was about getting a man out of the way that the bishop did not like it but was told by mr merridew very plainly that he must and that he then assented jennys sister doll next appeared she was transformed into a young and pleasing woman with a silver ring for greater respectability her evidence corroborated that of her mother but she added an important particular that one morning when there was no one in the place but the bishop and the captain mr probus came with mr merridew and sat conversing with those two gentlemen for a long time then the young fellow called jack went into the box by this time the interest of everyone in the court was intense because here was the unrolling of a plot which for audacity and wickedness was perhaps unequalled and the wretched man probus still writhing in his seat cast his eyes to the door in hopes of a chance at flight in his agony his wig was pushed back and the whole of his head exposed to view i confess that horror rather than revenge possessed me the young fellow called jack gave his evidence in a straightforward way he confessed that he had run away from his native village in consequence of an unfortunate love affair that he had come up to town hoping to get employment that he had been taken to the black jack by someone who met him in the street that he had there been introduced to mr merridew who promised to find him work that in fact he had been employed by him in shoplifting and in small street robberies his employer he explained would go along the street first and make a sign where he could carry off something that he was promised promotion to be a highwayman by mr merridew if he should deserve it that he had been told to keep himself in readiness to help in knocking a gentleman on the head that the thing was talked over with him by the bishop and the captain that at the last moment they told him they should want none of his help asked what he should do after giving this evidence replied that if mr merridew got off he should have to enlist in order to save his neck which would be as good as gone more he said but this was the most important then mr caterham called mr halliday my unfortunate cousin entered the witnessbox pale and trembling in answer to questions he acknowledged that he had lost the whole of his fortune and ruined a once noble business in the space of three or four years he confessed that his bankruptcy was inevitable that probus had been urgent with him to get his cousin to sell his chance of succession in order to raise money by which he himself might recover his money that he was willing to do so if his cousin would sell but his cousin would not he said that mr probus had come to him stating that a mans life might be lost in many ways that for instance he might fall into the hands of the law that he had brought mr merridew who offered to arrange so that his cousin might lose his life in some such way if he were paid a thousand pounds down that he would not listen to such detestable overtures that he heard of his cousins arrest that he had informed his cousins attorney of the offer made him by probus and merridew but he had neither paid nor promised a thousand pounds or anything at all and that he had never been a consenting party to the plot he was allowed to stand down he remained in the court trembling and shivering as pitiable an object as the wretched conspirators themselves if there had been interest in the case before judge what it was now in the appearance of the next witness for there entered the box none other than jenny herself the bewitching jenny she was all lace and ribbons as beautiful a creature as one could expect to see anywhere she smiled upon the judge and upon the lord mayor she smiled upon the jury she smiled upon me the prisoner in the dock in answer to the questions put to her she answered in substance my name is jenny halliday i am the wife of the last witness matthew halliday i am an actress i am known by my maiden name jenny wilmot as an entertainer i am known as madame vallance there was now the most breathless attention in court by birth i am the daughter of the landlady of the black jack it is a place of resort of the residents of st giless most of them to my certain knowledge probably all are thieves i sometimes go there to see my mother and sister not to see the frequenters of the place whenever i do go there i always find the two witnesses who just now called themselves carstairs and fenwick at the black jack they were always called the bishop and the captain i have always heard and i understand that they are rogues of the deepest dye the bishop is not a clergyman at all he is so called because he dresses like a clergyman and can write well the captain is a highwayman most of his fraternity call themselves captains he is the son of a butcher in clare market his name is tom kestever both are mr merridews men that is they have to carry out whatever he orders and they live in perpetual terror that their time is up the last time i was in the black jack merridew came in drank a glass or two of punch in a friendly way and so left them when he said that he did not know the men it was flat perjury he was continually in the black jack looking up his people admonishing the young and threatening the elders not a rogue in london but knows mr merridew and trembles at the thought of him asked about mr probus she said she did not know him at all save by repute that he constantly threatened the prisoner with consequences if he did not consent to sell his chance of succession and that she had been present on a certain occasion in newgate when mr probus visited the prisoner and offered him there and then if he would sign the document offered that the principal witnesses should not appear at the trial which would thus fall through asked as to her knowledge of the prisoner she deposed that she found him in the kings bench prison sent there through the arts of mr probus that she took him out paying the detainers that she then gave him employment in her orchestra that he was a young gentleman of the highest principle married to a wife of saintly conduct and character that he was incapable of crimethat he lived quietly was not in debt and received for his work in the orchestra the sum of thirty shillings a week which was enough for their modest household asked again about her husband she said that she could not live with him partly because he was an inveterate gambler and that to gratify this passion there was nothing he would not sell that he had gamed away a noble fortune and ruined a noble business that steps had already been taken to make him bankrupt and that it was to save his own money that the man probus had designed this villainy call thomas shirley it was the junior counsel who rose tom went into the box and answered the preliminary questions do you remember meeting mr probus in newgate about a month ago i do what offer did he make he offered my brotherinlaw l down if he would sell his chance of the succession and further promised that the principal witnesses should not appear you swear that this was his offer i swear it the counsel looked at serjeant cosins who shook his head you may sit down sir my lud said mr caterham my case is completed i have no other evidence unless you direct me to sweep the streets of st giless and compel them to come in when all the evidence was completed there was a dead silence in the court everybody was silent for a space the faces of the rogues in the gallery were white with consternation here were the very secrets of their citadel their home the black jack disclosed and by the very people of the black jack the landlady and her daughters the jury looked at each other in amazement here was the complete revelation of a plot which for wickedness and audacity went beyond everything ever invented or imagined what would happen next brother cosins said the judge he threw his papers on the desk my lud he said i throw down my brief then the judge charged the jury gentlemen he said it has been clearly establishedmore clearly than i ever before experienced that a wickednay a most horriblecrime designed by one man carried out by three others has been perpetrated against the prisoner william halliday it is a case in which everything has been most carefully prepared the perjury of the witnesses has been established beyond a doubt even though the witnesses have been in part taken from the regions of st giless and from actual criminals gentlemen there is but one verdict possible they did not leave the box they conferred for a moment rose and through their foreman pronounced their verdictnot guilty they added a hope that the conspirators would not escape they shall not said the judge william halliday the verdict of the jury sets you free i am happy to say that you leave this court with an unblemished character and that you have the most heartfelt commiseration of the court for your wholly undeserved sufferings and anxiety then the judge turned to the four i commit eliezer probus samuel carstairs alias what he pleases the man who calls himself ferdinando fenwick and john merridew for trial on the charge of conspiracy and perjury chapter xiii the company of revenge the case was overi stepped out of the dock i was free everybody including mr caterham kc was shaking my hand the lord mayor sent for me to the bench and shook my hand warmly he said that he had known my worthy father sir peter and that he rejoiced that my innocence had been made as clear as the noonday all the jury shook hands with me my cousin tom paid my dues to the prison without payment of which even a free man proved innocent must go back to the prison again and there stay till he discharges thembecause a gaoler everywhere has a heart made of flint at last surrounded by my friends i went out of court outside in the street there was a crowd who shouted and cried my name with death to the conspirators but i saw many who did not shout who are they who had no sympathy with innocence they stood apart with lowering faces they came down from the public gallery wherei was afterwards toldthe appearance in that witnessbox first of the wellknown landlady of the black jacktheir ancient friend next of her daughteralso their friend thirdly of the young fellow called jack one of themselves a rogue and the companion of rogues and lastly of the woman of whom they had been so proud jenny the actress jenny the orange girl jenny of drury lane filled them with dismay and rage what their own people turn against their own friends the landlady of the black jack even the landlady of the black jack that most notorious receiver of stolen goods and harbourer of rogues to give evidence against her own customers thief betray thief dog bite dog heard ever man the like now you understand the lowering and gloomy faces these people whispered to each other in the gallery of the court house they murmured to each other outside on the pavement when we climbed into a hackney coachjennyher mother and sisterthe young fellow called jack and myselfthey followed usin pairsby fours talking low and cursing below their breath after a while they desisted but one or two of them still kept up with the coach i sent alice home under charge of tom i would get home i said as quickly as i could after seeing jenny safely at her own house we arrived at the house in soho square it was empty save for some womenservants for there was no entertainment that evening we went into the small room on the left and lit the candles it was then about seven oclock in the evening and quite dark as the time of year was november jenny was restless and excited she went to the window and looked out the square is quiet she said how long will it remain quiet the servants brought in some supper jenny took a little glass of wine she then went away and returned in a plain dress with a cloak and hood i must be ready she said to set off on my travelswhither mothershe turned to the old ladyyou are a witch look into the fire and tell me what you see the old woman filled and drained a glass of madeira and turned her chair round she gazed intently into the red coals i see she said a crowd of people i see a court i see the condemned cell she turned away no jenny i will look no more twas thus i looked in the fire before thy father was taken thus and thus did i see i will look no longer well said doll what will they do next they know now where you live madame vallance the old woman sat down and sighed heavily the black jack she murmured we shall never see it again jenny was quiet and grave we have beaten them she said they never suspected that so complete a beating was in store for them now comes our turnmy turn rather your turn jenny yes will my turn do you suppose they will forgive us why we have given evidence against our own people all st giless trusted my mother and sistercould one suspect the black jack why because i was a daughter of the house all st giless trusted meand we have betrayed them there will be revenge and that quickly doll nodded expressively her mother groaned what kind of revenge doll nodded her head again and drew a long breath her mother groaned again i do not know yet listen will the people know very well that this case has been got up by myself i found out by my mothers assistance those facts about the trials and floggings and imprisonments i went into the country and secured the evidence i brought up the gaolers to testify to the mens identity i even went to my husband and promisedyes i sworethat i would put him into the conspiracy as well as the other four if he did not give evidence without saying a word to probus and then i bought my mother out you bought out your mother twas as sweet a business sir the old woman interrupted as you ever saw a matter of three pounds a day takings and two pounds a day profit i bought her out said jenny i also compensated her for the contents of her vaults ah sighed the old woman there were treasures the black jack is shut up when the people go there this eveningagain doll noddedthey will find it closedand they will wreck the place and drink up all thats left said doll let us prevent murder jack you will find it best for your health to get at far as possible out of london take my mother and sister to one of the taverns in the borough theres a waggon or a caravan starts every morning for some country place or other never mind where go with them jack stay with them for a while till they are settled mother you wont be happy unless you can have a tavern somewhere if you can find one jack will do for you there you will be safe i think st giless doesnt contain any of our people but in london you will be murderedyou and doll toofor sure and certain for sure and certain said doll grimly jenny gave her mother more money that will carry you into the country she said you can let me know somehow where you are but take care not to let anyone know who would tell the people here the gipsies are your best friends not the thieves i asked her if it was really necessary to make all these preparations you dont know these people will i do the one thing to which they cling is their safety from the law so long as they are among themselves there will be wild work this evening as for me i have under my dress all my money and all my jewels i am ready for flight why jenny you dont think they will attack you here i do indeed there is nothing more likely did you observe a woman running along holborn beside the coach i know that woman she is the captains girl revenge was written on her faceeasy to readrevengerevenge she stood beside the doorstep when we came in she marked the house she has gone back to st giless to tell them where we can be found this evening but they learned that fact in court oh they will come presently well jenny let us escape while we can there are many ways of escape she said there is no hurry we can pass over the roof of the next house and so into the garrets of the house beyond i have proved this way of escapeoh will i counted the cost beforehand or there is the back door which opens on hog lane we can get out that way i am sure they will not think of the back door or it is easy to climb over the garden wall into the next house there are plenty of ways i am not afraid about our escapeif we can keep them out for a few minutes but jack you had better take my mother and sister away at once no said jack stoutly where you are madame there i am you are a fool jack she replied with her sweet smile which made him more foolish still they will murder you if they can they shant murder you then the lad replied clutching his cudgel by the time we finished supper and held this discourse it was close upon eight will said jenny you and jack had better barricade the door it is a strong door but even oak will give way take the cardtables and pile them up the cardtables were thin slight things with curved legs all gilt and lacquer but the long table was a heavy mahogany thing we took out some of the pieces by which it was lengthened and closed it up then we carried it out to the hall and placed it against the door the length of the door filled the breadth of the hall and jammed in the boards until it seemed as if it would bear any amount of pressure from without we piled the smaller tables one above the other behind the large table if the mob did get in they would be encumbered for awhile among the legs of so many tables this was the only attempt we could make at fortifying the house the lower windows were protected by the iron railings outside will said jenny we have made the door safe but lord what is to prevent their breaking down the railings and entering by the area or why should they not bring a ladder and force their way at the first floor would they be so determined they scent blood they are like the carrion crow they mean blood and pillage the latter they will have not the former at this point we heard a low grumbling noise in the distance which became the roar of many voices they are already at the black jack said jenny i should like to see what they are doing come with me will it is too dark for anyone to recognise me and there will be a great crowd all st giless will be out to see the wreck of the black jack she drew her hood over her head which in a measure hid her face and taking my hand she led me through the garden and so out by the back door into hog lane the place always quiet was deserted and besides was nearly pitch dark having no lamps in it jennys housethe assembly rooms of soho squarestood at the corner of sutton street and with its gardens extended back into hog lane nearly opposite sutton street a little lower down the short street called denmark street ran from hog lane into st giless high street opposite the church the black jack stood opposite to the church when we got to denmark street we took the north side because there were fewer people there yet the crowd was gathering fast we stood at the corner of the street at the east and where we could see what was going on and be ready to escape as quickly as possible in case of necessity a company of men with whom were a good many women and a few boys were besieging the dark and deserted black jack they were a company apart acting by themselves without any assistance from the crowd which looked on approvingly and applauded they neither asked for nor would they accept assistance if any man from the outside offered to join them he was roughly ordered back it is their revenge will said jenny they will have no one with them to join in their own business their resolution and the quiet way with which they actedfor the roars and shouting we heard did not proceed from the company of revenge but from the crowd that followed themstruck one with terror as if we were contemplating the irresistible decrees of fate they battered at the doors as no one answered they broke in the doors but first with a volley of stones they broke every window in the house poor mother said jenny twould break her heart but she will lose nothing i bought her out it is the landlord who will suffer now they have found candles they light up see they are going all over the house in search of the landlady we saw lights in the rooms one after the other they will not find her nor her money nor anything that is valuable it is all gone gentlemen all provided for and stowed away in a safer place this is not a house where a woman who values her throat should be found after todays work seenow they have made up their minds that no one is left in the house what next will they set fire to it no they did not set fire to the house they proceeded to break up everything all the furniture the beds chairs and tables and to throw fragments out of windows into the open space below where some of them collected everything and made a bonfire when the house was emptied they began to bring out the bottles and to haul up the casks out of the cellars upon this there was a rush of the crowd from the outside strange as it may appear the company of revenge were going to break the bottles and to set the casks running but the mob rushed in there was fighting for a few minutes someone blew a whistle and the rioters drew apart and stood together before the house then one of them their leader spoke this is the revenge of st giless on the landlady of the black jack drink up all her casks and all her bottles and be damned to ye the people that rushed upon the casks were like ravenous beasts of prey you would have thought that they had never had their fill of strong drink before indeed for such people it is impossible to have their fill of strong drink unless insensibility means satiety they set the casks running they made cups of their hands they drank with their mouths from the taps they filled empty bottles they fought for the full bottles the place was covered with broken glass their faces were bleeding with cuts from broken bottles the bonfire lifted its fierce flame hissing and roaring at the open windows of houses hardby women looked on shrieking and applauding some within the railings of the church looked on as from a place of safety as the flames lit up their pale faces they might have been the ghosts of the dead called out of their quiet graves to see what was going on it is not their intention to burn down the black jack said jenny then there will be a new landlady and the thieves kitchen will go on again the leader of the company blew his whistle and the men fell into some kind of line my turn now said jenny let us fly will let us fly back again we ran down denmark street into the quiet dark hogs lane before the company reached the place we ran through the garden door and locked it then we went back to the house the old woman was half drunk by this time and half asleep doll was sitting upright waiting jack stood by the door they are coming said jenny they have sacked the black jack doll they would have murdered you had you been in the house they have broken all the furniture and made a bonfire of it and they have brought out all the liquor the people are drinking it up nowbeer and rum and ginand wine well you have lost nothing dollnothing at all now they are coming here she rang the bell and called the servants there were six of them there is a mob on their way to this house she told them they are going to wreck the place and to murder me if they can you had better get out of the house as soon as you can put together all that you can carry and go out of the back way you can go to one of the inns in holborn for the night if any of you have the courage to venture through the streets of soho you might go to the horse guards and call the soldiers to save the house now be quick tomorrow i will pay you your wages the women looked astonished as well they might what sort of company was madame keeping there was the old woman bemused with drink there was the young country man who were they what did it mean the mob are coming tonight madame they are coming now they will be here in a few minutes if you would escape go put your things together and fly by the garden door they looked at each other without a word they retired and i suppose they got away immediately because we saw no more of them and then we heard a steady tramp of feet along sutton street they are here said jenny we heard the feet but there was no shouting they marched in a silence which was more threatening than any noise i closed the wooden shutters of the room it was as well not to show any lights i suppose said doll that you will give us time to escape otherwise we shall all four have our throats cut and perhaps this gentleman too for whom youve taken all this troubleand him with a wife of his own hed better go back to her yes doll jenny replied meekly without replying to the suggestion you shall have time to escape they drew up apparently in very good order before the house without any shouting because most of the crowd that had followed them to the black jack were still on the spot drinking what they could get in the general scramble there were some however who came with them and hung outside and behind the company of revenge who began to assemble and to shout huzzah after the way of the londoners but i believe they knew not what was intended save that it was revenge of some kind there would most certainly be the breaking of windows and the smashing of doors there would be the pleasant spectacle of revenge with more bonfires of broken furniture perhaps more casks and bottles of strong drink in all probability women would be turned out into the street with every kind of insult and illusage as had happened indeed only a week before in the strand when a company of sailors wrecked a house and turned the women out of doors with blows and curses first they knocked loudly at the door shouting for the door to be opened or it would be the worse for everybody inside then they pushed the door which yielded not they will not force the door easily said jenny who will run downstairs and see that the area door is secure i volunteered for this duty the kitchen windows were provided with strong iron bars which would keep the people off for a time the area door was strong and was barred within for further precaution i locked and barred the kitchen door and a strong door at the head of the staircase we should thus gain time crashsmashcrash were you ever in a house while the mob outside were breaking the windows perhaps not tis like a field of battle with the rattle of musquetry at one moment half the windows in the house were broken at the next moment the other half went and still crashcrashthe stones flew into the windows tearing out what little glass remained then there was silence again our time is nearly up said jenny doll wake up mother tie her hat under her chin wrap her handkerchief round her neckso what will they do next jack are you afraid to reconnoitre go up to the first floor and look out of window i went with him the stones were still flying thickly through the windows we made our way along the wall till we came to the window then we went on hands and knees and crept to the window i wrapped one hand in a curtain and held it before my face while i looked out they were lighting torches and conferring together by the torchlight i could make out their faces they were of the type which i had had a recent opportunity of studying in newgate the type which means both the hunter and the hunted it is a cruel and hard type a relentless type the faces all had the same expressionit meant revenge we have been betrayed said the faces by our friends by the very people we trusted we will have revenge as we have sacked the black jack so we will sack the assembly rooms as we would have killed the landlady of the black jack so we will kill her daughter the orange girl if we find her that is what the faces seemed to say they were conferring what to do next one of them i could see advocated breaking down the iron railings but they had no instruments another wanted to use a battering ram against the front door but they had no batteringram a third proposed a ladder and entering by the first floor windows but they had no ladder while they were thus debating a man came into the square who brought a ladder for them there was no further hesitation come jack i said there is no time to be lost we must get away as quickly as possible you go on said jack i will follow he waited the ladder was raised to the window at which he watched a fellow ran up quickly jack sprang to his feet threw up the sash and hurled him headlong off the ladder the poor wretch fell on the spikes he groaned but only once he was killed there was silence for a moment then there arose a mighty screami say it was like the screaming of a woman the mob had tasted blood it was their ownbut it was blood they yelled and roared some of them ran to hold the ladder while a dozen men ran up jack prudently retired but locked the door behind him i believe i have killed him he said quickly the one who ran up the ladder i think he fell on the spikes come said jenny we must go at once if we mean to go at all wake up mother again doll farewell to my greatness will i grudge not any costrememberwhatever it is take me with you to your own home for awhile till i am able to look round again these devils they are overhead i hear them falling over the furniture pray that they break their shins come everybody she blew out the candles and led the way the old woman half awake was led out by jack and doll i followed last as we passed out into the garden we could hear the cursing of the fellows overhead and the smashing of the door which jack had locked in sutton street over the garden wall everything seemed quiet that is there were no footsteps as of a crowd yet in the square the crowd roared and yelled and from st giless was still heard the clamour of the people fighting over the drink we looked out of the garden door cautiously no one was in hog lane which was as deserted as a city in the desert we closed the door and turned to the right and so making our way by streets which i knew well either by day or by night we got to st martins lane and then to charing cross where we found a hackney coach jenny i said in the coach taking her hand the evening spoils the day all this you have suffered for my sake what can i say what can i feel oh will what are a few sticks of furniture and curtains compared to your safety and to alices happiness i care not a straw i am ruined it is true butfor the first time in my life i am thankful for iti am a married woman my debts will all be transferred to matthew will think of it the first effect of the victory will be to make matthew a bankrupt at once after what he owned in court after he receives the news of my debts there can be no delay henceforth my dear will you will be safe from mr probus i was indeed to be safe from him but in a way which she could not expect meantime she added with a sigh they have not done with me yet why what further harm can they do you i know not you asked the same question before there is no end to the ways of a revengeful spirit they will murder me perhaps or they will contrive some other way then go out of their reach the only place of safety for me is with my own folks i should be safe in a gipsy camp they have their camps everywhere but i do not want to live with them no will i shall remain after all the revenge of people like these soon passes away they will wreck my house tonight that very likely will seem to them enough i should have thought so but for the things that mother saw in the coals she is a witch indeed i say mother you are a proper witch but the good lady was fast asleep we left her with her daughter doll and the young fellow they called jack at the white hart inn it appeared that a waggon was going on in the morning to horsham in sussex they might as well stay at horsham for a time as anywhere else there was very little fear that the st giless company of revenge would make any further inquiries about them so they left us and i saw the pair no moreand cannot tell you what became of them in the end as for the young fellow you will hear more about him the hackney coach took us to our cottage on the bank where after so many emotions and surprises i for one slept well let us return to the house in the square the rioters finding no one within quickly pulled away the barricade of the front door and threw it open then the work of wrecking the place began when you remember that supper was sometimes provided for two thousand people you will understand the prodigious quantity of plates dishes knives forks tables benches and things that were stored in the pantries and kitchens you have heard of the hangings the curtains the candelabra the sconces the musical instruments the plants the vases the paintings the coloured lamps the cardtables the candlesticks the stores of candlesin a word the immense collection of all kinds necessary for carrying on the entertainments it is true that the suppers were cooked at a tavern and sent in cold but they had to be served in dishes and provided with plates there was no wine to speak of in the house because the wine was sent in for the night from the tavern which supplied it everything in the house was broken the company of revenge did its work thoroughly everything was broken everything was thrown out of the windows the centre of the square was made the site of a huge bonfire which i believe must be remembered yet all the furniture was piled up on this bonfire the flames ascended to the skies that of the black jack was a mere boys bonfire compared to this while the piles of broken glass and china rendered walking in the square dangerous for many a day to come you have heard that jenny recommended her womenservants to call out the soldiers one of them dared to run through the dark streets to the horse guards half an hour however elapsed before the soldiers could be turned out at last they started with muskets loaded and bayonets fixed when they arrived the work was nearly finished it would have been better for poor jenny had it been completely finished as you will presently discover the furniture was all broken and with the hangings curtains and carpets was burning on the bonfire the soldiers drew up before the door the mob began throwing stones the soldiers fired into them four or five fellof whom two were killed on the spot the rest were wounded the mob soon ran away some of the soldiers proceeded to search the house they found a dozen or twenty fellows engaged in smashing the mirrors and the candelabra in the dancinghall they secured them and then the mob all gone and the bonfire dying away they left a guard of four or five and marched back with their prisoners and the wounded men in the morning the soldiers fastened up the broken door somehow and left the empty house alas if only the mob had been able to fire the house and to burn down and gut the place from cellar to garret this was the first act of revenge on the part of st giless there was to be another and a more deadly act chapter xiv an unexpected charge the joy of the acquittal and the release was certainly dashed by the wild revenge of the mob in the evening the wreck of the great house with all its costly fittings and decorations could be nothing short of ruin to poor jenny still it was with heartfelt gratitude that i returned to my own roof with character unblemished alice had a little feast prepared not so joyful as it might have been though jenny made a brave attempt to be cheerful tom was with us the punchbowl was filled the glasses went round tom played and sangnobody could sing more movingly than he when he was in that vein that is when he sat with a cheerful company round the steaming punchbowl more revenge however was to follow next morning about eight or nine of the clock jenny came out with me to walk upon the bank for the time of year the weather was fine the sun still warm though it was now low down and had a wintry aspect shone upon the river the wind tossed up the water in little waves the boats rocked the swans rolled about and threatened to capsize jenny carried the boy who laughed and played with her hair and impudently planted his fingers upon her cheek will she said i must now contrive some other means of existence the assembly rooms of soho square are wrecked and destroyed that is certain they are very likely burned down as well all my furniture all my property is destroyed of that i am quite certain the villains would make short work once inside well i can never recover credit enough to refit them besides the mob might break in again though i do not think they would i am sorry for my creditors they will be much more injured than i myself she laughed who are your creditors jenny upholsterers painters furnituremakers cooks winemerchants bakers grocers drapershalf london will there was never anybody a greater benefactor to trade they let me go on because you see they thought the profits of the winter season would clear them poor dear confiding people well but jenny since they trusted you before will they not trust you again they cannot possibly consider what it would take to refit that great place by this time all the mirrors and the paintings have been destroyed most likely the house is burned down as well unless the soldiers came in time which i doubt they generally march up when the mischief is done so she began to toss and to dandle the boy singing to it will she said the happiest lot for a woman is to live retired and bring up her brats if matthew had been what he promised and taken me away from london and into the country do you know how much you owe i heard some time ago that it was over l masquerades i fear cannot be made to pay they say i give them too much wine and too good as for giving them too much that is impossible the men would drink every night a threedecker full their throats are like the vasty deep butis it possible l jenny you can never pay that enormous sum my dear will i never thought i should be able to pay it unfortunately while it is unpaid the good people are not likely to give me any more money no will that chapter is finished exit madame vallance who comes next but there are the creditors to consider i began to have fears of a debtors prison for jenny oh the creditors the creditors my dear will will be handed over to matthew you are a good musician but an indifferent lawyer matthewmatthewis responsible for his wifes liabilities this is the only point which reconciles me to marriage with such a man i am provided with a person who must take over all my debts dear matthew kind matthew that worthy man that incomparable husband will now for the first time understand the full felicities of the married state but matthew can never pay this enormous sum of money i do not suppose he can then he will retreat to the prison where he put you and as long as he lives will have opportunity of blessing first the day when he married a wife and next the day when he made it impossible for her to live with him if i can no longer carry on my assembly rooms what remains there is always the stage your friends desire nothing so much as your return to drury lane yes the stage i might return to drury lane but will those good people who sacked the black jack and wrecked the house in the square yesterday they were my friends of old some of them i believe are my cousins they formerly came to applaud do you think they would come to applaud after what has happened not so they would come with baskets full of rotten apples and addled eggs they would salute me with those missiles there would be frantic cursings and hissings they would drive me off the stage with every brutal insult that their filthy minds could invent oh i know my own peoplemy cousins i know them they will forget you jenny yes if i keep quiet if i put myself forward the old rancour will be revived who betrayed her old friends who sent the bishop and the captain to newgate who got them put in pillorywhere they will most certainly have to stand who caused all the addled eggs in london to fly in their innocent faces i tell you will i know my people are they not my people and have i not betrayed them you lovely boytell your dada that jenny will never repent or regret what she did for his sake she would do it again she wouldshe wouldshe would oh jenny you cut me to the heart what can i do for you you can look happy again and you can get the newgate paleness out of your cheeksthat is what you can do will at this point of our discourse i observed without paying any attention to them a little company of two men and a woman walking across the marsh in the direction of the palace or the church or perhaps the cottages i looked at them without suspicion otherwise it would have been easy for jenny to have jumped into a boat and to have escapedfor a time at least but at this juncture we were singularly unfortunate the house in soho square had not been burned otherwise there would have been no further trouble but you shall hear i went back to the question of the liabilities how could anyone be easy who owed l since there is no help jenny for the creditors and since you are not responsible why then jenny you shall live with us and it will be our pride and happiness to work for you she laughed no that would not do either meantime the people i had seen crossing the marsh were drawing nearer i now observed that the woman with the two men was none other than the girl i had seen at the black jack sitting on the captains knee jenny i said quick here comes a woman who owes you no goodwill are you afraid of her if so let us take boat and escape across the river is it one of the st giless company no will i am not afraid of the woman and you i am sure are not afraid of the men they were within fifty feet of us the woman broke away from the men and ran towards us here she is she cried this is the woman make her prisoner quick she will run away i told you she would be here oh make her prisoner quick put on the handcuffs tie her hand and footshes a devilbring out the chains she is desperate she will claw some of you with her nails once she bit off a mans ear that was when she was an orange girl make her prisoner good gentlemen as quick as you can take care of her shell tear your eyes out for you jenny flushed scarlet and stood still but she caught my hand dont leave me will she murmured leave her but a terrible sinking of the heart warned me that something horrible and dreadful was falling upon us what was it i have felt it coming said jenny come with me whatever they do the woman was within six feet of us standing on the bank a wild figure she was bareheaded save for her hair which streamed out in the fresh breeze she wore a black leather corset and a frock of some thick stuff with a woollen shawl or kerchief round her neck her red arms were bare to the elbow she had a black eye and a disfiguring scratch across her cheek her bosom heaved her lips trembled her eyes were bright her cheeks were flaming i knew her now she was the girl i had seen sitting on the captains knee and i understood this was more revenge the two men then approached i knew them too alas i had good reason to know them they were officers of bow street court by your leave madame said one i have an order to arrest the body of madame vallance otherwise called jenny wilmot otherwise mrs matthew halliday he produced his emblem of office the short wand with a brass crown upon it i am the person sir i suppose you have some reasonsome chargeagainst me receiving stolen goods knowing the same to have been stolen oh she caught at my arm i had forgotten that dangerwill do not leave menot yetnot yet then she recovered her selfpossession well gentlemen i am your prisoner this gentleman my friend and cousin may i suppose come with me alice came to the door and looked out astonished to see two officers take your child alice said jenny i must go with these gentlemen not content with destroying my property they are now trying to destroy my character will goes with me to see what it means he will report to you later on oh your character said the woman a pretty character youve got how long since you had a character at all i should like to know destroy your character i will destroy your lifeyour lifeyour lifevile impudent drabi shall take your life you shall learn what it means to turn against your friends come said one of the men youve shown us where she was no more jaw now leave us go you have had your revenge not yetnot till i see her in the cart that is the only revenge that will satisfy me jenny looked at her with a kind of pity poor soul she said gently do you think the man is worth all this revenge do you think he cares for you do you think you will care about him after a day or two what do you think you will get by all the revenge possible more of his love and fidelity who gave you that black eye will you make him any happier in his prisonwill you make him any fonder oh the woman gasped and caught her breath revenge if i can find your mother and your sister i will kill them both with a pair of scissors she improved this prophecy by a few decorative adjectives as for you this will teach you to turn against your own folkthe poor roguesyou belong to us and you turn against us to save a man that belongs to other folk ha the rope is round your neck already ha i see you swinging ho she stopped and gasped again being overcome with the emotion of satisfied revenge perhaps i said weakly this good woman would take a guinea and go away quietly no no she replied not if you stuffed my pockets full of guineas youve put my man in prison they say hell stand in pillory and praps be killedthe properest man in st giless they kill them sometimes in the pillory she shuddered but praps theyll let him off easy as for you my fine madameyou that look so haughtyyou the orange girlyoull be hangedyoull be hanged she screamed these words dancing about and cracking her fingers like a mad woman never before had i seen a woman so entirely possessed by the fury of loves bereavement do not imagine that i have set down her actual wordsthat i could not donor the half of what she said and all for such a lover for a footpad and highway robber for a brute who beat her kicked her and knocked her down a low dirty villain who made her fetch and carry and work for him who had no tenderness or any good thing in him at all yet he was her man and she loved him and she would be revenged for him this woman i say was like a tigress bereft of her cubs had it not been for the constable who stood between and for myself who stood beside she would have flown at poor jenny with nail and claw and indeed any other weapon which nature had given to woman i saw two women fighting once for a man twas in the kings bench prison they were pulled apart after one had been disfigured for life by the others teeth this woman wanted only permission to rush in and do likewise but the constable kept her back with his strong arm come he said enough said whats the use of crying and shrieking youll all be hanged in good timeall be hanged what else are you fit for and a blessed thing it is for you that you will be hanged thats what i say if you only knew it madame he said very respectfully i must ask leave to take you before his worship he held out his hand the hand of law in all her branches from counsel to thief taker is always held out i gave him half a guinea the woman was still standing beside us shaking and trembling under the agitation of the late storm here you said the officer weve had enough of your filthy tongue get off with you go i say he stepped forward with a menacing gesture among these women a blow generally follows a word she turned and walked away i followed her with my eyes her shoulders still heaved her fingers worked from time to time she turned and shook her fist and though i could not hear i am certain she was talking to herself where are we going jenny asked humbly to sir john fieldings bow street madame lord what signifies what a madwoman like that says shes lost her man and shes off her head how are we to get there well madam there is no coach to be got this side the high street if i may make so bold theres the boats at the horseferry we can drop down the river more quickly than over london bridge jenny made no remark she sat in the boat with bent head her cheeks still flaming i am thinking will dont speak to me just at present the boat carried us swiftly down the river i am thinking she repeated what is best to do will i had quite forgotten the things i could not understand a word of what she said i know now what i have to do its a hard thing to do but its the best she explained no more and we presently arrived at the savoy stairs and took a coach to bow street police court it was only six weeks since i was there last but on what a different errand the blind magistrate took our case and called for the evidence first the woman who had delivered jenny into the hands of the law deposed that she was a respectable milliner by trade that she was accidentally in the neighbourhood of the black jack about midnight three nights before when she became aware of something which excited her curiosity and interest the landlady of the tavern and her daughter doll were carrying between them a box full of something or other she followed them herself unseen they walked down denmark street into hogs lane and carried their box into a garden the door of which was open for greater certainty of knowing the place again she marked the door in the corner with a cross then the two women came out and returned to the black jack all night long they were carrying things from the tavern to the garden gate sometimes in boxes sometimes in their arms there were silk mantles and satin frocks and embroidered petticoats very fine that work kept them all night now knowing the old woman to be a notorious fence she was certain that these were stolen goods and that they were removing them for safety to this house probably unknown to the master and the mistress that in the morning when it was light she went back to the place and found that the gardendoor was the backdoor of the premises known as the soho square assembly rooms kept by a madame vallance well what then asked sir john your worship the next day was the trial of that gentleman there for robbing the bishop and the captain i was in the old bailey sir and the gentleman would have been brought in guilty and hanged as many a better man than he has suffered it without a whisper or a snivelbut this woman herethis madame vallance who is nothing in the world but jenny wilmot the actresswho was an orange girl at drury lane onceand is the daughter of the old woman that keeps the black jack the black jack said sir john the mob wrecked that house last night and the other house too they would have set it on fire your honour said the girl but the soldiers came up and stopped them mores the pity have a care woman said the magistrate or i shall commit you for taking part in the riot go on with your evidence if you have any more she gave her evidence in a quick impetuous manner it was like a cataract of angry burning words it was in the garret that i found the things i knew them at once id been down in mother wilmots cellars oh i knew them at once jennys got the stolen goods i said and so she had so she had your honour and oh let her deny itlet her deny itif she can you found property in the garret which you identified as stolen pray how did you know that fact because it came from mother wilmots cellars that does not prove it to be stolen well sir i happened to know some respectable people who had been robbed of late and i made bold to tell them of it and they found their own things and here the worthy respectable gentlemen are to testify i will hear them presently then sir john began to ask the woman a few questions which mightily disconcerted her if he asked she was a respectable milliner where did she work if she was a respectable woman what was she doing in front of st giless church at midnight if she were a respectable woman how did she come to know the landlady of the black jack and her daughter how was it she found herself in the garrets at all at what time was she in the garrets how did she come to know the people who had lost property of late in a word he made the woman confess who she was and what she was and he then to her confusion and amazement committed her for trial for taking part in the riots so she was put aside and presently consigned to newgate with other rioters taken in the fact in the end she was imprisoned and whipped still her evidence proved the deposit of goods in the garrets the worthy gentlemen to whom she referred were three or four respectable tradesmen of holborn they deposed one after the other how they had suffered of late much from depredations which prevented them from exposing their goods at their doors that this woman had called to warn them of certain things found by the rioters in the garrets of the soho square assembly rooms that they went to see the things by permission of the guard of soldiers that they found certain things of their own which they identified by private marks upon them the evidence was concluded madame the magistrate said you have heard the evidence what have you to say if you desire to call evidence for the defence i will remand the case you can produce perhaps your mother and sister though i confess they are not likely to appear they got away yesterday to avoid the fury of the mob sir this woman is angry because i have proved her lover to be guilty of perjury that is evident on the other hand your house contained the stolen goods your mother was seen taking them into the house the circumstances are such as to make it evident that your mother desired a place of safety it is proper to show that you were not an accomplice of the removal and the reception in your house i submit sir that i can only prove this by calling my mother as witness and sir you have yourself acknowledged that she is not likely to appear then madame i can only ask you for anything you may say in defence sir i shall say nothing this reply amazed me beyond anything i expected her to deny indignantly any knowledge of the matter and to declare that the things had been brought into the house without her knowledge she would say nothing then sir john committed her for trial i placed her in a coach with such heaviness of heart as you may imagine and we drove to newgate jenny was well remembered by the turnkeys to whom she had been generous and even profuse in my case turnkeys are never astonished but the appearance of madame was perhaps an exception to this general rule however on payment of certain guineas she was placed alone in the best cell that the womans side could boast jenny i cried when we were alone for gods sake what does it mean why did you not deny knowledge of the whole business what have you to do with stolen goods even supposing that your mother took them there what has that got to do with you i shall tell the whole truth to you will and only to you but you may tell alice from you i will keep no secrets oh jenny it is for mefor methat you have fallen into all this trouble what shall i do what shall i do i looked round the mean bare and ugly walls of the cell twas a poor exchange from the private room in the square and all for me what did your boy tell you this morning will that jenny never regretsnever repentswhat she has done for you she would do it all over againover againa hundred thousand times over again she buried her face in her hands for a moment twas not in womans nature to restrain the tears then she sprang to her feet what you think i am going to cry because the woman has done this at least she is coming to newgate as well now will i must tell you the truth it was most important to get the evidence of my mother and of doll they connected probus with the conspiracy they helped to identify the two principal witnesses well i had to buy their evidence they made me pay a pretty price for it as for doll you wouldnt believe what a grasping creature she is that comes of keeping the slate i had to compensate them for the loss of their daily takings at the black jack i paid them for their stock of liquorswe saw the mob drinking it up last night i paid them for their furniture and their clothes i gave them money to get out of london with and to keep them until they can get another tavern they got money from me on one pretence or the other till i thought they were resolved on taking all i had and when i had paid for everything and thought they were settled and done with there arose the question of the stolen goods and i really thought the whole business was ruined and undone what question why my parent will had got under the old house a spacious stone vault quite dry built up with arches and paved with stone there isnt a finer storeroom in all london it belonged once to some peoplei dont knowreligious people who liked shutting themselves up in the dark i suppose that mother couldnt bear waste or the throwing away of good opportunities for she turned the vault into a cellar for stolen goods she bought the goods she stored them down below she sold them to people who carried them about the country everybody knew it and she was pretty safe because she had a good name for the prices she gave and even merridew had to let her alone well what was to be done with the things in the vault there was enough to hang them both a hundred times they took me down to see them i never suspected there was anything like the quantity of things plain silver melted down gold melted down precious stones picked out of rings and snuffboxes patch boxes rolls of silk boxes of gloves handkerchiefs frocks and gowns and embroidered petticoats and mantles ribbons of all kinds the place was like a wonderful shop time was pressing it was impossible for mother to sell everything at once things have to be taken into the country and sold cautiously to the squires lady who knows very well what she is buying just as her husband knows that he is buying smuggled brandy so you bought the things there was nothing else to do mother tied up the jewels in her handkerchief doll took the melted gold and silver and they undertook to carry all the rest of the things across to the garden door in hog lane the door by which we escaped yesterday and to store them in my cellars and garrets this i suppose they did i paid for the things they are mine will oh i groaned yes they are mine this comes of being born in st giless and belonging to the black jack well i clean forgot all about the things well now this is the point if i deny knowledge of them they will send out a hue and cry for mother she will certainly be found and brought up on the charge and she is not the sort to suffer in silence i know my people will she and doll will let it be known that i bought the things so that we may all thus stand in the dock together and i assure you will i would much rather stand in the dock alone i shall have a better chance yesbut if i take the whole business on myself they wont drag in mother they will let her alone and she will keep quiet for her own sake besides seeing what this woman has got by her evidence i dont think the others will be eager to give their evidence now will you know the exact truth andandthis is what one expects if you belong to the black jack butjennythinkthink i know what you would say dear lad they will hang me it is a most ungraceful way of going out of the world one would prefer a feather bed with dignity but indeed have no fears will they will do nothing of the kind if jenny wilmot made any friends at drury lane now is the time to prove them but i must think what to do she sat down to the table there were writing materials upon it she took quill in hand then she turned to me with her pretty smile oh willwhat a disaster it was that the soldiers came up before the mob had set fire to the house what a disaster if the house was burned the things in the garrets would have been burned as well and all the stolen goods would have been destroyed and no trace left what a disaster she laughed what might have been called my good fortune has turned out the greatest misfortune that could have happened to me i must think she said i must be alone and think out the whole situation it all depends on what should be told and what should be concealed that i take it is the history of everything some parts we hide and some we tell i must think i did not disturb her she leaned her head upon her hand and was silent for awhile will she said of all my friends there are but two on whom i can rely with any hope of helponly two yet they told me i had troops of friends you have heard me speak of a certain noble lord who made love to me he made love so seriously that he was ready to marry me i refused him as a reward besides his sister came and wepti told you the story i cannot bear to see even a woman weep well will this man is i am quite sure a loyal and faithful gentleman the only one of all my lovers whom i could respect i am going to write to him he promised me upon his honour to come to my assistance if ever i wanted any help of any kind i am going to remind him of that promise the next friend is the manager of drury he will help me if he can though he did not propose to marry me i will write to him as well and i must write to my attorney who is also a friend of yours now will i want you to take by your own hand a letter to his lordship go to his town house in curzon street and ask the people to deliver the letter instantly the other two letters you can send by messenger and will one more thing i believe you ought to warn matthew what to expect since he is going to be bankrupt on his own account it will not hurt him very much to be bankrupt on mine as well now wait a little while i write the letters chapter xv the filial martyr i hastened on my errand taking a boat to westminster whence it is a short walk across the parks to curzon street where my lord brockenhurst had his town house it was about three oclock in the afternoon i found carriages and chaises waiting outside the open door and the hall within filled with servants in livery lolling about and exchanging insolent remarks upon the people who crowded up the stairs i am little versed in the customs of the great but i confess that the continual presence of these insolent and hulking varlets in the house and in all the rooms would be to me a burden intolerable what says doctor johnson the pride of awful state the golden canopy the glittring plate the regal palace the luxurious board the liveried army and the menial lord i believe he meant the lords who were obsequious to the cardinal we may read it to suit those times the impudent menials who lord it over their masters house i thought of those lines as i waited neglected in the hall among the lacqueys fortunately i was reminded of other lines by the same great author where won by bribes by flatteries implored the groom retails the favours of his lord i turned to one of them whose shoulder knots and his rod of office proclaimed him one in authority sir i said i am the bearer of a letter for his lordship wait friend wait his lordship will receive presently sir it is an important letter it is from a lady i assure you that his lordship would be much vexed not to receive it give it to me then sir by your leave it is very important can you contrive to put it into his lordships hand immediately he looked at me with an air of surprise and made no reply pardon me sir i said taking out my purse in which were two guineasall i had in the worldi forgot to add that i rely on your good offices with that i slipped a guinea into his hand ay he said now you talk sense well sir you may trust me his lordship shall have the letter within an hour as soon as his company begins to go with this assurance i was fain to be content so i came away hoping that the fellow would keep his word this happily he did it was too late at that hour to seek out matthew in his countinghouse besides i confess that i felt pity for the poor wretch thus hastening to destruction his haggard look at the trial showed the miseries he was suffering he gave his evidence as you have heard on the threat that otherwise he would be charged with the other four with conspiracy and now a misfortune almost as bad was to fall upon him to go to him would have the appearance of exulting over these misfortunes yet it was necessary to tell him i went home sadly that jenny should suffer the wreck and destruction of her house in soho square was hard that she should also which was much worse be arrested on a capital charge and committed to newgate that she should have nothing to say or to plead in defence in revenge for the part she had played in proving my innocence these things i say were difficult to understand why should she not plead not guilty and leave it to the prosecution to prove that she was the owner of the property or that she knew it was in her house who would believe the word of the revengeful fury who swore to seeing the things taken to the house by the old woman and her daughter would not a clever counsel make her contradict herself and confess somehow that she herself had laid the things there by way of a trap so i argued blind in my anxiety will said alice you would meet misfortune by falsehood fie you would lay a trap set by a clever talker to catch this miserable ignorant woman fie what then i cried ignorant or not she is a mischievous and a revengeful woman my dear i would save jenny at any cost i think jenny is right will she will meet the charge by simply pleading guilty to whatever they can prove against her namely having the things in her house knowing that they were stolen i think it is her wisest course no questions will be asked no one will believe that a woman in her position could actually be guilty of receiving stolen goods so worthless it will be understood by everybody that she is screening someonesome close relationeven at the risk of her own life i replied by a groan of dissent jenny is not an actress for nothing she ought not to have bought the things at all or she ought to have destroyed them this i suppose she would have done but she forgot she was wholly occupied in saving you we must remember that with gratitude unspeakable will yes wife god knows i do the world has been told over and over again that poor jenny was once an orange girl do people ever expect orange girls to come of respectable parents to take guilt upon yourselfin order to screen your motherwill appear to the world as a noble and generous act it would have taken you and me will a month to discover the best way out of the trouble but jenny saw her way at once in the end alice proved to be right jenny chose the very best thing possible as you shall see in the morning i began by making my way to the old familiar place the counting house and wharf close to allhallows the great the wharf was quite empty and desolate the cranes were there but there were no lighters the casks and bales that formerly encumbered the place were gone in the outer countinghouse there were no clerks except ramage but the place was filled with lawyers clerks attornies creditors and their representatives the talk was loud and angry all were talking together all were threatening terrible things unless their claims were paid in full ramage held up his hands when he saw me and shook his head will my cousin see me ramage i asked tell him i have something of the greatest importance to say to him it is all over mr william he whispered the blow has fallen after the things which came out in the old bailey there was no hope it was all over the city at once and on change in the afternoon you will find him within i fear you will find that he has been drinking go in sir you must not pay any heed to what he says he has been strange and unlike himself for a long time no wonder with all these troubles thus did the faithful servant stand up for the credit of an unworthy master go in sir he will insult you but dont mind what he says i went in matthew was evidently half drunk he had a bottle of brandy before him and he was drinking fast and furiously gaolbird he cried banging his fist on the table and talking thickly newgatebirdwhat do you want money you all want money you may go away then i havent got any money all the moneys gone all the moneys lost so he went on repeating his words and maundering and forgetting one moment what he had said just before matthew i said i have not come to ask for money or for anything i have brought you news what news there is no news but bad news perhaps somebody has murdered probus why dont you murder probusmurdermurder probus i suffered him to go on in his foolish way without reply do you know will he lay back in his chair and plunged his hands in his pockets there is nobody i should like to see murdered so much as probusezekiel probus excepting yourself if i could see both of you hanging side by side i should be happy but if i could see you both murdered with a bludgeon i could goi could goi could go to the kings bench cheerfullycheerfully it was no use prolonging the interview i told him briefly why i had come your wife i said has had her house sacked and the whole of her property destroyed by the mob i am glad of thatvery glad to hear that all of it destroyed you say this is good news indeed she can no longer carry on her business at the soho square assembly rooms the property destroyed consists largely of furniture supplied for the use of the rooms it is not yet paid for therefore she will be compelled to refer her creditors to you her creditors does this abandoned woman owe any money then i believe about l is the sum of her liabilities he laughed he laughed cheerfully as if it was one of the merriest and heartiest jokes he had ever heard is that all why man its nothing put it on my back and as much more as you please as much as the bank of england contains why i can bear it all nothing makes any difference now tell her she is quite welcome to double it if she can get the credit its all one to me that is what i came to tell you very good gaolbird probus very nearly succeeded did he not you felt a kind of a tightening about the neck i suppose never mind dont be disappointed i dare say you will go to tyburn after all you are young yet and then the fortune will come to meand we shall seewe shall seehe drank another glass of nanteswe shall seewhat was i going to say so i left him and went on my way to newgate jenny was in conference with her attorney come in will i have no secrets from my cousin mr dewberry now if you please give me your opinion first then if you plead not guiltywhat can they prove against you that certain things were found in your garrets how did they get there a wretched revengeful drab says that your mother and sister put them there is her word to be believed she is the sweetheart of a conspirator and presumably a highwayman whom you have been instrumental in consigning to a prison with probably a severe punishment to follow where are your mother and sister they are gone away where you cannot be asked but you do not know why to escape the revenge of the mob who have wrecked their house very well there the case endsand breaks down not so it does not break down my mother has long been known as the greatest receiver in the trade she bought more and sold more than anybody else the court dressmakers came to her to buy her lace and her embroidery for the great court ladies why she is the most notorious woman in london if i am acquitted they will get up a hue and cry for her and they will certainly find her and then there isnt a thief in prison or out who will not give evidence against her after the evidence she has given against the thieves and as for dollmy sisters name is dollin order to save her own skin she will most certainly be ready to give evidence to the effect that i bought the things of my mother and paid for them which i did as i told you you never told me so i dont know that it matters much i am only trying to see my way to an acquittal and considering there is nobody but that woman to testify to the conveyance of the goods really i think there ought to be no doubt as to the result mr dewberry jenny laid her hand upon his arm understand me i have been kept down all my life by my origin as soon as this business is over i shall try in some way or other to get clear away from them alloh what an origin it is oh how i have always envied the children of honest parents whymy father dear lady do not speak of these things well then my cousinsi mean those of them who are not yet hangedlive in the courts and blind alleys of st giless i have no longer any patience with themit makes me wretched to think of them and it humiliates me to go among them because i have to become again one of them and i do it so easily well sir i am what i am yet strange as it may seem to youi will not lend my help to getting my mother and sister hanged mr dewberry took her hand and kissed it proceed madame he said gravely if then i plead guilty the womans evidence will be received without any dispute or discussion and when sentence is passed the case will be closed no one afterwards will venture to charge my mother with that crime i suppose not but the sentence madame the sentence she shuddered i know what the sentence will be but i am not afraid i have friends who will come to my assistance in fact one of them appeared at that very moment he was a gentleman of a singularly sweet and pleasant countenance on which kindness honour and loyalty were stamped without the least uncertainty he was dressed very finely in a satin coat and waistcoat and he wore a sash and a star divine jenny he said taking her hand and kissing it is it possible that i find thee in such a place and in such a situation as this jenny suffered her hand to remain in his when i think of her and of her behaviour at this juncture i am amazed at her power of acting she represented not her own feelings which were those of the greatest disgust towards her nearest relations to whom one is taught to pay respect but the feelings which she wished lord brockenhurst and through him the world at large should believe of her in her left hand she held a white lace handkerchief scented with some delicate perfume the woman was one of those who are never without some subtle fragrance which seemed to belong to her naturally this handkerchief she applied to her eyesfrom time to time they were dry to my certain knowledge but the act was the outward semblance of weeping my lord said jenny this gentleman is my cousinnot of st gilessmy husbands cousinmy husband however i cannot suffer to approach me this other gentleman is mr dewberry of great st thomas apostle in the city of london attorney at law they are considering my case with me by your lordships permission we will renew our conference in your presence if on the other hand you would prefer to hear alone what i have to state they will leave us i am in your hands jenny he kissed her hand again and let it go my sole desire is to be of service pray remember jenny that whatever i promise i try to perform all the service that i can render you in this time of trouble is at your command i placed a chair for him and looked to jenny to begin she sat down and buried her face in her hands while we all waited my lord she rose at last and continued standing i once told youat a time when it was impossible to conceal anything from you that i was originally an orange girl at the theatre where you honoured me frequently by witnessing my humble performances say rather jenny inspired performances she bowed her head like some queen if your lordship pleases i also told you that my parents were of the very lowestso low that one can get no lower you did now my lord i am accused of receiving stolen property in my house knowing the property to be stolen oh monstrous most monstrous my accuser is a girl whose sweetheart is now by my evidence and the evidence of others lying in this prison beside me on a charge of conspiracy with the girl it is an act of revenge she would tell you as much the mob also in revenge for exposing a most diabolical plot has wrecked and sacked my mothers house in st giless and my own in soho square they have destroyed all that i possessed i am therefore ruined but that is nothing on the stage we care very little about losing or gaining money this woman has now brought a charge against me which i blush even to name you have only to deny the charge jenny there is not a man in london who would doubt the word of the incomparable jenny wilmot she bowed her head again i would i could think so she made as if she would go on then stopped and hesitated looking down as if in doubt and shame my lord i will put the case to you quite plainly mr dewberry is of opinion that the result if the matter is brought before the court will certainly be decided in my favour i am certain on the point said the attorney i beg your lordships pardon for my interruption oh sir who has a better right to interrupt he turned again to jenny whom he devoured with his eyes truly if ever any man was in love it was lord brockenhurst if i were acquitted she went on indeed i believe i should be acquittedbut the case would not be ended by that acquittal suppose my lordi put a caseit need not be mineshe plucked at the lace of her handkerchief as if deeply agitatedi say it need not be my own casei suppose a case such a charge is brought against a personperhaps innocent she is acquittedbut the charge remains it will then be brought against the real criminal out of revenge every thief in st giless would crowd in to give evidence that persons fate would be certain she would beshe would beyour lordship will spare me the word again she covered her eyes then she lifted her head again and went on i know that thepersonis guiltyshe deserves nothing short of what the law provides yet reflect my lord born among rogues brought up among rogues without education and moral principles or honour or religion can one wonder if such a person turns to crime and can you wonder my lordagain she sank into a chair and covered her face with her handscan you wonder if the daughter should resolve to save the mothers life by takingupon herselfthe guiltthe confessionthe consequences of the crime she was silent save for a sob that convulsed her frame his lordship heard with humid eyes when she had finished he rose with tears that streamed down his face for a while he could not speak then he turned to mr dewberry sir he said tell metell mewhat she means she means my lord to plead guilty and to take the consequences by so doing she will save her motheryes my lord her mothereven at the sacrifice of her own life oh he cried it must not be great heavens it must not be jennyjennythou art i swear an angel no my lord no angel yes an angel hear me jenny i will stand by thee the world shall knowthe world that loves theeby the world shall know what a treasure it possesses in the incomparable jenny wilmot as an actress thou art without an equal as a childas a daughterhistory records no greater heroism thou shalt be written down in history beside the woman who saved her father from starvation and the woman who saved her husband from the traitors block i can endure it no longer jenny tomorrow when my spirits are less agitated i will come again he stooped and kissed her bowed head and so left us a common or vulgar actress when the man for whom she had been playing had gone would have laughed or in some way betrayed herself not so jenny she waited a reasonable time after his lordships departure and then lifted her head placed her handkerchiefstill dryto her eyes and stood up mr dewberry she said do you agree with me in the line i have resolved to take madame i do he replied emphatically and you will i hesitated because i perceived that she had been playing a part yet an innocent part she did not certainly desire to bring her mother and sister to a shameful end but at the same time she did not wish it to be known that she had really paid for the property and ordered its removal to her own house she did not regard the landlady of the black jack with all the filial affection not to speak of respect which her emotion undoubtedly conveyed to his lordship on the other hand it would serve her own caseas well as her estimable motherbetter that she should be regarded as a voluntary victim to save a parent than that she should be acquitted in order to give place to her mother who would certainly be convicted i agree jennyi agree i answered sir said mr dewberry as we walked away i have often heard miss jenny wilmot described as an incomparable actress i am now convinced of the fact chapter xvi the snare which they digged for others the same day on leaving jenny the turnkey who conducted me to the gate offered me congratulationsrather gruff and even forcedon the turn things had taken i assure you sir he said with feeling that we know generally beforehand what will happen and wed quite made up our minds as to your case spite of madames interest there didnt seem any doubt some of us are a bit disappointed we dont like you see for anyone to slip out well theres always disappointments would you like to cast an eye on your friendsthem that hatched that pretty plot come this way then i wouldnt like to be in their shoes if it comes to pilloryand it will so he led me out of the passage into one of the yards at the sight of the place my heart sank to think how i had myself trodden those flagstones and stepped from side to side of those dismal walls the place was the masters side there were twenty prisoners or more in it one or two were sitting on the stone bench drinking beer and smoking tobacco one was playing a game of fives by himself my two principal witnesses the bishop and his friend the captain were walking side by side both in irons mr probus sat in a corner his head hanging down taking no notice of anything mr merridew walked by himself with an assumption of being in the wrong place by accident and with an air of importance the prisoners making way for him right and left for the terror of his name accompanied him even into newgate the turnkey called him merridew he said with familiarity come and see the young gentleman you tried to hang now hell hang you thats curious isnt it here we go up he turned to me with a philosophic smile and here we go down sir mr merridew obeyed the call and approached me bowing with great humility his cringing salute was almost as nauseous as the impudent brutality which he had shown in the thieves kitchen sir i am pleased to make your honoured acquaintance i hardly expected in this place where i am confined by accident oh sir i did not come here to make your acquaintance believe me sir i am pleased to have speech with you even in this place and if only to remove a misunderstanding which seems to have arisen regarding my part in the late unhappy business if you will kindly remember sir i merely testified to what i saw being an accidental eyewitness the night was dark there was a scuffle you will bear me out sirso fara scufflewhether you were attacking that fellowhe pointed to the bishop who with his friend the captain was now looking onor that other fellowhe indicated the captainvillains both sirbothwho but for my mistaken kindness would have been hanged long agoi cannot exactly say i may have beenperhapswe all make mistakestoo ready to believe the other side and what they said however that is all over and of course i shall be set free in an hour or two with expressions of sorrow for an undeserved imprisonment he looked in my face for some expression of sympathy but i believe found none no malice sir i hope he held out the abominable hand which was steeped in the blood of his victims and rank with the stink of his wickedness i hope sir that if the case comes to trial i may not see you among the prosecutors i maintained silence and took no notice of his proffered hand but indeed i shall certainly be out in an hour or two or perhaps a day or two my case has not yet perhaps been laid before the authorities i am here as a mere matter of form haformin fact i have no business hereno business at allno business his voice sank to a whisper showing the real agitation of his mind mr merridew i have not come here with any desire to converse with you you are not going to bear malice mr halliday be content with exposing two villains two will be enoughif you want more there is probus hes an extraordinary villain as for you sir consider you are a fortunate man sir you ought to be in the condemned cell you have got off against all expectation and when everybody to a man thought it was a certainty had i been consulted by your sweetheart i should have advised her sir i should indeed so strong a case was itto my experienced mind sir i should have advised her sir to buy the cap and the ribbons and the nosegay and the orangeoh a fortunate man indeed as if he had had nothing whatever to do with the case as if there had been no conspiracy i was turning away in disgust when the other pair of villains drew near i prepared for some volley of abuse and foul language but was disappointed they addressed me it seemed in no spirit of hostility but quite the contrary they were lamb like sir said the bishop what was done by my friend the captain and myself was done by orders of mr merridew here he said do it or swing so we had no choice merridew gave us the orders and probus invented the plot do it or swing was the word you shall swing too the thief taker turned upon him savagely as soon as i get out a pair of villains not fit to live you wont hang anybody any more said the captain with defiance your own times up at last merridew your own rope has come to an end wait till i get out wait till i get out he roared that wont be just yet brother said the turnkey conspiracys an ugly word friend merridew theres imprisonment in itand flogging sometimesand pillory but make up your mind for a long stay and be comfortable dick said mr merridew he knew every turnkey as well as most of the prisoners it was said that he often had to go shares with the turnkeys dick you know me of old ayaywe all know you weve worked together that is as may be but go on well dick i am a sheriffs officer i know all the rogues in london dont i why certainly i know where to lay my hands upon every one i know where they practise and what they do correct said the turnkey they dont dare to lock me up do they lock me up he snorted why if i am kept here long all the villains will go free london will no longer be safe there wont be fifty hangings in a year who fills your gaols john merridew who fills your carts john merridew you know that dick nobody knows better than you correct said dick the judges cant send me to prison they cant do it i say whyof courseof course again his voice sank to a whisper i looked at the man with amazement he was evidently seeking consolation by delusive assurances at heart he was filled with terror for beside the prison there was the dread of pillory they might be set in pillory he knew none better that the thieftaker who is also the thiefmaker has not a single friend in the whole world what would be done to him if he should stand in pillory let me get out as soon as possible he went on appealing to me why sir unless i go out the whole criminal procedure of this country will be thrown out of gear i am the only manthe only man sirask dick here the turnkey shook his keys and nodded but theyll give you a heavy sentence my friend he said the only man that cant be sparedthe only manthe only man again his voice dropped to a whisper he turned away babbling and shaking his head all the insolence gone out of him his power is gone said the bishop he wont get my more rewards yes said the turnkey but he has had a long innings why he must be nearly fifty theres a many would envy merridew the bishop once more addressed himself to me sir he said i grieve to hear that our friends wrecked the black jack and madames house i fear these acts of violence may make you vindictive madame herself was brought in yesterdayfor receiving stolen goods madame madame brought here on a charge the bishops face expressed the liveliest concern why said the captain its a motion of his fingers to his throat showed what he meant nothing could have been more disastrous said the bishop believe me sir we have nothing to do with the wreck of the houses and we were ignorant of this charge i assure you sir oh this is a great misfortune the misfortune it appeared lay in the dangernay the certainty that this persecution would make both madame and myself more vindictive now the events of the trial when at a word as it seemed from madamewitnesses sprang up in a cloud to confront them with their villainy made them believe that she had friends everywhere it cannot be said the bishop but she will get off who is the principal evidence ask the captain and that is enough i stepped across the yard and laid my finger on probuss shoulder as he sat with bowed form and hanging head he looked up with lacklustre eyes i believe that the loss of his money and the result of his conspiracy had affected his brain for he seemed to pay no heed to anything mr probus i said i must tell you that my cousin is now bankrupt he stared without any look of recognition mr probus i repeated my cousin matthew is a bankrupt i tell you in order that you may send in your claim with those of the other creditors ayay he replied very like bankrupt i said again even had you succeeded in your plot you would have been too late he nodded without attention and another mass of debts has been added his wifes house has been wrecked by the mob and all her property destroyed therefore her liabilities have been presented to her husband all gone he moaned all gone the work of an honest lifetime wasted and thrown away nothing will ever be recovered mr probus i said the money is gone that is most true but more than that is gone your characteryour honourit is all gonewasted and thrown awaynone of it will be recovered all goneall gone he repeated the turnkey stood beside me queer isnt it he said hes lost his money and his wits have gone after it a money lender he was hes put more poor folk into the fleet and the kings bench than his friend merridew has put prisoners here and he ought to be thinking of something elsehis trial and his sentence his sentence wellyou see merridew he knows this one doesnt the bishop he knowsand the captainand they dont like it this man doesnt care for you see they will certainly have to stand in pilloryand if the mob dont love money lenders they love thief takers less and merridews the most notorious thief taker in town wellits a wonderful country for law and justice now i suppose they poor french would be content to hang up a man at once we dont we give em an hours ride in a cart where they sometimes gets roses but more often gets addled eggs or we put em in pillory where they may get dead cats or they may get flints and broken bottles i came away the heavy gate closed the key turned in the lock the four wretches were shut in once more there at least the prey to the keenest terrors dying a thousand deaths before they should be taken out for the dead cats and the addled eggs and perhaps the flints and broken bottles chapter xvii the case of clarinda the town has notoriously a short memory yet i doubt if there be any still living who remember the year and have forgotten the case of jenny wilmot for indeed no one for some time talked of anything else there were armies in the field these were forgotten there were fleets and naval battles and expeditions these were forgotten there was the strife of party that was forgotten there were the anxieties of trade they were forgotten there were scandals among the aristocracy they were forgotten there was the new play the new poem all were clean forgotten and neglected while the town talked at my ladys breakfast or moll kings tavern of jenny wilmot jenny wilmot jenny wilmot the world at first could find nothing too bad to say or think of her at the clubs they suspended their play while they listened to the latest rumour about jenny at the coffeehouses every quidnunc and gobemouche brought a new story which he had heard and transmitted with embroideries or else a trifling variation in the old story to communicate people remembered how she disappeared mysteriously from the stage a year or two before this catastropheha what a proof of wickedness was that why it was now known that she was none other than madame vallance who provided the masquerades and the assemblies in soho square and was never seen by the company except in a domino there was another illustration of her wicked disposition it was also recalled for the benefit of those who did not remember the fact that she had been an orange girl at drury before she was promoted to the stage what could be expected of an orange girl and now it was actually brought to lightcould one believe itit was actually discoveredhad she not herself confessed itthat her mother and sister kept a tavern in st giless a place of resort for the lowest a mere thieves kitchen the rendezvous of highwaymen footpads pickpockets and rogues of every description it was certain that jenny had been born and brought up in this vile receptacle or temple of vice many people were found who had recollections of jenny as a child playing in the gutter or on the steps of st giless church these recollections were of an edifying nature one gentleman of an aspect which we call smugsomewhat resembling in fact my cousin matthew at his earliest and bestrelated in my hearing that he had addressed the child and on hearing that her ambition was to become an orange girl at drury lane theatre had warned her against the perils of that path unhappily without effect except that while he was exhorting her to a godly life his tears were checked by the theft of his pockethandkerchief and so on and so on because the occasion gave an opportunity for securing a momentary distinction and when the imagination is fired the tongue is loosed again there is in the english mind something particularly repellant in the life and the acts of the informer now it cannot be denied that in my trial jenny figured as one who had turned against her old friends and associates had used her knowledge to secure their arrest and had induced her mother and sister and at least one of the rogues of the black jack to join her in giving evidence against the conspirators so that when the news was spread abroad that her house as well as the black jack had been wrecked and the contents destroyed there was at first a strong feeling among many that this was a kind of wild justice which she deserved because she ought not to have turned against her friends as for the man for whose sake she did it you may be sure that the motive commonly attributed to her was such as would naturally commend itself to the majority that any woman should be so deeply moved by generosity of heart by love of justice by honest indignation against so foul a conspiracy as to resolve at all risks and hazards to defeat the object of the villains and to prevent the destruction of an innocent man required too high a flight to make it possible to be considered by the common sorti mean not the poor but the common sort of respectable burgesses the folk of the coffeehouse and the club the world always accepts the worst where it ought to believe the best and the wickedness of the natural man is never so strongly demonstrated as when he is searching for motives in a word it was pretended and believed that in order to rescue her lovera brokendown gentleman and a highwaymanfrom the charge of robbery which could only be proved by the witnesses taking false names in order to protect themselves being unfortunately rogues themselves she brought a charge against them of conspiracy and exposed their true names and their history which she could only effect by the knowledge she got from the black jack and the assistance of her mother that her lover it was true was cast loose upon the world again but that the innocence of those four persons including one most respectable attorney would be established as the noonday clear at the ensuing criminal court at the old bailey further it was spread abroad that jenny had been arrested at her lovers house in the rules of the kings bench that she had been brought before sir john fielding and had been by him committed to newgate on a charge of receiving stolen goods receiving stolen goods what however could one expect from st giless and the daughter of the black jack she who must needs expose the crimes of her friends was now in prison on a charge far more serious than theirs receiving stolen goods monstrous and one who entertained even r ps at her assemblies and she was all the time acting with her mother in receiving stolen goods after this what pity could one feel even for a woman so beautiful and so engaging as jenny wilmot but was she so beautiful some of the men raised this question painted for the stage all artificial was she engaging she played as she was taught she smiled and laughed as she was told to smile and laugh that is not true acting alas poor jenny poor favourite of the town how wert thou fallen and certainly for a day or two the reputation of jenny was very low indeed suddenly however there came a changeto me most welcome because without doubt the mind of the town was poisoned and prejudiced against jenny in whose favour no one ventured to speak the first cause of the change was due to a paperi think if my memory serves me right in the connoisseur in this paper the case of clarinda put forth with great skill and power thinly disguised the history of jenny i venture to quote a portion of that paper as soon as people understood that it was her history that was told the paper flew from hand to hand everybody in the coffeehouses and the taverns cried out for it when they entered the house and when it was read a silence fell upon the room and shame upon all hearts the author i have always understood i know not why was my lord brockenhurst though he never confessed it the mottoesthere were twowere as follows non tali auxilio non defensoribus istis tempus eget and tandem desine matrem sequi the case of clarinda whose future yet remains to be determined is one which ought to reduce to humility those who boast of our civilization and the justice of our institutions for certainly it will be allowed that the first requisite of justice is that the officers of the state shall be sufficiently provided with intelligence with resources and with encouragement to search into all cases of alleged crime and to take care by ascertaining especially the private character and previous history of the witnesses how far they are to be credited in a word and speaking of those cases in which human intelligence can be of avail it should be impossible for an innocent man to be convicted of any crime charged to him yet the case of clarinda shows that such is the condition of the times such the weakness of our criminal procedure that a conspiracy as vile as villainous as was ever concocted out of hell would have succeeded to the judicial murder of an innocent man had it not been for the activity the courage the lavish expenditure of a woman unaided and singlehanded her efforts have resulted in the escape of the innocent man and the imprisonment of the conspirators but at what a price for herself clarinda is the daughter of a widow who for a long time has kept a tavern in that part of the town known as st giless it is not pretended that the place is the resort of the quality there has been nothing however alleged against the conduct of the house or the character of the landlady some of the frequenters certainly belonged to the ranks of those who live by their wits it is not the case as alleged in some quarters that clarinda was ever the companion or the friend of these people when she was still quite young she was placed in the pit of drury lane theatre as an orange girl accident drew towards her the attention of the manager who found her clever and attractive with a lovely face and figure a charming manner and a beautiful voice in a word the orange girl was transferred to the stage and there became the delight of the town the greatest favourite of living actresses after a time clarinda as often happens to actresses grew weary of the stage and longed for a quiet life in the country far from the lights and music and applause of the theatre among the many who sighed for her was a young merchant from the city he said he was rich he swore he loved her he promised to take her out of town to a country house where she would have a carriage a garden and all that she could desire clarinda listened he was grave in demeanour he was even austere but this proved that he was free from the vices of the men she more frequently met clarinda accepted him and they were married she discovered on the very day of her marriage that he had lied to her he was not rich though once he had been possessed of a large fortune he was a gambler he had gambled away all his money he had married her because she was lovely he proposed to use her charms for the purpose of attracting rich gentlemen to his rooms where he intended to carry on a gaming table clarinda on this discovery instantly left the man in disgust but for the moment she would not go back to the stage she then took a large house in one of the western squares she decorated and furnished this house and she opened it for masquerades and assemblies one day she received a letter from two of the frequenters of her mothers house they were in a debtors prison they were afraid of becoming known in which case not only would other detainers be put in but they might themselves be arrested on some criminal charge clarinda always generous went to the prison saw the two men and promised them relief it was an unfortunate act of generosity which in the end worked toward her ruin in the prison she espied a young man so closely resembling her own unworthy husband that she accosted him and learned that he was imprisoned probably for life by her husband aided by mr vulpes an attorney on a vampedup charge of debt with the hope of making him obtain his liberty by selling his chance of succession to a large fortune she obtained the release of this gentleman who with his wife can never cease to be sufficiently grateful to her she gave him for he was a fine musician a place in her orchestra she then learned that vulpes the attorney together with one traditor a thief taker was organizing another plot against this already injured gentleman but she was unable to learn the nature of the plot except that the two villains whom she had released from prison were involved in it the next step was that the gentleman was accused by the whole party of four as a highway robber and as such was cast into prison then it was that our magistrates should have taken up the case clarinda repaired to rhadamanthus the magistrate and pointed out to him the truth he told her that he had neither men nor money to follow up the case therefore clarinda at her own expense fetched up from various country prisons turnkeys and governors who should expose the character of the witnesses she persuaded her mother and sister to give evidence to the same effect in order to do this she was obliged to buy her mother out of the tavern she herself gave evidence and she made her unwilling husband give evidence the result was the acquittal of the prisoner and the committal of the conspirators not the magistrates of the country butdux femina factia woman without assistance singlehanded at her own private charges has done this non tali auxilio non defensoribus istis tempus eget that the mob should in revenge wreck her house and destroy her property was to be expected at a time when we cannot protect our streets in the very day time but there was more clarindas mother at the time of the trial had in her keeping a certain quantity of stolen property whether she knew it to be stolen or not cannot be said when however the old woman accepted clarindas proposal that she should give evidence against the conspiracy she seems to have thought that the garrets of her daughters house would be a safe place for storing these goods she was observed to be conveying them by a woman the mistress of one of the conspirators while the house was in the hands of the mob this woman looked for and found the propertya miserable paltry collection of ragsin the garrets for the sake of revenge she brought information against clarinda who now therefore lies in newgate waiting her trial at the old bailey what should clarinda do if she pleads not guilty which under ordinary circumstances she should do the more so as there is no evidence whatever to connect her with any knowledge of these rags she will be acquitted but then her mother will be arrested and tried on this capital charge if on the other hand she takes upon herself the full responsibility the mother escapes scot free while the daughter may pay the full penalty for the crime the reader will not think it necessary to ask what course will be pursued by clarinda the generous heart which would risk all sacrifice all lavish all in the cause of justice and for the rescue of a mannot her lover but a worthless husbands cousinfrom an ignominious and undeserved death will assuredly not hesitate to save her erring mother even at the risk of her own life that generous heart that noble heart will be sustained and followed unto the end even though justice demands the uttermost penalty by the tears of all who can admire heroic sacrifice and filial martyrdom there was more but this is enough in a single day the voice of the people veered round to the opposite pole it was wonderful how quickly opinion was changed jenny who yesterday had been a traitress a spy a receiver of stolen goods a hussy with no character suddenly became a heroine a martyr then the men remembered once more that she was a wonderful actress a most charming woman a most beautiful graceful vivacious creature then as of old men recalled the evenings when as they sat in the pit jenny seemed to have singled out one by one each for a separate and individual smile so that they went home their heads in the clouds to dream of things impossible and unspeakable and all the old love for the favourite returned to them and they panted for jenny to be set free during this time i was with jenny all day long ready to be of service to her the more i observed her the more i marvelled at the strange power which brought all men to their knees before her she had but to smile upon them and they were conquered the governor of the prison was her servant the turnkeys were her slaves her visitors crowded her narrow cell every afternoon while jenny received them dressed like a countess with the manner of a countess sometimes i was honoured by her commands to play to them tea and chocolate were served daily great ladies came with the rest to gaze upon her actresses once her rivals now came all rivalry apart to weep over her gentlemen wrote her letters of passionate love portrait painters begged on their knees permission to limn her lovely features in a word for a while the centre of fashion was jennys cell in newgate and every day among the visitors stood my lord of brockenhurst foremost in sympathy and truest in friendship he was indeed as jenny had assured me the most loyal of the gentlemen and the most sincere of friends it must be added that jennys time in prison was not wholly spent in converting a cell into a drawingroom of fashion the unfortunate women her fellowprisoners were much worse off than the men they had fewer friends they were suffered to starve on the penny loaf a day the allowance of the prison they lay for the most part in cold and starvation in rags and dirt and misery overwhelming jenny went into their yard and among them there was the poor creature who had caused her arrest she was half starved now jenny gave her food and spoke to her friendly without reproach she sent food to others who were starving she not only fed them she talked to them not about their sins because poor jenny knew nothing about sins except so far as that certain deeds are punished by the law but she talked to them about being clean and neat she revived the womanly instinct in them made them wash themselves dress their hair and take pleasure again in making themselves attractive never had a woman a keener sense of the duty of women to be beautiful she made them in a week or two so civilized that they left off fighting there was not a black eye in the place and while jenny was in the ward there was hardly so much as a foul word it was pretty to see how they loved her and welcomed her and would have worked themselves to death for her poor lost soulsif indeed they are lost they must all be dead now the horrible gallows has killed some the gaol fever others the fever of bad food and bad drink and bad air others yet until the day of death i am sure that all remembered jenny notably there was her accuser she was sullen at first she was revengeful next she was ashamed and turned aside then she wept and then she became like a tame kitten following her through the ward hungering and thirsting for one more wordone more word of friendshipfrom the very woman whom she had brought to this place chapter xviii the fallen alderman let me return to the wretched man who had caused this trouble i learned that although his two fellowprisoners declared openly that mr merridews power was gone and that he would never again have the power to hang anybody some of his credit was still maintained he pretended that the booksof which he spoke often and with pride were still kept up and that every mans life and liberty were in his hands and many poor rogues thinking to curry favour waited upon him daily bringing him presents of wine tobacco and secretly rum so that he was able to be drunk and to forget his anxieties for the greater part of the day the two rebels against his authority the bishop and the captain carried themselves bravely there is indeed in the profession of the rogue something of the soldier in that they both brave dangers without fear the battle field is covered with the dead and wounded but there are plenty left standing unhurt every soldier thinks he will escape the rogues field of honour is covered with whippingposts stocks pillory and gallows it is far more dangerous than the field of battle yet every rogue hopes to escape and carries himself accordingly perhaps it is better so one would not wish such a crew to be whining and snivelling and pretending repentance and imploring pity one day i met coming out of the prison one whose face and appearance i knew he was old and bent and in rags his woollen stockings were in holes the elbows of his coat were gone his hat was too limp to preserve its shape his buttons were off his coathe wore the old jasey with a broken pigtail i touched him on the shoulder you are mr probuss clerk i said if i am sir he replied is that a crime nonono but you remember me you bade me once go throw myself into the river with a stone about my neck ayay he replied yes i remember you now i did i did was it good advice young man it was doubtless very good advice but i did not take it what are you doing here i come to look after my master he replied simply your master he has kept you in rags and wretchedness he has given you a starvation wage yet he is my master i have eaten his bread though it was bitter i come every day to look after him has he no friends no wife or children to do this for him his friends were his money bags till he lost them they were his wife and children as well has he no relationscousinsnephews perhapshe has driven them all away long ago you are his friend at least i am his clerk he repeated sir since my master found that all his money had been thrown away and lost he has not been himself he has been mad with rage and grief that is why he hatched that unfortunate plot i was in court and heard it ah he was not himself sir i assure you common tricks he practised daily because he knew how far he could go but not such a big job as this conspiracy in his sober senses he would not have been so mad have you seen him sir have you observed the change in him twould bring tears to a flint he moans and laments all day long yes i have seen him sir he thinks about nothing else sir i verily believe that he does not know even that he is in newgate all the money he had in the world is gonelent to mr matthew and lost by mr matthew terrible terrible was there not some lent to the man merridew a trifle sir a few hundreds only no it is all gone my master and i must become beggars and go together into the workhouse he shook his poor old head and went his way now this man had received the treatment of a dog how long he had been with probus what was his previous history i never knew it matters not he had received the treatment of a dog and the wages of a galley slave yet he was faithful and stood by his masterthe only living thing who didin his adversity as in his prosperity i next heard from mr ramage that the counting house was closed and the gates of the quay locked that matthew had run away then that the unfortunate alderman partner in the house had been arrested for debt and was taken to the fleet prison after this that matthew had been arrested that he was bankrupt that he had been taken to the same prison and that the whole amount of the liabilities was now so great that this meant certain imprisonment for life by the custom of london too a creditor may before the day of payment arrest his debtor and oblige him to find sureties to pay the money on the day it shall become due by this custom the whole of jennys liabilities became the cause of new detainers so that i believe the total amount for which matthew was imprisoned was not far short of l i conveyed this intelligence to my mistress misfortune she said gravely is falling upon all of us thou alone wilt survivethe triumph of virtue go however take the man something or he will starve give it him from me will tell himtell himshe considered for a little tell himas soon as i can forget i will forgive not that he cares whether he is forgiven or not a man will i very truly believe may be anything he pleasesdrunkardmurdererhighwayman yet something may still survive in him of human kindness there will still be a place perhaps for compassion or for love but for a gambler there is no compassion left he is more hardened than the worst villain in this wretched place he has neither sense nor pity nor affection nor anything he is all gambler i will give him your money jenny but not your message she smiled sadly go will the money will solace him as long as it lasts perhaps a quarter of an hour i repaired without delay to the fleet prison those who walk up and down the fleet market know of the open window in the wall and the grating behind which stands a man holding a tin box which he rattles to attract attention while he repeats his parrot cry pity the poor prisoners pity the poor prisoners this humiliation is imposed upon those of the common side they must beg or they must starve what was my surprise and shamewho could believe that one of my family should fall so lowto recognise in the prisoner behind these bars my cousin matthew none other his face was paleit had always been pale now it was white his hand shook he was unshaven and uncombed i pretended not to notice him i entered the prison and was told that he was holding the plate but would be free in half an hour so i waited in the yard until he came out being relieved of his task i now saw that he was in rags how can a man dressed as a substantial merchant fall into rags in a few days there was but one answer the gambler can get rid of everything matthew had played for his clothes and lost i accosted him at sight of me he fell into a paroxysm of rage he reviled and cursed me i had been the cause of all his misfortunes he wept and sobbed being weak for want of food and cold so i let him go on until he stopped and sank exhausted upon the bench then i told him that i had come to him from his wife he began again to curse and to swear it was jenny now who was the cause of all his troubles it was jenny who refused to obey him her liabilities alone had prevented him from weathering the storm he should certainly have weathered the storm and so onfoolish recrimination that meant nothing i made no answer until he had again exhausted his strength but not his bitterness matthew i said the woman against whom you have been railing sends you money here it is use it for living and not for gambling the money i gave him was five guineas the moment he had it in his hand he hurried away as fast as he could go i thought he ran away in order to conceal his agitation or shame at receiving these coals of fire not so it was in order to find out someone who would sit down to play with him oh it was a madness i watched him he ran to the kitchen and bought some food he swallowed it eagerly then he bent his steps to the coffeeroom i followed and looked in he was already at a table opposite another man and in his hands was a pack of cards in a few hours or a few minutesit mattered not whichjennys present of five guineas would be gone and the man would be destitute again poor wretch one forgave him all considering this madness that had fallen upon him but said jenny he was bad before he was mad he was bad when he married me he is only worse nothing more is the matter with him but my uncle the alderman also involved in the bankruptcy had been carried to the same place while his great house on clapham common with all his plate and fine furniture had been sold for the benefit of the creditors matthew had ruined all i went to see him he was on the masters not the common side it was a most melancholy spectacle for my own part i bore the poor man no kind of malice he had but believed things told him concerning me he gave me his hand nephew he said his voice breaking this is but a poor place for an alderman yet it is to be my portion for the brief remainder of my days what would my brotheryour fatherhave said if he had known but he could not even suspect no one could suspect nay sir i said i hope that your creditors will give you a speedy release i doubt it will they are incensedand justly soat their treatment bybymatthew they reproach me with not knowing what was doingwhy will i trusted my sonhe sobbedmy sonabsalom my sonthe steady sober son for whom i have thanked god so often will he made me believe evil things of thee he accused thee of such profligacy as we dare not speak of in the city profligacy such as young men of quality may practise but not young men of the city i dared not tell my brother all that he told me indeed sir i know how he persuaded not only you but my father as wellto my injury in the end it was my own act and deed that drove me forth because i would not give up my music if not that then something else would have served his purpose alas will here come your cousins heed them not they are bitter with me heed them not the girls whom i had not seen since my fathers funeral marched along with disdainful airs pulling their hoops aside as once before to prevent the contamination of a touch they reddened when they saw me but not with friendliness oh said one he comes to gloat over our misfortunes ah no doubt they make him happy cousins i said i am in no mood to rejoice over anything except my own escape from grievous peril the hand of the lord is heavy upon this family we are all afflicted as for your brother matthew it is best to call him mad who hath driven him mad asked amelia the elder the revengeful spirit of his cousin this was their burden women may be the most unreasonable of all creatures these girls could not believe that their brother was guilty the bankruptcy of the house the stories of his gambling his marriage with an actress his evidence in the court were all set down as instigated suggested encouraged or invented by his wicked cousin will it matters not i have no doubt that the legend had grown in their minds until it was an article of their creed if they ever mention the prodigal sonwho is now far awayit is to deplore the wicked wiles by which he ruined their martyred saint their brother matthew it is of no use i said to my uncle to protest to ask what my cousins mean or how i could have injured matthew had i desired i may tell you sir that i learned only a short time ago that matthew was a gambler that the affairs of the house were desperate and that an attempt was to be made upon my lifean attempt of which matthew was cognizanteven if he did not formally consent so sir i take my leave they actually did not know that matthew was within the same wallsfather and son the father on the masters side dignified at least with the carriage of fallen authority the son a ragged shambling creature with no air at all save that of decay and ruin unfortunate indeed was our house dismal indeed was its fall shameful was its end chapter xix the end of the conspiracy the trial of our four friends for conspiracy took place in the middle of january for my own part i had to relate in open court the whole history with which you are already acquainted the clause in my fathers will giving me a chance of obtaining a large fortune if i should survive my cousin the attempts made by mr probus to persuade me to sell the chance of succession the trumping up of a debt which never existed my imprisonment in a debtors prison my release by jennys assistance the renewed attempts of mr probus to gain my submission his threats and the truth about the alleged robbery i also stated that two of the defendants had been imprisoned in the kings bench at the same time as myself and that they were at that time close companions the counsel for the defence crossexamined me rigorously but with no effect my story was plain and simple it was in a word so much to the interest of mr probus to get me to renounce my chance that he stuck at nothing in order to effect this purposeor my death i sat down and looked about me heavens with what a different mind from that with which i stood in the dock now occupied by my enemies i should have been more than human had i not felt a great satisfaction at the sight of these four men standing in a row let me call it gratitude not satisfaction the spectacle of the chief offender the contriver of the villainy mr probus was indeed enough to move ones heart to terror if not to pity the wretched man had lost with the whole of his money the whole of his wits the money was his god his religion his heaven he had lost the harvest of a life he was old he would get no more clients he would save no more money he would probably have to make a living as others of his kind have done by advising and acting as an attorney for the rabble of st giless and clerkenwell he stood with rounded shoulders and bowed head he clutched at the iron spikes before him he pulled the sprigs of rue to pieces he appeared to pay no attention at all to the evidence mr merridew on the other hand showed in his bearing the greatest possible terror and anxiety he gasped when his counsel seemed to make a point in his favour he shivered and shook when his part in the plot was exposed he who had given evidence in so many hanging cases unconcerned now stood in the dock himself he was made to feelwhat he had never before consideredthe natural horror of the prisoner and the dreadful terror of the sentence the case might have been strengthened by the evidence of the landlady of the black jack she worthy soul was out of the way and no one inquired after her nor was her daughter doll present on the occasion but there was evidence enough the gaolers and masters of the country prisons proved the real character of the two witnesses who called themselves respectively a clergyman and a country gentleman ramage the clerk proved as before that probus brought merridew to the counting house jack the country lad proved the consultations at the black jack between probus merridew and the two others these two indeed behaved with some manliness they had given up all hope of an acquittal and could only hope that the sentence would be comparatively light they therefore made a creditable appearance of undaunted courage a thing which is as popular in their profession as in any other i do not suppose their crime was capital otherwise the judge would most certainly have sent them all to the gallows many he said at the end are justly executed for offences mild indeed in comparison with the detestable crime of which you stand convicted when the case was completed and all the evidence heard the judge asked the prisoners one after the other what they had to say in their own defence ezekiel probus you have now to lay before the court whatever you have to urge in your own defence mr probus still with hanging head appeared not to hear the warder touched him on the shoulder and whispered he held up his head for a moment looked round the court and murmured nonoit is all gone nothing more could be got from him john merridew you have now the opportunity of stating your own case he began in a trembling voice he said that he had been long a sheriffs officer that he had incurred great odium by his zeal in the arrest of criminals that it was not true that he had concocted any plot either with mr probus or with the other prisoners that he was a man of consideration whose evidence had frequently been received with respect in that very court that it was not true further as had been stated by the prosecution that he had ever encouraged thieves or advised them to become highwaymen that if he went to such places as the black jack it was to arrest villains in the cause of justice that he deposed at the last trial what he saw or thought he sawnamely a scuffle he might have been in too great a hurry to conclude that the late prisoner halliday was the assaulting party the night was dark he only knew the two witnesses as two rogues whom he intended to bring to justice on a dozen capital charges for each as soon as he was out of newgate and that he was a personthis he earnestly begged the court to considerwithout whom the criminal courts would be empty and justice would be rendered impossible with more to the same effect and all with such servile cringings and entreaties for special consideration as did him i am convinced more harm than good when it came to the doctors turn he boldly declared that if the verdict of the jury went against himand gentlemen he said i must own that the evidence has certainly placed me in a strange and unexpected and most painful positionhe would bring over the archbishop of dublin the dean of st patricks cathedral and the provost of trinity college besides noblemen of the irish peerage and many of his old parishioners in order to prove that he was what he pretended to be the assurance gentlemen that i shall be thus supported enables me to bear up even against your possible view of the case and his lordships possible opinion to a divine of unblemished life it is i confess inexpressibly painful to be confused with forgers and highwaymen lastly the gallant captain spoke of himself this he said with a front of brass is a case of most unfortunate resemblance it appears that i bear some likeness to a certain notorious robber and highwayman called it is said the captain here the whole court burst into laughter so unabashed was the villain when he pronounced these words he looked round him with affected wonder the event of this trial however he went on matters but little because in two or three weeks i can bring to town the mayor and alderman the town clerk the rector of the church and the master of the grammar school of my native town to testify that i am what i have declared myself to be this being so gentlemen you may proceed if you please to do your duty the judge then summed up he went through the whole case adopting the views of the counsel for the prosecution he said that the evidence before him was practically unshaken it showed that these men who had pretended to know nothing of each other were in fact banded and allied togetherin short he gave the whole weight of his opinion against the prisoners indeed i cannot think what else he would do seeing the nature of the evidence so he left the jury to find their verdict they found it without leaving the box it was a verdict of guilty against all four prisoners i looked to see the judge assume the black cap to my surprise he did not he began by commenting in the strongest terms on the diabolical wickedness of the conspiracy he said that he could find no difference as to the respective guilt of one or the other the prisoner probus a member of a learned profession was the contriver or designer of the deed perhaps he might be thought the worst indeed his was a depth of infamy to which it was difficult to find a rival or an equal he would be punished worse than the rest because he would infallibly lose by his disgrace his profession and his practice the infamy of the prisoner merridew when one considered the hold that he had over a large number of criminals and rogues was very close to that of the prisoner probus he had apparently forced the other two into carrying out the plot on threat of informing against them in short he pronounced the sentence of the court namely that the prisoners should stand in pillory for an hour and then be imprisoned for the space of four years on hearing the sentence mr merridew shrieked aloud my lord he cried my lord have mercy they will murder me they led him off crying that he was a murdered man the doctor swelled out his cassock the archbishop he said will arrive i believe next week there will still be time for his grace to procure my release so rolling his head and squaring his sleeves he followed along the passage which leads to the prison i left the court and made my way through the crowd to the gates of newgate in order to tell jenny four years she said will more than suffice to ruin the man merridew his companies of thieves will be broken up he will no longer have any hold over them he will have to turn rogue himself when all has been said this is the greatest villain of them all i hope they will not maltreat the prisoners in pillory because there they are defenceless but a thieftakera thieftaker they cannot abide if i were mr merridew i should wish the job well over while we were discoursing there came a message from the captain would madame grant him the favour of speech with her he came in walking with his heavy clanking irons he had lost the braggart swagger which he assumed at the trial and now looked as humble as any pickpocket about to undergo the discipline of the pump madame he said i thank you for this favour your trial is over captain i hear it is over he sighed mr halliday sir i hope you are satisfied i desire no revenge i said i want safety and peacenothing more these blessings you and your friends denied me it is quite true sir it was a most damnable plot the only excuse for me is that i had no choice but to comply and obey or be hanged captain i do not desire more of your company than is necessary will you tell me what you want of me the sentence ishe made a wry facepillory pillory madame and four years imprisonment but the four years will passwhat i fear is pillory i have heard of a mans friends protecting him mine will do what they can but madame my fear is not so much on my own account as that i may be put up on the same scaffold with mr merridew or mr probus there isnt a rogue in london who will not come out with something for the thieftaker madame no one knows the terror in which we poor robbers live the world envies us our lot they think it is glorious to ride out of a moonlight night and stop the coach all alone they dont know that the thieftaker is always behind the highwayman he lays his hand on the largest share of the swag he encourages lads to take the roads and whenever he wants money he says that the time is up and then he takes the reward my time was up i know all thisunhappilyas well as you what do you want me to do mr probushe will prove quite as unpopular as merridew they thirst for his blood there will be murder done in the pillory madame for the love of god do something for me what you have great influence everybody knows what powerful friends you have make them put the two unpopular prisoners on the same scaffold they will share the flints between them let me stand up beside the bishop nobody will give us much more than a dead cat or two and a basket of rotten eggs but the other twohe shivered with cold terrori know not what will happen to them well captain perhaps if merridew gives up the profession you may possibly turn honest man again when you go out of this place he shook his head no that is impossible well i will do this the governor of the prison is civil to me i will ask him as a special favour to place you as you desire i hope that you boththe bishop as well as yourselfwill enjoy your short hour on that elevated position will give the captain a bottle of wine to take away with him you can go sir chapter xx the honours of the mob it was far from my intention to witness the reception of my friends in pillory from the sympathizing mob i was however reminded that the day had arrived by finding in my morning walk from lambeth to the old bailey the pillory itself actually erected in st martins lane somewhat above st martins church it was put up in the open space where long acre runs into st martins lane very nearly in the actual spot where the assault was delivered and the plot carried out a just retribution even now after thirty years only to think of the villainy causes my blood to boil nothing surely could be bad enough for these creatures vilest of all the vile creatures of this wicked town at the same time when i saw the preparations that were making for the reception of the criminals my heart sank and i would willingly have spared them all and forgiven them all to save them from what followed the pillory on a scaffold four feet high was put up with accommodationif we may so describe itfor two persons standing side by side so that they could not see each other they were also so close together that favours intended for the face of one might if they missed him be received by some part of the body of the other a vast crowd was already assembled although the sentence would not be carried out till eleven and it was then barely nine the crowd consisted of the scum and offscouring of the whole city there was a company from southwark while i was looking on they arrived marching in good form like soldiers there were contributions from turnmill street and hockleybythehole there were detachments from the riverside from st katherines by the tower from clerkenwell but above all from st giless who is to stand up there today i asked one of thema more decentlooking man than most of course i knew very well but i wished to find out what the people intended where do you come from not to know that the man replied tis the thieftaker him that makes the rogue teaches the rogue and then sells the rogue now weve got himwait till we leave him and theres the lawyer who made the plot to hang a man weve got him too we dont often get a lawyer wait a bitwait a bit you shall see what theyll look like when we leave them he had his apron full of something or otherrotten eggs perhaps or rotten apples or perhaps brickbats the faces of all around expressed the same deadly look of revenge i thought of the captains terror and of his petition to jenny that he might be put up with the bishop it was impossible not to feel awed and terrified at the aspect of so much hatred and such deliberate preparation for revenge a thieftaker and a lawyer oh noble opportunity some carried baskets filled with missiles some had their aprons full the women for their part brought rotten eggs and dead cats stinking rabbits and all kinds of putrid offal in baskets and in their arms as if they had been things precious and costly they conferred together and laughed grimly telling what they had to throw and how they would throw it i dont waste my basket said one on rotten eggs theres something here sharper than rotten eggs he took my man before his time was up because he wanted the money my man was honest before he met merridew who made him a rogue poor ladyes made himtold him what to dotaught him made him a highwayman told him where to go hired a horse for him and gave him a pistol then he sold himgot forty pounds and a tyburn ticket for him and twenty pounds allowance for his own horse oh if my arm is strong enough let me get near himclose to him good people he took my son said another to be sure he was a rogue but he thieved in a safe way till john merridew got him if i had my strength that i used to have it wouldnt be rotten eggs but never mindtheres others besides me dont waste your brickbats throw straight let the women get to the front oh he shall look very pretty when he is carried home he shall have a pleasant hour with his friends we love him dont we we love him like a son we do this man had for years exercised absolute sway over rogueland he instructed the young in the various branches of the criminals horrid trade he led them on from pocketpicking to stealing from stalls and bulkheads to shoplifting to burglary to robbery in the street to forgery to coining and issuing false coin to highway robbery and at times to murder twas the most accomplished and the most desperate villain that ever livedi cannot believe that his like was ever known no one dared to cross him or to refuse his orders if anyone should be so presumptuous he speedily repented in newgate under a capital charge followed by a capital sentence there are so many ways of getting hanged and so few outside the law know what offences may be capital and what are not that there was never any certainty in the mind of the smallest rogue that he was safe from such a charge children of fourteen on his information were hung as well as grown men little girls of fourteen were hung on his information as well as grown women for shoplifting for lifting linen from the hedgewhy this devil incarnate would instigate a child to commit a capital offence and then give him into custody for the reward careless whether the child was hanged or not it was a terrible end that he met with i read sometimes of dreadful punishments of tortures and agonies yet i cannot picture to myself a punishment more awful than to stand up before an infuriated and implacable mob to look down upon thousands of faces and to see no gleam of relenting upon one not one with a tear of pity to hear their yells of execration to see their arms springing up with one consentpoor wretch poor wretch these people knew very well that mr merridew could hang them all that in course of time he would hang them all and that if they offended him he would hang them all at once it was a terrible weapon for one man to wield nor can i believe that the laws of the land intended that any one man should be able to wield such a weapon why they allowed him to exist i know notseeing their insensibility to crime one would think that they would have murdered him long before from wives he had taken their husbands from mothers their sons from girls their sweethearts he had taken their wives and their mistresses from the men he had taken the boysone cannot say the innocent boysfrom their playfellows and he had hanged them all it would be interesting to know how many he had hanged this murderous bloodstained villain whose heart was like the nether millstone for hardness the punishment of pillory hands a man over to the people for judgment and execution or for acquittal or for pardon the law says practically we find him guilty we assign him a term of imprisonment it is for the people to increase the punishment or to protest against it in the case of a common rogue whose offence is in no way remarkable a few rotten eggs broken on his face and dropping yellow streams over the nose and cheeks please the mob who like this harmless demonstration in favour of virtue which does not hurt their friend and brother the prisoner in other cases where the sympathy of the people is entirely with the prisoner one hour of pillory means an hour of triumph for they bring bands of music and welcome the criminal they shout applause they hang the pillory with flowers they take out the horses and drag the carriage this happened to dr shebbeare who came to the pillory in the sheriffs carriage and stood in front of the pillory not in it a man holding an umbrella over his head the whole time to keep off the rain it is however the most terrible punishment that can be devised when the mob are infuriated with the prisoner in this case the thieftaker the manslayer was about to stand before them and with him the designer of a plot to take away the life of an innocent man the crowd now became so dense that it was impossible to get forwards or back therefore though it might seem revengeful to look on at the popular reception of these two wretches i was fain to stay where i was namely on the top step of slaughters coffee house the time passed quickly while i stood looking on and listening the crowd grew thicker on the outskirts with me were many respectable persons their indignation against the crime was like mine tempered by the prospect of the horrible punishment that awaited the evildoers i would not tell them that i myself was the object of this plot for fear of being considered as wishing to enjoy a revenge full and satisfying the greatest villain of the four said one gentleman is the attorney he will barely escape i think but these people are assembled to vent their revenge upon the thieftaker i know not whether when he is gone crime will decrease but it is time that something was done to prevent the encouragement of crime with one hand and the arrest of the criminal with the other such a wretch sir is not fit to live and said another unless i mistake we are here to witness the resolution of the mob that he shall no longer live at eleven oclock there was a shout which ran all down st martins lane here they come here they come followed by roars which were certainly not meant for applause and approval it is an awful moment said my next neighbour if i could get out of the throng i would go away it will be a terrible spectacle there was a force of constables round the pillory as it appeared immediately afterwards it was insufficient they formed a circle standing shoulder to shoulder to keep back the crowd and to preserve an open space round the scaffold it is a merciful plan because the greater the distance the better is the prisoners chance the prisoners were brought in a cart it was recognised by the crowd as a cart used for flogging unfortunates and there were jokes on the subject perhaps the hitching of shoulders as it passed it was guarded by a force of constables armed with clubs not that they feared a rescue but that they feared a rush of the crowd and the tearing of the prisoners to pieces i was standing i say on the highest doorstep of slaughters coffee house the windows of which were full of men looking on looking thus over the heads of the people i saw that the driver and the prisoner probus were covered already with filth and with rotten eggs the former cursed the people why cant you waityou he cried as the eggs flew about his head or broke upon his face mr probus sat on the bench bowed and doubled up he showed no fear he was as one who is utterly broken up and in despair he had lost his moneyall his money the work of his life that was all he cared for he was disgraced and imprisonedhe had lost his money he was going to be pelted in the pilloryhe had lost his moneynothing else mattered to a revengeful man this days work was revenge indeed ample and satisfying if revenge ever can satisfy i do not think it can one would want to repeat it every day the man in the italian poem who gnaws his enemys head can never have enough of his cruel and horrid revenge i hope however that no one will think that i rejoiced over sufferings terrors and pain unspeakable even though they were deserved if mr probus showed callousness and insensibility extraordinary his companion behaved in exactly an opposite manner for he had thrown himself down in the bottom of the cart and there lay writhing while the execrations of the people followed the cart when the procession arrived at the pillory it took six men to drag him out he covered his face with his hands he weptthe tears ran down his cheeks he clung to the constables it took a quarter of an hour before they had him up the steps and on the platform it took another ten minutes before he was placed in the machine his face turned towards the crowd on the north side with his helpless hands struck through the holes as for the other he stood facing the south when both the miserable men were ready the undersheriff and the constables ducked their heads and ran for their lives from the stage down the ladder and waited under cover for with a roar as of a hungry wild beast the mob began there was no formal or courteous commencement with rotten eggs and dead cats these things it is true were flung and with effect but from the very beginning they were accompanied by sharp flints stones and brickbats the mob broke through the line of constables and filled up the open space they pushed the women to the front i think they were mad they shrieked and yelled execrations the air was thick with missiles where did they come from there were neither pause nor cessation for the whole time the storm went on the undersheriff wanted i have heard to take down the men but no one would venture on the stage to release them meanwhile with both of them the yellow streams of broken eggs had given way to blood their faces and heads were covered every inchevery half inchwith open bleeding wounds their eyes were closed their heads held down as much as they could if they groaned if they shrieked if they prayed for mercy if they prayed for the mercy of heaven since from man there was none no one could hear in the babel of voices from the mob it was the thieftaker the manslayer who was the principal object of the crowds attention but they could not distinguish between the two and they soon threw at one head or the other impartially it was indeed a most dreadful spectacle of the popular justice just so the jews took out the man who worshipped false idols and the woman who was a witch and stoned them with stones so that they died for my own part i can never forget that sight of the two bowed heads at which a mob of i know not how many hundreds crowded together in a narrow street hurled everything that they could find round paving stones sharp flints broken bricks wooden logs with every kind of execration that the worst and lowest of the people can invent from the south and from the north there was an equal shower there was no difference for a whole hour this went on the pillory should have been turned every quarter of an hour but no one dared to mount the stage in order to turn itbesides it was safer to let one side exhaust their artillery than to tempt the unspent stores of the other side at last the hour of twelve struck there was a final discharge then all stopped the heads hung down inanimate motionless had the mob then killed them both the undersheriff mounted the stage one of the constables cleared it of the miscellaneous stuff lying at the feet of the prisoners then they took out the men both were senseless they were carried down the steps and placed in the cart the driver went to the horses head the constables closed in the show was over in five minutes the whole crowd had dispersed they had enjoyed the very rare chance of expressing their opinion upon a thieftaker and an attorney they went off in great spirits marching away in companies each in its own direction those from clare market i observed were headed by music peculiar to that district played by eight butchers with marrowbones and cleavers the horrid business over i thought i would learn how the other two fared in soho square the pillory was still standing when i got there but the business of the day was over from a gentleman who had been a spectator i learned that the two men were turned to the four quarters in the pillory that their friends on the st giless side would not pelt them but that on the other three sides they received a liberal allowance of eggs and such harmless gifts together with a more severe expression of opinion in stones and brickbats they were taken out wounded and bleeding but they could walk down the ladder and were carried off in their right senses at least i went on to newgate there i learned that the man merridew was already dead he was found dead in the cart when he was brought in it was not wonderful his skull was battered in his cheekbones were broken his jaw was fractured for the last halfhour it was thought he had been already senseless if not dead the case of mr probus was nearly as bad he was breathing they told me and no more it was doubtful if he would recover the captain and the bishop were as i have said more fortunate they escaped with scars which would disfigure them for life but they did escape and since their master the manslayer was dead they might begin again once out of prison with another rope much longer perhaps than the first i suppose they are long since hanged both of them no other lot was possible for them i have not seen them or heard of them since that day chapter xxi guilty my lord the days slipped away visitors came gazed and departed our attorney exhorted jenny every day to consider her decision and to prepare a defence consider madame he urged earnestly you will stand before a court already prepossessed by the knowledge of your history in your favour there will be no pressure of points against you it will be shown nay it is already well known that you have by your own unaided efforts defeated a most odious conspiracy and made it possible for the conspirators to be brought to justice this fact further assigns reasons and motives for the persecution and the malignity of their friends i am prepared to show that at the time when you are charged with receiving stolen property you were occupying a fine position that you were solvent because you were receiving large sums of money that you were the last person to be tempted even to receive stolen goods especially those of a mean and worthless character those who might otherwise be ready to perjure themselves against you will be afraid to speak since this last business you have this protection brought about by your own action it will be impossible to prove that you had any knowledge of the property found on your premises all that is true yet dear sir i cannot change my mind it is so true that i cannot believe it possible under the circumstances for a jury to convict you are also madame which is a very important feature in the case possessed of a face and form whose loveliness alone proclaims your innocence oh sir if loveliness had aught to do with justice but could i even then rely upon that claim let me instruct counsel he will brush aside the evidence good heavens what evidence a woman swears that she saw the property carried into your house during the whole of a certain night that is quite possible certain shopkeepers have been found to swear to some of the articles found in your rooms as their own how do they know one bale of goods is like another that kind of evidence is worth very little but if the things are theirs how are you to be connected with them i shall prove that you lived in a great house with many servants that it was quite easy to carry things in and out of that house without your knowledge i shall call your servants who will swear that they know nothing of any such conveyance of goods i will prepare a defence for you in which you will state that you had no knowledge of these things nor do you know when or by whom they were brought into the house you will point to your troop of servants including footmen waiters carvers cooks butlers and women of all kinds you will ask if a manager of any place of entertainment is to be held responsible for what was brought under his roofthat you were not in want of money and that if you were the rubbish lying in your garrets would be of no use to you and so on there could not possibly be found a better defence i know one better still said jenny quietly tell me what it is then i have already told you once more then my mother has long been notorious as a receiver of stolen goods the people used to bring their plunder to the black jack by a back entrance under the house there are stone vaults and a great deal of property can be stored there when i understood that we should want the evidence of my mother i was obliged to offer her a large sum of money as a bribe before she would consent when she found that i would give no more she accepted my offer but on conditions remember she said none of us will ever be able to show our faces at the black jack any more we should be murdered for sure for going against our own people well said mr dewberry doubtless she was right but what were the conditions they were connected with the stolen goods the vaults contained a great deal of property which could not be sold at once if i would suffer her to store that property in my house she would consent sir at that time and in order to defeat those villains i would have consented to anything it was agreed that my mother and sister should move the things by night after the black jack was shut up i suppose the woman watched so you see unfortunately i did consent without thinking you did consentoh he groaned but after all your mother and sister will not give evidence where is the evidence of your consent are they out of sight good let them keep out of sight but there is more dear sir you will say i am very imprudent when it was arranged for my mother to go away after the trial and lie snug for awhile she could not bear to think of losing all her property and sostill without thinking of consequencesi bought the whole lot you bought oh this indeed i did not expect you bought the whole however one comfort no one knows except your mother and my sister now sir doll will not allow my mother to suffer alone if she is accused of receiving i shall be charged with buying the property i wish the mob had burned the place nobody can wish that more than myself now consider if i plead not guilty and am acquitted my mother will certainly be arrested there will be a hue and cry after her and i shall then be charged again with buying stolen property knowing it to be stolen no sir my mind is quite made up i shall plead guilty if the evidence is only what we know there will be no further inquiry after the property so at least my mother will be safe mr dewberry said nothing for a while would your mother he asked do as much for you i dare say she would we have our virtues we poor rogues sometimes he remonstrated with her he repeated over and over again his assurance that her defence was as perfect as a defence could be she could not be examined or crossexamined the evidence of the woman would be confined to one point it was all in vain she was obstinate i shall plead guilty she said finally he went away and left me alone with her jenny i said sometimes i believe you are mad so far as your own interests are concerned no willonly crafty now listen a little i have one firm strong powerful friendi mean lord brockenhurst if a woman wants a man to remain in love with her she must keep him off he knows all about me he says he has made up the prettiest tale possible and he actually believes it made up a tale jenny it was a very pretty story that he wrote called the case of clarinda this is a prettier story still it appears that i am the lost and stolen child of noble parents my birth is stamped upon my face never a gipsy yet was known to have light hair like mine and blue eyes like mine i have been brought up in ignorance of my parentage by a woman of dishonest character who stole me in infancy she made me against my wish for a person of my rank naturally loathes employment so menial an orange girl of drury lane theatre then i rose above that station by the possession of parts inherited and became an actress and the toast of the town the woman clung to her pretended daughter still then i left the stage in order to be married when i found my husband little better than a sordid gambler i left his house and opened the assemblyroom the woman for her own safety made unknown to me a storehouse of my garrets that is his story but the end is better still my true nobility of soul inherited from my unknown illustrious ancestors prompts me to plead guilty in order to save this pretended mother now will how does the story help because it has already got abroad because it will incline everybodys heart to get me saved yesbut an acquittal is so easy will you can never understand what it means to belong to such a family as mine suppose i get my acquittal thenafterwards what will follow afterwards do you think that they will let me return to the stage i must face the revenge of the familythe family of st giless through me the bishop and the captain have been put in pillory and are now in prison they belong to the familymy family and i have brought them to ruini myself one of themselves can they forgive me nay will i was brought up among them it is their only point of honour can i expect them to forgive me neveruntilunless she stopped and trembled unlesswhat unless i pay for it as i have made those two rogues pay for it unless i pass through the fiery furnace of trial and sentence even if it leads me to the condemned cell after that will i may perhaps look for forgiveness a man must be a stock or a stone not to be moved by such words as these oh jenny i said you have brought all this upon yourselffor me yes will for you and for yours i have counted the cost your life is worth it alland more dont think i never flinched no i had thoughts of letting everything go why should i imperil myselfmy lifeto defeat a villain it was easy to do nothing then one night i saw a ghostoh a real ghost it was alice and in her arms lay your boy jenny rose slowly the afternoon was turning into early evening the cell was already in twilight she rose and gradually so great is the power of an actress that even though my eyes were overcast i saw the narrow cell no longer there was no jenny in her place stood another woman it was alice in the arms of that spirit lay the semblance of a child and the spirit spoke it was the voice of alice woman she said solemnly give me back my husband give the boy the honour of his father murderess thou wouldst kill the father and ruin the son there shall be no peace or rest or quiet for thee to the end save himfor thou must suffer and endure what follows thou shalt suffer but thou shalt not be destroyed alice spoke it was as if she came there with intent to say those words then she vanished and with a trembling of great fear even as saul trembled when he saw the spirit of samuel i saw jenny standing in the place where alice had been she fell into her chair she burst into tearsthe first and the last that ever i saw upon her cheek she covered her face with her hands i soothed her i assured her of all that i could say in gratitude infinite perhaps i mingled my tears with hers oh will she cried do not vex yourself over the fate of an orangewench what does it matter for such a creature as myself the old bailey never witnessed a greater crowd than that which filled the court to witness the trial of mistress jenny wilmot charged with receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen her assumed name of madame vallance was forgotten her married name of halliday was forgotten on everybodys tongue she was jenny wilmot the actress jenny wilmot the toast of the town jenny wilmot of drury lane they spoke of her beauty her grace her vivacity these were still remembered in spite of her absence from the stage of nearly two years now two years is a long time for an actress unless she is very good indeed to be remembered but the case of clarinda was by this time known to every club and coffeehouse in london not a city clerk or shopman but had the story pat with oaths and sighs and tears my lord brockenhurst had done his share in changing public opinion and the later story that of the noble origin of the stolen girl was also whispered from mouth to mouth the court i say was crowded behind the chairs of the lord mayor and judge the aldermen and the sheriffs were other chairs filled with great ladies the public gallery was also filled with ladies who were admitted by tickets issued by sheriffs the entrances and doorways and the body of the court were filled with gentlemen actors and actresses mixed with an evillooking and evilsmelling company from st giless the witnesses among whom i failed to observe the revengeful woman consisted i was pleased to see of no more than the two or three shopkeepers who were waiting to swear to their own property they stood beside the witnessbox wearing the look of determined and pleased revenge common to those who have been robbed the jury were sworn one after the other and took their seats i could not fail to observe that the unrelenting faces with which they had received me the highwayman were changed into faces of sweet commiseration if ever jury betrayed by outward signs a full intention beforehand of bringing in a verdict of not guilty with the addition if the judge would allow it that the lady left the dock without a blemish upon her character it was that juryyet a jury composed entirely of persons engaged in trade who would naturally be severe upon the crime of receiving stolen goods when the court were ready to take their places the prisoner was brought in and all the people murmured with astonishment and admiration and pity for the prisoner was dressed as for her wedding day she was all in white without a touch of any other colour her lovely fair hair was dressed without powder over a high cushion with white silk ribbons hanging to her shoulders her white silk frock drawn back in front showed a white satin petticoat white silk gloves covered her hands and arms she carried a nosegay of white jonquils a necklace of pearls hung round her neck her belt was of worked silver she took her place in the dock she disposed her flowers between the spikes among the sprigs of rue her air was calm and collected not boastful sad as was natural resigned as was becoming neither bold nor shrinking there was no affectation of confidence nor any agitation of terror she was like a queen she was full of dignity she seemed to say look at me all of you can you believe that iiisuch as ijenny wilmotcould actually stoop to receive a lot of stolen rags and old petticoats and bales of stuff worth no more altogether than two or three guineas during the whole time of the trial the eyes of everybody in court i observed were turned upon the prisoner never before i am sure did a more lovely prisoner stand in the dock never was there one whose position was more commiserated they were all i verily believe ready to set her free at once but for the act and deed of the prisoner herself her attitude her face her dress all proclaimed aloud the words which i have written down above everybody had seen her on the stage playing principally the coquette the woman of fashion and folly the hoyden the affected prudebut not a part like this ye gods i heard a young barrister exclaim she looks like an angel an angel sent down to newgate the strange new unexpected look of virginal innocence stamped on the brow of the once daring and headlong actress startled the people it went to the heart of everyone it made everybody present feel that they were assisting at a martyrdom nay as if they were themselves unwillingly bringing faggots to pile the fire before the trial began many an eye was dim many a cheek was humid the court entered the people rose the counsel bowed to the bench the lord mayor took his seat beside him the judge with him the aldermen and the sheriffs the prisoner also did reverence to the court like a gentlewoman receiving company one would not have been surprised had my lord mayor stepped down and kissed her on the cheek in city fashion but neither in her look nor in her actions was there betrayed the least sign of degradation fear or shame when a somewhat lengthy indictment had been read she raised her head my lord i would first desire to ask for my name to be amended what amendment do you desire i am described as madame vallance alias jenny wilmot actress it is true that jenny wilmot was my maiden name and that i assumed the name of madame vallance when i left the stage and opened the assembly rooms my true name is jenny halliday and i am the wife of mr matthew halliday son of sir peter halliday alderman and partner in the house of halliday brothers west india wharf by the steel yard in the parish of all hallows the great the judge whom nothing could surprise answered with the awful coldness which becomes a judge and so terrifies a prisoner there is no dispute concerning identity plead in your married name if you will then my lord i plead guilty she had done it then with a case so strong with an assurance of acquittal she had pleaded guilty my heart sank yet i knew what she would do the lord mayor whispered the judge again you are ignorant of law and procedure in courts of justice he said i will allow you to withdraw that plea have you no counsel i need none my lord i plead guilty the people all held their breath then the case of clarinda was true after all i am anxious the judge went on that you should have a fair trial appoint a counsel advise with him i plead guilty she repeated the judge threw himself back in his seat let the trial proceed he said the counsel for the prosecution opened the case it was he said a remarkable case because there seemed no sufficient reason or temptation for breaking the law or for receiving stolen property the information was laid by a woman living in the purlieus of st giless parish she was very probably a person of no character at all but character was not wanted in this case because her information would be supplemented by the evidence of several persons of the highest respectability who would swear to certain articles as their own property the woman in fact would depose to the conveyance of stolen goods to the house in question she gave information the goods were actually found there and other witnesses would claim as their own many things among the property so found gentlemen of the jury he went on this is a case of a painful nature the prisoner who pleads guiltywho rejects the clemencythe kindly benevolenceof the courtis a person who as you know a year or two ago was delighting the town by the vivacity of her acting and the beauty of her person she left the stage the world knew not why or what had become of her it now appears that she took a certain house in soho square where she carried on assemblies masquerades and other amusements still delighting the town there is nothing to make one believe that she was in pecuniary embarrassments and we now learn that she is actually the wife of a city merchant of great wealth and reputation here his neighbour hurriedly wrote something on a paper and handed it to him my learned friend he said correcting himself informs me that this house until recently in the highest repute has fallen into evil times and is now bankrupt but gentlemen whether the prisoner attempted to stave off her husbands bankruptcy or not the property which she received was of so trifling a character that it would seem as if she was breaking the law for the sake of a few shillings the things found in her possession were not those which we are accustomed to regard as the booty of robbers there are no jewels gold chains silver cups lace silks or anything at all but things belonging to poor people or to people just raised above poverty there are womens petticoats mens nightcaps watches in tortoiseshell cases knives and forks small spoons handkerchiefs stockings even wigs and so forth i expected i confess when i surveyed this rubbish to hear a defence on the ground that such a person in a position so responsiblewith friends so numerous some of them of high rank could not condescend to countenance the mean and sordid traffic i confess that i looked forward to this trial as a means of finding out the real criminal who had taken advantage of access to the house and impudently used the rooms in madame vallances premises for their own dishonest purposes that expectation must be now disappointed that hope must be abandoned by her own repeated confession the prisoner has assured the court that she is guilty the case he went on has grown out of one recently heard before this court it was one in which the present prisoner exerted herself very actively in the cause of a man named halliday presumably a connection of her own by marriage halliday was charged with highway robbery the evidence was clear and direct the prisoner before us however with great activity and courage brought together an overwhelming mass of evidence which proved that the charge was a conspiracy of the blackest and foulest kind the conspirators are now undergoing their sentence by this brave action an innocent life was saved and four villains were sent to prison i mention the fact because it shows that the prisoner possesses many noble qualities which make it the more marvellous that she should be guilty of acts so mean so paltry so sordid the woman who will appear before you was the mistress of one of these conspirators her information was doubtless laid as an act of revenge yet we cannot weigh motives and so on it appeared that the evidence was of a merely formal character and that the witnesses would not be crossexamined the first witness was the woman of whom you know she among other women prisoners in newgate had been kept from starvation by jenny this fact might have softened her heart but unfortunately the recent sufferings of her lover in pillory reawakened her desire for revenge she was an eager witness she wanted to begin at once and to tell her tale her own way the main point now was a statement invented since her evidence before the magistrate she now declared that she herself was engaged by the prisoner to carry the property to the assembly rooms this abominable perjury she stoutly maintained the counsel for the prosecution questioned her apparently in order to elicit the facts in reality as i now believe in order to make her contradict herself she was asked where she put the things why in the garret what servants helped her who received her who carried candles for her why the prisoner selected her for the job what share she had in the riots whether she was in prison on that account and so on she was a poor ignorant creature thirsting for revenge therefore she maintained stoutly that the prisoner had paid her for moving the goods into her house whether by accident or design nothing was said about the black jack or about the landlady of that establishment i suppose that the prosecution was only anxious to establish the bare facts to which the prisoner had pleaded guilty the manner in which the witness gave her evidence the fire in her eyes and in her cheeks the dirty slovenly look of the woman her uncombed hair her voice her gestures her manifest perjuries and contradictions disgusted all who looked on the judge laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair as if what she said was of no concern the aldermen looked at the judge as much as to ask how long this was to be permitted the jury whispered and shook their heads the ladies present knotted their brows and fanned themselves and whispered each other angrily at last she sat down flaming and vehement to the end her evidence had in fact ruined the case why she had the impudence to allege that the property she had herself carried to the house was received by madame herself who ordered her footmen to carry it to the garrets she was followed by the shopkeepers who had been robbed they swore to certain goods of no great value which had been stolen from them their evidence was quickly given there was in fact no evidence really implicating the prisoner except that of the woman there was clearly something behind something not explained which everybody was whispering to each otherit had been revealed in the famous paper called the case of clarinda and now i understood what jenny meant when she said that her defence would bring her mother into the business for counsel would have inquired into the black jack story and asked what the things were doing there how they came there who was the landlord with many other particulars some of which would have brought out the truth as for the woman whether by feminine cunning or by accident she concealed the relationship between jenny and the black jack she had really seen the sister and the mother carrying things to the house in soho square she did not then know that madame vallance was jenny she found out the fact at the trial she then invented the story of being hired for carrying the property because she knew it was there all that the court knew however was the fact that such a woman as stood before them this angel of loveliness this woman of position had actually confessed to the crime of receiving the miserable odds and endsthe rags and tawdry finerystolen from quite poor people it was amazing it was incredible that is my case my lord said the counsel with a sigh as if he was ashamed of having conducted it at all prisoner at the bar said the judge you have heard the verdict of the jury you may now say anything you wish in explanation or extenuation what can i have to say my lord she replied simply but with dignity since i pleaded guilty nevertheless i have to thank the counsel for the prosecution who almost proved my pleading impossible the judge summed up in a few words the verdict of the jury included a recommendation to mercy the judge assumed the black cap he pronounced sentence of death the ordinary appeared in his robes and prayed that the lord would have mercy on her soul the warder tied the usual slip of string about the prisoners thumb to show what hanging meant the only person unaffected by the sentence was the prisoner herself never before had she acted so finely never before indeed had jenny been called upon to play such a part she stood with clasped hands gazing into the face of the judge not with defiance not with wonder not with resentment but with a meek acceptance the women in the court the great ladies behind the lord mayor wept and sobbed without restraint even the younger members of the outer bar were affected to unmanly humidity of the eyes now when the verdict of the jury was pronounced and before the sentence of the judge jenny did a strange thing which moved the people almost more than the words of the sentence she took up a small roll which lay before her it was a black lace veil she threw this over her head it fell down upon her shoulders nearly to her waist she held it up while the judge was speaking when he finished she dropped it over her face so with the veil of death falling over her spotless robes of innocence she stepped down from the dock and followed the men in blue back to the prison ye gods cried one of the barristers she is nothing less than the virgin martyr indeed she seemed nothing less than one of the christian martyrs the confessors faithful to the end whom no tortures and no punishment could turn aside from the path of martyrdom i hurried round to the prison ah sir sighed a turnkey she must now go to the condemned cell pity pity they were all her friendsevery one of these officers hardened by years of daily contact with the scum of the people but they wont hang her they cant and all for her mother said another i remember old sal of the black jack also her sister dolly all to save that fat old carrion carcass well well you can go in sir jenny was standing by the table she greeted me with a sad smile it is all over at last she said it is harder to play a part on a real stage than in a theatre did i play well will you left a house in tears jenny oh i cried impatiently is this what you wanted yes i am quite satisfied i really was afraid at one time that the counsel would throw up the case because his leading witness was so gross and impudent a liar didst ever hear a woman perjure herself so roundly and so often what next yes jenny what next i dont know will the assembly rooms which are taken in my name are seized i hear by my husbands creditors but all the furniture and fittings have been destroyed already that is done with then am i to begin again in order to have everything seized again she talked as if her immediate enlargement was certain i could not have the heart to whisper discouragement there is still the stage jenny the world will welcome you back again do you think so the orange girl they could stand it pleased the pit to remember how they used to buy my oranges but the woman who has come out of a condemned cell the woman who pleaded guilty to receiving stolen goods i doubt it will what does that matter everybody knows why you pleaded guilty you are clarinda an audience at a theatre will sometimes shows neither pity nor consideration for an actress they say what they like they shout what they like they insult her as they pleasean actress is fair game to make an actress run off the stage in a flood of tears is what they delight in they would be pleased to ask what i have done with the stolen goods what will you do then jenny there came along at this point another visitor it was none other than the counsel for the prosecution he stood at the door of the cell but seeing me he hesitated come in sir said jenny you wish to speak to me speak this gentleman my husbands first cousin can hear all that you have to ask or i to reply madame he bowed as to a countess this is a wretched place for you i trust however that it will not be for long the recommendation of the jury will certainly have weight the judge is benevolently disposed you have many friends i hope sir that i have some friends who will not believe that i have bought a parcel of stolen petticoats your friends will stand by you of that i am certain madame i venture here to ask you if i may do so without the charge of impertinent curiositybelieve mei am not so actuated surely sir ask what you will i would ask you then why you pleaded guilty the case was certain from the outset to break down i might have pressed the witness as to the property itself but i refrained because her perjuries were manifest why then madameif i may askwhy perhaps i had learned that certain things had been sent to my garrets but i paid no thought to any risk or danger that might have been pleaded the case being over that property can bring no other person into trouble i believe i should think not the case is ended then sir i pray you to consider this question if some person very closely connected with yourself were actually guilty of this crime if you yourself were charged with it if your acquittal would lead to that persons conviction what would you do that is what they whisper he replied madame i hope that such a choice may never be made to me is this truewhat you suggestwhat people whisper many things are whispered concerning me said jenny proudly i do not heed those whispers well sir such a choice has been presented to me it is part of the penalty of my birth that such a choice could be possible then it is true he insisted the case of clarinda is true sir it is true in many points i was once an orange girl of drury lane my people were residents of st giless in the fields i was brought up in the courts and lanes of that quarter you sir are a lawyer need i explain further the nature of that choice madam said the lawyer i think you are the best woman in the world as you are the loveliest so saying he lifted her hand to his lips bowing low and left us well said jenny i think i have done pretty well for my mother and for doll their slate is clean again they can begin fair receiving has been her principal trade so long that she is not likely to be satisfied with drawing beer but the past is wiped out and as for myself she sighed what next matthew is where the wicked can no longer trouble merridew poor wretch has also ceased from troubling my friends of st giless will be satisfied because i have now done what i told you i should do and gone through the fiery furnace why she looked around the bare and narrow walls i believe i am in it still but the flames do not burn nor does the hot air scorchbelieve me dear willoh believe mei would do it all againall againi regret nothingwill nothing assure alice that i would do it all againexactly as i have done with a full heart i left her what next what next chapter xxii from the condemned cell and now indeed began the time of endurance and suspense to the bravest of women came moments of depressionwhat else could be expected when her days and nights were spent in a condemned cell in this gloomy apartment jenny was now compelled to live the place lies in a corner of the womens yard or court it contains two rooms one of them a small bedroom the other when there are only one or two in residence a living room one other prisoner was already in this cell awaiting her time for execution alas she was a mere child not more than sixteen and looking younger a poor ignorant creature who had never learned the difference between right and wrong who had been brought up as was jenny herself among children of rogues themselves rogues from infancy the law was going to kill this child because the law itself had found no way to protect her alas for our humanity alas for our statesmen alas for our church will there never arise a prophet in the land to show us how much better it is to teach than to kill outside the yard was all day long filled with women either convicted or waiting to be tried some of them were in prison for short sentences some were waiting to be whipped some were waiting for ships to carry them to the plantations all alike were foul in language unwashed uncombed and draggled rough and coarse and common such women gathered together in one place make each other worse they swear like men they fight like men they drink like men their hair hangs loose over their shoulders the loose jumps of leather which they use for stays are never changed the ragged kerchief over their shoulders is never washed the linseywoolsey frock is foul with every kind of stain their loud harsh voices have no feminine softness their red brawny arms terrify the spectator in their faces even of the youngest is no look of venus taken to this place jenny had to wait expectant for the relief that was promised her by lord brockenhurst her cheek grew pale and thin her eyes became unnaturally bright i feared gaol fever but happily she was spared this dreadful malady yet she kept up the appearance of cheerfulness and greeted me every day with a smile that was never forced and a grasp that was never chilled for exercise jenny had the crowded yard there with no one to protect her she walked a little every morning the women falling back right and left to let her pass they offered her no molestation to save her fancy manso ran the legendshe had compassed the ruin of her old friends with this object twas the only one they could understand she put up her mother to bear witness against her own customers well it was to save her fancy manthe same came every day to see her in the prison that was some excuse for her would not any woman do as much for her man and now she was herself condemned all through the other woman whose man she had put in prison and in pillory so far then they were quits and might all become friends again and they remembered as a point in jennys favour that the noble welcome with which the thieftaker was receiveda thing at which all roguery rejoicedwas entirely due to her exertions these things passed from one to the other clothed in the language peculiar to such people jenny took two or three turns in the yard every morning when the prison air is freshest and then went back to her cell where she remained for the rest of the day in those days she talked to me more freely than before and a great deal about herself she was forced to talk and to think about herself for the first time in her life her thoughts went back to the past when all she could expect was to become such as the poor creatures with her in the prison yet these poor women whom i found so terrible to look upon and to hear she regarded with a tenderness which i thought excessive i now understand that it was more humane than at that time was within my comprehension they are not terrible to me she said i know themwhat they are and what has made them so i can speak their language but i must not let them know that i understand it is the thieves tongue made up of gipsy and of tinkers talk they talk about me all dayeven when i am in their midst poor wretches they are not so bad as they look nay jenny but to see them beside you if we grow up among people will and are used to them we do not think much of their manners and their looks when i was a child i played among them many a cuff have i had many a slap for getting in their way but many a bit of gingerbread and many an apple you think them terrible if they were clean and had their hair dressed they would not be terrible any longer oh will they are not very far from the fine ladiesnonor so very much below the best of good women even alice they are women though you flog them at bridewell and hang them at tyburnthey are still women and they lovein their poor fond faithful waythe very hand that knocks them down and the very foot that kicks them they loveoh the poor womenthey love she broke off with a sob in her voice i marvelled at the time because i had always looked upon the creatures as something below humanity as belonging to a tribe of savages such as swift called the yahoos afterwards i understood and then i marvelled more another time she talked about her profession as an actress acting she said cannot be otherwise than delightfulbut it takes an actor away from himself when one has been two or three years on the stage nothing is left but the stage and the dressingroom the company behind the scenes and the audience in front nothing is real everything that happens is but a scene in a play when the curtain drops upon this act that is when they let me go i shall rest for five minutes while the next act is getting ready the play of clarinda or the orange girl has some excellent scenes you remember that scene when the mob wrecked the house and the scene when the mob pelted mr merridewwell i should not be in the least surprised to meet mr merridew himself walking along holborn with one eye on a young thief in training for a shoplifter and i might look in at the black jack and see my mother taking her morning dram and doll adding up the scores upon the slate in five minutes after the curtain has dropped what has happened is little more to me than the last scene in the play at drury why if i were put into the cart and carried out to tyburn i should still be the heroine playing my part to a breathless house and i believe i should enjoy that part of the performance as much as anything you saw how i played the virgin martyr in court yet this is real enough god knows i said looking round the place i dare say it looks so to you to me it is part of the play will the play is nearly over i knew all along that disaster was coming upon me but the worst is overthe worst is over i know that the worst is over i can now foretell what is coming next she looked straight before her her eyes luminous in the dark cell i can see she said a time of peace and calm well will reality or not that scene will be pleasant i shall go out of this place very soonbut i know not when and i cannot see myself at any time again upon the boards of drury i am certain that i shall never go back there i cannot see myself in soho square either i shall never go back there i see fields and hills and woodsshe shuddered and with a gesture pushed the vision from her willit is strange all is strange it is a beautiful country but i know it noti cannot understand it it was not the first time as you have seen that she showed this strange power of peering into the future whether this fairhaired and blueeyed woman was really a child of the gipsies or as lord brockenhurst conjectured a stolen child she had the powers that we commonly find in gipsy women who are fortunetellers all the world over that she compelled all men to become her servants you have seen that she could also compel women to follow and obey her was proved by what she did during that three or four weeks which she spent in the condemned cell the same magic artsyet she was no witch and she could read the futurea gift which is marvellous in our eyes her power over others even the most savage people was shown by the changed behaviour of the poor girl waiting for execution i have mentioned her she was at first a wild creature she fled to the darkest corner of the cell and there crouched with eyes of suspicion and terror she snatched her food and ran into her corner to eat it she was altogether unwashed and altogether in rags she was barefooted barelegged and barearmed her hair which should have been lightlike jennys own hair was matted with dirt it looked as if it had never known a comb yet long and beautiful hair her eyes were blue large and limpid she had never known kindness or love or care since the day when her mother was marched away to newgate wearing handcuffs she was i say a mere savage the child might have been sixteen but she looked thirteen still sixteen is young for tyburn jenny found this child in her cell condemned like herself and she tamed her not in a single day but in a few days she tamed her with kindness with soft words in the language which the child understood best with soft touches with gifts of pretty things i suppose she gave her sweetmeatsi know not what she did but in a few days i found the savage wild creature converted into a shy timid girlclinging to jenny and following her about like a favourite spaniel she was washed and combed and dressed from head to foot she wore stockings and shoes her hair just confined by a ribbon hung over her shoulders in lovely tresses she had become an interesting child who promised to grow into a lovely maiden and yet she was to be carried out to tyburn and there hanged then when the girl had assumed a civilized look jenny began to lament her approaching fate of which the poor creature seemed herself unconscious indeed i think the child understood nothing at her trial or her sentence except that she was horribly frightened and was carried out of court crying is it not terrible she asked that we must hang childrenignorant children it is the law of the land jenny judges have only to administer the law of the land then it is a cruel law and the judges ought to say so a man is a murderer who condemns a child to death even if it is the law without declaring against it nay jennythis she could not understand for the reasons i have already givenwe must remember that the children suffer for the sins of the fathers unto the third and fourth generation she stared why she said the poor child has been taught no better and indeed there seems no answer to this plea if in the mysteries of providence we must so suffer the law of men should not punish ignorance to hang children she insisted to destroy their lives before they have well begun and for what for taking something not their ownoh will it is monstrous just for a bit of clothonly a bit of cloth off a counter oh the poor child the poor child then just as she had spared no trouble to get me out of my danger so she now began to work for the rescue of this child she spoke to the governor about it he looked astonished children of fifteen or so were frequently executed for one offence or the other the law was doubtless severe but criminals of all kinds were multiplying after all they were out of the way when they were hanged this girl for instance would only grow up like the rest a plague and a curse to the community still he gave jenny advice and by her instruction i drew up a petition from the child herself addressed to no less a person than her gracious majesty the young queen who was said to have a kindly heart the petition with certain changes might almost have been that of jenny herself for her own case here is a piece of it your petitioner humbly submits that she was born and brought up in a part of london occupied entirely by thieves rogues and vagabonds that she was taught from infancy that the only way by which she could earn her daily bread was by stealing that the only art or trade she had ever learned was that of stealing without being detected that she was never at any school or church or under any kind of instruction whatever that she was never taught the meaning of right or wrong that she had learned no religion and no morals and knew not what they meant and that being caught in the act of stealing a piece of cloth value six shillings from a shop she is now lying under sentence of death to make a long story short jenny entrusted this petition to lord brockenhurst who generously interested himself in the girl and undertook that the petition should reach the hands of her majesty the queenwith the result as you shall presently hear that the girls life was spared this incident has nothing to do with the story save that it shows jennys generous nature and her good heart thus in the midst of her own anxieties to think of the troubles of others nay she not only saved the life of this girl but she brought her to a new mind and to new thoughts and whereas she had been before what you have seen she converted the child into a decent well conducted civil girl worthy of better thingseven to marry an honest man and to become the mother of stout lads and sturdy wenches let us consider how many lives might have been destroyed had they hanged this young girl i have sometimes calculated that if they hang a hundred women every year most of them young they deprive the country of five hundred children whose loss may mean the loss of two thousand five hundred grandchildren and so on can any country afford to lose so many valuable soldiers and sailors every year the number still mounting up why then cannot we take the children when they are still young out of roguery and place them in some house where they will be taught religion and morals and a craft at present the cry is all hang hang hang or flog flog flog so the soldiers and the sailors and the wretched women are tied up and flogged well nigh to death and the carts go rumbling along holborn loaded with the poor creatures on their way to be hanged but the rogues increase and multiply since hanging and flogging do no good cannot we try jennys method of kindness i say this writing many years afterwardsbecause at that time i did not understand the law of kindness which i now perceive to be the heavenly law of charity jenny who had no glimmer of religion poor thing in her quick way divined the law of charity why she changed even the women in the prison yard there was great suffering among them many of them had no friends to bring them food they had nothing but the daily dole of the penny loaf presently i observed that they looked more contented and better fed they were less noisy there was less quarrelling and fighting they were even cleaner to look at all this was jennys doing she fed them first then when their craving for food which made them quarrelsome was allayed she went among them and talked to them one at a time i have seen her i have seen how the rough coarse common creatures would respond little by little to words of kindness she advised them about their affairs she made them confess what they had done why was she not one of themselves i knew you she said to one long ago in hogs lane you lived in the old bell alley we were girls together come into my cell and i will find you something more to put on and your hair wants to be combed and put up doesnt it and your face would look so much better if it were washed come with me and so on with one after the other not the least case being the girl who had laid information and committed perjury against her it was what jenny saidthough the saying was then too hard for me they are women as are all men and women whether we call some yahoos or not they are women there is not such very great difference between the greatest lady and the lowest woman both are women both are ruled by the same irresistible forces of love some day perhaps some gentlewoman will put the part of the christian religioni mean the law of charityinto practice it is strange that a woman who was not a christian and had no religion should first teach me that charity means more than the giving of alms let me said jenny do something for these poor creatures while i am among them that will not be for long then they will fall back again into their own ways but jenny you are spending all your money an actress never wants money when i get out of this place i have made up my mind what to do i will not return to drury lane i will go over to dublin that is the strange country with hills and woods which i see before me always it is ireland i will go on the dublin stage as for the money i brought with me all there was in the house when i left it and all my jewelsbut they are not worth much these women have had some of the money and the turnkeys have had some and mr dewberry has had some and i think there is not much left the question of money pressed hard because i had none and as yet no new situation and when jenny was released she would certainly want money to carry her on she laughed seeing my seriousness oh willwill she said you are a musician and yet you are anxious about money but you were born in the city now in a theatre nobody thinks about money when the money is plenty it is freely lent when there is none it is freely borrowed believe me will i shall want no money i never have wanted money did i ever tell you will my own fortune an old gipsy woman told me what others envy she shall have what she would have she shall lack she shall pass through dangers without harm she shall be happy in the end yet not in the way she would most desire that is a strange fortune is it not now i am in the midst of dangers yet nothing will do me harm what do i most desire what do all women most desire you were born in the city will where they do not study the human heart therefore you know not the old woman was a witch as they all areall the gipsy womenso far i have had what others envyandalas will i still lack what most i desire what is it jenny ask your violin will ask your music ask the play upon the stage what women most desire oh foolish youth they ask what you have given to alicethey ask the happiness of love if the time was long to those who watched and waited it was worse for her who suffered i believe if i remember aright that our poor jenny spent five or perhaps six weeks in that noisome cell her cheek as i have said grew thin and pale from the bad air and the confinement but her courage she never lost for a single day she asked for no consolations and desired no soothing to alleviate the weariness of her prison of those fine ladies who called before she was tried not one came now nor did any of the actresses her old friends and rivals visit her they came before the trial just as they visit a notorious robber because it is interesting to gape upon a person who stands in the great danger of a trial for his life or has done some daring act of villainy or is about to undergo some terrible ordeal when her trial was over and it became certain in everybodys mind that although the woman had pleaded guilty although she was condemned she would not suffer the capital sentence the interest of the public in the case rapidly declined and in a few days ceased wholly the great ladies ran after other excitements they sent letters to the new singer they sent rings to their favourite actor they crowded the prison of the fashionable highwaymen the actresses for their part reflected that they would probably have jenny back among them before long casting them all in the shade so they left off calling the portrait painters went elsewhere after studies likely to be popular truly it was a lamentable instance of the breath of popular favour fickle and uncertain the case of clarinda was forgotten as soon as people had made up their minds that clarinda was not to be hanged although she had screened her mother and pleaded guilty and received sentence of death the only persons who now came to the cell were lord brockenhurst and mr dewberry the attorney not to speak of the governor of the prison who came daily to ask after his fair prisoners health his lordship let us know day by day concerning the efforts being made on jennys behalf the reason why they were so slow was partly due to a feeling on the part of the judge that though the motive of the prisoner might be good she had confessed to a heinous crime and the law must not be made ridiculous therefore a few weeks of prison should be allowed whatever was done afterwards in vindication of the majesty of the law but said lord brockenhurst he is at least on your side so much i know for a fact it is a great thing to have the judge on your side he also told us that the counsel for the prosecution a gentleman of great eminence in the law was also very active on our behalf that the jurymen had drawn up a petition and signed it unanimously for jennys pardon and release that the queen was also reported to be interested in the case and in favour of clemency the whole circumstances being so unusual and the behaviour of the prisoner so strangely actuated by filial affection even towards an unworthy object and that the general opinion of the people was that it was impossible to suppose that a woman in jennys position commanding receipts of thousands every night of a masquerade could condescend to so low and miserable a business as receiving a bundle of stolen goods not worth a couple of guineas altogether with the assistance of wretched confederates whose evidence might hang her and further that the minds of the people being made up they thought no more about the matter in a word that all was going well but we must wait he could not tell us how long and possess our souls in patience if only we do not die of gaol fever jenny sighed faugh to die in the reek and the stench of this place my lord i am always your most obliged servant perhaps the judge would consider his opinion and give me at least the choice of death let me die like my own people they lie down in a little tent which keeps off the cold rain and the hot sun on their backs they lie looking through the open front at the sky and the clouds and presently they shut their eyes and their limbs grow cold then they are buried in the hedge without coffin or windingsheet and without prayers said his lordship dear madame they are not your people there was never yet gipsy with fair hair and blue eyes you shall not die in a tent but in a bed with those who love you weeping over you and you shall be borne to a marble tomb in the church with the singing men and the boys chanting the service for the good of your soul the doctrine was unsound but the meaning of his lordship was good the good of my soul jenny repeated doubtfully well my lord i have at least learned something from the people who stole meif they did steal me i love the light and the sunshine and the wind restore me to these and i will promise never never never to have another mother who will tempt me with secondhand petticoats she laughed but lord brockenhurst who was a grave gentleman did not laugh madame he said kissing her fingersof which he never seemed to wearyi should desire nothing better than to lead you into meadows and beside gentle streams where the zephyrs would bring back their rosy hue to your pale cheek we must not speak of death but of life but not of love my lord she interrupted remember i have a husband he is in the kings bench prison a bankrupt there to remain for life because he can never hope to pay his debts but he is my husband of everything but love madame he replied with the dignity which sat upon him as naturally as grace sat upon jenny seriously i have a house some fifty miles from here it stands among deep woods beside a flowing stream behind it is a hill not terrible with crags but of a gentle ascent it has gardens and orchards around is a park with flocks of the timid deer not far off you may discover the tower of a village church and hear the music of the bells thither thither madame i will lead you when you are free from the misery of this place and there you shall stay till your spirits are restored and your mind recreated nay you shall stay there if you will so honour me all your life the house and all that belongs to it shall be your own i will be content if once in a while i may spend a day or two with you as your honoured guest oh my lord jenny made reply through her tears you are too good to me indeed i deserve none of this kindness you deserve allalldivine jennythat a man can offer believe me there is nothing that is too good or too great for such as jenny wilmot this dialogue was only one of many truly as jenny said here was a faithful and a loyal friend one more friend was found as faithful and as loyal but more humble you remember the country lad called jack who had fallen into merridews clutches and had already entered under his guidance upon the career of a rogue he it was who gave evidence which helped to connect all four plotters with the plot he it was also who carried off the old woman and doll by the waggon to horsham in sussex we thought no more about him he had done his service and had received his pay and had gone his own way the lad had an honest looka wholesome countrybred face different from the pale cheeks of the boys and the swollen faces of the men with whom he had begun to sit in a word he was not yet branded with the mark of cain but i say we had forgotten him he was one of the characters in the last scene but one of the play which we were performing with miss jenny wilmot of drury lane theatre as the heroine now one morning while i was playing something to please our prisoner in her cell the turnkey brought us a visitor it was none other than the country lad he stood at the open door and pulled his hair holding his hat in one hand your servant to command madame he said timidly pronouncing his words in the broad country manner which is too uncouth to be presented to eyes polite why cried jenny it is jack how fares it honest jack and so took him by the hand as if he was of her station jenny had no sense of what is due to rank and station why she said when i spoke to her about it we are all players in the same company and we all like speaking parts and how did you leave mother and doll she went on purely well madame they got out of the waggon about two miles from horsham at a tavern by the roadside it was shut up doll saw it mother she said it would do for us they wanted me to stay and if they could get the house i should be tapster and drawer but i thought i would go home so i left them and then you went home ayi went home but they didnt want me there and the parson talked about the whippingpost so i came away again and i found out where you were madame and i came to offer my humble services thank you kindly jack but what can i do with you here i will fetch and carry i want no wages but just to live let me stay with your ladyship he looked so earnest and so honest that jenny turned to me he might be useful i believe he is honest what say you will what could i say should i turn away a friend when we might want all the friends we could find how we were to keep our new servant was more than i knew however there he was upon our hands it was a kindly act of jenny when her fortunes were at their worst to take over this poor lad who was thrown upon the world without a tradesave that of rustic labourer which is useless in london without a character and without friends jennys consent saved himhe could remain honest vex not your soul about money will we shall want none there is always money when it is really wanted see how cheaply i live i cannot wear out my fine clothesindeed the mob has left me mighty few to wear i have no rent to pay nor any servants it is true that my money is nearly gone but there are still thingswellthings of which you know nothing and the judge who thinks so much about the majesty of the lawwill surely relent before long if he would come to see me i think i could soften his heart indeed you would jenny if it was of the hardness of the nether millstone chapter xxiii an unexpected event at this juncture the question of money became pressing for three months i had been out of a place jennys money of which she was so prodigal was coming to an end and although she hinted at other resources it became obvious to me that the attempt must be made to find employment i looked forward to another round of walking about the town day after day in fruitless search at this juncture however an event happened wholly unexpected which changed the position altogether both for myself and as it proved for jenny you have heard how i visited my cousin in the prison how i found him ragged and half starved and how i gave him five guineas from his wife which he instantly gambled away jenny sent him no more money nor did she speak of him again nor did i again visit him nor did i think upon him to think of one who had been my lifelong enemy served no purpose but to make me angry even now after thirty years when i have long since forgiven this poor deluded wretch ever running after a willothewisp i cannot think of what he did for mehow he made it impossible for my father to be reconciledwithout a momentary wrath boiling up in my heart still i say at thinking of my cousin matthew the pulse beats quicker the blood rises to my cheeks it is like a wound whose scar never vanishes though it may be hidden away i would not injure matthew if he were still living in the world but i cannot forget the old rule taught to children was that we must forget and forgive two boys fight and are reconciled the master flogs the boy who is then forgiven and his offence at once forgotten we all forget and forgive daily yet some things may not be forgotten the long years of continued persecution animosity misrepresentation and conspiracy against dear life i cannot forget though i have long since forgiven one evening mr ramage came to see me mr will he said i have called to tell you what you ought to know the alderman sir has i fear lost his wits his misfortunes have made him distracted he now dreams that he is living in a palace and that his riches have no limit he buys land he gives his daughters diamonds he founds almshouses if he believes all that he is surely happy i said this faithful servant shook his head there is a look in his eyes which belies his words he said i would rather see him wretched in his senses than happy without them how does he live he has a room on the masters side some of his old friends of the city send him a guinea every week his daughters pass the day with him he wants for nothing but mr willthe change the change and so his eyes filled with tears and he who would have been lord mayorlord mayornext year how do my cousins treat you if i was a dog and toothless they could not treat me worse because i gave that evidence the unfortunate alderman this was indeed a wretched ending to an honourable career i suppose that he knew nothing and suspected nothing of what was threatening and that the news of his wrecked fortunes fell upon him like a thunderbolt that some of his friends sent him a guinea a week showed that he was pitied rather than blamed for this wreck and ruin of a noble house poor old merchant and this after his aldermans pride and glory after being warden of his company after a long partnership in one of the oldest houses in the city fortune which used to put kings down and put kings up just by a turn of her wheel now makes rich merchants bankrupt and consigns aldermen to debtors prisons in order to bring home to all of useven the humble musicianthe uncertainty of human wealth his wits gone awandering a happiness for him a thing to be expected when at his age there had fallen upon him the thing which city merchants dread worse than death how can we help him i asked nay there is no help but pity and to bear the scorn of the young ladies as best one may do they know that matthew is in the prison with him no sir they do not know they do not inquire after mr matthew but it was of him sir that i came to speak it then appeared that since in every depth of misery there is a lower depth so the unfortunate man had sunk still lower since i last saw him he was absolutely destitute ragged starving even barefooted will said alice we must take him tomorrow what we can spare after all he is your cousin you must forgive him i would not harm him certainly alas silver and gold had we little out of our slender store we might spare two or three shillings and some provisions half a loaf a piece of cheese a piece of gammon a bottle of beer these things i carried over to the fleet prison in the morning i also carried over a warm coat which i could ill spare a pair of shoes and stockings a warm wrapper for the neck and a thick blanket i had no difficulty in finding matthew he sat in a bare and wretched room where on this cold day of january with a sharp frost outside there was no fire in the grate no curtains to the rattling windows no carpet no beds nothing but the hard planks to lie upon when night fell and the poor debtors could huddle together for such warmth as the halfstarved human body could afford there was a small benchi suppose it found its way there by accident matthew sat on that his feet under the bench his body bent his hands clasped i called him by name matthew he looked up he knew me he murmured something i know not what but it was unfriendly to the last he remained unfriendly i opened my bundle i took out my provisions and the bottle of beer he ate and drank enormously but without a word of thanks then i took out the stockings and the shoes and put them on tied the kerchief round his neck laid the thick blanket on the floor laid him on it and rolled it round him he was quite unresisting he was without gratitude he cursed but mechanically and as if he could say nothing else instead of getting warmer his teeth chattered and he shivered still i spoke to him again is there anything more i can do for you matthew you can go away he said articulate at last you can go away and leave me the sight of you makes me mad i have since thought that this might be a sign of repentance i will go away directly is there anything more i can do for you i want he said lifting his head and looking round i want to have my turn the last time i lost if you will find the man who won my coat and will send him here i shall be warm directly and i can have another turn ive lost a good deal somehow the lucks been against me always against me he lay back and shivered again though now he was wrapped up in the blanket with a warm coat on over his old rags he should have been quite warm i felt his forehead it was hot and dry matthew i said i think you are in some kind of fever shall i bring a doctor for you there are generally about a thousand people in this barrack men women and children yet they have not so much as an apothecary in the place outside there is the wise woman who knows the herbs and professes to cure all the diseases that flesh is heir to with a bundle of camomile feverfew or vervain she commonly lives in a court in fleet street there is the apothecary who has a shop full of drugs he despises the wise woman yet is not so much wiser than she is except in his own conceit there is the toothdrawer and there is the bonesetter but for physicians there are none his face now that the pains of cold and hunger were appeased looked gray and what the old women call drawn it is a bad sign had i known it but i did not i thought he was suffering from cold and hunger first and from some kind of fever brought on by privation you think he murmuredhis voice was sunk almost to a whisperto bring a mana murdererto make an endthat is your revenge but you shall not i will send to the warden for protection go away leave me alone i can do you no more harm i will have no doctor sent by you to poison me do you know matthew that probus received such terrible injuries in pillory that he will remain blind for the rest of his life blind he sat up eagerly repeating blind for the rest of his life ha then he will not be able to find me will he wanted to get you hungso as to be out of the way he was going to try next to get me hung then all the money would be his blind is he then he cant find me will the man is a devil now a blind devil a devil in the dark the thought seemed to revive and to comfort him the other man merridew was killed by the mob in pillory killedkilledby the mob i was afraid he was going to give me up for the reward then i am safe at last both of them out of the way now i shall prosper again yesyou are quite safe will he held out his hand dont bear malice dont give information against me i am not going to give any information against you but i could not take his hand for which i was afterwards sorry the information ought to be worth fifty pounds at least and a tyburn ticketa tyburn ticket he went on repeating the words over one after the other which showed the weakness of his condition it is useless setting down all the nonsense he talked after a while i left him and looked about for someone who would attend to him presently i found an old man in rags almost as bad as matthews who undertook to look after him and give him some food from time to time so i went away and repaired to my daily post at newgate again saying nothing to jenny about this illness i repeat that i had no thought of anything but what they call a feverish cold which would be checked by the warmth and the food you may therefore imagine my surprise when i went to visit the sick man in the morning to learn that he was dead he talked a lot of nonsense said the old man his nurse all day long he talked nonsense about murdering and hanging and dividing thousands now and then i gave him a bit and a sup and he went on talking there was no candle and i lay down beside him with a corner of his blanket over me and in the middle of the night i woke up and found that he had left off talking and was quite still and cold so i went to sleep again the insensate wretch had actually finished his sleep beside the corpse matthew was dead they showed me his body lying in a small shed against the wall it was laid in a shell of pinewood roughly painted black with no name or plate upon it it was to be taken across to the churchyard of st georges that afternoon to be laid in a paupers grave without mourners or friends and with a service hurriedly gabbled over his coffin the old man who had nursed him was now comfortably wrapped in the blanket and clothed in the coat and stockings which alice had sent for the use of the dead man i hope the things kept him warm matthew was dead at first i did not understand the difference it made to me i asked if he had left anything behind him any letters or papers or anything at all that his sisters might desire to have there was nothing absolutely nothing was left of him at all most of our lives are like the stones thrown in the water it makes circles widening and growing indistinct presently these signs vanish altogether then the stone is clean forgotten so the man and his life are clean forgotten never to be brought to mind again matthew left no circles even his was a stone that fell into the water silently and made no splash and left no mark upon the surface even for a minute he lived for eightandtwenty years he ruined an old and noble house of trade he lost all the wealth and possessions and money of the house he lost all the money he could borrow he plotted against me continually in order to get some of the money which might be mine he wilfully and deliberately deceived the woman who married him he died in a debtors prison without a single friend in the world or a single possession to bequeath to a single friend if he had one to die lying on the floorit would have been on the bare planks but for alice in the dark room without fire or light what more wretched end could one desire for his worst enemy what more miserable record could one set down against a man i could do nothing more i left the poor shell in the shed and passed over to the other side if my uncle could understand anything i had to communicate the sad news to him his only son was deadwhat a son what a life what a death the alderman was sitting before the fire with him sat his two daughters the guinea a week which was meant for him alone procured food for the two girls as well they passed the whole day i believe sitting thus before the fire in gloom and bitterness their bitterness was mostly directed against myself as the supposed cause of all their troubles cousin said one of them looking up you are not wanted here perhaps not i have come however to bring you news it is not good news i am sorry to say that one can see by the joy expressed in your face yet i did not feel joyful sir i addressed my uncle i bring you bad news he looked up and smiled vacuously you will find my brother sir on change i believe yes sir i would speak to you of matthew he is in the countinghouse or perhaps on board one of the ships or on the quay i turned to the daughters i see that he understands nothing no he eats and sleeps he talks nonsense it is no use speaking to him you have seen us in our shame and misery give us your news and go it is about matthew matthew where is he we heard he had escaped you do not know matthew has been in this prison for some weeks here in this prison and we have not see him he has been on the common side on the poor side perhaps that is the reason perhaps he did not know that they looked at each other then they burst into tears i thought they were natural tears such as a sister might shed over the loss of her brother but they were not oh they cried oh oh oh and now you will have the whole of that great fortune and we thought that you would die and that matthew would have it what a misfortune what a dreadful thing they wept and lamented capping each other in lamentations all to the effect that the fortune had fallen to the undeserving one and after all his plots and after his shameful trial before all the world and after his highway robbery and after the things that have been done to us and now that people will say that matthew died a pauperon the common side on the poor side we can never hold up our heads again so i left these dear creatures never could i understand why they attributed any one of their misfortunes to me nor of what nature were the plots to which they referred nor why my trial was shameful however i left these poor ladies the reduction in their circumstances their precarious condition their having nothing but the guinea a week given by the aldermans old friend the uncertainty of his life all should be considered when we think of their bitterness for my own part it was not until my cousins reminded me that i understood the great difference which the event made to me i was the survivor and my succession came to me in less than three years after my fathers death i was the survivor at a single step i rose from the condition of a simple fiddler at twentyfive or thirty shillings a week to the possession of a fortune of over a hundred thousand pounds i hastened to our trusty attorney mr dewberry i apprised him of what had happened he undertook to present my claims and to transfer the money to my name which he faithfully effected and without difficulty then i went on to newgate what is the matter will cried jenny you look strangely agitated jennyi took her hand and held ityou told me the other day that you were in no anxiety about money i never am will for people of parts there is always plenty of money you are a prophetess jenny you will never want for money so long as you live for all that i have is yours and i am rich you are rich over her face so quick to change there passed a cloud you are rich thenwill then if you are richi must bea widow is matthew dead he is dead jenny she sank into a chair she shed no tears she expressed no sorrow matthew is dead i wish i had never met himmatthew is dead he is dead jenny he died in the prison and i am a widow i am free again i am a widow who never was a wife will i would not speak ill of the deadof the unburied but alas i can find no good words to speak of him he can do no more harmeither to you or to me let us not speak of him then nowe must forget him as for this money will it is yoursyour ownyours and alicesand the lovely boys jennyall that we have is yours all that we have and more more gratitude and love and devotionwhich are more than gold chapter xxiv commutation at that very moment while we were trying to find words befitting the occasion which would not admit of grief yet demanded the respect due to death arrived the news so long expected the governor of the prison accompanied by our friend the counsel for the prosecution stood at the door followed by one of the turnkeys madame said the governor i come to bring you news but he looked so serious that my heart sank and i madame said the lawyer shall be pleased to add a codicil to this intelligence gentlemen i have already this morning received news enough for one day at least am i gentlemen ordered to adorn the next procession along the oxford road no madame the governor replied but i wish the news were more joyful i had hopedi had expectedconsidering the whole case i looked at jenny she turned suddenly pale i thought she was going to faint consider she had persuaded herself that a full and immediate pardon would be granted she had no doubt as to that point she did not faint she recovered and spoke with white lips and a hard forced voice tell me quick madame his majesty has graciously commuted the sentence into transportation to the plantations for the term of five years jenny made no reply i groaned aloud transportation to go out as a servant to be bought by a planter and made to work in the tobacco fields under the lash this for jenny all the world knew what transportation meant and what were the mercies served out to convicts the governor sighed and shook his head the lawyer took up the tale madame he said believe me everything has been done that could be done had you pleaded not guilty you would most certainly have been acquitted madame i know your reasons and i respect them you pleaded guilty your reasons were not such as could be laid before the king unless privately the judge in your case is a lawyer of great eminence that is to say he is jealous of the law he holds that above all things the law must be feared he is called a hanging judge being a most merciful man but the law must be respected there must not be one law for the rich rogue and another for the poor rogue rich or poor said jenny i am a rogue for having stolen nightcaps in my garrets and i am a rogue and a vagabond because i am an actress nay madame but the toast of the town the most lovely my loveliness does not stand me in much stead at this juncture tell me again i am to be shipped across seas i am to stay there five years i am to herd on board with the wretched women outside i am to work in the fields with them and with negroes i am to be whipped by my master i am to live on sweet potatoes i am to wear sacking for all my clothes gentlemen she added with flushed cheek go tell the king that i will not accept this mercy nay madame said the lawyer with persuasive tongue you go too fast those who have friends can evade the obligations of service you who have so many friends will find that you have nothing to fear beyond the voyage and a short residence in a pleasant climate for my own part dear madame i hope to see you before another year begins back upon the boards of drury lane with all the town at your feet i pine madame i languish for the first evening to arrive jenny i whispered for heavens sake be careful consider this gentleman cannot be deceiving you if there is as he says no real obligation to service and if as he says the sentence means only a short residence in a pleasant countrythen surely you must accept there is however the voyage perhaps sir i addressed the lawyer it will be possible for madame to take the voyage in a private cabin apart from the rest of thethe company it will certainly be possible she may take state rooms for herself and her maid she will be treated as a gentlewoman it is only a question of arrangement with the captain madame i assure you upon my honour that the sentence means no more than what i have stated it is a brief exile in which you will endure no other indignity than that of sailing on board the ship which carries a few scores of the wretches going out as slavesif one may call an englishman a slave jenny wavered her cheek was still red with shame and disappointment she wavered jenny i said taking her hand she sat down let it be then as you will that is bravely resolved said the governor and now i shall have the pleasure of removing you immediately from this close and confined chamber to one more airy and more commodious gentlemen said jenny still crestfallen i thank you both for your good intentions i should love you better if you would put a sword through me and so end it perhaps however the ship may go to the bottom let us hope so it must sink i am sure so heavy will be the heart of lead on board it so with renewed protestations of assistance and goodwill the lawyer went away with the governor in the yard i observed that he stopped and looked upon the crowd of women many of whom he would help to the gallows does such a lawyer always occupied in getting up and preparing a case so as to persuade a jury into a verdict of guilty ever feel remorse at having done so or repugnance at doing it again do the ghosts of those whom he has sent to the other world haunt his bedside at night one may as well ask if the judge who pronounces the sentence feels remorse or pity he is the mouth of the law the counsel feeds the mouth the governor of newgate is the arm of the law however that the counsel for the prosecution should take so much interest in the release of a prisoner is i should think without example in the history of newgate where they have never had before and can never have again a prisoner so lovely so attractive so interesting as jenny after him came another visitor it was my lord brockenhurst who brought us the news we had already heardbut with a difference madame he said after telling us what we had already heard i shall always regret that i was not the first to let you know indeed i have flown the commutation of the sentence involves a voyage that cannot be denied but there is no obligation to service that will be arranged for you i can undertake so much if necessary the voyage is no great matter six weeks if you are fortunate eight weeks at most will set you on shore the country is said to be beautiful the climate is healthy the virginians are mostly gentlemen of good family i thank you my lord for your kind words there is another thing madame i am empowered to assure you that the petition which you drew up for your young protegee here has been graciously received by her majesty the queen she has herself asked for the remission of the capital sentence the girls life will be spared this is good news at least on conditions which you must expect she will go with you to virginia for five years you can take her as your maid if you please with me for five years jenny repeated i know so little of what is ordered briefly madame a prisoner under sentence of transportation is engaged as a servant generally on a tobacco plantation where he works with the negroes if there should happen to be one among them of a superior class he becomes an accountant or even a manager or if he can command influence or money his engagement is merely nominal your engagement will be a form which i shall arrange for you this girl can remain with you when you come home you can bring her with you in five years noin much less timein a few months i am permitted on the highest authority to assure you that your banishment will be but short as soon as it can with decency be asked for a full pardon will be asked for and it will be granted you will then only have to return in order to delight your friends once more when shall i have to go a ship is now fitting out she sails in a week or a fortnight you will sail as a cabin passenger entrusted to the protection of the captain thethe otherpassengers will be confined between decks i believe my lord i am deeply touched by all your kindness madame i have done littlelittle indeed would it had been more i shall now with your permission make arrangements with the captain of the ship for your entertainment on the voyage and your reception on reaching the port so said jenny in one day i am deprived of my husband i am a widow who never was a wife i am deprived of my countrywhich is london and of all my friends his lordships face changed your husband madame is he dead he died last night let us not speak of him then you are free he glanced at me i saw his meaning and the purpose in his eyes you are free i stepped out leaving them together in a few minutes he came out with the look of one distracted and not knowing what he was doing or whither he went within the cell jenny was sitting at the table with red and tearful eyes that good and noble friend will would make me lady brockenhurst jennywhy not he would go with me he would marry me here and sail with me nonoi promised his sister what because i love a manthe best of menshould i give him children who would be ashamed of their mother and her origin mine would be a pretty history for them to learn would it not no will no believe me i love him too well even if he were a meaner man i could never bring my history to smirch the chronicles of a respectable family she was silent a little will she said presently looking up all that i foretold has proved true i want no money i am going out to a strange country it is not ireland as i thought it is virginia i see it again so plainso cleari shall know it when i land but i can see no farther there will be no return for me to drury lane my vision stops shortnow that i see yousomewherewith mei see alice also but i cannot see england or londonor the black jack or drury lane then we moved to the more commodious chamber where i soothed her spirits with a cup of tea which is better far than wine or cordials for the refreshment of the mind presently she began to recover a little from her disappointment it will be lonely at first she said without a single friend and i suppose that a transported convictsay that for me willit hath a strange sound it is like a slap in the facea transported convict nay jenny do not say it i must i say that though a transported convict must be despised yet i shall have my girl here with me and perhaps my lord will prove right and i may come home again yet i do not think so will there is one consolation at last i shall get clean away from my own people they used to congregate round the stagedoor of the theatre to congratulate their old friend on her success the orangegirls were never tired of claiming old friendship i married in order to get away from them but matthew never meant to keep his promisei am tired will of my own people they have made me suffer too much henceforth let them go and hang without any help from me it is high time jenny the act ends lamely perhaps it may be the last act of the play the ship leaves the quay on the deck stands the heroine in white satin waving her handkerchief the people weep the bosn blows his whistle the sailors stamp about the curtain falls will if things are realwhat am i to do when i get backif i do get back how am i to live jenny i said seriously i believe that one so good and so fearless for whom daily prayers are offered will be led by no will of her own into some way of peace and happiness think you so good cousin there spoke alice it is her language she says that beyond the stars are eyes that can see and hands that can lead why will for my people the only hand that leads is the hand of hunger the only hand that directs is the hand with the whip in it as for eyes that seeshe shook her head sadlyi wish there were she said perhaps there would then be some order in st giless and there would be some hope for the poor rogues oh willthe poor helpless ignorant miserable roguesof whom i am onea transported convicta transported convicthow we suffer how we die and pass away and are forgotten will will i go with a heavy hearti go to meet my death for never more shall i return where is the eye that sees oh willwhere is the hand that leads chapter xxv transportation in the evening when i left the prison it was with emotions strange and bewildering jenny who was to have received a free pardon was sent a selfaccused convict to the plantations to the plantations where they send the common rogues and villains she was to go out on board a convict ship counted happy because although one of that shameful company she was not kept below all the voyage on convict fare with those wretches vile and unspeakable and i was rich after all these troubles after my fathers displeasure after my disinheritance after my persecution and imprisonment i was rich and matthew the cause of all was dead truly the hand of the lord had been heavy upon them all matthew dying in starvation and misery mr probus lying in prison a pauper and blind merridew stoned to death the other two escaped with life but that was all but the innocent were suffering with the guilty the old man alderman languishing in a debtors prison with no hope of release and jenny a convict to be transported across the seas they did well to call it a voyage a short exile in a pleasant climate she was a convict she was under sentence and i was rich so i kept saying to myself as i walked home that evening so i kept saying to alice when i told her what had happened while we sat till late at night talking over these acts of providence we were to see her go far away across the oceana convict never perhaps to return to see her go alone save for her little maid in danger of wicked men of whom there are plenty over every part of the world perhaps in spite of what was said a servant even at her masters beck and call the woman to whom i owed more than life far more than life honour and the respect of the world and the happiness of my children and grandchildren yea even unto the third and fourth generation what was wealth where was its happiness when we had to think of jenny it was this woman i say who by her ready wit her generosity her fearlessness in the presence of risks certain and dangers inevitable made my innocence as clear as the noondays sun for this service shall her name be blessed among those who come after me and bear my name and are stimulated to deeds of honour by the thought that they come of an honourable stock think of the burden upon their lives had they been doomed to remember that their father or their grandfather before them had suffered a shameful death for highway robbery jenny saved mebut at what a price she braved the worst that the rogues her former friends could do to her she compelled her own people their own associates to betray them in order to prove my innocence she paid for the betrayal by prison trial and ruin she poured out her money like water in order that no doubt whatever should exist in the mind of the court or the jury as to the real character of the witnesses in return she endured the foul air and the foul companionship of newgate and a shameful transportation to virginia there to be set up if her sentence was carried out and sold as a slave for five years it was no common gratitudewe repeated over and over againthat we owed her for this service we owed her allallallthat we possessed or ever could possess but money cannot effect everything it could not in this case give jenny the full pardon and the immediate release we desired in the dead of night as i lay sleepless tortured in my mind because i could think of nothing that we could do for jenny who had done so much for us alice spoke to me sitting up in bed husband she said and then she fell to weeping for a while and it seemed as if she could not stop her crying and sobbingbut they were tears of prayer and praise let us talk it is yet night the world sleeps but the lord is awake let us talk so we talked i am heavy in my mind about that poor creature she began and i no less my dear we must not think that the innocent are punished with the guilty that old man the alderman is pulled down by his son they lie in ruin together but he is innocent for this reason he has been permitted to lose his wits and now feels nothing jenny suffers because though she is innocent in intention she is guilty in fact will if i think of that poor creature so good and generous and so selfdenying and of the company among whom she has lived and of the people among whom she was born and how she has no religion not the least sense of religion i think that this new business may be but the leading of the poor trembling soul to knowledge she is assured that before long she will be permitted to return perhaps she will not be permitted to return there is one who is higher than kings what would you do alice let us ask ourselves will what we are to do with our new riches i am but a homely body i cannot become a fine lady as for yourself remember my dear that you have been a musician playing for your livelihood at the dog and duck and you have stood your trial at the old bailey and you have been in a debtors prison and your fathers house is bankrupt and your name is held in contempt where formerly it was in honour where will you seek your new friends in the country but the quality despise a musician in the city they despise a musician much prisoner for debt more a bankrupt most i know not what is in your mind alice i am coming to it my dear remember once more what you said tonight that we owe her allallall your life your honour your sons pride in his father my life for the agony and the shame would have killed me oh will what can we do for her what can we give her in return for benefits and services such as these i will give her all i have my dear my whole fortune this new great fortune i will give her everything but you my dear and the boy money she does not want and it will not help her in this strait what then can we do we have gratitudeit is hers and our fortune it is hers if she will take it oh will be patient with me dear we can give her indeed all that we have we can give hershe bent over me and kissed me and her tears fell upon my foreheadwe can give her willourselves what we can give herourselves the whole of our lives we can become her servants in grateful thanks for all that she has done for us but how alice how consider she is going out to a new countryalone we know not into what company she may fall it is a rough country not yet fully settled i am told there are fierce indians and cruel snakes and wild beaststhough i fear the men worse than the beasts who will protect her she is beautiful and men are sometimes driven mad by beauty in women i began to understand let us go away with her to this new country where she shall be the mistress and we will be the servants they say it is a beautiful country with fine sunshine and fruits in plenty let us go with her will and protect her from dangers and teach her to forget the thieves kitchen and make her happy among the flowers and the woods we will turn her captivity into a holiday we will think of nothing in the world but to make her happy i have told you will what is in my mind and my dear i verily believe the lord himself has put it there i reflected for a little then i kissed her i am content my dear i said as you desire so shall it be we will go with jenny and become her servants as long as the duty shall be laid upon us and so we fell asleep and in the morning this thing seemed a dream but it was no dream then we had to begin our preparations it would be close on three weeks we learned before the ship the pride of ratcliffe would be ready to drop down the river i went on board and saw the captain he told us that lord brockenhurst had already engaged the best cabin for madame that although one of the convicts she was to be treated differently to be separated from the rest not to mix with them wherein he said grimly she is lucky indeed with her and in her cabin was to go another convict a young girl they were to mess in the captains cabin see he said what it is to be a friend of a noble lord i told him that the lady was a cousin of my own which disconcerted him however without many more words we came to an understanding i was to have a cabin for so much and the captain undertook to lay in provisions for us he was kind enough to draw up a list of the things we should require it appeared necessary for a passenger to america to buy up half the beeves and sheep of smithfield together with all the turkey geese and poultry of leadenhall not to speak of wine and rum enough for the whole crew he said that in bad weather so much of the livestock was destroyed that it was necessary to provide against these accidents so he prevailed and i think i kept the whole ships company with my stores the ship was of tons burden a stout wellbuilt ship with three masts not unlike one of my fathers west indiamen but inferior in tonnage she was slow it afterwards appeared generally doing from four knots an hour or about a hundred knots a day at such times as there was a favourable wind if the wind was unfavourable as generally happened her speed was much less as for the length of the voyage the captain reckoned that taking one voyage with another she would get across in six or eight weeks the uncertainty of the time as he pointed out as well as the possibility of storms called for the apparently vast quantity of provisions which he was laying in for our party and now began a busy time first i communicated our design to mr dewberry the attorney who entirely approved of it next i arranged with him for the safe investment of my new fortune as to which there was no difficulty at all as soon as the death of matthew had been duly proved and attested the amount which was originally l had now by the accumulation of the interest become over l which at five per cent produced the enormous income of l a yearmore than a hundred pounds a week what would we do with a hundred pounds a week mr dewberry laughed i have never yet he said found a rich man complaining of too much wealth for the most part he complains of poverty in a word mr halliday your wealth will before many months cease to be a burden to you but remember great as is this income even in the wealthy city of london and enormous as it will be in the distant land of virginia there are limits to the power even of such an income keep within it keep within it it matters not how we made this money safethat is as safe as money can be made there are stocks and shares in the national debt some of these were obtained and there were houses in the city which were bought in a few days my excellent attorney put my affairs in such order that i was enabled to leave england without fear and to be provided moreover with letters of credit by which i could draw for such money as might be necessary from time to time by this time our plans much talked about were matured we would purchase an estate as a plantation in virginia every estate is a plantation it would be probably a tobaccogrowing estate with its servants and slaves and buildings complete thither we would all go together and take up our abode letters were provided which i could present to responsible and honest merchants at baltimore by whose assistance i hoped to get what we desired and we resolved further to tell jenny nothing of these plans until we were all on board together the next thing was to find out what we should take out from the old country to the new it was reported that already they made nearly everything that was wanted such as furniture and things made out of the woods of the country which are various and excellent the things most in demand were reported to be knives tools and ironmongery of all kinds guns and weapons clothes of the better kind especially dresses for gentlewomen in silk and satin and embroidered work books music and musical instruments were also scarce i laid in a great stock of all these things they were packed in large chests bound in iron and sent on board as they were bought in getting these purchases and in procuring this information the days passed quickly because it was necessary as well that i should visit jenny every day a happy bustling time after all the trouble of the past it was pleasant to think of a new world opening before us with new hopes of happiness these hopes were realized i do not say that people are better in the new world than in the old everywhere are men selfseeking and grasping but there is less suffering less poverty and i believe none of such infernal wickedness as may be devised at home by men like probus and merridew such monstrous growths are not found in a new country where the population is thin and there is no place for villains to hide their heads the worst trouble in virginia in those days was with the convicts concerning whom i shall speak immediately while these preparations were going on jenny waited in newgate somewhat sadly lord brockenhurst came to visit her daily she had the girl whom she had saved for a maid the lad jack came every day to fetch and carry and do her bidding i said nothing to this fellow of our purpose one day however while he waited in the corridor outside the cell i called him in and spoke to him seriously jack i said tis known to thee that madame sails for america in a week or so ay sir and his face dropped what will you do jack there is the old company of the kitchen at the black jack if that is broken up they have gone to the spotted dog no sir he said stoutly i will be a rogue no more i have promised madame then there is the village you could go home again jack they will not have me then jack what will you do he held his hat in his hands and then with tears rolling down his cheeks he fell on his knees to jenny take me with you madame he said i will be your faithful servant to command only take me with you alas jack who am i that i should have a servant with me who shall be but a servant myself poor lad i cannot take thee by your leave jenny i said there will be a little maid to wait upon you and you will want jack to protect both you and her if you consent to take him he shall go but will you know the conditions i shall not be mistress even of myself that is provided did not lord brockenhurst promise lord brockenhurst will do what he can of that i have no doubt but as to his power across the atlantic of that i have grave doubts jenny i took her hand do you trust my word could i deceive you could i ever hold out hopes unless i knew that they were well grounded why will whom should i trust if not you then jenny listen and believe it is so arranged and provided that on landing in america you will be provided with a house fit for your station and with everything so long as you may stay in the country that a gentlewoman can require and all that you have or enjoy will be yoursyour ownand over all you shall be mistress dear willthis providing is your providing a manservant you must have to begin with negroes there are in plenty but an english manservantan honesthere i looked jack in the face he reddened and was confusedan honest strong capable faithful servant that you want jenny and that you must have and here he is i clapped the fellow on the shoulder as he still knelt before his mistress get up jack she said since it must be so it must but you must thank mr halliday and not me it was not a servant that she took out with her but a slave one of those willing slaves to whom their slavery is freedom who have no thoughts or desires of their own none but the thought how best to please their lords or ladies such servants are rare except those who have served in the army where duty is taught to be the first virtue at least said jenny i shall not be put ashore alone or among the gang of poor creatures with whom i ought to stand as a companion and indeed the prospect of this strong fellow to protect her at the outset caused her i was pleased to find no slight consolation yet i dared not tell her till it was too late to be altered the resolution which we had formed to go with her as well despite the injurious treatment of my two cousins i took it greatly to heart that the unfortunate alderman should for no fault of his own be condemned to imprisonment for the short remainder of his days he was past understanding where he was in imagination he rolled in his chariot from clapham common to the wharf and counting house he received the captains of the west indiamen he appeared on change he dined with his company he sat on the bench he walked in his garden he cut pineapples and grapes in his hothouses he was quite happy but there was the shame of knowing that he was there and that he was supported by the charity of his old friends accordingly i sought mr dewberrys advice and help there was now but little time to be lost a matter which made things easier because mr dewberry said so long as there was any chance of getting more by putting off the matter it would be put off in a word he called together the creditors they were fortunately a small body all those who had claims in respect to jennys liabilities were cut off by matthews death the debt of mr probus was also removed by his death because it was an account of monies borrowed by matthew privately there remained the debts of the house and these were due to merchants and to banks the creditors met therefore and i attended mr dewberry pointed out that my desire was the release of my uncle that the creditors had no claim upon me that anything i might offer with the view of attaining that object was a free and voluntary gift that if the creditors refused this gift they would never get anything at all and finally that they should consider that the poor man now in prison had not been a party to any of the transactions which led to the ruin of the house they asked half an hour to consider at the end of that time they offered to accept in full discharge of all claims two shillings in the pound i was advised to accept this offer it took nearly l out of my fortune in fact all the accumulations but i had the satisfaction before i left of releasing my uncle from his chamber in the loathed kings bench i knew how i should be received by my cousins but words break no bones besides i wished to release him so to speak with my own hands you are come again then said my elder cousin who for some reason unknown was much the more bitter of the two there is your handiwork gaze upon it she pointed to her father and exult exult on the whole i said i can this day at least exult in my work it is your doing none but yours if you had signed what he wished this misery would have been saved and you would have had quite as much as one in your beggarly trade could desire thank you cousin you are always kind to me you are my brothers murderer you have ruined my father she added i am anything you wish indeed i have no reply to make to such charges as these meantime i have come here today in order to release your father down below waits the attorney with his discharge in due form he is free you can take him out of the prison out of prison they both stared at me their eyes flashed the sudden joy of liberty seized them they sprang to their feet free he is free cried the younger father you are freedo you hear free he replied i have been free of the city for sixandthirty years free echoed the elder what is the good of freedom without the means of getting a living free let us stay here where at least we have a guinea a week your livelihood is provided for you will receive during your three lives the sum of three guineas paid weekly three guineas the younger caught my hand cousin will oh it is our living it is everything to us poor paupers will i doubt we have misjudged you her sister snatched her hand away dont touch him she cried dont speak to him three guineas a week the miserable pittance and he has thousandsthousandsthousands a yearher voice rose to a shriekwhich ought to have been our murdered brothers and our own one must never look for gratitude or even for reasonable recognition or for the courtesy of thanks but these words were really more shrewish and more bitter than one can endure however i made no reply and left them pleased at least that one of them could be moved to confessing her prejudice i know not what became of them nor have i ever heard tidings of them since that day one more addition was made to our party my brotherinlaw tom shirley came to me one morning with a serious faceserious at least for him will he said i have been thinking about my own concerns that is my wife has been thinking about them for me it is a great advantage for a man to give over that part of his business to his wife well tom she says if i remember right because she has been saying a good deal that so long as i am content to play first fiddle at the dog and duck for thirty shillings a week it matters not as we shall never get on and shall have to live in the rules all our life well will i would as lief live in the rules as out of them there is very good company in the rules almost as good as in the kings bench itself she is not content that you should always play the fiddle at that place and you are is that so for the patronage of aristocracy and the esteem of an audience of taste there is no equal to the dog and duck he replied gravely as if he meant what he said of the dirty disreputable haunt of prentices and their kind but i confess will that there are times when i consider my musical compositions and when i long for a wider popularity i think that i should like an opportunity to get my name better known at the dog and duck the noble audience doth not ask the name of the composer you would leave the rules if you could and go live at westminster where there are concerts and rich patrons well tom we are now rich we might manage that for you i believe he shook his head no best not waste good money i should only get back here again in a month or two my dear will if you only knew how difficult it is to refuse when things are offered on credit now in the rules no one has any credit so that we save all our money i never heard of toms saving any money however i asked him what he would have he would go with me but did they want music in virginia perhaps not now wait however till they have heard and seen me i believe there is no musical composer yet in the province i will be the first virginian musician i will be the handel of virginia well tom why not the knowledge of my great income made me yielding was there not enough for a dozen toms i dare say we could pay out your detaining creditors with no great difficulty not for the world my dear brotherinlaw even from you i could not accept such a favour pay me out why it would be no favour it would be a crime do you know that my only detaining creditor is an attorney pay an attorney never remember probus surely you have had enough of attorneys indeed i am not likely to forget probus as long as i live but then if you are not paid out tom how will you get out i shall walk out mr william halliday if you let us go out with you i shall send the wife on board with alice and i shall then walk out with my violin in one hand and a bundle of music in the other on the evening before the ship sails i shall go on board when my creditor finds out that i have taken my departure which may take weeksor it may take monthsthat honest attorney will be pained no doubt for he is of a revengeful spirit he will then do exactly what he pleases but i believe he will not venture out to virginia if he should dare that attempt i will give him to friendly indians in order to becarbonadoed as i believe you americans call it that attorney will shall be carbonadoed over a slow fire tom then was to come with us so with jenny her maid and her man tom shirley and his wife alice the boy and myself we should make up as pleasant a family party as ever sailed across the atlantic the time approached when we were to go on board the ship was to drop down with the ebb on saturday morning at nine with the turn of the tide everything was on board on the forecastle on deck my live stock was gathered sheep pigs turkeys all of which died in the channel geese and poultry our furniture books and music were stowed away in the hold our wine and liquors were laid in bunks around the cabin the captain and the mate were to take meals with us they were also so obliging as to drink up our rum and our wine we had no leavetakings on friday afternoon alice and her sisterinlaw went on board tom joined them after sundown at eight oclock or thereabouts i was to bring jenny and her party on board lord brockenhurst had expressed his desire to say farewell to her on the quarterdeck a little after seven i repaired to the gaol at the gates i saw waiting three large waggons which the people were filling with boxes and bundles tied up in sacking and canvas i thought nothing of these waggons at the moment they did not concern me and i entered the lodge there was waiting for me jenny herself dressed in splendour as if for a wedding surely no prisoner sentenced to transportation ever went on board ship in such a guise she was taking an affectionate leave of the governor who was moved almost to tears by her departure indeed sir she said i am grieved to have put you to so much trouble so she shook hands smiling sweetly then she turned to the turnkeys i am also very much in your debt my friends and walked along the whole line distributing guineas god bless your ladyship they uttered fervently we shall never see the likes of your ladyship here again indeed i am sure that they never will she mounted the steps of the coach which waited outside she was followed by the girl by myself and by the lad called jack i am glad she said that this child goes out with me to virginia the childshe looked little moretook jennys hand and kissed it she is an affectionate little fool said jenny and loves me much and to think what they were going to do with her oh fools fools she cried oh monstrous fools we were now rolling slowly along ludgate hill there was a rumbling after us which continued i looked out they were the three waggons i had observed at the gate what are those waggons i asked they contain my baggage did you think i was going abroad with nothing but in those waggons you must have the whole wardrobe of drury lane she laughed will you understand nothing did i not tell you that i would have all those turnkeys at my feet in a day or two well i succeeded but what has that got to do with your baggage why you see the officers that went to search my house for stolen property began with the garrets and there they stopped now when my mother agreed to give evidence it was on conditions as i told you i gave her money for compensation and i bought the whole of her stock of stolen property it had been stored in the stone vaults under the black jack they carried it over to the cellars of my house and when there was no room left there they used the garrets oh they took the garrets first where there was very little to see now you understand why there was such a paltry show could a woman in my position brave such a fate for things so miserable jenny jenny you are wonderful no will only i have my wits about me you have actually converted newgatenewgate prisoninto a receiving house for stolen property five guineas apiece for the turnkeys was what it cost i thought it the safest and the simplest plan will safest and simplest before i recovered the surprise of this information we reached the stairs on the quarter deck was alice with the boy you dear good woman jenny cried you are come to see the last of the transported convict the end of the orange girl yet beside my wife in her homely dress jenny looked like a countess alice kissed her we are not going to leave you jenny we are going with you your servants as long as we live chapter xxvi the last temptation we are waiting said the captain for our passengers while he spoke there came alongside the ship a dozen boats or more laden with the passengers for whose sake the good ship was about to cross the atlantic there were i rememberit is not possible for me to forget anything that happened on this voyageone hundred and eight of them who came on board men and women they were brought down from blackfriars stairs in a closed lighter jenny i said go into the cabin do not look at them why will i ought to be among them i am one of them suffer me to look at my brothers and sisters in misfortune of these poor wretches we had seen the greater part already in newgate within those walls in the bad air among those companions where everything was sordid and wretched they did not present an appearance so horrible as they did in the open air on the bright river in the sunshine under the flying clouds among the sailors where everything spoke of freedom the pallor of their faces their wretched rags blowing about in the breeze their pinched faces the unnatural brightness of their eyes their tottering limbs their meek submissiveness to order proclaimed their long detention in prison while they were waiting for the ship as they climbed up the companion painfully as they stepped down upon the deck as they stood huddled together like sheep my heart sank within me for thinking that jenny too was reckoned as one of these i glanced at her she was thinking the same thing her cheek was aflame her eyes glowed her lips trembled will said she we are a proper company virginia will welcome us they brought with themfaugh the prison reek and stench but we saw them for a few moments only then they were bundled down below to their own quarters and we saw the poor creatures no more it has been said that these poor convicts are cruelly illused on board the transport ships i can speak only of what i saw i know that our captain was a humane man i can testify to the fact that there were seldom more than two or three floggings a day and of the women not so many i know that our convicts were a gang of hardened wretches whom nothing but the fear of the lash kept in order i know that when they came on board they were for the most part in a wretched condition of low habits from long confinement poor food and bad drink that many of them lay down directly the ship got into open water and what with seasickness fever and weakness never got up again the truth is that the contractors who receive l a head for a voyage which takes about two months do honestly provide the convicts the rations prescribed by the government these rations are sufficient but not luxurious they consist of beef pork biscuits and cheese once a week to keep up their spirits they are served a ration of gin the beef may have been tough and the pork rusty but such as it was the captain served it out among them yet on the voyage of seven weeks we buried fortyseven or nearly one every day it seems a large number those who died were nearly all men very few of them were women they were unfit to face the fatigues of the voyage and the rolling of the ship some of them were even consumptive some were asthmatic some were in fevers some had other diseases they died perhaps they would have died at home in prison at newgate scarce a day passes that some poor wretch does not succumb to privation and bad air if so many of them died on board the ship that is no proof of inhumanity let us forget these poor sinners it is easy to say that they deserved all they got no doubt they did and what do we deserve and when a man like myself has gone through that gate and mouth of hell called newgate he looks on the poor creatures who go there to be flogged and branded and pilloried and hanged and transported with some compassion because he knows that such as they are such they have been made mr merridew is always with them the landlady of the black jack is always ready to buy what they offer her for sale no respectable person will employ them they have never been taught anything the divine and the schoolmaster dare not venture within their streets which are the very sanctuary of wickedness our charities are all for the deserving we have no bowels no compassion for those we call the undeserving let us forget them better to lie at the bottom of the ocean where at least it is peaceful than to face the cruel whip of the overseer and the burning fields of the american plantations our voyage lasted i say little more than seven weeks we were wafted across a smooth sea by favouring breezes after leaving the channel we got into a warmer air we began to sit on the quarterdeck tom and i got out our violins and played we played for our party we played for the sailors we sang those partsongs which he made so well jenny for her part was silent now and then she spoke to me about herself will she said if i receive that permission to return which my lord promises what will you do will you come home with me i do not know i told her if the place pleases us why should we go home again my memories of home will be full of wrongs for many a year to come i can never get back to my old friends in the city although thanks to you i was fully acquitted i am a newgate bird and a bird of the kings bench people look askance upon such a man i must think of alice too and of the boy we must not let these memories haunt the mother and make the boy ashamed to go back she answered without heeding me to stand on the stage at drury lane once more have they forgotten me already do you think the orange girls will remember i am sure and the natives of st giless she laughed i dont think they will bear malice you must not go back to drury lane jenny i can do better than drury lane will she said i have but to consent and i shall bea countess and oh how proud will my children be of their mother proud indeed of their mother oh will to think how ones birth clings round and hampers us all our lives i might be happy i might make a good and faithful man happy but the time would come when the children would grow up and would ask who and what was their mother and where she was born could i take them to the ruins of the black jack could i take them to the tyburn tree of glory and tell them how how their grandfather died then she relapsed into silence and so remained for awhile she had none of the common accomplishments of women she could not sew or embroider or make things as women used she could do nothing she could not cook or make cordials she understood no household work of any kind she could read but she had read nothing beyond the plays in which she had acted she knew no history or geography or politics she knew nothing but what she had learned for her own purposes the scaffolding so to speak on which the actor builds his playing the art of fine dress and how to wear it the art of dancing with an admirable grace of manner and of carriage the art of courtesy and graciousness in which she was a princess the art of making herself even more beautiful than nature intended and the art of bringing all men to her feet before we had been a day at sea the captain was her servant to command by the second day the mate was her slave by the third day the sailors worshipped her she brought good luck to the ship every sailor will tell you that passengers may and often do resemble jonah who was pursued by a tempest jenny brought fair weather and a balmy breeze always from the right quarter she did not forget our fellowpassengers when she heard that they were dying fast she would have gone below to visit them but the captain refused his leave the noisome quarters where they herded together day and night was not a proper place for any decent woman to visit let her send down what she pleased and they should have it she sent down from our stores daily drams of cordial and of rum if she did not save many lives she made death less terrible the voyage came to an end all too quickly on a certain day at the beginning of april we put into port and presently landed on the shores of the new world there are certain forms the bodies of jenny halliday and pamela st gilessi called the girl pamela for obvious reasonswere duly delivered to the officer representing the governor and as duly handed over to me as their master for five years this proceeding was performed without jennys presence or knowledge i then found a lodging not far from the port and sought the merchants to whom i had letters of introduction and credit my tale draws to an end let it not grow tedious in its last pages in one word in a week or so after our landing we started on a short journey of thirty miles or so over a somewhat rough road our journey took us five hours it was about three oclock in the afternoon when we arrived first there was a large wooden house of two storeys painted white in the front a long and deep verandameaning a place covered over and protected from the sun by the roof and hangings at the side and in the front before the house was a flowergarden at the back was a kitchen garden and orchard the house was well and solidly furnished all round the house lay fields of tobacco on which black people were working on the steps of the veranda in the garden under the trees played in the warm sun the little naked negro children where are we asked jenny looking round her i assisted her to get out of the waggonit was little betterin which we had made our journey i led her into the house in the principal room there was a long table laid as if for dinner at the head was an armchair carved i should think in the sixteenth century or earlier it was a kind of throne with a coat of arms carved gilded and coloured upon it the shield of the late occupant of the estate recently dead i led jenny to the head of the table i placed her in the throne madame i said this house is yours these gardens are yours this estate is yours and we if you please are your most humble servants to command so i bent one knee and kissed her hand your most humble obedient and grateful servants said alice following my example so we all did homage but our queen and mistress hid her face in her handkerchief and for a while she could not speak thus began our new life in which we all vied with each other in making jenny feel that she was our mistress we called her madame we made way for her we flew to obey her the overseers were instructed to report to her personally as to the condition of the field and the conduct of the slavesthere were no white servants on the estate the slaves themselves looked to madame as their owner their mistress and their friend for a time jennys mind remained still with the events of the past the thought of lord brockenhurst of the danger and the horrors which she had escaped indeed she could never forget these things little by little as i hoped the sense of power and authority returned she never asked how this lovely property came to her or if it truly belonged to her she began quietly as she had done in the assembly rooms at soho square to direct administrate and improve she mitigated the floggings she improved the slaves rations she gave them days of rejoicing she made the poor ignorant blacks who for the most part understand little but the whip and the stick and the cuff feel that they were in kindly hands their children rolled about at her feet taking their childish liberties she learned the business of tobaccogrowing in all the stages she walked about the fields in the morning before the sun was high and noted how the plants were looking and whether the weeds were kept down our neighbourswe had neighbours in all directions at two or three miles distancefor some time hesitated to call things were variously reported that madame had come out for the help of her cousin a convict that madame had brought out a large fortune that the cousin had certainly letters of credit for a very large amount that madame was herself a convict that we were all convictspolitical prisonerssent out for some kind of treasonjacobite conspirators friends of the young pretender there was no end to the rumours and reports which were spread abroad concerning us nor was it until lord brockenhurst himself came all the way from england to visit us and stay with us as you shall hear that the neighbours made up their minds that we could be visited i believe people think that colonial society is open to all comers without questionperhaps they think it is composed of convicts on the other hand the colonials are more careful than the english at home whom they admit into their houses on friendly or intimate terms our method of life was simple and uniform we assembled on the veranda at seven when i read prayers and a chapter this done we took breakfast not the petty meal of thin bread and butter and tea which satisfies the man about town but a plentiful repast with many dishes containing vegetables and fruits unknown in london after breakfast came the duties of the day my own part was the keeping of the accounts i called myself the steward alice directed the household jack was butler in command over the negroes of the house and pamela st giless was in charge of the stillroom outside the blacks were busy in the fields at twelve a bell rang which brought them all back to camp where they took their dinner at half past twelve we dined for our eating i declare that we had the choicest birds the finest mutton the best beef the most excellent fish that you can imagine all things cheap all plentiful and for drink our cellars were full of such canary madeira and port as few gentlemen could show at home in the evening we had supper at six after supper i read prayers and another chapter then we played cards or we had in the violins or tom played on the harpischord or we sang glees and madrigals and every night all to bed by nine on sundays we had morning service which i read the overseers were present and after the blacks grew to like the music they sat about the door while we chanted the psalms and sang our hymns in the evening i read a sermon or a discourse on some godly subject at these religious exercises madame would always be present sitting in her carved armchair her head resting on her hand expressing in her face neither interest nor weariness remember that never had anyone taught her a word of religion she looked on and listened sometimes she did not listen her eyes were fixed and far away she was back on the stage of drury lane who can tell how they all loved and worshipped her even the overseers commonly the most brutal of men some of whom pride themselves at being able to cut a lump of flesh from a negros leg at a distance of ten feet and more were softened by the gracious presence the worst cruelties were abandoned on our estate as for floggings of course there must be flogging so long as there are slaves and of course there must be slaves so long as there are negroes the clergy of virginia are united in this opinion i wish they were also united in the opinion that even a slave should be protected by the law from inhuman treatment this our quiet mode of life was broken into one day when there appeared unexpectedly lord brockenhurst himself it was about six months after our arrival he dismounted he threw his reins to his servant and mounted the steps of the veranda it was late in the afternoonabout six the autumn sun was getting low jenny was sitting with alice and toms wife talking of household affairs she rose quietly with a pretty blush and stepped forward good heavens jenny his lordship cried you are more beautiful than ever i swear welcome my lord to virginia you are come i trust to accept the hospitality of this poor house madame you honour me it is a lovely house with a view the most charming in the world i knew not that virginia was half so fine a country indeed if english people did knowthey would all come over i pray your lordship not to speak too well of us there are some people in the old country that we would not willingly welcome in the new so she led him into the inner room and sent for madeira to refresh him your lordship has something to tell me she said beginning to shiver and shake you did not come all the way from england only to wish me goodmorning i bring you jenny what i promised your full pardon and release it is in the hands of the governor you can return now whenever you please i was beginning to forget my lord that i am but a prisoner still and a convict these people with whom i live the best people i very believe in the whole world have almost made me forget that fact but i thank your lordship all the same i thank you most humbly and most gratefully except my cousin willmy husbands cousinthere is no more loyal and faithful gentleman than my lord brockenhurst i have done what i can i could do no more my lord you have ridden thirty miles you are tired no thenlet me ask you one more favour tell me about this matter tomorrow sleep first upon it for she saw his purpose in his eyes think i pray you partly of what i am and of what you are partly of your own dignity partly of how one such as i am should behave towards one such as you she rose i will now she said if you are not tired show you our gardens and our tobaccofields his lordship took supper with us i saw that he was pleased at the little state and ceremony with which we surrounded jenny i saw as well the love in his eyes which he could not tear away from her face after supper we had a little concert tom took the harpsichord and i took the violin first we played a piece as a duet then tom played while alice sang then we all with jack our butler who had an excellent bass while tom sang alto and i the tenor sang fourpart songs and i saw how his lordship watched the negroes sitting about outside and crowding up the doorway i am sure he took home the belief that we were a happy household blacks and all and that jenny was the mistress over all after breakfast in the morning jenny bade alice and me come with her while she received his lordship she took her place at the window sitting in her high chair lord brockenhurst entered bearing certain papers in his hand my lord she said you can speak with perfect freedom i entreat you to use perfect freedom before my cousins i have no secrets from them they can tell you perhaps more about myself than i ever will speakfor myself lord brockenhurst coloured and was confused but only for a little dear madame he said since you will not give an interview alone i must make the best of the presence of others they know everything said madame he bowed i have told you he said that i have brought out and delivered over to the governor your full pardon and release these papers are a copy jenny pushed them aside i do not want to see them she said let me never be reminded of their existence take them will and lock them up i received them and placed them in my pocket that done madame he went on i have only to invite your remembrance of a certain proposal thati believe you have not forgotten it since your worthy cousins know what that proposal was i have only to say that once more most divine woman i offer myselfmy name and rankmy fortune and possessionsat your feet he fell on his knees and took her hand jenny turned away her face answer him alicetell him what i have so often told you rise my lord do not pain me by kneeling at my unworthy feet my lord said alice solemnly there is no one in the worldbelieve mewhom jenny regards with greater respect and gratitude than yourself respect and gratitude are but cold words he said let me add with greater love your lordship is the only man in the world whom she has ever loved or could love that also believe me is most true why then he held out his hand nay my lord jenny loves you so well that nothing would induce her to accept the honour of your proposal how loves me so well jenny bids me tell you that the time would come when your children would ask who was their mother and who were her mothers friends they would learn her history i need not remind you of her history you know it all jenny loves you too well to bring shame and discredit on a noble house your children she says must have a mother worthy of yourself there is no more worthy woman in the world than jenny their mother must have an unblemished name my lord worthy of your own she knows you to be so good and loyal that you could never reproach her with the past but it belongs to her and my lord it must not belong to you it must not it shall not jenny repeated through her tears is this your answer jenny oh jenny will you cast me off for such a scruple i musti must go my lord think of me no more whyshe sprang to her feetwhat could i expect ithe orange girlthe daughter of the black jackthe friend of thieves the newgate prisoner the transported convict a coronet for me the hand of a noble gentleman the name of a noble house for me fie upon you my lord for thinking of such a thing remember what is due to a gentleman and i thank youoh i thank youyou can never know how muchfor thinkingyou the only oneof nothing less or lower go my lord tempt me no more i know what i must do farewell he seized her in his arms he kissed herforehead and cheek and lips and hands he ceased to urge his suit he saw that she was fixed and in his heart he knew that she was right i obey he said oh noblest of women i obey so he rushed away and jenny fell into alices arms i sit on my own estate in the pleasant land of virginia outside the veranda the hot sun ripens the corn and fruit i did my duty in the great and glorious war which set our country free my sons will do theirs if the occasion should again arise we have taught our cousins across the seas that we can fight for freedom but there will be no more fighting for that it is won once for alli am now old but as i sit alone my eyes resting on as fair a landscape of river and forest and orchard and garden as the world can show i suddenly wander away and gaze beyond the ocean beyond the years upon that abode of despair and wretchedness where jenny sits like a flower in a pigsty talking of what she should do when she came out of prison but unable to read in the future any return to the world at all as for fear or doubt or any anxiety about the future the poor soul had none she was going to continue for ever beautiful to win that worship of men which she loved so much i have now lost all the friends of my youth they pass before me sometimes in a long procession it is the consolation of age to live in the past but in all the array of ghosts there is none that brings tears except the figure of jenny in her wondrous beauty and her soft and lovely eyes she lived with us for more than thirty years she grew graybut she was as lovely in her age as in her youth she was mistress unquestioned to the end and never more than in her old age but always with the same kindness the same grace the same sweetness of look and the same softness of eye she died at last of some fever caught of a young negress whom she visited in the infirmary she was ill for three days only and she died lying in the veranda looking out upon the woods and mountains on the golden sunshine that she loved alice dear she said you have told me often that we are led we know not how to things that are best for us though by ways that we would not choose i have not forgotten what you said i never forget my dear what you say alice kissed her fingers i understand now what you mean i have been led i have been ledmy dear i am going to die bury me as one of yourselvesnot in a ditch like my own peoplewho perhaps are not led bury me in the burialground where your baby lies put no stone upon my grave but plant white flowers over it let my abode at least look lovely after death i have been led alicei have been ledi understand it now after a little alice i have been proud of what men called my loveliness it makes every woman happy when men call her lovely my lord called me lovely send him alice a lock of my hair tell him that i have never loved any other man she died we buried her in the little burialground where lay the child we lost we put up no headstone but we planted the grave with white flowers there is now another grave beside hers with more white flowers it bears the name of alice to me it has been given to love two women at the same time and that with equal love and equal respect and without blame or sin

of america stolen idols book one chapter i the two ships pursuer and pursued quaintly shaped with heavy flapping sails lay apparently becalmed in a sort of natural basin formed by the junction of two silently flowing turgid riversrivers whose water was thick and oily yellow in colour unpleasant to look at the country through which they passed was swampriven and desolate though in the far distance were rice fields and the curiously fashioned roofs of a chinese village the sun beat down upon the glasslike water the air was windless further movement seemed impossible until from the smaller boat through unexpectedly opened hatches half a dozen oars were suddenly thrust into the water the huge chinaman who stood at the helm yellowskinned and naked to the waist picked up an enormous pole and let it gradually down into the river bed the oars languidly though they were wielded cut the water and the dhow began slowly to move wu abst the mighty terror of the great river as he loved to hear himself described grinned mockingly as he looked backwards towards his pursuer he shouted words through the glistening heat intended to convey his contempt of those who fancied that he was to be caught napping then he bent over his giant pole and glanced with satisfaction at the distant bank which already showed signs of their progress at the bend of the river not three miles distant was a stretch of water into which no such craft as that which had chased him could follow he relit his pipe therefore and smoked like a man at peace whilst below the sweat rolled from the naked bodies of the men who were emulating their roman predecessors of two thousand years ago wu abst pleased with their efforts shipped his pole for a moment and leaning over the side shouted encouragement and exhortation to the toilers then suddenly the words died away upon his lips his whole frame stiffened the remains of the grin faded from his face the whole expression of which was now almost ludicrously changed for across that little stretch of river came the horrible sound of which he had heard the poppoppop denoting the use of some devilmade mechanical contrivance which triumphed over windless airs and opposing currents his horrified gaze became fastened upon the pursuing ship now also moving and not only moving but moving very much faster than anything which all the efforts of his toiling gang were able to accomplish bewilderment gave place to anger which in its turn became merged almost at once in the philosophy of his racethe graveyard of all emotions he shouted an order to those down below there was a clatter and a rumble as the men shipped their oars and another more metallic sound as they exchanged them for other weapons wu abst thrust his hand through the window of a small cuddy hole which he called his cabin and drew out a long antiquated rifle it was one of a type manufactured in birmingham fifty years ago rejected since then by every south american band of patriots planning a revolution and scoffed at even by west african savages he nevertheless dropped a cartridge into its place and waited whilst the other ship glided almost alongside his eyes swept its deck and his bloodthirsty intentions were promptly changed with expressionless face he slipped his weapon back again through the cuddy hole and called down another order below then he leaned over the rail and raised his hand in salute a man who was seated aft in a basket chair upon the deck of the approaching ship rose to his feet and came to the side he wore chinese garb and he spoke in chinese but his linen clothes were spotlessly white and he wore no pigtail are you wu abst the river pirate he called out i am wu abst was the reply and who are you i am wu ling the peaceful trader the other answered i bring prosperity to those whom you seek to rob wu abst spat into the river i know of you he growled you trade with foreign money you take the jade and the gems the silk and the handiwork of these people and sell them rubbish where i take the other rejoined i give something in return which is more than you do what is your business with me wu abst demanded glancing sullenly at the two maxim guns trained upon him behind each of which was seated crosslegged a brawny and capablelooking chinese sailor last night wu ling announced i traded at the village of hyest and i heard a strange tale i heard that you had on board your ship a foreigner tied with ropes and that you were waiting to reach your own stretches to throw him to the crocodiles is this the truth wu abst or am i to search your ship it is the truth the other admitted grimly he is a foreign devil who merits death and even torture he is a thief and a sacrilegious pest upon the earth you speak hard words of him wu ling observed what words other than hard can be spoken of such wu abst retorted presently i shall tell you of his deeds i like not your speech wu ling you speak our tongue but speak it strangely there are rumours of you in many places there are some who say that not only is the money with which you trade the money of foreign devils but that you too are one of them in spirit if not by birth what i am is none of the present business wu ling declared what of this prisoner of yours i shall speak of him now wu abst answered then if you are indeed a man of this country you shall see that i do no evil thing in casting him to the crocodiles he was caught a thief in the sacred temple of the sacred village of nilkaya in the temple where the great emperor himself was used to worship the priests who caught him tied his body with ropesnot i they brought him to the riverside and they gave me silver to deal with him your story is true wu ling admitted the circumstances you relate are known to me but there were two of these robbers what of the other his companion the priests say that he escaped and with him the two sacred images of the great god reverenced for nine hundred years the pirate confided it is because of the escape of the other that they wish to make sure of the death of this one wu ling considered for a moment wu abst he pronounced at last you have told me a true story and you have acted in this matter as a just man therefore these guns of mine shall bring no message of evil to you nor shall i declare war so long as you keep to your side of the river and above the villages where i trade but as for the foreign devil you must hand him over to me wu abst raised his hands to heaven for a time his speech was almost incomprehensible he was stricken with a fit of anger he shouted and pleaded until he foamed at the mouth wu ling listened unmoved when at last there was silence he spoke it is clear to me what you intended wu abst he said there was to be torture and more silver from the priests before you cast this prisoner to the sea fish it is a hard living that one makes nowadays wu abst the terror of the river muttered nevertheless in this matter i am firm the other insisted hand me over the foreigner and go your way you know of me i travel into dangerous places when i leave my ship and i have a score of men below who could hew their way through a regiment of your cutthroats and a gun in the bows there which would send you to the bottom with a single discharge i am your master wu abst and i command bring me the foreigner and go your way so a few minutes later a halfnaked barely conscious young englishman the remains of his garments rags upon his back blue in the face from lack of circulation a hideous and pitiful sight was carried up from the hold of wu absts sailing dhow and laid upon the deck of the trading schooner of wu ling his cords were cut brandy and water were poured down his throat a sail reared as a shelter from the sun whilst from a small hose cool refreshing water was sprayed over him until consciousness returned and speech began to stammer from his lips then from the petrol engine commenced once more the noise which had brought consternation to wu abst the ship swung round in a circle and passed on its way down the river wu abst with a little shrug of the shoulders relit his pipe perhaps after all there would have been no more silver that evening seemed to the released man like a foretaste of paradise he lay on a couch in wu lings cabin with the roof and sides rolled back and nothing but a cunning arrangement of mosquito netting between him and the violet twilight above was the moon and the brilliantly starlit night on either side occasional groves of treestrees growing almost down to the rivers edge some with poisonous odours others almost sickly sweet sometimes there was a light from a distant village but more often they were enveloped in a thick velvety darkness and they were pointing for the great port at the mouth of the river and safety the released man was sipping brandy and water and smoking his host sat opposite him grave and enigmatic i talk english little wu ling said but i understand all speak your story and tell how called the young man raised himself slightly my name is gregory ballaston he announced i am an englishman as you know a traveller and fond of adventure for years this story of the temple of nilkaya has been in my brain i heard all about it from some one who lived in pekin for many years the story wu ling enquired politely in this temple the young man narrated is a great statue of a chinese godbuddha i supposeand on either side of it are two smaller ones made from hard wood marvellously carved and some say a thousand years old each is supposed to be a counterpart of the greater god and yet they demonstrate an amazingly presented allegory they bear a likeness to one another they bear a likeness to the god himself but each is curiously different in one you seem to trace the whole of the evil qualities which could ever enter into the character of man and in the other all the good qualities one is hideous and the other beautiful yet if you put them side by side and glance quickly from one to the other the two seem to grow together so that the impression of the image which is left in your mind is that of the great god above they are called the body and the soul this story i have heard wu ling admitted i have heard it many times but i scarcely believed ituntil i saw the young man continued i had only a few minutes in the temple and there was danger all around yet for a moment they took my breath away i could scarcely move why the man who fashioned them might have been an oriental phidias proceed wu ling begged well the point of the story is this generations ago there was a great rising amongst the people an invasion from the north and robbers seem to have overrun the whole place they sacked even the temples and the prieststhose who had warning of their comingstripped their robes and their temples of all the precious stones which they possessed and hid them hid them wu ling repeated ah some of this story you have of course heard the young man went on because your trade brings you i suppose within a hundred miles of nilkaya the temples were rich in jewelsthe emperors of china had sent them gifts for centuriesand the legend is that all the most valuable were concealed within these two imagesthe body and the soul that wu ling commented is a strange story as i told you the young man continued i heard it from one who lived in pekin and i believe that it is the truth for centuries the priests have possessed a manuscript which has been handed down from one high priest to the other and this manuscript tells how these images have been fashioned so that there is within them a hollow place there are directions for finding it and for opening the images and they say that without these directions no man in the world could guess how to do it i have spoken with one who has visited the temple and who was not quite so much pressed for time as i was who has seen these images only a few feet away and who insists upon it that there is not a sign of any possible aperture or any break in the wood a simple thing wu ling suggested blandly would be to break with choppers the young man raised his eyebrows it is strange to hear you a chinaman propose such a thing he remarked i suppose any one who attempted it in this country would sooner or later be cut into small pieces for these images are blessed just as the larger one but there is another reason against attempting such a thing you are a very wonderful race you chinese and you were more wonderful still generations ago ah wu ling murmured there are plenty of people the young man proceeded who say that there is scarcely a discovery in the world which you have not anticipated and then declined to use because the central tenet of your religion and your philosophy was to leave things that are well they say that you discovered gunpowder and all manner of explosives about the time these images were fashioned they must always from the first have been intended for a possible hiding place for the old legend concerning themi know this from the only european who has ever visited the templedeclared that if these are subjected to violence in any way then the earthquake follows the priests all believe this implicitly and although it sounds a farfetched idea the man who first told me the story is convinced that when the jewels were stored away inside they were imbedded in some sort of explosive it becomes more than ever a strange story wu ling said didactically the young man looked searchingly for a moment at his host was it his fancy he wondered or was there a faint note of sardonic disbelief in his even tone of course he went on it must sound to you as it does to me although you would scarcely understand the word like rot but the man from whom i heard it was a great person in pekin a friend even of the emperor and not only of the emperor but of the emperors great adviser whom some people think the greatest chinaman who ever lived he had privileges which had never before been extended to any european wu ling nodded gravely so he said with the painstaking air of one trying to solve a problem you were seeking to take images from temple away from priests to whom belong that you might possess jewels the young man coughed somehow or other wu lings eyes were very penetrating well he admitted i suppose in a way it was robbery but robbery on a legitimate scale i dont suppose youve read much european history have you read never wu ling replied that makes it difficult to explain his companion regretted pausing for a moment to breathe in with great satisfaction a gulp of the cool night air however most of the territories in different parts of the world which england possesses and a great deal of her inherited wealth have come because centuries ago englishmen went across the seas to every country in the world and helped themselves to pretty well what they wanted that wu ling remarked sounds like wu abst the pirate gregory ballaston smiled well he continued the invasion of a foreign country for purposes of aggrandisement is robbery i suppose only you see it is robbery on a big scale we looked at this present affair in the same way if it is true that there are a million pounds worth of jewels in these images what good can they possibly do to any one hidden there for centuries no one could see them no one could derive any good from them their very beauty is lost to the world robbery if you like wu ling but not petty larceny wu ling shook his head with an uncomprehending smile of course you wont understand that the other observed still what i mean to say is that the very danger of the exploit the fact that you risk your lifelook how near i came to losing minemakes the enterprise almost worth while nothing mean about it anyway ah wu ling murmured meditatively and now please tell where images the young man was silent thats a long story wu ling he sighed there were two of us in this the other got away he didnt desert me exactly it was according to plan but he had to leave first and he left damned quick and the images wu ling persisted softly gregory ballaston leaned back the night had become a thing of splendour the water no longer yellow but glittering with the reflection of the moon they were passing through a narrow strip of country which might have been the garden of some great noblemans palace there were flowering shrubs down to the rivers edge a faint perfume of almond blossom in the distance a stronger scent of something like eucalyptus and all the time a divine silence after his terrible quarters in the pirate ship this was a dream of luxury the young man was full of gratitude to his benefactor and yet he hesitated could one trust any chinaman even though he has saved ones life with a secret like this the images no longer stand in the temple wu ling he said but just where they are now i do not know it was my part of the affairif you understand military languageto fight a rearguard action i did but there were too many of them for me they fought like furies those priests i might have killed them but i hadnt the heart to do it i shot one or two in the limbs and then chucked it when i saw it was no use whether my friend succeeded in getting away with the images or not i shall not know for many days they passed a tiny village from a plastered house with a curving roof two lanterns were hanging a girls figure was dimly visible through the strings of thin bamboo rustling musically together in the breeze she was singing to a kind of guitar an amazing melody uncouth in its way and unintelligible yet the young man turned over and smiled as he listened is there no other thing but money to be desired amongst you of the west wu ling asked that even in youth you risk so much gregory ballaston clasped his hands behind his head he was gazing steadily up at the stars listening to the melody dying away in the distance although he addressed his companion he had the air of one soliloquising the further west you go wu ling he said the more you need money to taste life artistically of course its all wrong but then the worlds all wrong its slipped out of shape somehow during the last thousand years we arent natural any longer the natural person accepts pleasure but doesnt seek it directly you seek you begin a terrible chase and were all seekers over westward wu ling we have lost the art of being we have lost the gift of repose we have lost the capacity for quiet enjoyments sport ambitions and lovemaking have all joined in the debacle no one man can live alone and away from his fellows even if he sees into the evil of these things all life to us has come to run on wheels which need always the oil of money and for the chance of gaining that wu ling murmured you young englishmen have come so far and risked your lives the young man looked round the cabin and beyond there was a rack of rifles against the wall boxes of ammunition which reached to the ceiling the moonlight outside glinted now and then upon the muzzles of the maxims you yourself wu ling he pointed out run risks for what for the same thing for wealth you wouldnt carry those firearms unless you had trouble sometimes you are past the time of life when an adventure alone appeals you too seek wealth and you seek it with maxim guns and enfield rifles to protect yourself there are evil men upon the river wu ling admitted there are men like abst and others but these are for protection we have a proverb in this countrythe strong man only is safe a wise saying the young man acknowledged drowsily wu ling rose to his feet our guest must sleep he said soon the night will be cold and they will draw coverings over the netting im awfully afraid im turning you out of your quarters gregory ballaston apologised i have others was the courteous reply it is for sleep i leave you he passed out and walking to the stern of the boat stood pensively watching a little streak of silver left behind forward the young man sleptslept as he had never hoped to do again in this world all through the night they made lazy progress towards the great city which fringed the ocean chapter ii wu ling the trader chinese representative of the great house of johnson and company at home and amongst his merchandise was strangely installed he sat in the remote corner of a huge warehouse packed from floor to ceiling with an amazingly heterogeneous collection of all manner of articles there were bales of cotton and calico goods from manchester woollens from bradford cases of firearms from birmingham and six great crates of american bicycles in the foreground a ford automobile stood in the middle of the floor and farther back in the recesses of the room which seemed to be of no particular shape and which wandered into many corners were piles of chinese silks shelf after shelf of china bowls and ivory statuettes hanging from the walls were mandarins robes of green and blue embroidered with manycoloured silks fragments of brocade and one great pictorial representation of the grounds of an emperors palace woven with miraculous skill into a background of pale blue material from the more distant parts of the warehouse came an insidious pungent odour as of a perfume from which the life had gone but the faintness of which remained a perfume which spread itself with gentle insistence into every corner of the place and seemed to envelop even its more sordid details with an air of mystery in the great open yard bluesmocked chinamen were packing and unpacking in amazing silence the only sound in the warehouse itself came from the clicking of a typewriter before which on a plain deal bench was seated a blackhaired sallowfaced youth in european clothes from outside there drifted in through the open window in a confused medley the strange noises of the quay the patter of naked feet the shrill cry of the porters and occasional screech of a siren a white mist hung over the harbour a hot damp mist concealing in patches the tangled mass of shipping into this curious chamber of commerce ushered by a chinese boy came gregory ballaston the englishman whom wu ling had rescued a short while ago the chinese boy murmured something and departed wu ling nodded a welcome to his visitora grave reserved welcome no gone england yet he observed the young man sank into the chair which the others gesture indicated he had evidently found his clothes for he was very correctly dressed in the european fashion his manner was selfpossessed and his voice level nevertheless his pallor was almost ghastly and there were still blue lines under his eyes he had the air of a man who has been through some form of suffering you have heard the story of my friend wu ling he asked the chinaman shook his head and pointed around much affairs he explained very busy smoke cigarette gregory ballaston helped himself from the open box my friend got away he recounted reached pekin and got safely on to the train at some godforsaken place on the way here the train was held up there seems to have been confusion for an hour or so when the soldiers arrived my friend was found with his throat cut and the chinaman who had been his guide and interpreter was killed too wu ling inclined his head gravely the story was not an unusual one robbers in china are bad men he declared and the images the young englishman touched his forehead the heat was great and there were drops of moisture upon his fingers one was still amongst the train baggage he confided it is now safely on board the steamer the other was taken away by the robbers wu ling reflected for several moments looking downward upon the table he seemed indisposed for speech and presently his visitor continued of course he went on according to the superstition one is supposed to be worthless without the other i am going to risk that however mine is under lock and key in the pursers safe and i shant even look at it until were well out of these seas the steamer sail at four oclock tomorrow wu ling remarked glancing at a chart the young man nodded i have been on board already he said i came back to pay my promised call upon you and to thank you once more for all you did for me wu ling waved his hand it was nothing he declared wu abst bad man if he had killed you there would have been trouble on the river my trading all disturbed you safe now better leave the image behind im damned if i do was the emphatic reply its cost my pals life and very nearly mine i am going to stick to it wu ling was thoughtful apparently he was watching some of the porters at work in a distant corner of the warehouse which image you have he enquired body or soul i havent undone the case the young man answered i dont care which it is so long as the jewels are in it you think you get the jewels wu ling asked gently if they are there i shall was the dogged reply superstitions are all very well in a way but a wooden image is a wooden image after all wu ling said nothing there was a curious significance about his silence which seemed somehow to embarrass his visitor who rose presently to his feet and looked around he was inspired with a desire to change the conversation what an amazing place this is he exclaimed i suppose you have some wonderful chinese things we spend life collecting them wu ling answered in return you see what we give pointing to the bales of calico and woollen goods and the crates of bicycles perhaps you care buy some curios gregory ballaston shook his head no money he confessed i shall have to get a credit from the purser as it is wu ling rose slowly to his feet come he enjoined i show you something follow the young man not altogether willing followed his guide to the extreme end of that amazing warehouse through a recess into a further dark room also filled with a strange conglomeration of articles from which seemed to come with even more troublous insistence the same curious odour lifeless yet disturbing beyond was still another door towards which wu ling made his way his companion hesitated i have not a great deal of time he said i want to see the consul before the place closes you have time to see what i shall show was the almost ominous rejoinder they paused before the door which to ballastons surprise was studded with great nails and of enormous strength wu ling produced a long thin key from his pocket which he inserted into a very modernlooking aperture the door swung ponderously open inside there was no window nor apparently any form of ventilation and again that odour cloying and nauseating swept out in stabbing little wafts almost stupefying the young man confronted with a pool of darkness would have drawn back but there was suddenly a grip upon his arm like a ring of iron wait wu ling ordered there shall be light and immediately there was from some unseen switch the dark chamber was flooded with the illumination of many electric bulbs ballaston gasped as he looked around it was almost as though he had found his way into some aladdins cave on shelves of red highly polished wood were ranged lumps of jade and quartz bowls of ancient china of which even his inexperience could gauge the pricelessness silk coats faded but marvellously embroidered barbaric stones in open trays a great circlet of malay pearls and on a shelf alone staring at him bland and unmistakable the other of the twin images which he and his friend had dragged down from their pedestals in the temple ballaston stared at it speechless the face itself had a touch of sphinxlike mysticism the remoteness of a god the benevolence of a kindly spirit the work in it seemed so slight the result so prodigious ballaston found words at last the other image he cried where did you get it in this city wu ling explained nothing of this sort is sold unless it come first to us three nights since there appeared a messenger i sought the man from whom he came at his hiding place in the city with him i traded for the image you purchased it the young man gasped whom else was the composed reply in this country from the dark forests of northern mongolia the temples of pekin or the mines on the siberian borders all that there is for which men seek gold comes here we pay they sell but you cant keep it ballaston exclaimed not in this country the priests will hear you will be forced to return it if it belongs to any one he stopped short wu ling read his thoughts and smiled the priests of the temple which you and your accomplice ravaged he announced live no longer they were murdered by the people many days ago for their sin in permitting you to enter the temple furthermore the images are now defiled the hand of the foreigner has touched them they can never again take their place by the side of the great buddha you bought with blood and i with gold there was the sound of shuffling footsteps close at hand an elderly man dressed in shabby european clothes stood behind them he looked over their shoulders at the image and there was for a moment almost a glow in his worn and lined face this wu ling confided is a man of your race he is of the firma partnernot because of business but because he is a great scholar he reads strange tongues manuscripts from the monasteries of thibet the archives of ancient china he was once a professor at one of your universitiesprofessor endacott he is now of the firm of johnson and company the newcomer acknowledged indifferently the young mans greeting you are looking at a very wonderful piece of carving he said i once spent a year in pekin to see that and its companion image young man has other wu ling explained blandly he and friend stole both from temple this one come hereyou know how the other he has on ship taking with him to england endacotts whole frame seemed to stiffen he frowned heavily his tone carried a faroff note of sarcasm which might have belonged to the days of his professorship the young man has chosen as he would he remarked he possesses the body and here still in the land which gave it immortality remains the soul now they are separated what will you do with your image young man if you reach your country safely there is a legend of hidden jewels was the eager reply you perhaps know of it i know the legend well the other admitted there is treasure in one perhaps in both which do you think might hold the jewelsthe body or the soul i am hoping that there are some in mine anyhow ballaston answered that may be was the tranquil comment on the other hand we may find the whole story to be an allegory you may discover nothing but emptiness and disappointment in the body here at least in the soul you find reflected by the divine skill of the craftsman the jewels of pure living and spiritual thought you were of oxford young man magdalen you have the air nearly all of your age and small vision scoff in your hearts at any religion which may seek to express the qualities for which that image stands it is your illfortune that you have the body when you are home you will unpack your case you will place the image amongst your treasures and i can tell you even though it is thirty years since i saw it what you will see you will see a brooding face and eyes cast down to the dunghills you will see thick lips and coarse features you will see expressed as glaringly as here you see the triumph of the spirit the debasement of the body you will watch your image and you will sink you will never look at it you or others without conceiving an unworthy thought just as you could never look upon this one without feeling that some one has stretched down his hand that somewhere there is a murmur of sweet voices speaking to you from above the clouds but the jewels the young man persisted bah endacott muttered as he turned on his heel ballaston with wondering eyes watched the erstwhile professor disappear looney he murmured under his breath i desire pardon wu ling interpolated politely a madman wu ling smiled he is a personage of great learning he declared he is a friend of chinese scholars who have never spoken to any other foreigner he has great knowledge what are you going to do with that ballaston asked motioning towards the image wu ling sighed he stood for a moment in silent thought his eyes fixed upon his treasure then gently and almost with reverence he turned away beckoned his companion to precede him passed out and locked the door who can tell he ruminated we have a great warehouse here filled with strange goods as you see another and larger in alexandria an agent in new york all the things come and go we do not hurry we have jade there which we have not even spoken of for twenty years silk robes from the chests of him who was emperor ivory carvings from his summer palace denied even to the great merchants perhaps we sell perhaps not you must be rolling in money the young man sighed i desire pardon wu ling rejoined mystified you must be wealthyvery rich wu ling smiled tolerantly he turned back swung open once more the door and turned on the light he pointed to the image serene and benevolent what counts money he murmured they were about halfway through the outer warehouse on their way to the lighter room beyond when a thing happened so amazing that ballaston stopped short and gripped his companion by the shoulder returning towards them was endacott and by his side a girl she was dressed simply enough in the white clothes and shady straw hat which the climate demanded but there were other things which made her appearance in such a place curiously incongruous she broke off in her conversation and looked at gregory ballaston in frank astonishment it was certainly an unusual meeting place for two young people of the modern world i am taking my niece to see our new treasure mr endacott observed a little stiffly will you lend me the key wu ling or will you take us back yourself i will return wu ling replied gravely the young gentleman will excuse if i too might be permitted one more glimpse ballaston begged the girl smiled at him and glanced at her companion mr endacott recalled the conventions of his past i should like my dear he said to present our young visitor to you but i am not sure that i remember his name or that i have even heard it ballaston the young man interposed with some eagerness gregory ballaston this then is my niece miss claire endacott the exprofessor proceeded she will be your fellow traveller i imagine if you leave on tomorrows steamer the two young people shook hands and they all turned back into the recesses of the warehouse you are coming to england ballaston asked she nodded it is so nice to meet some one who is going to be on the ship she said i came from new york here last month knowing scarcely a soul after that they remained without speech for a few moments somehow or other their surroundings and their mission seemed to demand silence wu ling gravely opened the door and turned up the light the girl drew a little breath of joy as she gazed at the image but that is wonderful she exclaimed it is the work of a great master her uncle explained gravely the hand which fashioned that image was the hand of a man who knew the secrets of the ages who came as near the knowledge of what eternity means as any man may there is much to think aboutlittle to speak of their silence was the silence of entrancement ballastons attention alone curiously distracted it was a strange environment for her modern and vivid beauty this chamber with its clinging odours its ancient treasures of silk and ivory the timedefying image gazing serenely past them wu ling and endacott himself seemed entirely in the setting the girl with her masses of yellow hair and almost eagerly joyous expression a butterfly wandered by chance into a vault yet he had another impression of her before they left he caught a glimpse of her parted lips the strained light in her clear grey eyes as though in a sense her spiritual self were reaching out towards the allegory of the image then her uncle gave the signal wu ling gravely switched off the light and they trooped back into the warehouse somehow the girl reflectedi suppose it is because i have just come from the art classes and the museums of new yorki feel as though that were the first real thing i have ever seen in my life chapter iii well claire exclaimed laughing at gregory ballaston across the table how have you enjoyed your dinner immensely he answered with enthusiasm have you ever dined more strangely i dont think i have he confessed it was most frightfully kind of your uncle to ask me i was never so surprised in my life nor i she admitted candidly to tell you the truth when we all came together in the warehouse this afternoon it seemed to me from his manner that you were not particularly good friends and i was afraid he was going to hurry me off without a word then your intense curiosity to have another look at that image entirely assumed he interrupted i wanted a chance to be introduced to you of course that wasnt in the least obvious she laughed anyhow even then i never dreamed of this it was just when you were going that he asked your name again and seemed so interested do you realise that he must know something about you or your family i wondered gregory admitted she glanced at the door through which her uncle had disappeared in search of cigarettes anyhow she continued it is delightful to think that you are going to be a fellow passenger on the kalatat dont you sympathise with me for being rather glad to get away from here he looked around at the almost empty room at the comfortless linoleum upon the floor the chinese servants moving like ghosts about the table at the canebottomed chairs the few articles of cheap furniture it was an amazing environment your uncle he remarked a little hesitatingly apart from his household surroundings seems to be a man of great taste he has wonderful knowledge she said and a wonderful sense of beauty but he lives absolutely within himself i am perfectly certain he doesnt know that he has eaten curried chicken and rice every night for a week why if i hadnt thought of it wed have had nothing but water for dinner youre a good samaritan he murmured come and sit outside she invited the verandah is the only possible place here were a great deal too near the rest of the houses but the city looks almost beautiful now the lights are out and the harbour is wonderful the chairs as you will discover are horrible and there isnt a cushion in the place tell me about yourself he begged when they were established and why you came here you see she confided mr endacotts brother my father was a professor at harvard he died when i was eleven years old and my mother died a year afterwards i was sent to boarding school in boston and new york when i was nineteen i was to be sent either to an aunt in england or to my uncle here my aunt in england lives at a place which reminds me of your namemarket ballaston it is called he looked at her in astonishment why that is where i live he exclaimed tell me your aunts name de fourgenet she replied she married a frenchman the comte de fourgenet good god madame madame that is what we call your aunt in the neighbourhood he explained she is my fathers greatest friend you know of course that she is an invalid i have heard so the girl admitted a motor accident wasnt it uncle she went on as he stepped through the window do you realise that mr ballaston knows aunt angele i imagined that he might mr endacott acknowledged a little drily it was not until i heard your name for the second time he continued turning to the younger man that i realised who you must be it is a very small world gregory ballaston remarked tritely as he accepted one of the cigars which mr endacott was offering geographically it has contracted for me during the last twentyfive years into a radius of a few miles round the city here mr endacott confided to come back into the world again at my time of life will seem strange but you wont really mind it the girl assured him you will find a country house not too far from aunt angele you will have all your manuscripts your books your treasures round you it is true isnt it that you sit in your little office every day without stirring why you can do the same thing in england as here and then there must be some of your old oxford friends who would like to see you mr endacott smiled thinly thirty years he reminded her is a long way to look back to pick up the threads the friendships dropped more than a quarter of a century ago is not easy at the same time he went on it is right that i should return to england it marches well with affairs here you must have found the life out in these parts very interesting sir gregory ballaston remarked i dont know whether it would get monotonous to you but to any one coming upon it suddenly it is an amazing corner of the world off the ship i have only seen three europeans since i have been here it is for that reason mr endacott pointed out an unsuitable place for my niece my establishment here too is impossible no european woman could keep house under the prevailing conditions that is why i am hurrying my niece off although i myself shall follow before long my father will be interested to see you again gregory ventured your father if his tastes had lain that way mr endacott ruminated might have been a brilliant scholar he preferred sport and life we met not so many years ago in pekin he was dabbling in diplomacy then he certainly had the gifts for it he was in fact the most popular englishman who ever appeared at the court there he was received and granted privileges where i could never follow him he was i suppose your instigator in this buccaneering expedition of yours the young man laughed a little uneasily there had been a vein of contempt in the others tone i suppose it must have seemed a horrible piece of vandalism to you sir he remarked however there it is the adventure appealed to me and we wanted the money badly enough his host looked out across the harbour at the swaying lanterns of the small boats and beyond to the great lighthouse money he repeated the password of the west somehow i never thought i should return to it money counts for something out here too gregory protested look at your friend and partner wu ling trading up the river with machine guns and rifles to protect himself for what to make money hes doing it for johnson and company youre one of the firm mr endacott the latter nodded touche he admitted but let me point out to you young gentleman that the things wu ling brings back to our warehouses are things of beauty which he pays for with rubbish gregory rejoined half of your warehouse is an abomination the other half i admit a treasure house mr endacott gently inclined his head i cannot defend myself he acknowledged i am a partner in the firm because they insisted all my savings for twenty years which i advanced to them were they tell me the foundation from which the business has been built up but believe me i have never seen inside a ledger once every twelve months a strange little man brings me a slip of paper i look at it and the business for the year is finished it is perhaps as well gregory observed that your associates are probably honest wu ling for instance wu ling is an amazing person mr endacott pronounced is he altogether chinese gregory enquired there have been times when he has puzzled me no one but wu ling knows who wu ling is or where he comes from was the enigmatic reply he is a power unto himself he saved my life gregory remarked but i dont think that he approves of me tell me mr ballaston the girl asked have you looked at your image yet the one you have on the ship not yet mr endacott turned his head he was seated on the most uncomfortable of the three uncomfortable cane chairs a stiff unbending figure his eyes were turned speculatively upon his visitor if there be any truth in the legend he advised you will do well to leave it in its case gregory was doubtful i rather wanted to examine it he admitted the part of the legend which interests me most is the part which has to do with the jewels naturally mr endacott agreed with unconcealed sarcasm yet in the story of the fashioning of the images there has been nothing more vehement than the warning issued by the high priest in whose day it was done here he pointed out by the great art of the sculptor the body and soul were torn apart all that was good and virtuous and that made towards the beautiful in life was carven into the image which our friend wu ling seems to have purchased from the robber all that was debased and evil and which prompted towards sin was graven into the features of the one which you possess together side by side they were supposed to make up the sum of humanitythe good and the evil balancing side by side they might be looked at without evil effect they might inspire thoughtreflection of the highest order there were indications there of what to avoid what passions to fight against indications there too of what a mans aim should be how to uplift oneself above sin and how to climb always in ones thoughts towards the spiritual they both listened fascinated to mr endacotts thin reedy voice his still words spoken without emphasis or enthusiasm as they might have been spoken to a class of student philosophers it was the girl who first ventured upon a question but uncle she demanded you dont seriously believe that to live with either of these statues without the other could really affect any ones character so runs the legend was the quiet almost solemn reply so it is written in one of the manuscripts recording their history the superstition if it be a superstition has at least a logical basis an environment of beauty and spirituality tends towards holiness an environment of bestiality must on the other hand in time debase before these images were fashioned the philosophers of past ages used their symbolism for a text if thou wouldst be holy live with holy and spiritual things if thou wouldst avoid sin turn thy back upon the presentment of evil but you dont really suppose sir gregory ventured although of course the idea is beautiful that there is anything supernatural in the influence which those images might bring to bear upon any ones life my dear young man mr endacott expounded i do not even know what empires of thought the word supernatural covers i have pointed out the logical basis for such a teaching that is all we are in a world here where one does not lightly reject superstitions in the west there exists a great world reared to the gods of materialism unwarmed with the flame of spirituality the world of gold and stone and huge banking accounts and prosperous cities and hurrying hastening lives the western brain holds no corner for superstitions but casts them scornfully away live here for twenty years and you find the brain more elastic its cells more receptive even its philosophy less inevitably based upon the fundamental but dryasdust mathematical principles keep your image in its packing case mr gregory ballaston it will be time enough when you get home to search for the jewels the rickshaw which gregory had ordered came lumbering up the hill he rose with reluctance even in her stiff uncomfortable chair there was something very attractive about claire as she lay with her hands clasped behind her head the light of a lantern upon her suddenly thoughtful face he reflected however with a little thrill of pleasure that for six weeks she would be more or less his companion if we dont meet again before i sail sir he begged turning towards his host let me thank you for your hospitality it will be a great pleasure to see you and your niece in norfolk this must be our farewell for the present at any rate mr endacott said as he shook hands my niece is going on board early tomorrow morning as i myself have a meeting to attend in the afternoon my respects to your father we shall meet without a doubt in england and we gregory added in a lower tone as he bent over his young hostess fingers shall meet before then she looked up at him smiling they were young and he was very goodlooking nevertheless she was americantrained and it was in a spirit of frank comradeship that she replied i know that we shall have a lovely time on the voyage until tomorrow then gregory ballaston was carried down the rough road past the tangle of high modern buildingsrabbit warrens of humanitypast the plastered and wooden structures of older days with their curved roofs and narrow windows through the confused streets which at every step became more thronged towards the harbour taking very little note of his progress his thoughts engrossed his mind fixed upon one problem already the memory of that strange meal amidst surroundings so sordid that even the girls presence had been unable to modify them was becoming overshadowed his late hosts cold words of advice seemed to have made not the slightest impression upon him he thought of the small packing case in the pursers office with almost feverish impatience joyful of the permission to sleep on board for the night anxious only for the moment when he should reach the quay somehow or other endacotts serious stilted talk had immensely confirmed his belief in the existence of the jewels and as for the restthe warning he had receivedthis in all probability simply proceeded from the vapourings of a mind steeped in orientalism the mind of a scholar removed for half a lifetime from the whole world of common sense and possibilities morally he was as other young men he would have scorned to cheat or lie he had an inherited sense of honour and a sportsmans probity a mean action would have revolted himhe was capable of a great one he was a little selfish a little narrow in his pride of name and race as courageous as any man might be with the undoubted conceit of his class such as he was he had no fear of change he had never indulged in selfanalysis he accepted himself for what he was which on the whole was something a little better than the average he had no presentiment of even temporary illfortune as he stepped into the ships boat waiting by the quay and looked eagerly across the harbour to where the great steamer lay anchored with her blazing line of lights chapter iv at very nearly the hour of his former visit gregory ballaston entered the warehouse of messrs johnson and company on the following morning wu ling seated at his table waved away the stolidlooking native foreman to whom he was giving orders and glanced enquiringly at his visitor ship not gone he asked we dont sail until the afternoon gregory reminded him havent got all our fresh stores shipped or something i came back to have a talk do you mind wu lings gesture was noncommittal the young man continued last night he confided sinking into a chair i unpacked my image i took it out and looked at it with my porthole closed and my door locked although i imagine that now that the priests are dead there is no fear of my being followedwu ling i wish to god that you were an englishman why for i could talk to you more easily there was a brief silence wu ling stolid powerful imperturbable sat with his keen enquiring eyes fixed upon his visitor gregory showed signs of some slight relapse from his wellbeing of the day before his natural bronzed complexion which had almost reasserted itself seemed to have given place again to the pallor which denoted a sleepless night there were lines under his eyes a restlessness in his manner you found image bad company wu ling enquired i hate the beastly thing already gregory acknowledged wu ling clapped his hands softly together the screen of bamboos was pushed to one side and mr endacott appeared he had discarded his european clothes in favour of the dress of a native chinese gentleman and he carried a white umbrella our young friend again he remarked with a brief salutation wu ling pointed to a chair he wish talk to you mr endacott glanced at his watch before he sat down i am about to visit the head of the chinese university here he announced a man of rare intelligence and great learning why should i waste my time have you found the jewels in your image mr ballaston not a sign of them up to the present sir gregory admitted i am not very happy about them either as you know the whole thing was a pretty dangerous enterprise and ive only half succeeded the image is heavy enough but i cant see any possible aperture anywhere the recovery of the jewels mr endacott remarked leaning a little forward with his hands clasped upon the knob of his umbrella was scarcely likely to be a simple matter i realise that gregory confessed already i am beginning to feel a sort of hatred of the thing for the first time last night he went on i felt inclined to take seriously what wu ling here and you have said of these images that neither of them has any real existence separately side by side they have looked down upon that procession of worshippers through all these years side by side they must be you have told me according to the superstition if the jewels are to be found mr endacott inclined his head our young friend is showing signs of intelligence he admitted he is beginning to travel along the lines of the allegory if this is true gregory asked bluntly what is the use of my taking one to england and leaving the other here in this warehouse the only reason for such a course seems to be his companion murmured that one does not belong to you perhaps you can trade with the firm i myself am not a trader wu ling is wu ling i am sure is at your disposal how can i trade gregory demanded what do you suppose brought me out here on an enterprise like this love of adventure a good deal i grant you but behind it all sheer and absolute need of money we are poor in england today mr endacott we people with estates i havent the money to buy your image after my experience of last night i would rather consider an offer from you for mine wu ling smiled he talked for a moment in chinese to his companion the latter showed signs of agreement wu lings attitude is mine mr endacott pronounced if by any chance you had acquired the statue we possess and we had yours the firm of johnson and company would trade not now we are content then you dont believe in your own allegory gregory queried wu ling was looking into the dark recesses of the warehouse there was nothing to indicate that he had heard or understood but it was he who replied yes i believe in it he admitted we both believe in it but we have many jewels and i think that these will be hard to find if you had both the images gregory suggested you could break them up mr endacott raised his hand to his forehead as though in pain wu lings expression appeared unchanged yet somehow or other he gave one the impression of having listened with distaste to words of blasphemy you speak like a huckster from the new cities mr endacott said wearily they are great works of art these images sanctified by the years alive by virtue of their greatness to raise a hand against them would be barbarous besides wu ling and i believe the legend we believe that those will die who treat the images roughly gregory remained discontented he took a cigarette from the large wooden box which wu ling pushed towards him the box was of some sort of sandalwood but it too seemed to give out the peculiar odour of the place last night he confided when i sat alone with my image it came back to me how my father himself had insisted upon the necessity for securing both images he too must have been impressed by the legend hell think my errand a failure if i return with one without money how buy wu ling asked johnson and company we are traders for gold we sell anything on earth without gold how can buy it is a problem gregory admitted gloomily you had perhaps a proposition mr endacott suggested something of the sort that is why i came to see you this morning i wondered whether you would let me take your image to england with mine and whilst they were together have them examined in the british museum and see if any possible trace of opening or access to the interior of them is to be found of course i shall do that with mine when i get there anyhow but you see i am beginning to fall in line with your superstition i feel that both images ought to be treated at the same time and if the jewels should be discovered mr endacott enquired we would divide equally was gregorys prompt proposal wu ling a man not given to gestures beat the air in front of him gently with the fingers of his hands we would not agree he said i would not agree mr endacott would not agree our partner who is not here would not agree gregory frowned he followed wu lings steadfast gaze followed it into the further recesses of the second warehouse he began to think of the image he had lost the image in the steel chamber a sense of its beauty suddenly possessed him he coveted it passionately in a way he ventured the image which you have locked up there the image which you call the soul rather belongs to me dont you think i have at least a claim upon it i fought to secure it my friend lost his life in defending it wu lings smile was almost a genuine effort at mirth mr endacott chuckled sardonically if i were you young man he advised i dont think that i would pursue that line of argument it was stolen property gregory persisted doggedly and the stolen property was stolen mr endacott reminded him there was a silence an impasse seemed to have been reached it seemed indeed as though there were nothing more to be done no further argument he could use yet gregory ballaston sat as though rooted to the spot to leave the place with his desire unattained seemed almost a physical impossibility then unexpectedly wu ling spoke at some length what you come here to say he began has reason you come here with an idea which is right body and soul you cannot part your image without that one which belongs to johnson and company is a thing of evil the image we have locked in our treasure chamber is a thing of great beauty and no more you who desire the jewels cannot buy we to whom the jewels mean little will not sell listen to me young gentleman i propose something go on gregory begged eagerly you wu ling continued have a quality of the chinese in you or you would not have risked life for this adventure you are gambler me too i offer this i will gamble with you for the two images gregory ballaston held his cigarette away from his mouth and stared at the speaker temporarily at any rate his nonchalance had left him are you in earnest he demanded wu ling nodded gravely gregory glanced towards the professor the latter also inclined his head gently if wu ling says so he murmured gamble but how what games do we both know there is a chinese game wu ling began not having any gregory interrupted drily i have heard of these chinese games what about poker not understand wu ling regretted gregory sat for a moment or two deep in disturbed thought more than anything he had ever coveted in the world he coveted that other image look here he decided at last i accept but we dont need to play a game at all send for a pack of cards have them well shuffled and deal a card to each of us the highest wins wu ling nodded approvingly it is simple he assented we do that if you win my porters shall pack image and you can take it to ship if you lose you bring yours here gregory moistened his lips which were already a little dry it is agreed he said wu ling opened one of the lower drawers of his desk he searched for a few moments and then produced an ordinary pack of playing cards he laid them upon the table in here gregory demanded glancing at the silent forms always moving around them why not wu ling replied what we do is nothing to them they see nothing they work mr endacott chuckled as he took the cards in his hands and shuffled them you will lose young man he warned gregory ive seen a great many games of cards in this city but i have never yet seen a european who could hold his own against a chinese this isnt a game gregory pointed out its just a showdown my chance must be as good as his well make it the best of three though how wu ling queried politely a card each three times his partner explained and the one who wins twice out of three times gets the images it appears to me that i too am rather largely interested in this any choice as to who turns the first card up gregory shook his head cut the cards which were handed to him and passed them to wu ling the latter hesitated only for the fraction of a second then he threw one card to his opponent and one to himself gregorys card was a knave his own a queen one up to the firm mr endacott observed gregory took the cards his hands were beginning to shake he gave his opponent a four he himself threw down a ten one each he exclaimed trying his best to keep his tone level he shuffled and passed the cards across once more wu ling sat for a moment toying with them almost as though in silent prayer then he threw a card to gregory a king the latter cried exultantly and the firm has an ace mr endacott pointed out as wu lings card fell upon the table gregory sat staring at it motionless and rigid the light of triumph fading from his face there had been gamblers in his family though and heredity asserted itself he rose calmly to his feet ill go down and pack the image he said wu ling clapped his hands his expression had never varied he showed no signs even of content there will be porters who attend you he announced they will follow your rickshaw and bring back the image gregory held out his hand even then scarcely realising the position all this risk and privation for nothing his friends life for nothing all gone on the turn of a card for a moment the place with its strange atmosphere seemed unreal his adventure a nightmare then he heard wu ling giving orders to the foreman and saw him point to the harbour he choked down his feelings i shall not sympathise with you mr endacott said as he shook hands your enterprise has never commended itself to me and your possession of the body without the soul was never a thing to be envied gregory could not trust himself to reply he held out his hand to wu ling who took it gravely at least wu ling he said if you have spoilt my trip out here you saved my life i dont think its worth much but i thank you send the porters along he turned and left the place a tall slim figure graceful and trim in his wellfitting clothes the strangest contrast to the bluesmocked coolies and one or two native traders through whom he had almost to push his way he walked out into the broiling sun and disappeared mr endacott glanced at wu ling and wu ling with the cards in his hand smiled back at him the morning wore on the afternoon came and passed mr endacott who had spent a pleasant few hours with his chinese friend returned to find repose reigning throughout the rambling premises of messrs johnson and company a fierce sun had suddenly blazed once more through the drifting masses of mistgone now as breath from a lookingglass the water in the harbour was indigo blue the junks and dhows and native fishing craft were all becalmed like painted ships upon a still ocean the sirens blew no more all who could were at rest the porters in the warehouse had crept into the dark shady corners and lay there motionless half a dozen clerks young men of superior station who wore european clothes and babbled a little english had retired to the shelter of an adjoining tea house only wu ling sat still in his place waiting mr endacott took in the situation at a glance they have not returned our porters he enquired not yet and the ship sails it is past due endacott smiled the truth is as old as life he said the things which are written here are written behind the veil that young man came from what from a western point of view we used to think good stock his father was under me at oxford his grandfather and generations before him were men of good repute still that counts for nothing and we know why he has the body why wait wu ling you think that his word it is broken the latter asked broken to us who scorned even to watch him to the ship mr endacott shook his head he has the body he repeated there was a pattering of feet outside feet that passed swiftly across the pavement of blistered heat a little troop of porters entered and sought shelter the foreman advanced and stood silent before wu lings desk speak wu ling directed we waited on the dock the man recounted we waited in the heat hours went by then as the ship moved away the englishman leaned over the rail he called out to us there is nothing to send back then he disappeared so you returned wu ling murmured so we returned the man assented wu ling rose to his feet and stood at the window there was a clamour of sirens blowing through the sultry stagnant air a waving of handkerchiefs from a distant dock a great steamer was drifting out her bows set westward wu ling watched her gathering speed through the lazy sea leaving behind her a wake like a rope of snow in the deep blue of the waters which she parted the smoke belched from her funnels somewhere on board her was gregory ballaston and his booty endacott laid his hand upon the arm of wu ling whom he loved the young man has done ill he said but the soul is ours chapter v steward gregory asked him standing up in the centre of his stateroom his hands behind his back do i look drunk the steward was used to eccentric passengers and answered as though the question were an entirely reasonable one for a young gentleman as hasnt moved out of his stateroom for two days and as had a good deal more to drink than to eat he pronounced you look wonderful sir fetch me a whisky and soda then certainly sir the man withdrew closing the door behind him gregory drew back the curtain of his upper bunk and again with tireless eyes he stared at the treasure which had cost him his friends life and as it seemed to him sometimes now especially in those horrible watches of the night his own honour always there was the same fascination every time he looked he fancied that he discovered some fresh horror in that grim yet superbly bestial face you are ugly he said softly as he dropped the curtain you are damnably ugly i wish you were at the bottom of the sea and yet i cant part with you the steward brought him the whisky and soda he paused for a moment before drinking it whats your name he demanded perkins sir well then perkins he directed please see the second steward for me try to get me a small table in the saloon alone in a corner and i will go in to dinner tonight very good sir the man replied as he made his exit there will be plenty of room to sit just where you please until we get to bombay once more gregory pushed aside the curtain raised his glass and drained its contents his eyes fixed all the time upon the image he set down the empty tumbler thats what you like to see me drink isnt it he murmured softly youd like the whole world to be as foul as the things some devil has carved into your face yet i suppose i would forgive you if only you would give up your secret for the hundredth time he passed his fingers over the carved head fingers which were long and slim and sensitive of touch nowhere however could they discover the slightest sign of any join or any possible aperture however cunningly concealed the wood had become as smooth and hard as marble black as jet shining as though with generations of polish gregory drew the curtain and turned away baffled once more with his back turned to the image he made a long and deliberate toilet afterwards he lit a cigarette and for the first time since he had boarded the steamer ventured on deck to find only a few people promenading a dozen or so drinking cocktails in the smoking room there was no sign of the person he longed yet dreaded to see the heat was great but it was not unusually oppressive in the west a bloodred sun pencils of black cloud surrounding it seemed almost to be falling into the ocean gregory loitered about until long after the bugle had sounded and then summoning up all his courage descended to take his place in the saloon the second steward hurried forward to meet him and showed him his table he breathed a sigh of relief as he realised its isolation i have given you a table to yourself sir as perkins seemed to think you wanted it he announced but if you would care for a seat at the captains tablethat was where we had intended to put youit could be arranged now if you preferred it not on any account gregory begged earnestly ive been laid up must be quiet this exactly suits me he continued a conversation for some minutes accepted the wine list studied the menu gave his orders and finally ventured to look around she was there seated on the right hand of the captain her inevitable place under the circumstances their eyes met without hesitation she smiled a greeting gregory half rose in his place and bowed when he sat down he realised that both his hands were clenched the white of the knuckles showing through the skin his breath was coming a little quickly it was an absurd thing but he had a feeling that he had passed through one of the crises of his life there had been no message then from her uncleno wireless she knew nothing afterwards he came across her on deck talking to an elderly woman whom he realised must be the mrs hichens of whom she had spoken as a possible chaperone she turned round at once and welcomed him smilingly there was a shade of reproach in her tone i was beginning to wonder what had become of you mr ballaston she said let me present you to my chaperone mrs hichens gregory acknowledged the introduction and spent the next few minutes searching for and arranging their chairs i suppose i have been outrageously lazy he confessed when at last he had installed them that trip of mine into the interior which you heard me speaking of with your uncle was rather an exhausting affair some day you must tell me the whole story she begged the snatches i heard of it were most romantic you came back in wu lings trading schooner didnt you wu ling gregory confided saved my life and brought me back to the city i got into trouble i was certainly somewhere where i had no right to be and i was handed over to wu abst the famous pirate by a couple of fanatical priests with instructions that i was to become nourishment for the alligators wu ling heard about it at one of the villages where he was trading and released me it sounds like a page from somebodys novel doesnt it it was all very real at the time though they both looked at him curiously but the older woman had lived for some time in a country where few questions were asked and claire was more concerned with the shadow of either pain or sleeplessness which seemed to darken his face i can quite understand your feeling like a rest she said sympathetically i thought you looked terribly ill the day we met in the warehouse she picked up a book merely with the idea of giving him an opportunity to pass on if he cared to but after strolling about the deck aimlessly for a quarter of an hour he returned to find her with her book still unopened her mind as a matter of fact occupied with him and his story she accepted immediately his invitation to walk they went on to the upper deck and looked down together at the oily water with its streak of phosphorescence they talked of the ship of such of their fellow passengers as they had observed and of the route home with a certain obvious attempt at casualness conversation of little import yet almost a necessary steppingstone to more intimate understanding claires perceptions were keen enough for her to realise that this young man was scarcely in a normal condition you have had no wireless from your uncle or from the firm since you left he asked a little abruptly she shook her head you asked me that before she reminded him why on earth should i we said goodby early in the morning after the night you dined with us uncle would never dream of coming to see me off he hates steamers and he hates what he calls looking westwards how he will survive life in england i am sure i cant imagine except that he does sometimes still admit that english country life is wonderful he really means to come then why surely and you shall you like it she assented a little doubtfully i think i would rather live in new york she confessed but i cant fancy uncle there i think that would be expecting a little too much of him he still has friends and a few relatives in england pretty sporting of him to break away at all gregory observed after all these years i think it is marvellous she agreed i am sure if i hadnt come hed rather go on living in that strange smelly little house of his and read chinese manuscripts and interpret chinese hieroglyphics round old ornaments and talk chinese literature with some of the quaintestlooking people you ever saw up at the university than do anything else in the world all the same gregory remarked they say that a man should always return to the country of his birth to end his days besides china is no place for an englishman after a certain number of years hed become nothing but an old fossil without the society of his own kind what a nice consoling person you are she declared sometimes ive had it on my conscience a little that im taking him away from the things he likes best in life i shouldnt worry about that he told her hell be better at home amongst some of his old cronies and for youwell of course china would be utterly impossible i am very happy to be going to england she assured him i am looking forward to the country life immensely fond of games he asked her riding and tennis are the extent of my accomplishments she replied i like those and then after a year or so i shall hope to travel on the continent my aunt still has a great many friends in paris one meets so many american women and girls in france and italy he observed and so few men why are they such stay at homes they arent she explained they travel but they want something out of it they either prospect for mines or look for markets or something of that sort in a way then they too have the adventurers instinct i havent any head for business when the war endedi had been wounded twice and transferred into the intelligence departmentit chanced that i was in palestine and i went on from there to abyssinia from there i visited some friends in bombay and when i got home my father and i planned my little adventure in china you certainly are some traveller she admitted smilingly so was my father before me he confided he was in the diplomatic service for some time and lived in pekin during the days of the monarchy she suddenly looked around and saw the rising moon a bloodred circle emerging with incredible swiftness from the edge of a black sea she crossed the deck swiftly waving to him to follow her halfway there he paused she was standing full in the light shining through the uncurtained window of the marconi room tall slim and white in the windless nighta curiously and wonderfully desirable vision she turned and waved to him impatiently a smile of invitation upon her lips her eyes full of eager delight hurry she cried isnt it wonderful he came slowly across the deck and a little puzzled frown took the place of her smile as he drew near why do you look at me as though you had never seen me before she asked as he took his place by her side i never have with the same eyes he answered uneasily idiot she laughed well youll have to put up with me for at least six weeks like this dont you love the stillness with just the throb of the engine id like it better without the engine he observed it is beautiful enough here to make one believe that we are on our way to paradise and that wretched throb keeps on reminding us that our next stop is bombay arent you just a little inclined to be cynical tonight she asked i dont know quite whats the matter with me he answered restlessly i think that terrible country behind has broken my nerve or his thoughts flashed back to his stateroom she was suddenly intent upon listening from away upon the lower deck they could hear the sound of the orchestra her face lit up with pure joy dancing she cried i believe theyre dancing why i havent even heard the music since i left new york come along she had reached the companion ladder before he could catch her up already her feet were moving to the music look here he confided doubtfully remember ive been out of england for a very long time im not at all sure that i can manage these new steps she slipped her arm through his in friendly fashion youre the only man on board i know and youve got to she declared imperiously chapter vi perkins gregory demanded as he struggled into his dinner coat a few nights later what should you think if i told you to drop that grinning piece of wooden monstrosity there into the sea the steward glanced doubtfully over his shoulder at the image its a damned ugly piece of goods sir he admitted but i shouldnt make away with it like that its very likely valuable they give no end of money sometimes for genuine bits of stuff from china way gregory straightened his tie and looked at his treasure fixedly perkins he confided that image is either worth a few hundred or perhaps a thousand pounds as an antique or it may be worthlisten to mea million the steward coughed he was inclined to think that this passenger of his on whom the slackness of the season had enabled him to bestow more than his normal share of attention was a trifle cracked if it is worth as much money as that sir he remarked it would be a sin to think of getting rid of it youre quite right gregory assented it would be a sin well let it stay where it is at his table in the dining saloon he trifled with his dinner and covertly watched the girl seated by the captains side who on his entrance had sent him a little wave of welcome he had worshipped more or less casually at the shrine of girls and women of all ages but never with quite the same restless and fitful confusion of feeling as had swept over him occasionally during the last few days in her near presence or at the thought of her in his sleepless hours she was he tried to tell himself as he studied her with eyes that attempted to be critical an ordinary pleasantlooking goodlooking attractive girl like hundreds of others of her age too young and too lacking in experience to justify a great passion her yellow hair her one real beauty was brushed backwards with a touch almost of severity a fashion however which the vivacity of her face justified her eyes he had to admit were unusual grave and tender sometimes full of the sparkle of humour when as now she was engaged in lighthearted conversation her mouth was perhaps almost too sensitive but it was beautifully shaped and not oversmall he watched her rise and walk out of the saloon a girls figure still but with just a suggestion of coming power in her easy flowing movements he had known more beautiful women there were more beautiful women to be seen every day in bond street he told himself with an almost fierce desire to deny her attractiveness but she possessed a gift which baffled him he only knew that the idea of that message which without a doubt she must at some time or other receive from her uncle was like a nightmare to him he felt instinctively how meanness of any sort dishonour and falsehood would appeal to her with her youthful uncompromising standards her lack of experience she would belie that sensitive mouth and the kindliness of her eyes where an older woman might have sympathised she would have no pity and with it all his mind was in a state of turmoil about her unaccustomed sensations tortured him the flash of her welcoming glance had set his pulses tingling he finished his wine leaving most of his dinner untasted and instead of going on deck returned to his stateroom thrust aside the curtain and looked fiercely almost challengingly at his treasure as he looked he felt once more a certain change in himself and his impulses suddenly felt the torture of a sacrilegious thought an instinct horrible at one moment alluring the next he suddenly threw the cigarette case which he was holding at the face which mocked him blast you he cried the case truly enough thrown recoiled from the unchanging hardness of that lowering forehead and fell spilling its contents upon the bunk he recovered it with trembling fingers listening all the time to the music of the distant orchestra he had a sudden impulse to lock the door and stay where he was an impulse swept away a moment later by an unconquerable desire to be moving to the music with claire in his arms from the door he ventured upon one last unwilling glance upwards he could have sworn that for the fiftieth time that expression had changed there was a light almost of suggestion in those sightless orbs a curl of sardonic contempt in the thick lips he hurried up on to the deck and leaned for a moment over the rail his eyes looking across the sea nerves he told himself slowly nerves the doctor passed him with a cheery good evening gregory called out to him just a moment doctor youll be in disgrace the latter remarked theyre dancing already come and have a liqueur in my room first thank you gregory replied they made their way to the lower deck and into the doctors quarters the latter excused himself for a moment whilst he prepared some medicine afterwards he opened his cupboard produced a bottle of brandy and two liqueur glasses and pushed a box of cigarettes across the table whats wrong with you young fellow he asked a little abruptly nerves gregory answered do you believe in them to some extent was the cautious reply how are they getting at you im haunted by an evil spirit gregory declared lighting a cigarette its there a wooden image behind a curtain down in my stateroom now get ready to laugh i assure you doctor every moment i spend with that damned thing makes me feel more of a rotter where did you get it the doctor enquired curiously gregory glanced towards the closed door i am not sure whether it is wise to tell you he replied but as a matter of fact it is a small statue of a famous chinese god it is meant to represent all the gross side of a mans life it is meant to depict every evil that can haunt the sinner the doctor suddenly leaned forward in his chair you dont mean to tell me that you were mixed up in the nilkaya affair he exclaimed youre not one of the englishmen who looted the place ive got one of the images here anyway gregory admitted there was a report that you were both dead my pal is although he was taking on what we thought the simplest part of the job they got me a dozen of those priests fought like furies the fellows did i was to have been food for the alligators but i was rescued on the river by a trader from the coast the doctor looked at his companion with amazement no wonder youve got nerves he observed youve been through something ive been through hell gregory admitted the fight wasnt so bad but i was two days strapped up on that pirate ship with not a mouthful to eat in a foul atmosphere and expecting to be thrown overboard at any moment i had a certain amount of luck i got clear as you see and ive got one of the images it is supposed to be chock full of jewels and yet im half inclined to chuck the damned thing overboard the doctor smiled reassuringly i wont say anything of the morality of the enterprise he declared but you had a fine plucky adventure and when you talk about throwing the image overboard youre talking like an ass set your heel upon all this superstitious nonsense ballaston and go on as usual believe me youll be none the worse for possessing that piece of wood you create the evil in yourself when you allow yourself to believe that the things likely to do you harm the worlds old enough for us to realise the nature of most of its organic forces the malice of nine hundred years ago may have been carved into that image but it cant come out again gregory drew a little sigh of relief of course youre right he acquiesced and yet cut out the and yets the doctor interrupted get up on deck now and dance thats whats good for you be normal and dont harbour any thought that hasnt a definite and reasonable origin see you later i may come up and have a turn myself gregory hurried on deck to be greeted a little reproachfully by claire how dare you keep me waiting she complained the orchestra have never played better and ive been nearly crazy sitting here by myself dont lets waste a minute now you have come they were out of the region of storms the awning had been rolled away and they danced on the outside deck with the orchestra half concealed in a little lounge the minutes passed by in a sort of enchantment from fox trots they passed to waltzes both utterly unconscious that sometimes they were the only two dancing suddenly claire drew back and looked at her companion why i believe youre tired she exclaimed do lets stop no well go on he answered quickly the music seemed to have gained a new and more passionate throb the starlit night seemed to be leaning down to close them in there was a breath of magic in the languid air in the perfume from her hair and clothes swimming out into the stillness her eyes for a moment had half closed in faint response to the joy of it all his arm suddenly tightened around hertightened stop she ordered quickly he obeyed at once she looked at him with an expression of amazement in which was almost a gleam of terror then she turned away im tired she said i want to speak to mrs hichens please dont come he knew better than to follow her to protest to attempt any explanation he made his way to the smoking room and drank two whiskies and sodas the steward looked at him curiously hot work dancing tonight sir he observed hot as hell gregory answered give me another drink he was served immediately afterwards he stepped back on to the deck claire had disappeared he went up to a woman whom he had previously avoided with sedulous carea grass widow goodlooking still in a way but overanxious overobvious overperfumed she rose to her feet with astonishing alacrity at his unexpected invitation a moment later they danced off into the darkness the smokingroom steward took gregory to his stateroom that night and the faithful perkins summoned from his own repose undressed him he went to sleep with a chuckle upon his distorted lips im with you old fellow he muttered waving his hand feebly to his unseen companion youre the chap for us ballastons glad i got youand not the other chapter vii the doctor a few days later paused in his morning promenade and took a vacant place by claires side he made a few commonplace remarks about the voyage and then leaned confidentially towards her miss endacott i want to speak to you for a moment if i may about young ballaston the sensitive lips quivered a little nevertheless she had selfcontrol well doctor i dont exactly know what has happened of course he went on but you two were such pals at first and now one cant help noticing that you scarcely speak ballaston hasnt said a word to me this is all on my own but i imagine that somehow or other he has succeeded in offending you he has she acquiesced coldly i dont hold any brief for the young man the doctor proceeded but i cant help wondering whether you know what hes been through just lately hes had a wonderful adventure and played his part like a man i wont say a word about the morality of it or the object of it or anything else ill only say that it was a jolly plucky thing to attempt and he only escaped with his life by a miracle i have heard all this claire admitted it is always after an exploit of this sort that one runs a danger of suffering from nerves thats precisely whats happened to young ballaston in his stateroom down below he has that image which he risked his life for and hes adopted the legend about it in a way i should never have dreamed a young fellow with his strength of character could have done you know the legend i have heard it well ballaston honestly believes that every hour he spends with this image is doing him harm morally and that very belief is apt to make him behave at odd times impossibly the thing wont last of course hell get used to it and the idea will pass out of his brain it is there just now and i tell you frankly that i believe it is likely to influence his actions there was more and more interest in claires face a little tinge of returning colour she leaned forward the icy note had gone from her tone how extraordinary she exclaimed iwell to tell you the truth doctor the other night when we were dancing when i was offended i thought that he had had too much to drink the doctor shook his head it wasnt that at all he assured her gravely now mind you miss endacott im not defending ballaston i dont even know what the cause of offence wascertainly im not trying to interfere in any waybut he is suffering and suffering terribly and it isnt doing him any good to be cut off from you if you could just remember that you might be able to help him perhaps more than any one else i will remember she promised thank you very much indeed the doctor took his leave and claire sat gazing out to sea with a kindlier expression in her face a few minutes later gregory left the smoking room and seeing her was turning the other way she called to him softly mr ballaston he glanced around in surprise mr ballaston please come here for a moment he approached slowly and stood before her bareheaded as she looked at him her pity increased his eyes were very brilliant but they seemed to have sunken and he was certainly thinner in the face will you sit down and talk to me for a little time please she invited if you wish me to he replied diffidently i think that perhaps i was silly about the other night she went on i perhapsmisunderstood you didnt he groaned please dont say that she begged i want to believe that i did and i want you to please be nice to me again and be different has any one been talking to you he asked the doctor spoke a few words she admitted it is sweet of you he declared dejectedly but you mustnt believe the doctor altogether it isnt exactly nerves i was never much good and youre such a child im not good enough now to talk and dance with you on equal terms i feel this all the time for two days i have hated you because it is through you i know what i am and i dont mind telling you that i hate you he went on because because she questioned because i care for you more than any one else in the world he concluded she laughed but very kindly her eyes were softer than he had ever seen them and there was a new flush in her cheeks it is just as silly for you to say that as the other she declared considering that i have known you exactlywhat is iteleven twelve days now could we talk nonsense please or go for a walk we start again and you seei trust you i shouldnt he warned her gloomily im not trustworthy and youll find it out before long ill wait until i do she decided come along this morning i need movement it isnt nearly so hot and there hasnt been any one to do things with the last few days well play deck tennis on the upper deck and then go for a swim they passed the whole morning together the doctor seeing them waved his hand cordially the captain stopped and exchanged a few goodhumoured words everything seemed to be once more as it should be gregory was quite as distinctly the bestlooking and most attractive young man on board as claire was the most charming girl and nearly every one seemed pleased that the little misunderstanding which had kept them apart was apparently removed gossip not illnatured but natural enough recommenced gregory heir to a baronetcy poor perhaps but with a romantic career for a young man and claire whose uncle was a partner in the great firm of johnson and companya most suitable affair late in the afternoon they found a cool corner in the bows and gregory read poetry his voice naturally a beautiful one with its slight oxford peculiarities fascinated claire she listened with joy as he passed from shelley to keats and wound up with swinburne afterwards the captain took them into his room for tea and they sat talking until it was almost time to change they descended from the bridge together tonight claire exclaimed happily we dance gregory made no reply for a single moment a little shiver seemed to pass through him she turned and smiled reassuringly i am looking forward to it so much she murmured im sure we are both going to love it the doctor swung by as gregory was changing for dinner gregory hailed him just one moment he called out the doctor paused and put his head in the staterooma large one on the upper promenade deck and easily accessible i want to thank you gregory said earnestly for speaking to miss endacott everything all right again the other asked smiling quite thanks to you was the wellsatisfied reply i hope to god i dont give myself away again come in and have a look at my evil genius the doctor came a little farther into the room and examined the image through his eyeglasses jove its amazing he exclaimed amazingly powerful diabolically gregory muttered the doctor was clearly fascinated by the image his fingers passed over it with the soft touch of a connoisseur he stood back and viewed it from another angle ballaston he said there isnt a sculptor in the west today who could produce a piece of work like that its stupendous i think i shall tell my steward to send it down below into safe keeping somewhere gregory suggested turning away and lighting a cigarette dont you think it would be a good idea the doctor shook his head i think it would be a damned bad idea he answered now look here young fellow he went on putting his hand on gregorys shoulder how old are you thirtyone if at your time of life the doctor continued you once begin to give way to what your brain and real consciousness tell you is an idea youll be a victim to what they call nerves all your life youve never been affected before like this have you never gregory declared earnestly one doesnt want to talk about oneself but i got my medals in france and a jolly close shave of the big thing ive shot big game and ive come out of tight corners once or twice without turning a hair thats why i dont understand this good the doctor exclaimed that confirms me in what i was saying square up to it man dont be all the time flinching away like you are now look at it look at it with me arm in arm it is just a damned but wonderful representation of wickedness there is nothing alive about it except its art it isnt going to do you any harm and it isnt going to do me any harm let it stay where it is ballaston fastened his tie slowly considering the advice thoughtfully you mean that doctor he demanded you see when im sane i have the utmost respect andi can say it to youaffection for miss endacott shes only a child of course but shes wonderful its such a horrible thought that i might chuck it the doctor interrupted tersely you wont remember if you give way now you will give way all your life come in and have a last drink with me before you turn in tonight and i bet youll be jolly glad youve stuck it outi must get along now got a patient expecting me before dinner he swung off large buoyant diffusing an atmosphere of confidence gregory finished his dressing strolled along the deck and found mrs hichens and claire he took them all into the little lounge where they drank cocktails together gregory was suddenly in joyous spirits and claire thoroughly responsive they made plans for the next few days and ended up with a race round the deck the course being kept clear by a little handful of amused passengers the captain coming upon them breathless just as the bugle sounded invited gregory to his table for dinner and gregory his unsociability altogether dispersed proved a most attractive guest of his own exploits he tried to talk as little as possible but the ballastons had been a family well known in sporting and political circles for generations and there were plenty of anecdotes to be told of english life for claires amusement a general engaged him in kindly reminiscences of france and he found an old etonian and a junior diplomat on his way home from japan they sat at table until long after the others had left and the music had already commenced when they trooped up the gangway what a wonderful evening claire exclaimed delightedly and now we are going to dance the orchestra welcomed them back again with kindly smiles the lanterns which enclosed the little space of deck were like fairy lights the music streamed out to them even its ordinary melodies somehow beautified by their own sense of wellbeing and the glamour of their surroundings claire danced from pure love of graceful movement from that agelong impulse of rhythm which passes behind history into legend gregory a born athlete and lightfooted as an indian suffering nothing from his ignorance of the more modern steps once or twice they rested but always impatiently always with their senses tingling with the joy of rhythmical motion it was not until the end of the programme that claire realised suddenly that her companion had been dancing during the last few minutes with unusual stiffness he was pale and breathing more quickly than usual how selfish of me she exclaimed of course you are tired let us sit out for a few minutessomewhere where the music doesnt haunt us they found two chairs in a retired corner gregory seemed to have thrown off his reserves to have become once more fluent and discoursive his voice lowered because of occasional promenaders had developed an almost passionate timbre there was a light in his eyes which half puzzled half thrilled her his hands sought her fingers underneath the rug which they shared she suffered him to hold them for a moment before she drew them gently away i have never forgotten he told her how i saw you first you came into that crazy old warehouse with its piles of silks and rugs and carpets and shelves of jade and china and its quaint odour the perfume of china and the east you threaded your way through that group of chinamen in that spotless white dress of yours in the hat with the yellow flowers like something fresh and sweet from a new worldfrom a world where the sun didnt bake and shrivel everything to dust or those dank humid mists make slime of the ground underneath she laughed softly i think the poetry of this afternoon is lingering in your brain she said still i dare say it was strange to see an american girl with a new york frock amongst all that medley you must have thought our little house stranger yet can you imagine my uncle surrounded with all those beautiful things living between bare walls and with oilcloth upon the floor andam i very greedywith such a terrible cook are you shocked at me for my materialism you know i never pretended to be anything else i love life as it comes to me day by day with just the things it brings and i love life as i find it now he whispered it seems too wonderful to think that you too are on your way to england and that were going to be almost neighbours but you are never at home she reminded him with a smile ive had nothing to keep me at home he rejoined in the future it may be different already i begin to feel that my love of wandering is finished perhaps she suggested softly we had better dance she rose to her feet and he acquiesced at once as he leaned towards her his face as white as marble in the moonlight he was undoubtedly handsome yet once again she caught a glimpse of something in his eyes which filled her with a vague uneasiness yes well dance he assented youre teaching me to understand what dancing means the last timewhen was italexandria i believe he stopped abruptly confused by a turbulent flood of memory they moved away to the music in and out of the string of lights rocking now in an unexpected night breeze claire danced still with the joy of her youthful strength and gracious temperament once or twice when gregorys arm seemed to be drawing her a little closer she freed herself slightly once she caught a flash of that disturbing glint in his eyes but she only laughed at her own uneasiness please dont look so terribly in earnest she begged him dancing is one of the happiest things in the world we must keep that feeling always with us the music came to an abrupt finish claire looked across at the leader of the orchestra in dismay but it was too late for intervention already the first notes of god save the king had been struck well it has been lovely she declared i suppose i must go and look for mrs hichens come and have a lemon squash first he begged the steward served them out on deck gregory drank a whisky and soda as though it had been water lets sit out for a time he suggested it is too warm to sleep down below ill fetch some more rugs she shook her head and rose regretfully to her feet it has been delightful she admitted but after all it is eleven oclock they strolled along the deck suddenly he gripped her by the arm they were passing his stateroom perkins was moving about and the light was lit he pointed in through the wideopen door only a few feet away let me show you my evil genius he begged she hesitated for a moment then with the steward smilingly standing on one side for her to enter her hesitation seemed ridiculous she crossed the threshold as perkins disappeared with a suave good night gregory stood by her side and pointed to the image she gave a little gasp for several moments neither of them spoke they both gazed at it intently claire with wondering horror gregory fighting against some sympathetic suggestion in the cynical brutality of the thick mocking lips what a ghastly thing to own she cried the hand which had been holding her arm was suddenly round her waist look at it by moonlight he whispered in her ear the forefinger of his other hand touched the switch they were almost in darkness his eyes suddenly seemed to be blazing into hers she felt the burning of his lips even as they drew near there was something sweet but vaguely evil in his tone claire you are adorable she wrenched herself freefree from arms which had seemed to be closing like a vice round her away from lips whose very proximity seemed to scorch she staggered through the door as she stood there on the deck the light flashed out again and gregory suddenly it seemed almost calm stood upon the threshold a courteous but sardonic farewell upon his lips good night he said you realise now perhaps what it is for a man to live with so evil a thing she swayed as she neared the companionway and steadied herself in her descent by the banisters when she reached her room she locked the door behind her and threw herself upon the bedgregory had moved back into his stateroom his fist hard and clenched was within a few inches of the leering mouth you damned swine he exclaimed with all his calmness gone a hoarse fury breaking his voice youyou accursed spirit his voice suddenly failed an overpowering impulse seized him he took the image into his arms rushed through the open door across the deck and leaned over the rail find your own hell he shouted and dashed it downwards chapter viii in the morning gregory awoke after a wonderfully sound sleep it was still very early there was a delightful pearly light in the sky visible through his open porthole the glitter of the barely risen sun lay faint upon the ocean he remained for a few minutes breathing quietly trying to recall the events of the night before they came back to him with a shock followed by an immense sense of relief he remembered what he had done without a thought of regret he had cast away the fruits of his enterprise the possibility of wealth and he was full of rejoicing in those few seconds of glad thought the world seemed a different place wealth after all but a trifling part of its joys youth and love suddenly great and wonderful things a clearer light seemed to be pouring in upon some possible future a new atmosphere of happiness encircling him he sprang out of bed he would have an early bath and send a note round to claire she must forgive she must understand she must realise the sacrifice he had made then as he reached for his dressing gown he felt as though he were turned to stone up on its accustomed place its eyes meeting his its lips mocking him was the image he stood looking at it for once genuinely terrified then he pressed the bell feverishly and stood there with his thumb upon the knob until perkins came running in where the hell did that come from he demanded pointing to the image perkins smiled with the air of one who imparts good tidings the bosun sent it up early this morning sir he explained it was in one of the lower boats swung out from the main deckgone right through the canvas but there isnt a scratch on it gregory drew on his dressing gown and staggered out on to the deck he walked up and down for an hour and a half fighting a distinct and definite battle and with every step he took it seemed to him that he became saner his waking idea took shape gave him encouragement and life with his craving for what it might have to give abandoned the power of the image too for evil must decline he wanted those jewels no longer he was ready to face life and all its possibilities from a new standard he went down to his bath visited the barber and dressed before any of the passengers were astir then he made his way into the writing room and drew paper and ink towards him he wrote fluently and without hesitation all that he wished to say seemed so clear these few lines dear bring my prayer to you for pardon the doctor talks of nerves well i never suffered from them and i would as soon believe in the supernatural i believe that there is evil in my treasure last night in a fit of selfdisgust i tried to throw it overboard but it was caught by one of the canvascovered boats on the lower deck and when i awoke this morning it was back in its accustomed place if your answer to this note is what i pray for it will be overboard before we meet and overboard in such a place that it will sink to the bottom of the sea will you marry me claire as soon as we reach england and my father and your uncle can meet and give their consent i dont pretend that i am a particularly desirable person but i am at any rate not too bad to realise that you are the dearest and sweetest thing i have ever met or to fail in keeping my word when i promise that you shall never regret it if you say yes i havent a great deal to offer you beyond my love but that i offer to you not in the spirit of last night in the shadow of that accursed image but earnestly and faithfully and eternally please send me just a line the black buddha waits to know his fate and i mine gregory perkins took the note and after his departure gregory climbed to the upper deck and stood there leaning over the rail forgetting even to smoke watching the sun mount a little higher and spread its gleams a little farther across the ocean watching the blue haze of coming heat blot out the clearness of the horizon waiting with an eagerness utterly unfamiliar with a sense of having suddenly changed personalities with some simpler and stronger being at last the head and shoulders of perkins appeared coming up the ladder your breakfast is in your room sir he announced as he handed over the note he was carrying gregory made no reply he was looking at the handwriting upon the envelope rather faint and delicate not too legible for a moment or two he turned the note over he absolutely feared to open it a wave of pessimism had seized him then he suddenly tore the envelope across and read dear mr ballaston i am so sorry but i cannot say yes i appreciate your letter and i try to sympathise with what lies behind it but to be quite honest i cannot just now believe in you i do not myself believe in the supernatural nor can i bring myself to believe in the superstition of which you speak i can therefore only think of you as one whom i was beginning to like very much indeed but who has disappointed me bitterly i am sorry but that is how i feel and it is useless for me to pretend otherwise if you wish to be kind please keep away it is foolish of course but you see i am a little lonely here and after what has happened i shall feel so much happier not to find myself alone with you again claire endacott gregory read the letter twice then sent it fluttering away in little white fragments watching them fall like snowflakes upon the sea afterwards he descended to his stateroom he sat on his camp stool stirred his coffee and looked across at the image then with his left hand he kissed his fingers to it i give you best my friend he groaned count me your disciple gregory was on deck even before his accustomed time he showed unusual interest in the ships run and greeted claire when she appeared very late and looking pale and tired with the casualness of a steamer acquaintance he talked lightly with mrs hichens exchanged remarks with his other fellow passengers and notwithstanding the slight air of aloofness which was habitual to him he took a prominent part in the sports of the day he conducted an auction pool with success and he refused no mans invitation to drink at night though when the dancing started he obstinately refused to leave the smoking room pleaded a weak ankle and confessed to an inordinate thirst the doctor came in and sat beside him more trouble he asked quietly gregory shrugged his shoulders no particular trouble he replied im rather fed up with dancing besides which i have worn through the soles of my only pair of patent shoes is miss endacott in a similar predicament the doctor enquired i see that she is not on deck miss endacott is probably reading one of paleys sermons to mrs hichens he answered a little sarcastically i wonder why the devil some one doesnt look after your libraries on board ship doctor there are no less than eleven different volumes of sermons there no doubt you got them cheap but who wants them especially on a voyage where one is supposed to send ones morals overland the doctor rose to his feet there is nothing i can do for you he asked nothing gregory replied have a drink the doctor shook his head i am in earnest he persisted i am still at your disposal if you want a sleeping draught im your man or an ambassadorwell im here otherwise it happens to be otherwise gregory declared a little brutally perkins gregory ballaston asked sitting up in his bunk a few mornings later and gazing distastefully at his tea was i very drunk last night no more than usual sir was the mans somewhat gloomy answer the chief steward in the second class sent for me and i brought you up myself gregory sighed bad perkinsbad he admitted i ought not to have gone there at all was iermisbehaving more than usual you seemed to be making a little free with the young women down there if i might say so sir perkins replied gregory poured himself out some tea well it was the last night anyhow he said with an air of relief i am landing at marseilles i have packed most of your things sir the man announced i expect theyll bustle the overland passengers off the ship as quickly as possible were a good many hours late as it is and the train will be waiting i am going the other way gregory confided i have a strange feeling perkins that i am likely to win at monte carlo i have been there twice before and lost pretty well all i possessed at the moment this time i feel like winning anyway i am going to try my luck when shall i be able to finish your packing sir whenever you like and as soon as you like i dont care for this ship perkins youre a good fellow and youve looked after me very well but i dont like the rest of them any more than they like me you wouldnt say that i was a popular person on board would you perkins the man made no reply for a moment he was occupied thrusting the trees into some evening slippers if i might make so bold sir he said at last you have only yourself to thank for what people think you have acted queerly more than once sir a fact gregory murmured a damnable fact and i dont hold the man went on with this sitting in the smoking room taking a drink with anybody who comes along and going down to the second class when theres plenty of your own sort on board sir youre a sound fellow perkins gregory admitted as he swung out of his bunk is my bath ready waiting sir and perkins gregory continued as he struggled into his dressing gown some time this morning i want you to bring me some packing cloth and get the carpenter to find you a box i cant take my image about like that im going to send it home to my fathera little souvenir of my visit to china i think it might brighten up the household ill fetch you the packing cloth and box sir with pleasure perkins assented looking up at the image dubiously but if it belonged to me i know what i should do with it gregory paused enquiringly the steward was still looking over the rail of the bunk with an expression of disgust i should chuck it overboard and have done with it sir but it is valuable gregory expostulated swinging his towel worth a lot of money perkins no one knows quite how much but its worth a great deal of money taint for its looks anyway the man muttered gregory went through his usual morning routinehis bath the swim the gymnasium and the coiffeur afterwards he made a leisurely toilet in his stateroom slipped out on to the deck at a moment when it was almost deserted and walked across to the smoking room with swift footsteps lithe and graceful notwithstanding the debauch of the night before carefully dressed as usual his eyes as bright as ever no sign of evil living in his clear complexion yet for all his presentability no one knew better than he that he had gradually become the most unpopular person upon the ship the captain had taken to looking the other way when he passed the doctors nod was of the curtest mrs hichens never pretended not to cut him claire alone on the few occasions when they passed or met face to face bowed gravely sometimes even exchanged a word of greeting she still spent the time on deck as usual but always with mrs hichens by her side one or two of the women with whom he had exchanged a few civilities still looked wistfully for him when the dancing beganhis grass widow had indeed boldly attempted to waylay him one evening on his return from the dining saloon gregory however lied with cynical impudence declared that he had sprained his ankle and would not dance again for the rest of the voyage and then promptly walked alone for an hour through the summer darkness on the upper deck on another occasion an enterprising young woman whose courage was greater than her discretion sought him out in the smoking room and tried to gain his confidence she rejoined her friends after a very brief absence a little ruffled gregorys politeness was icy but on one point he seemed to have made up his mind he was ready to gamble with any one to drink with any one but so far as the women were concernedthe women of his own quarter of the shiphe avoided them with a finality which admitted of no advances he played cards all through the long summer days and moonlit mediterranean nights for stakes much higher than the ships officers approved of but he never approached the dancing spaces or entered the music room where the ladies congregated rumour went about that he had been sent to coventry and as was natural on an eastern liner there were no end of scandalous stories one of them and a name he happened to overhear and he gave the smoking room something to gossip about for the rest of the day he rose from his seat and approached the little group may i ask your name sir he enquired of the man who had told the story a large man well under medium age but puffy and loudvoiced why you surely may was the prompt reply richard thomson weve played cards together more than once well mr thomson gregory said i have to tell you that i dislike the mention of ladies names in a smoking room i dislike it so much especially when allied with scandalous fiction that i am going to throw you out on to the deck the man tried bluster but he fared the worse for it he picked himself up sprawling from somewhere near the rails and spent his morning trying to interview various officers of the ship the purser at last was commissioned to approach gregory i have a complaint mr ballaston he announced a little stiffly from mr thomson he asserts that you used violence to him in the smoking room quite correct was the deliberate reply i dont like him i shall probably throw him out again if he comes in an affair of this sort is not to be treated so lightly sir the purser declared i must request some sort of an explanation or else that you apologise to mr thomson gregory considered for a moment very well he said i will offer you this much of an explanation i heard mr thomson make use of the name of a young lady in the smoking room he coupled her name with a story which although it may not have reflected any positive discredit upon her was yet untrue i object to the use of ladies names in a smoking room and i did what i should have done at any time in my life and what i should do again this afternoon and again tomorrow if necessaryi threw him out as to apologising to himi will fight him with one hand or standing on one leg or i will shoot at him and let him shoot at me from any mark he likes or give him what is termed satisfaction in any such manner as he can suggest but sooner than apologise i would throw him overboard first and spend the rest of the voyage in irons myself if necessary the pursers face relaxed i will report your explanation to the captain mr ballaston he promised nothing more was heard of the matter thomson somewhat ostentatiously played bridge out on deck with his friends and gregory suddenly sick of his smokingroom companions invaded the ships library and abjured cards he drew a great sigh of relief when at last amidst the screaming of tugs and a strange silence in the engine room they were brought in to marseilles docks he lingered about for an hour after the gangways were down hoping to be the last to leave the ship in the customs shed however when he made his belated appearance there he came face to face with claire and mrs hichens the latter ignored him claire held out her hand goodby mr ballaston she said gregory was taken aback he could not refuse her hand but he could find no words mrs hichens walked on they were for a moment alone together i am very sorry she continued that i had to answer your letter as i felt i am trying to forget all that is disagreeable in our friendship and remember only how thoroughly we enjoyed the first part of the voyage will you please do the sameand goodby she was gone with a friendly little nod before he could gasp out any more than a muttered monosyllable for a moment he almost followed her then he realised a certain finality about that gesture and turned away before he had finished with the customs the paris train had left he stood for a while at the barrier looking after it almost wistfully his thoughts travelling homeward it was late spring now there would be a scent of violets in the air cowslips coming up in the meadows honeysuckle in the hedges and sweeter than anything the wild roses making their faint appearance he thought of the rambling stately gardens at the hall the odour of the late hyacinths the warmth of the sun on the day when the gardeners opened the potting sheds and brought out the geraniums he could hear the lazy humming of the mowing machines the soft splash of water from the fountain on one of the terraced lawns it was a very beautiful home there waiting for him povertystricken perhaps a little silent a long way aloof from the throb and thrill of life the willothewisp of happiness which he had pursued so tirelessly which he was in quest of again even now then he had a sudden vision of claire and of showing her the house the gardens the park the woods beyond the peace of it the softly flowing waters of the trout stream the hum of insects he had a vision of claire too seated at the carriage window looking out perhaps herself not wholly happy perhaps even at that moment with a tear in those still tender eyes the sweetness of her the sweetness which he had terrified the childishness which that accursed image would have had him disturb it was like a black cloud upon his mind and thoughts then a raucous voice in his ear il faut vous depecher denregistrer vos bagages pour monte carlo monsieur le rapide arrive his fit of dreaming passed and he came back to the world of small everyday things went through the tiresome formality of registering his luggage found a place in an empty compartment dozed and dreamed a little more and finally was dragged behind a screaming locomotive into the curiously unimpressive station of monte carlo the hills behind glittering with lights the long sea front curving away into italy he shook himself and descending made his way to the hotel bathed and changed and sat down to write a few momentous lines home hotel de paris monte carlo my dear father i have come here from marseilles for a few days perhaps longerit depends upon the luck meanwhile you will receive from tilbury soon after the ship docks the image we got away with you wont like it if i were to tell you how i loathed it you would think i was mad but from the practical point of view everything that i heard in china confirms your story in either this image or the other one which alas fell into the hands of a firm called johnson and company who have branches nearly everywhere in the east are packed the whole of the treasures of the yuntse temple have an expert examine it but dont do anything about breaking it up until i return there are reasons against this i suppose everything is as usualno money heavier taxation plenty of debts and uncle henry denying himself even a new suit of clothes i hope madame progresses and that her new doctor will be able to work the great miracle here is an amazing coincidence of which you will hear more before you see me in the last letter i wrote you i told you about my adventure on the yuntse river and wu ling the chinese trader who rescued me well wu ling is a member of the firm of johnson and company the great eastern merchants and one of his partners is ralph endacott who used to have a chair at oxford a great oriental scholar andas you perhaps knowmadames brother he has a very delightful niece whom i saw something of on the voyage home he himself is winding up his affairs and coming to england shortly they have some idea i believe of taking a house in norfolk endacott himself is a somewhat austere person who looked upon my enterprise with a good deal of disfavour and myself i am afraid with more the niece however is perfectly charming well i shall be home for the summer i got through all right without a scratch as you know but for the first time in my life i think i have a touch of nerves the shadow of our elms ought to help ill write again as soon as i have decided when to come home thanks for your last letter i dont think you need send any money if i want it ill wire ever yours gregory gregory dined alone receiving the warm welcome of the maitres dhotel with whom he was acquainted and the other supernumeraries of the great hotel afterwards he went across and took out his cards of admission to the casino flung a few counters on one of the outside tables in the kitchen and losing them came out called in at the office of the sporting club for his ticket and presently mounted the front stairs prepared for such serious gambling as he could afford there was something almost allegorical in the wide opening of the doors as he entered he seemed engulfed once more into the world of pleasurable adventure only for the first time the whole thrill of it was wanting the tables themselves he eyed with all his old appetite as he counted his money and planned his campaign his inherited love of gambling was undeniable the green cloth the patter of the cards the call of the croupiers the rattling of the roulette ball each had their fascination it was the other things of which he seemed to have suddenly tired which somehow in a moment of presentiment as he looked through one of the great windows towards the moon hanging down over the harbour he knew would never appeal to him in quite the same way again the following morning he supplemented his letter home by a telegram to sir bertram ballaston baronet ballaston hall norfolk england dont send any money have won hundred milles very bored going rome with carruthers tonight shall return within a month gregory end of book one book two chapter i it was in a sense a dinner of celebration at ballaston hall in which these four men were concerned although with the exception of one guest it was a family party at the head of the table sat sir bertram thin long and hardjawed with brilliant dark eyes almost black lips and mouth sometimes cruel sometimes humorous a famous spendthrift an occasional libertine but without a doubt a great sportsman on his left gregory an almost startling reproduction of his father but with uncertainties in his face and expression which time as yet had not moulded next to him his uncle henry ballaston a smaller man stiff cold courtly and formal in speech and manner with greater capacities for kindliness but entirely devoid of that humorous twitch to the mouth he wore oldfashioned side whiskers his dress waistcoat showed less than the usual amount of shirt front and his tie was almost a stock on the opposite side of the table sat mr borroughes the agent to the estates a mixture of sportsman man of affairs and sycophant never altogether at ease with his host and in consequence rather overdoing the assumption of such a state below the little party was a vast expanse of polished but empty mahogany for dinner had been served in the great banquetting hall where places had often been laid in the past for as many as sixty guests rawson the butler ponderous yet lightfooted emerged from the shadows of the apartment carrying a second decanter of the port which they had been drinking he placed it reverently before sir bertram who lifted it first to the light poured a little into his glass sipped it and then passed the decanter on to his son excellent he pronounced almost as good a bottle as the first a wonderful bin henrymy dear henry his brother handed the decanter across the table to borroughes you are aware bertram he said that two glasses of wine after dinner are all i care for his speech was rather like that of an oldfashioned lawyerprim a little clipped extraordinarily precise sir bertram sighed i wonder whether there is anything in the world he murmured which would ever induce henry to diverge from a habit it is less prejudice than a partiality the latter pronounced two glasses i enjoy more so far as i am concerned bring me no pleasure i agree with you bertram that it is an excellent bin i always enjoy this wine and i have been happier than usual in drinking it this evening on account of our pleasure in welcoming gregory home again tell me about our new tenants at the great house gregory enquired presently addressing borroughes very desirablevery desirable indeed the latter replied delighted at the chance of entering into the conversation mr endacott curiously enough endacott gregory interrupted did you say endacott gregory whose first enquiry had been a casual one had set down the glass which he had been in the act of raising to his lips and was staring at borroughes incredulously staring at him and yet through him convinced in his heart suddenly realising what had happened yes ralph endacott borroughes continued curiously enough he belongs to an old norfolk family although he has lived all his life in china madame de fourgenet whom every one round here calls madame is his sister he is a great oriental scholar i believe a famous man at oxford in his day then theres his niecemiss claire endacottvery goodlooking girl thats all the family they have taken the place just as it stands furniture and all for three years and paying the full rent too thank god sir bertram added i meant to have told you gregory but weve scarcely had a minute together yet you met the old chap in china didnt you and of course you travelled home as far as marseilles with the girl mr endacott was a partner in the great eastern firm of johnson and company with branches at alexandria tokio and at several places in china mr borroughes went on i made use of his bankers references and was given to understand that he was a man of great wealth he knew to whom the property belonged before he took the house i suppose gregory enquired naturally the agent replied it was his sister who wrote to him about it quite a remarkable coincidence your having come across him in china sir bertram observed moving the decanter once more towards his son i wonder if he knows anything about your new possession gregory he knows more about it was the somewhat grim response than any other man breathing his firm as a matter of fact bought the twin image from one of the robbers who held up and looted the train from pekin a small world indeed sir bertram murmured tell us more about your coming into touch with these people johnson and company i am interested gregory glanced into the shadows rawson was out of sight at a huge sideboard only dimly visible at the other end of the room and the footmen had already departed well ive told you havent i the story of my rescue on the river by wu ling gregory proceeded it seems this fellow is one of the firm and does all the native trading for johnson and company naturally i called upon him before i sailed and found him in their warehousethe most astonishing place i told him of what had happened to poor hammonde and that only one of the images had turned up he listened to my story without a smile or a single word then he took me into a sort of holy of holies the firm hada secret treasure house at the back of the warehouse filled with a marvellous collection of curiosturned on the electric lightwhat an amazing anachronism it seemedand there smiling at me was the other image we looted from the temple and which had been stolen from the trainthe one they called the soul my ethical sense sir bertram observed in the question of meum and tuum has always been a little elastic but did you possibly suggest that he was a buyer of stolen goods my previous acquaintance with wu ling saved me from wasting my breath gregory replied drily from what he said however i gathered that he did not immediately at any rate intend to dispose of the image mr endacott mentioned in the course of conversation borroughes put in that the business although it had been immensely prosperous was being wound up the image that you are speaking of therefore is certain some time or other to come upon the market sir bertram rose to his feet we will have our coffee served in the library he suggested then we can pass into henrys sanctum and examine our new possession you havent seen it yet borroughes have you not yet sir bertram they left the room crossed a fine tapestryhung hall and entered the great library with its arched roof and famous stainedglass window a room of magnificent proportions there were bookshelves reaching to the ceiling and opposite the fireplace a wonderfully carved jacobean sideboard on which coffee and liqueurs were already arranged they lingered here for a few minutes then with a brief word of invitation sir bertram led the way to an inner door you dont mind our invading your sanctum for a minute or two henry he asked looking round towards his brother by no means was the slightly formal reply i was expecting your visit they passed through into a much smaller apartment furnished with the most complete and unexpected severity there was a touch even of monasticism in the bare white stone walls the high oriel windows and the furniture of austere shape and design here again were bookcases containing however works of a different order from the calfbound volumes in the library there were books on heraldry on china on silver on ancient furniture books on all the various forms of art starting from the renaissance to the most modern period and one entire shelf was taken up by manuscript records each stamped on the outside with the arms of ballaston on a pedestal of black oak standing in the farther corner of the apartment was the image of the body henry held a lamp above his head and the four men looked at this new family possession in silence as a specimen of allegorical carving sir bertram mused it is a marvellous piece of work one could conceive that this might be the countenance of a man even of a god from whom every element of spirituality was entirely absent a piece of work of great constructive merit i have no doubt henry ballaston observed as a subject for daily contemplation i find it displeasing most people would i think agree with you henry his brother conceded all the same we must not forget the family fortunes being what they are that although the expert whom we have had down rather scoffs at the idea of there being jewels concealed inside he expressed his opinion that the image as it stands with as much of its history as one would like to make known is probably exceedingly valuable a specimen of your purchases in china mr gregory borroughes enquired i didnt buy it i stole it was the young mans cool reply one does that sort of thing over there i stole two of them my friend and accomplice had his throat cut however and only one of the images got through to the coastthe wrong one i am afraid the agent looked doubtfully at his young host it was a continual source of discomfiture to him that he never knew when a ballaston was in earnest i give you all warning gregory continued that this image when separated from its companion is a pretty dangerous possession according to the legend it is supposed to have a debasing and malevolent effect upon its owners well theres only henry in this house to be corrupted sir bertram observed stirring his coffee thoughtfully nothing could make my reputation in the county worse than it is could it borroughes the agent looked uncomfortable he was a person who laughed a great deal but who was utterly devoid of a sense of humour henry ballaston frowned in troubled fashion your life is not a careful one bertram he said and you are not exactly a pattern to your neighbours actual wrongdoing however is a different thing no man yet has ever found opportunity to say a word against the honour of a ballaston that may come his brother predicted stretching out his hand towards the cigarette box we cant go on much longer without money can we borroughes it is a difficult proposition sir bertram the agent replied gravely swindling to a city millionaire is second nature sir bertram sighed financial acumen i believe it is called a county squire however finds few opportunitiesoff already borroughes he added as the latter approached with outstretched hand if you will excuse me sir bertram its a darkish ride home and i have a sale in norwich tomorrow and some accounts to look through tonight glad to see you back again mr gregory good night mr ballaston i will accompany you to the door henry ballaston announced rising to his feet i may possibly not return he added turning to his brother you will naturally have a great deal to say to gregory the two men left the room together gregory took an easychair with his back to the image his father refilled his glass with liqueur brandy drew a box of cigarettes to his side and seated himself opposite his son these were almost their first few minutes alone well gregory old man you couldnt quite bring it off then he observed not quite sir his son acknowledged we did our best no doubt about that you had a narrow shave of it as it was and all for nothing i am afraid sir bertram rose to his feet im not so sure about that he rejoined the man they sent down from christies spent over an hour examining that image ive never seen a fellow so interested in my life he had to give it up in the end but he wasnt any more satisfied than i am sir bertram had wandered off into the other room lifted the image from its pedestal and bringing it back placed it upon his knee the lamplight flashed upon its black polished surface to gregory its expression seemed if possible even more vicious than ever gregory his father continued thoughtfully you know who told me the story he was a man absolutely incapable of falsehood and he knew what he was talking about he was the greatest man in china in those days i am as certain as i sit here that either this image or the other one contains the whole of the treasure of the temple why not have this one broken up gregory suggested and risk getting blown to pieces the young man shook his head a bit too thick that he protested i have a wonderful amount of faith in the story but i should think any explosive that was ever put inside there would be a little mouldy by this time im not so sure sir bertram reflected those priests were always devils at protecting themselves against marauders besides in any case the thing as it stands is worth something lets sell it then gregory proposed eagerly his fathers eyebrows were slightly uplifted has the old gentleman been exercising his malevolent influence upon you he enquired with a faintly sardonic smile is that why you sent it me home in such a hurry gregory frowned gloomily i simply know that i detest it he declared vigorously sir bertrams expression cynical only at first suddenly developed humorous qualities one might almost imagine you terrified by the superstition my ingenu son he murmured turning the image around and gazing into its features gad youre ugly though different style of course our vices are after all the vices of gentle people here we have an eloquent personification of brutality and bestiality in real life i doubt whether this fellow would even be able to conduct an orgy with distinction put the damned thing down father gregory begged suddenly i lived with it for three weeks and i hate it like hell sir bertram strolled into the inner room and replaced the image upon the pedestal then he came back to his son and laid his hand for a moment upon his shoulder gregory he said youre not going to tell me in cold blood that you actually believe in the superstition of course i dont believe but listen i wanted the other image johnson and company wanted mine i wouldnt sellnot likely after all wed been through it was no good their naming a price for theirs because we had no money do you know what wu ling the chinaman who rescued me and who apparently is one of the principals in the firm suggested well he offered to gamble with methe winner to have both statues how like a chinaman sir bertram murmured it was a good sporting offer anyway he got a pack of cards gregory continued wellhe won i was to send this image back from the steamer i swear that when i left the warehouse i meant to do so i had lost fairly i suppose and it seemed to me from the first like a debt of honour i returned on board the ship then i looked at the image and looked at it and somehow the thing didnt seem so clear to me anddamn it i sent the coolies away and kept it anything else sir bertram asked after a moments pause yes you know that this man endacotts niece was on board on her way back to englandmadames niece too i suppose bytheby lord what a messupdad we talk about most things pretty nakedly to one another but we dont often talk about women one doesnt his father murmured listen then gregory went on she is young entirely innocent entirely adorable i like her better than any girl i have ever come across in my life we became great friends then we danced at night you know what that means when you get near the red sea and the canal and all the rest of it of course you do we danced every evening and all the time down in my stateroom that image was leering at me i began to feel that i was losing control of myself i tried to keep away from her she wouldnt have it i made an ass of myself once and she forgave me she thought that she herself had perhaps misunderstood i was so ashamed of myself that fortune or no fortune i tried to throw the damned thing overboard and what happened it pitched in an outslung boat and was brought back to me gregory explained grimly afterwardswell i offended again sir bertram sighed i suppose god gave us the instincts he murmured but the devil has toyed with them since she scarcely spoke to me again gregory concluded except out of her sweetness when we met face to face on the dock at marseilles it was because of her i went on to monte carlo instead of coming straight home and of course i won i played baccarat at rome and won again i brought home more pocket money than i ever had before in my life but i hate that image like hell now you know everything sir bertram moved to the sideboard helped himself to a whisky and soda and returned to his place confidence for confidence he said stretching himself out comfortably im not going to even comment upon your little confession gregory because i dont know what sort of a fellow your friend wu ling was and ive never seen a chinaman yet id trust for five seconds with a pack of cards ive bad news for you though im afraid we are pretty nearly broke we cant go on more than a few more months as bad as that i dont know how it is sir bertram continued but luck always seems against the gambler who takes the big chancesespecially when it really matters if any man knows the points of a horse i do if theres any amateur understands racing i do i bought my yearlings right i trained with sam roscoe and theres none better and the luck of old harrys pursued me this year just as it did last up to three days before the race little juneyou remember herwas favourite for the derby when you left england you know what i was doing i wasnt waiting for starting price i put on all i could at long odds i got forty thirty twenty and at eighteen i left off then without any rhyme or reason in the thing she went lame shes done for shell never race again it isnt worth telling you the whole story ive finishedhavent a horse left and i still owe roscoe a thousand or two you know old mason the bookmakerwell i owe him seven thousand pay me when you can sir bertram he said and shake hands on it and i shook hands with him but gregorygod forgive meive never paid him the lands bring us in about thirteen thousand taxes five thousand interest on the mortgages a little more than the rest queryhow do we live god knows there was a short silence gregory had thrown away his cigarette and his hands were clenching the arms of his chair his face was set the ghost of this threatened horror had risen up between them it means breaking the entail i suppose he muttered at last you and i can do it sir bertram rose to his feet fidgeted for a moment upon the hearthrug then stooped down and laid his hand upon his sons shoulder so far as it was possible for him to show emotion he was showing it then my lad he said i am the sixteenth baronet you would be the seventeenth sentiment but hell all the same isnt it and mark you before we can sign the papers i swear that henry will shoot us hes living in a panic i feel his eyes upon me wherever i go is there any other way out at all gregory asked despairingly his father once more disappeared into the inner room and returned carrying the image gregory he confided i believe in the legend if the jewels arent in this one they are in the other there was something in sir bertrams eyes which spoke of enterprisesomething definite to be attempted gregory responded to it at once ill go back to china and have another try if you say so he declared sir bertram glanced round the room as though he feared a listener his voice which was always low became a whisper you neednt he confided the soul is up at the great house chapter ii ralph endacott erstwhile professor of oxford university and partner in the great oriental house of johnson and company now an english country gentleman sat before wideflung french windows leading out on to the lawn sunken gardens and miniature park of the great house at market ballaston in front of him was an oak writing table upon which were pen and ink and a steelclamped coffer apparently of great age but attached to which was a modern bramah lock upon the blotting paper were a few sheets of yellow unfamiliarlooking thick paper covered with weird hieroglyphics in his left hand a pair of magnifying glasses the scent of the roses from outside had disturbed him in the midst of his labour he rang a silver bell which stood upon the edge of the tablerang it a second time claire a flutter of cool white swung herself out of a hammock close at hand and approached lazily what is it nunks dear she enquired you know very well that none of the servants can hear that bell only me it was you i wanted her uncle declared tell me child in what devilsent spirit of idiocy did i waste all those years in a musty godforsaken country whose only charm is that no one can understand it and no one ever will was i a fool or am i a fool now she laughed softly leaning against the side of the open window you were a fool she decided i was a fool too because i didnt believe in england i didnt believe in the green or the trees the flowers the softness the rest of it all you were too young to be foolish he said it is only the old who can find the way to folly do you know that during the last few days i have discovered some manuscripts which if i had been seated in that muskscented den in the corner of the warehouse with the smell of the east in my nostrils and the soft purring call of mystery all the time in the atmosphere would have sent me into a state of wild excitement here today i am gently and pleasantly interested i have learned values tell me about the manuscripts she begged passing finally through the window and throwing herself into an easychair close at hand there is a love poem here he confided written in his own handwriting by an emperor to a singing girl i shall lock it away it was not meant to be read by barbarians here are the details of the first plot to overcome the monarchy and here he went on is a document more interesting than any i have yet come acrossmore difficult to decipher because there are priestly words in it and phrases not used in modern chinese however i have mastered it so far as to know what it is about in this atmosphere it is strange even to dream of it he paused for a moment it was a lazy hour in a july afternoon even the birds had ceased to sing but there were bees humming amongst the flowers and the sound of a reaping machine in a meadow on the other side of the red brick wall every now and then the roses bent their heads in a flutter of the light west breeze and lent wafts of perfume to an air already sweet with the odour of verbena and heliotrope what about that last manuscript she asked he tapped the strange piece of thick stained paper beneath his fingers yellow in places drooping at the edges covered with what seemed to her to be meaningless hieroglyphics in the faintest of pinkcoloured ink this he said is the letter of the high priest of the temple of yuntse addressed to the emperor and telling him what means he had adopted for guarding the secret jewels yuntse she murmured the home of the body and the soul he nodded these few lines he continued smoothing out the paper thoughtfully with his long bony forefinger to any one who can understand them might easily be worth one of the great fortunes of the world what are you going to do with it she enquired curiously he made no immediate reply first folding up the letter and replacing it in the coffer which he carefully locked then he rose to his feet and led the way out into the gardens tell me about that letter she begged once more as they seated themselves under the cedar tree part of the old story at any rate seems to be true he confided those two images have always contained a secret hiding place and somewhere inside them are stored the jewels of the temple on the back of the document are instructions in the cipher of the priests which as yet i have not been able to translate i am not sure that i shall ever attempt to but why not she asked wonderingly if i did he murmured i should know how to appropriate the jewels but dont you want them she persisted wouldnt that be very wonderful he looked up through the boughs of the tree a worn tiredlooking man over whose high cheek bones the skin seemed tightly drawn in ordinary european costume he appeared somehow to have shrunken to have lost flesh and a certain amount of presence it is nothing he said since i arrived in england it has cost me many a weary hour to invest my money yesterday i heard from the accountants who are winding up the affairs of johnson and company and it seems that there are still great sums to come all made in that strange warehouse she exclaimed there and in alexandria he replied i went out to china claire as your father may have told you giving up a chair worth eight hundred a year at oxford and owning perhaps a couple of thousand pounds i became sort of unofficial adviser to johnson and company simply because there were things about china which no other european knew i was very useful to them without a doubt and in the end they made me a partner now that we are winding up the business it seems that my share is worth something between three and four hundred thousand pounds amazing the girl gasped here he continued in these few sentences may lie another fortune i am an old man and i ask myself what good could it do to me to place those secret jewels in the markets of the world to hang them round the necks and the shoulders of american millionairesses and the worlds courtesanes we cannot breathe sweeter air than this or more delicious perfumes we cannot look upon fairer scenes we could not eat more drink more or sleep more for your clothes and such pleasures as you may care to indulge in you have already carte blanche you are not one of those who will need money to buy herself a husband so tell me child what could we do with more money i can think of nothing she acknowledged then for the moment at any rate we will let the fortune remain where it is he decided and keep our fingers unstained from sacrilege is this a fairy prince claire or a very handsome young man in grey tweeds she drew a little fluttering breath her fingers closed over his nunks she said it is gregory ballaston that is a young man her uncle observed with whom i might have something to say wave to him claire he need not tug at that bell gregory ballaston hat in hand and probably less at his ease than on any previous occasion in his life crossed the lawn towards them claire leaning forward watched him intently her uncle with subdued and somewhat sardonic amusement his attitude towards them both was entirely tentative claire offered her hand which he took gratefully i have come he announced to welcome you to ballaston your obvious duty as our landlord endacott remarked also offering his hand pray sit down gregory dragged up a wicker chair with an air of relief when you spoke of settling down in norfolk he observed turning to claire i had no idea that we might possibly become such near neighbours nor i at the time she answered how beautiful your house is i spent quite half an hour this morning looking at it from the other side of the garden i hope he said a little anxiously that you are going to give us the pleasure of seeing you there this evening your father has been kind enough to ask us to dine mr endacott rejoined i have just despatched a note accepting with much pleasure i think you are very generous gregory declared with a certain contriteness in his tone the adjective seems to me to demand explanation mr endacott ruminated you know very well sir gregory continued that there are circumstances which would have justified you in refusing this invitation and refusing to meet me anywhere ah mr endacott murmured that affair of the image of course claire rose to her feet gregory waved her back again please listen miss endacott he begged i want you to hear what i have to say you know what happened she assented gravely my uncle has told me she admitted i can assure you sir gregory went on that when i left those extraordinary premises of yours i meant to send you the thing straight back i had one last look at it however and the longer i looked the more uncertain i felt about the whole business i kept telling myself that it was a debt of honour then i kept on finding poisonous ideas in my brainideas which i honestly believe i have never had before i was parting with perhaps a great treasure just on the turn of a carda chinamans turn of the card too you dont suggest mr endacott began i suggest nothing gregory interrupted all i know is that my moral selfif i may use rather a grandiloquent termwas completely upset i locked myself into my cabin with the image soon after the ship sailed of course i know he went on this must all sound stupidly inadequate but there it is superstition or no superstition i swear that that image has an evil influence i have proved it claire looked thoughtfully up into the trees her uncle stroked his chin with an air of profound meditation well he enquired have you found the fortune yet not yet gregory admitted my father has had an expert down and he can discover no trace of any hiding place in it mr endacott smiled very faintly you must find that disappointing he observed after all your efforts if the jewels are not in this one gregory said they are probably in the other ah mr endacott murmured if it is not an impertinent question sir he proceeded is it true that johnson and company are relinquishing the business quite true then the other image the other image is not for sale mr endacott said calmly who has it gregory ventured well mr endacott confided the members of the firm were wu ling a nebulous mr johnson and myself when i consider he continued the extreme measures which you and your friend took to possess yourselves of these imagesmeasures by the way which may be justified by precedent but hardly by moralityi can scarcely do you know bring myself to reveal whether it is the domicile of wu ling the possible mansion of mr johnson in alexandria or my very conveniently near abode here which might be indicated as the scene of your future adventures gregory was already sunburnt but he felt his cheeks grow hotter well i suppose i asked for that he admitted grimly what about the image which is at present in our possession to whom do you consider that it belongs the firm being now dissolved mr endacott mused the matter perhaps requires reflection i will answer you later on in the meantime i shall leave you and my niece to better your acquaintance my eastern habits prevail i desire to sleep he made his way towards the house a lank shambling figure yet not without a certain dignity in his abstracted movements gregory glanced anxiously towards his companion she remained seated in her chair munching some chocolates from a box have one she invited holding it out towards him he declined but was conscious of a poignant sense of relief with the airy tact of her sex she had demonstrated her position it was to be peace not war oblivion if not forgiveness what an extraordinary stroke of fortune it is he declared that you should have chosen this particular corner of norfolk to settle down in it makes the world seem a small place doesnt it she remarked frankly licking her delicately manicured fingers and placing the lid upon the box with a great air of determination it was my aunt living here of course which decided us madame he confided has been the one picturesque figure in this neighbourhood for years she was always beautiful and she is always on the point of being cured i believe that my father looks upon her as his greatest friend she is very attractive claire admitted she wears the most beautiful clothes i have ever seen i wonder whether it is a proof of vanity or of an immense sense of selfrespect which leads a woman who spends her whole life upon a couch to take such pains with her appearance if it be vanity there is a leaven of philanthropy in it he observed because every one loves looking at her besides i believe now she really is going to get well this new doctor who comes over from norwich has performed some wonderful cures it isnt as though the weakness had been born with her it was all the result of that motor accident you know it would be wonderful if she got well claire murmured they talked for a while of trifles the absence of other neighbours the country around when one gets over the spell of this lotuslike existence she asked him what is there to do herein the way of exercise i mean he looked down at the sunken lawn your tennis court used to be good he said one of ours is quite playable and there are plenty of golf links a few miles away where does one buy horses at norwich dad will tell you all about that the hunting isnt bad my father is master of one of the packs that hunt near here they begin cubbing at the end of next month the shooting parties will give you plenty of exercise too if you are fond of walking i like all these things she admitted a little more earnestly and i love this garden the peace of it is almost stupefying i feel somehow or other that i should like to grow old in this atmosphere you never would he rejoined she laughed at him suddenly she was serious she leaned forward in her chair in a few minutes she said i must go in to see madame before you leave though i want to ask you just one thing what was the chief reason which made you in the first instance come over to china on that mad adventure money he answered bluntly but why do you need money you have the most beautiful home i ever saw he laughed with a bitterness which he took no pains to conceal it is to keep that home he explained that we need money perhaps you scarcely understand the troubles that a certain class of english people have had to face lately especially people who come of extravagant stock like my father and me it wasnt pure love of adventure that took me out to china it was the hope of saving ballaston if i succeeded is it really as bad as that she asked sympathetically worse he rejoined i believe that my father has finally made up his mind that there is no chance of saving the place she was thoughtful for several moments affected even perhaps more than she realised by the note of dejection in his tone his enterprise which had presented itself before to her imagination as a sort of buccaneering feat not exactly reprehensible but faintly tinged with sordidness suddenly showed itself in a new light she realised alike the chivalry of it and the pathos and how near he had been to success unless after all you discover the jewels she observed a little abruptly i am afraid there isnt much chance of that he sighed somehow over here it seems absurd to take these superstitions seriously but i cant get away from the feeling that if the jewels are in existence they will never be discovered so long as the images are separated she leaned a little towards him the jewels do exist she assured him softly a touch of the old frenzied earnestness came back to him his eyes glistened not altogether with cupidity but with the adventurers pride in success how do you know that he demanded she hesitated for a few moments yet after all why should there be any secrecy the adventure such as it had been was finished here in this quiet backwater of life there seemed something grotesque about it all nevertheless she spoke uneasily almost reluctantly my uncle has discovered a manuscript she confided the jewels are there in which image he enquired breathlessly she shook her head i cannot tell you any more she said in fact i do not know any more everything rests with uncle if you can persuade him to let you have a copy of the manuscript or to tell you what is in it perhaps after all you will find yourself rich again if i can help i will if one only knew in which image he muttered why what difference could that make she asked smiling if they are in yours well some day or other i am sure you will be able to secure them if they are in his then i am afraid your adventure will have been in vain the sunlight caught her hair as she leaned once more back against the cushions gregory suddenly forgot the jewels he was uneasy unsure of himself curiously stirred by an unexpected wave of feeling his sense of proportion diminished there had been a cataclysm and nothing remained on earth but this oldworld garden with its elm trees and its odorous cedar and claire it will never have been in vain he declared with a curious little break in his tone chapter iii if at times mr endacott seemed a little out of his milieu at ballaston hall that evening claire on the other hand was an instantaneous and gorgeous success in the jacobean banquetting hall where she sat at her hosts right hand her fresh girlish beauty with its additional charm of a constant and piquant enthusiasm seemed in exquisite contrast to her majestic but gloomy surroundings the great dimly lit room the stately rows of oil paintings the cumbersome but magnificent furniture impressive not because of any intrinsic art of selection but because it was true to its period and had grown old with the house sir bertram whose attentions to the other sex apart from times of necessity had become rarer with the years was before the evening was over proving himself not only a courteous but even a devoted host and henry who voluntarily never addressed a woman at all actually waited for opportunities to attempt conversation in his oldfashioned thackerayan but courtly fashion gregory watched her success with complacent amusement content with temporary effacement and resigned himself to the entertainment of her uncle after dinner they entered upon a general and informal exploration of the house of the great picture gallery with its shining oak floor and its circular carved balustrade leading down to the hall below the victorian drawingroom its colourings quaintly sweet by the light of the lamps its perfume a fragrant mixture of lavender and potpourri curiously reminiscent of brocaded gowns hooped skirts and vinaigrettes they looked into the powdering closet on their way out and lingered for a few minutes on the south terrace from which stretched a moonlit panorama of italian gardens with tall cypresses broad walks leading down to the lake claire became almost silent she and gregory had drifted a little apart from the others at least she murmured sympathetically i realise now how terrible the very thought of parting with your home must be it has been ours since he told her uncle henry could tell you the exact date and the name and record of every ballaston since i cant pretend that my memory is as good i never had much head for detail but we are all alike in our love for the place i know i am very ignorant she said a little hesitatingly but your picturesthe gainsboroughs and corots and romneys and all those treasures toosurely they must be worth a great deala very great deal of money they are all heirlooms he explained just as the land is entailed they belong to us as ballastons only we could not sell a single picture i dont know why i should tell you all this he went on except that just now and then you seem to think that i was only an ordinary fortune hunter i wasnt you know really i went to china to try to get the money to keep us going it may have been the wrong way but it was the only way i was any good at we havent the instincts any of us for making money by legitimate methods you should do like so many young englishmen she suggested come over to the states and marry one of our millionairesses he made a little grimace we all even the worst of us have our code he reflected personally i would sooner rob a man besides she turned towards the open windows through which was an impression of the faded but stately drawingroom fine davenports and costly china with little pools of shaded light falling upon stretches of carpet delicately blue though threadbare in places i think we had better go inside she said with sudden decision nevertheless he murmured as he followed her there is a besides they found the others in the smaller library standing in a little semicircle round the image of the body they had evidently only just arrived for the door of the main apartment was open behind them and through it was a vista of liqueur glasses and coffee cups you are an authority i believe mr endacott upon all matters connected with the east sir bertram remarked to his visitor endacott nodded he had adjusted his more formidablelooking spectacles through which he was steadfastly regarding the image i think he admitted drily that i might be said to know more about chinese art and chinese objets dart than any other man alive i gather from my son sir bertram continued that you are acquainted with the history of this particular image intimately was the somewhat sardonic reply the fellow statue to this onethe soulwas acquired after the desecration of the temple by the firm with which i was connected in china their antiquity alone apart from their history makes these twin images intensely interesting they are reputed to have been the work of yuntse the priest after whom the temple was named and to have been fashioned for the purpose of concealing the jewels and treasures of the temple in times of danger i see no reason to doubt the truth of the story amazing sir bertram murmured yuntse endacott proceeded was the first apostle of chinese arrestment he preached the doctrine that china had advanced far enough along the great avenues of art and science and knowledge he looked still farther ahead and he saw that material progress meant actual retrogression in feeling in beauty in genuine achievement it was he who started the crusade against foreigners from an aesthetic point of view henry ballaston ventured a little stiffly one can find little to admire in this very extraordinary piece of work endacott turned towards the speaker his thin lips protruding only by contrast with its fellow he retorted sharply it was the wish of the sculptor a wish which has been zealously kept through the centuries that the two statues shall never be separated each is the complement of the other body and soul commingled make one life the artist dragged aside the component parts and separated them here in this one we have all that is gross and evil unredeemed by any strain of virtue and in the other statue there is charity and spirituality without a trace of the defiling qualities they are parted now perhaps for ever i cannot say that i regard with equanimity the action of the person responsible for this deed of vandalism there was a moments silence endacotts voice was contemptuous almost provocative gregory was on the point of speech but claires fingers suddenly pressed his arm your point of view mr endacott sir bertram admitted courteously is easily understood yet i am afraid that the spirit of loot has been rampant in englishmen throughout history else the british empire could scarcely have existed and speaking of loot he went on we come to the one really serious question concerning our possession here do you honestly believe that at the present moment it is as it stands the receptacle for a portion of the jewels of the temple i certainly do was the curt reply again silence a little tremor of excitement amongst the group sir bertram laid his long slim fingers upon the broad shining edge of the image but my dear sir he pointed out what possible place of concealment could there be in say this particular image examine it as carefully as you will you cannot find any sign of a join or aperture the chinese have with justice been called magicians endacott observed drily at least when they hide they hide if there had been as you remark any aperture or join to be seen theirs would have been a clumsy device at the best if the jewels are there sir bertram reflected and we can find no other way then the statue must be broken up endacott turned towards his host his manner and expression were alike displeasing the glance which flashed from behind his heavy spectacles was one of utter contempt you carry vandalism beyond the conceivable limits of thought he declared the person who could destroy work such as that would deserve the fate which would probably befall him there are times sir bertram rejoined when necessity is compelling let us turn this from an abstract to a concrete discussion my son risked his life to obtain this image and the one which was unfortunately lostrisked it in the belief that it contained jewels of great value am i not right in saying mr endacott that you could if you would assist us in the matter of obtaining those jewels i could endacott replied quietly i have at the present moment a manuscript in my possession which i believe would solve the riddle you will not refuse your help then sir bertram persisted endacott did not hesitate for a moment his tone was acid his manner brusque to the point of rudeness i do most certainly and absolutely refuse he said to have removed the images at all from their resting place was an unforgivable action this spirit of loot you speak of presents itself to me as an act of common robbery i refuse to countenance it i refuse my help there was a brief silence awkward yet in a sense dramatic henry ballaston who had been standing a little in the background took a step forward then paused the parchmentlike pallor of his face was almost ghastly there were pinpricks of fire in his cold blue eyes nevertheless he said nothing such words as had risen to his lips he repressed sir bertram for a moment had looked frankly angry he too however remained silent mr endacott turned his back upon the image and strolled across towards the sideboard may i be privileged he asked to smoke one more of your excellent cigarettes after which i will beg you to excuse my niece and me we have the habit of retiring early sir bertram was at once the courteous host the discussion was closed i shall not attempt he said to do my few treasures the injustice of showing them by this light but i hope mr endacott that you will give me another opportunity of asking your opinion on themyou and your niece he added turning with a smile to claire you know we have quaint customs in england he went on we have laws by reason of which we become only the custodians of all our treasures there are pictures here of great value and great beauty and three generations of my family spent fortunes in collecting china i shall be very happy to see your collection endacott assented i know little about pictures something perhaps of china my brother henry is our showman sir bertram observed he gives the whole of his time to the care of our treasures bytheby my sisterlady annistairwill be here on sunday afternoon you will perhaps bring your niece to tea it would be a good opportunity for a preliminary inspection endacott accepted without enthusiasm but with a certain measured politeness which was as far as he ever progressed towards geniality gregory escorted the departing guests to the already wideflung hall door claire made a little grimace at him as they dropped behind for a moment i am so sorry she whispered perhaps hell change his mind in any case he answered softly thank you for being sorry he walked out with them into the scented twilight and claire waved him another little farewell as they rolled off in the hired car when he returned to the library he found his father and his uncle both standing before the image they turned at the sound of his approaching footsteps there was something a little suggestive in their unnatural silence pleasant fellow your friend endacott the former remarked easily it is much to be hoped henry ballaston said in a low tone that he will not persist in his present most unreasonable attitude chapter iv sir bertram very lithe and debonair in his grey flannels and panama hat issued from his front door whistled to dogs who seemed to come to him from all directions and humming snatches of music from an almost forgotten italian opera stepped down from the terrace and strolled across the park keeping as far as possible in the shade of the great oak trees arrived at the boundary he vaulted over the stile exchanged greetings right and left as he passed down the village street and turning along the lane to the right pushed open the gate of the little house and knocked at the door with his ash stick at a word of command the dogs settled down to watch wistfully for the end of their vigil and sir bertram admitted by an elderly and ungraciouslooking domestic entered the little hall where he laid his hat and stick upon an oak chest and afterwards passed into the long low room the door of which the maid had opened a woman lying upon a couch held out both her hands long beautiful hands ringless and almost transparently white he raised them to his lips and drew a chair to her side you grow more beautiful every day angele was his greeting the faintest tinge of colour stole into her ivory pale cheeks and her eyes filled with a very affectionate light there was not a single grey thread in her carefully arranged goldenbrown hair yet it was obvious that she was no longer a young woman and you she murmured i listen here sometimes for your footsteps and i look down the lane and i can never tell whether it is you or gregory who comes you are a wonderful person especially considering the life you lead she added with a little grimace my dear he said we are all the victims of predestination it is such a comfortable doctrine that i have embraced it permanently i am a ballaston and gregory will be one after me so far as that is concerned henry also is a ballaston she reminded him henry he pointed out is not an elder son it is the elder sons who inherit the full measure of the virtues and vices of our family henry i admit is a freak god bless him so you had my relatives to dine last night she remarked tell me what you think of my niece the most amazingly attractive young person whom i have ever met in my life he replied with what was for him enthusiasm as a rule i find extreme youth overpoweringa mixture of shyness and precocity you know she is certainly beautiful madame murmured presently i shall get used to her and like to have her near me just now i find youth a little depressing gregory has altered it is disappointment his father sighed he had a stirring adventure though i suppose he has told you all about it madame nodded after all she said he brought one of the images home and a lot of good to us it is sir bertram remarked ruefully there is only one man who could help us angele ralph he nodded silently a most impossible person madame sighed his feet are on the earth his head in the clouds and his heart in china i am afraid as a matter of fact that he utterly disapproved of gregorys enterprise doginthemangerish i call it sir bertram grumbled you cant say that jewels collected by the priests of a temple which have been hidden for practically a hundred years belong now to any one in particular i am afraid i still have sufficient of the francis drake outlook to claim that they belong to whoever has the courage and the wit to find them the buccaneering spirit she observed with a faint smile of amusement you always had it my dear bertram nothing i am sure except the most rigid sense of honour has kept you from robbing your friends i shall probably have to end my days doing that he sighed in some continental spa or other another year will see us through at ballaston she took his hand and held it we wont believe that she said softly something must happen i dont exactly see what you ought to have married she declared when i think of the young womenheaps of them with any amount of moneywho were in love with you you ought to have married again i had the best reason in the world dear angele for remaining single he replied we wont speak of that she turned her head towards the window and her beautiful eyes were for a moment a little less clear the window looked out on to a very pleasant strip of garden almost of the cottage variety crowded with flowers and with a long narrow pergola still hung with roses inside the room itself with its grey walls and hangings its few french etchings the cabinet of choice china seemed to possess also some measure of the distinction of its owner bring me my mirror and vanity case from the table please bertram she begged smoke if you will you will find your own make of cigarettes there he did her bidding his head almost touching the ceiling of the low room when he rose to his feet madame busied herself with a very exquisite little gold case peering at herself meanwhile in the mirror i have an idea sir bertram remarked as he lit a cigarette that your brother dislikes me why he shrugged his shoulders i suppose he has every reason to angele from a brothers point of view and most other peoples too if any other person said that to me she rejoined quietly i should be very angry with them indeed you have given me all that i have had worth having in lifemore than i ever dared to hope for you give me now what keeps me alive he took her fingers in his and held them they were interrupted by the entrance of a maid who brought a little tea table to her mistress side a very dainty affair with a queen anne silver teapot and two sevres cups thin bread and butter cream and lemon miss besant still going on all right he enquired as soon as they were alone again she is good after her fashion madame acknowledged she is a discontented creature with queer humours and the usual moodiness of the unmarried girl of thirty god knows im trying enough one cant blame her if she gets jumpy sometimes she does her best and sir james he enquired has he been down this week he comes again on monday she answered i am keeping up everythingmassage baths and diet as a matter of fact i think im getting fat anna and miss besant were quite out of breath when they carried me to my room last night what do you think she threw on one side the beautiful lace wrap which had covered her and her eyes looked towards him with faint provocative enquiry he passed his hand along her arms and gently over her body she had the figure of a thin but graceful child of fourteen except that her feet and ankles were more beautiful i see no change in you he assured her during all these years illness seems to have kept you young do you know that you are still very beautiful angele again the faint flush the gleam of softening happiness in her face you mustnt turn my head please she begged then i must leave off talking he replied for you are fast turning mine shall i read to you de musset please the little volume of later poems i kept them for you he read for half an hour sympathetically and well when he laid down the volume her eyes thanked him you are missing ascot she remarked as he made preparations for departure he nodded between ourselves he confided i owe my bookmaker just a little beyond the limit of the amount with which i care to allow him to credit me i havent a horse running as you know or in training it seems to me i shall have to get through the summer on golf and tennis i am going to try and keep the hounds although of course it will be the last season poor dear she murmured and poor idiot too you know i have money bertrama great deal more than i need i dont spend half of it and ralph says there is more to come to me why maynt i help he bent down and kissed her tenderly my dear he said if ever the day comes when i can call myself your husband i may accept your bounty until thenwell we wont talk of such matters a delicate little wrinkle of dissatisfaction furrowed her brows she shook her head at him you are terribly obstinate she sighed you will come on thursday without fail he promised the dogs rose up from all sides as he passed out he lingered for a moment to talk to the rather sulky but not unpleasantlooking girl who was cutting some roses in the strip of front garden madame looks well he observed i hope that you are still content with the neighbourhood miss besant i like it very much she assured him if the doctor decides to permit madames visit to the hall next week he added we shall have i hope the pleasure of seeing you there she thanked him a little stiffly sir bertram whistled to his dogs gazed for a moment at the high red brick wall opposite which encircled the domain of the great house and with a little bow of farewell turned towards the village chapter v that evening endacott in response to an urgent summons rose somewhat reluctantly from his chair under the cedar tree finished his coffee and offered a grudging explanation of his departure your aunt has sent in to say that she wishes to see me particularly he confided to claire just the hour of the day when i like to rest what a pity she murmured shall i come with you he shook his head no need for two of us to go on a fools errand he grumbled he crossed the lawn passed down a gravel path and opening the postern gate made his way into the lane which divided the great house and the little house a moment or two later he was ushered into madames drawingroom you did not mind coming ralph she asked a little anxiously as a rule he admitted selecting a chair close to her couch i prefer my evenings undisturbed since you expressed a wish to see me however i am here his tone seemed scarcely propitious she looked at him wistfully the years she decided had treated him hardly there was little of sympathy in his face little left of gentleness almost from the first she felt that her task was hopeless sir bertram came down to see me this afternoon she began he nodded without speech and waited he comes down every other day when he is at ballaston she went on no one in the world ralph has ever been so kind to me that he rejoined may be a matter of opinion but ralph she pleaded it isnt a matter of opinion at all it is a fact i ought to know oughtnt i look at me what am i but a poor invalid woman the victim of a terrible accident my limbs have been almost useless for years even now i can scarcely move i am a depressing sight for any one what but real affection and kindness could bring him here day after day did kindness he asked bluntly prompt him to take you away from your husband bertram never took me away from maurice she expostulated maurice left meleft me for some algerian dancing girl for whom he bought a villa at cannes and on whom he squandered half his fortune all the world knows that bertram brought me back from paris a crushed humiliated woman it wasnt his fault that he was in the motor when the accident happened there have been different versions of the affair endacott declared moodily madames eyes suddenly flashed if you dare tell me that i may not love bertramthat i do not love himthat there is any sin in my loving him then you are a fool she cried of course i love him no one in the world could ever have been so wonderful to a woman as he has been to me his reputation endacott began ralph she interrupted indignantly you are too great a man to talk such shibboleth i dare say he has been a roue and a profligate and a great gambler i dare say he has squandered his money has been reckless and selfish but dont you understand ralph he is of the sort of men who could never treat a woman badly i wish i could make you understand at least believe me that bertram has treated me from the moment we first meteven when i was desperate willing in my heart to consent to anythingas though i were a thing almost sacred he kept my selfrespect alive im a broken creature now but all there is in my life worth having i owe to him endacott moved a little uneasily in his chair well he said we will not dig into the past it is scarcely profitable anyhow your message said that you wished to see me particularly this evening ralph she begged we have drifted a long way apart but we were children together cant we talk in a little more friendly fashion cant you look as though you remembered that we are still brother and sister he took her hand a little awkwardly my dear angele he pointed out the very fact that i chose to come here is proof that i remember it i returned to england partly for claires sake and partly because i wished to be near you i admit that i did not know that you were living in the shadow and the lustre of the ballaston regime but that is nothingprejudice without a doubt i came if i could make your life easier i would be glad is it money i have plenty she shook her head i want to save the ballastons she confided are they in any particular danger he asked coldly you cant have lived here even this short time without knowing it she answered bertrams father was a great gambler and bertram himself has gambled quite true he has raced and made a failure of it that also is true he has kept expensive establishments everywhere spent money like water lived altogether beyond his means all quite true other men have done this ralph who are not worthless and bertram ballaston is not worthless every acre of the estate is mortgaged now unless they can raise money within the next few months there is nothing left for them but to break the entail pay their debts and disappear endacott was unmoved his indifference apparent would the world be any the worse he ventured we will leave the world out she entreated it would break my heart what can i do about it he asked after a moments pause perhaps nothing she admitted i do not ask you to attempt impossibilities what do you ask he persisted doggedly bertram believes she went on that in that image which gregory went out to china to try to secure is hidden a treasure secure he sneered is a quaint word i wont argue with you about that ralph she said the fact remains that it was a dangerous adventure for a young man and it was undertaken for a worthy object he risked his life didnt he a dozen times over perhaps he failed you know best what do i know he demanded whether he really has a chance of finding the treasurewhether the story is true endacott was silent for several moments no longer indifferent gazing into the lamplit recesses of the room the muscles around his eyes more than once twitching supposing that it is true he suddenly burst out his long frame distended his thin lips parted so that his yellow teeth almost protruded his eyes steelysupposing it is true that he has say a portion of them in his graspthe treasures which the priests of yuntse have collected through all the centurieswhat are they but the emblems of selfsacrifice the gifts of men aiming towards spirituality denying themselves to give to some shadowy god think of it angelecentury after century denying themselves those poor creatures who lived with their heads bent to the land feeding like cattle living and dying like sheep denying themselves for the sake of that strange vein of spirituality that runs through all socalled heathen races is all their selfdenial all they went through the result of it all to go to reinstate in luxury and prosperity a family of foreign roues and gamblers why go into the history of the treasure she demanded what about all the treasures of peru and mexico brought into the old world where did they come from who asks who cares what about the adventurers all the world over who wrenched from the new countries they risked their lives to discover gold and gems and metals and brought them to the meltingpot of life you were not always a sentimentalist ralph she went on after a moments halfchoked pause you know perfectly well that if the gems are there whatever their history may be they are no good to any one hidden and unseen if on the other hand they belong to any one today any one family any one power they belong to the family who learned of their existence and whose son went out and risked his life to acquire them you are very eloquent angele he observed in a noncommittal manner every one who believes what they say is eloquent she rejoined he rose to his feet and walked to the further end of the room abruptly and without excuse for several moments he looked out of the window first across to the red brick wall bordering his domain and then down the narrow lane at the end of which half a dozen villagers were gathered together sluggishly gossiping above the roofs of the village was the sloping park but the moon had not yet risen and here was only a sea of obscurity on his way back he poured himself out a glass of water and drank it angele he said our lives have lain very far apart i have seen very little of you understood very little of you did you love de fourgenet i have loved only one man she replied and i have loved him not as you believe for his unworthiness but for his worthiness de fourgenet turned my head for a weekand neglected me for years i loved bertram from the first day we met he knew it and never once took advantage of the knowledge i would to god i felt convinced he exclaimed almost passionately whether you tell the truth or lie to shield the man you love i tell the truth she assured him with fervour anything there might have been between bertram and myself would have been at my seeking not his he is of the race of evildoers if you must call him an evildoergod knows they existto whom women are sacred endacott thrust his hands into his trousers pockets and sank almost sulkily lower into his chair it was as though he were being convinced against his will well he confided here is the truthas much of it as i know the ballastons have one of the two images i have the other nothing from a structural and material point of view suggests the presence of treasure in their interior and yet i believe that the jewels are there for years there has been deposited with us a coffer of manuscripts which came first from the summer palace of the emperor and afterwards from the temple of yuntse one of those manuscripts which i am now deciphering professes to give precise instructions as to how to secure the jewels there are only a few passages which i cannot master i am going to london in a day or two to obtain from the british museum a dictionary of mongolian dialects which is the only thing i need to help me to complete certain phrases you might think that i could guess at them i cannot because even the manuscript is in code i need the actual letters i believe that the jewels are in one or both of the images within a week i shall know how to extract them she laid her fingers upon his arm ralph dear she begged when that time comesyou are wealthy he stopped her for a moment the expression of almost superb scorn in his face lent him an unusual and unaccustomed dignity angele he interrupted you do not understand if i were a pauper i would refuse to supply the material needs of life with the accumulated offerings of these peasant worshippers but as it happens money is no temptation to me i am already rich in fairness the treasure such as it is should go back to china if i were a younger stronger man the crowning joy of my life would be to take it back and to choose for myself how to distribute it that however can never be i will try to be fair from your point of view china has a claim to the treasure that young man gregory ballaston may be said to also have a claima claim which i should never have admitted for a single moment but for your prayers leave it to me i will decide there was between them a long and rather wonderful silence the church clock behind the cottages in the background chimed twice before either of them spoke madame was lying flat on her back her eyes watching the moon rising slowly over the top of the red brick wall endacott as though overcome with a curious fit of exhaustion was seated almost huddled up in his chair finally he rose wearily to his feet i am tired tonight angele he confessed we understand one another we understand and i pray she answered grasping his hand he left the house then and instead of immediately entering the postern gate opposite turned his face towards the village there were a few lights burning in the windows of the irregular row of houses scarcely a person in the street he walked to the corner of the lane and looked down the main thoroughfare at its further end was a trough and a market cross on the stone balustrade of which some boys and girls were seated plunged in eloquent silence from behind one of the drawn blinds came the sound of a gramophone and through the open door of the ballaston arms the wheezing of a concertina up in the background some scattered lights flashed out from the farspread windows of the hall the outline of which was not yet visible endacott retraced his steps slowly in his ears was a faint tinkling of other music grotesque monotonous yet thrilling before his eyes a strange admixture of roofs beneath his nostrils an odour which never sprung from the soils of norfolk in his brain a confused tumult of thoughts claire a little bored a slim white figure in the violet darkness leaned forward and waved her hand as he entered the postern gate nunks what ages you have been she exclaimed have you been with aunt angele all this time not all the time he admitted where have you been then she persisted you look half asleep he sank back into his chair again he seemed to hear the echo of some tinkling instrument to find in his nostrils a perfume more pungent even than the perfume of the cedar tree to him there was something ominous in what seemed to be almost a message of recall a long journey he muttered a little vaguely chapter vi it was only after he had shown her around the picture gallery on the following sunday afternoon that claire properly appreciated henry ballaston she listened to his last little dissertationstiff perhaps and a trifle pedantic and yet in its way eloquentas to a supposed romney with something more than interest almost enthusiasm here was a man who spoke from his heart of things he loved and a man whom no one in the world meeting him casually would have suspected of possessing such a thing as a heart tell me what first made you love these things so she begged she had seated herself upon the huge divan at the end of the gallery from which in the afternoon light was a wonderful view on one side of the great oil paintings which lined the staircase and on the other through the wideflung mullioned windows a curiously beautiful vignette of the park with its beech and oak trees and beyond at the top of the slope the famous home covert i have had no other life he told her calmly at eton i developed no tastes either for athletics or affairs at oxford they spoke of the church the suggestion was repugnant to me i had some inclinations towards roman catholicism but the ballastons have always been a protestant family i considered the army and discarded the idea all the time wherever i was i wanted to come back to ballaston in the end i came back the old librarian here had just died and somehow or other i drifted into his place that was twentyseven years ago and it seems almost like yesterday a wonderful life she murmured it would have suited few other men he rejoined it has suited me i have activities out of doors as well as within there is scarcely a tree in the park for instance whose history i could not tell you nor an acre of the gardens i have not watched through the winter and summer i have helped to protect the fruits and flowers from the frosts and tried my best to gather in the sunshine for them indoors of course he went on after a moments pause has been the scene of my real labours if labours they can be called i have catalogued the pictures and the china the armour and the various curios after a style of my own with the history so far as possible of each of the masters the date and a copy of such criticisms as have appeared in the press the catalogues you observe are all written by hand she pored over the vellumbound manuscript book which he had been carrying turning the pages and glancing at the extracts written with great care in a stiff clerkly handwriting why this must have taken you ages she exclaimed there are thirtytwo similar volumes he confided the compilation of those alone took me four or five years i am very fortunate in my tastes because you see i am not an ordinary custodian i was born with these pictures these titians and corots and murillos on the lower staircase and those others just as great but with lesser names that hang upon the lefthand side of the galleries on rainy days i have walked from end to end and seen something different each day and each day of each year that is how i suppose affection for a home and its treasures grows that is how at any rate in me has grown up a great love for this house and all that it contains it will never be minei do not wish that it should but i have my share in it i am a ballaston and even if i were turned awayand neither bertram nor gregory would do thati think that my spirit would still haunt these staircases you make one realise she sighed how we waste our lives caring for indifferent things the choice is always with us he reminded her gently in youth however there are other tastes and inclinations which it is as well for us to gratify for instance i see they have commenced to play tennis and lady annistair is looking towards the house shall we go down not yet she begged i am loving being just here tell me some more please you are very sympathetic he acknowledged and you see i am disposed to take advantage of you sometimes indeed it is a relief to talk of ones hobby bertram loves his home and the traditions of his family almost as i do but he has lived outside moved in the great places they are a sentiment to him whereas they are a religion to me and gregory toohe is a little like that it is only natural to me no sort of career has ever appealed i suppose that is why i have filled my life with this one thing today we have only spoken of and looked at the pictures but there are other treasures every ballaston for many generations has collected china one day i must show you our collection there is something more to be appreciated there than its mere appearance i will show you what design can really come to mean what age can do to colouring then you will laugh at me perhaps but i am almost as foolish about our cellars i have watched the laying down of all our clarets mid sherries and ports and madeiras season by season i have given away or disposed of all of every vintage that disappointed that is why every one in the county speaks of the ballaston cellars i cannot alas bring the new things which make life so easy and luxurious to ballaston we have no electric light or heating and i am afraid you would laugh at our bathrooms but there are some of our bedchambers which are wonderful king james room for instance with the rosewood bedstead and original damask and the tapestries which were sent from the palace has scarcely ever been touched let me ask you something she begged may i you will not think it impertinent ask me what you will by all means my dear young lady he answered you have come here quite unexpectedly but you have captured all our hearts it will please me to tell you anything you care to know tell me thenthere isnt really any fear that all this may have to go his face was suddenly the face of an old man the primness of it the selfcontrol the sphinxlike mouth all seemed to fall away together it was an old man looking at death i cannot answer that question he confessed and even his voice was different metallic and toneless bertram entered life with great ideas and unfortunately his wife who was a gracious and charming lady and who would have been a great heiress died when gregory was born then gregory grew up very much in the same fashion as his father the war came and no ballaston ever knew how to save money or to save himself at other peoples expense we are in terrible financial straits and all the time there have been fresh mortgages i myself am not an expert at business but i have spent weary days and weeks thinking and adding up and wondering unless there is money soon it seems to me that the lands must all go and the house be sold up it would break your hearts she said softly it would be death he answered if i could save ballaston he went on a little added strength in his voice a glow although a steely one kindling in his eyes i would commit any crime on earth i would kill i would murder i would destroy i would plunge my soul into immortal misery to save the vandals from the auction rooms in london from coming and laying their hands upon the pictures and china and trees or the furniture and tramping about the rooms where history has been made sometimes lately i have awakened in the night and found myself crying out with fear found great drops of sweat upon my body and it hasnt been a knife at my throat or any horror of that sort but men with catalogues little jew men with pincenez peering at the pictures fat coarselooking men floundering through the rooms and looking at the hallmarks of my china through magnifying glasses he paused suddenly when he spoke again he was a different being my dear young lady he apologised i beg your pardon it is not often that i let myself go like this in fact to tell you the truth it has never happened before will you excuse me if i hurry you downstairs now i know that they are waiting and i must not monopolise you she rose to her feet still silent curiously indisposed for speech feeling in her youth and inexperience that deep though her sympathy and even her understanding she still had no words to offer you see how one gets he concluded as they descended the stairs through dwelling on one subject and one subject only i am a man with one idea but for that idea i am willing to live for that idea i would be quite willing to diehere is my nephew reginalda little angry with me i fear as the others will be for having kept you so long a tall fair boy gregorys younger cousin who had come over from annistair with his mother met them in the hall disconsolately i say he complained i think uncle henry has been most unfair we are all waiting to play tennis with you miss endacott no one will play another set until you come gregory is fuming the tea is cold and mother is quite convinced that you have fallen down an oubliettethere is one somewhere about the place you know youre in disgrace uncle henry i can tell you they all strolled out on to the lawn and claire made her apologies at the tea table please remember my transatlantic weaknesses she begged a house like this is more wonderful than any museum it is just illuminatingno tea thanks some lemonade and one of those cakes sir bertram who had been playing a single at tennis shook his racket at his brother henry he declared you are sent to coventry i appointed you showman with considerable selfsacrifice and gave you half an hour you have been away for an hour and a quarter and we havent finished yet claire insisted i have had the most interesting afternoon of my life i dont believe there is another house like ballaston in the world did you bring home any treasures from china gregory his cousin asked him what is that horriblelooking wooden image in uncle henrys room thats about the only treasure i did bring home was the somewhat grim reply worth about a million i believe if you knew how to handle him a most unprepossessinglooking object my dear gregory his aunt observed it may be valuablei hope for your sake it is if you didnt give much for itbut as an ornament it is absolutely repulsive just what it is meant to be gregory confided it typifies material fortune cut adrift from all redeeming inspiration material fortune is the one thing which we do not associate with this house dont get gloomy greg his cousin drawled here comes my beloved sister at last lets have a four arent you going to play uncle bertram the elders sir bertram replied are going to watch your prowess this set a jeer gregory exclaimed dont ever let my father take advantage of you that way miss endacott he can give me fifteen and owe fifteen and beat me when he feels like it they trooped back on to the tennis lawn played sat about under the cedar trees talked and gossiped until nearly seven oclock claire excused herself from playing in the last set and found a chair near where henry ballaston was seated i havent thanked you half enough for this afternoon she said gratefully i am afraid you must have found me very prolix he rejoined you must excuse an old man with one idea i think the man with one idea she answered is the most satisfactory person in the world as a rule he makes something of ityou spoke this afternoon for a moment of sir bertrams wife tell me more about her my dear there is not a great deal to tell he replied she was a little younger than bertram very beautiful and devotedly attached to him she was the daughter of the earl of rutland who has an estate on the other side of the county she died when gregory was born if she had lived eighteen months longer she would have inherited a fortune of nearly three quarters of a million pounds it was very unfortunate was sir bertram very much in love with her very much indeed in fact so far as i know he has only looked seriously at one other woman since and she too has come under the shadow of a tragedy we are not a fortunate family miss endacott that may come she ventured reassuringly the treasure of the image may materialise after all somehow or other i believe that it will my dear he said it is a very fantastic story for a simpleminded man to believe but if theres truth in itif there should be truth in it then i must confess that i am moved by the same spirit which prompted my brother to conceive the expedition and gregory to risk his life in carrying it out if the jewels are there no superstition no confused sense of morality no fear even of being branded as a wrongdoer would stop me for one moment from taking them in this matter i sympathise with the more bellicose side of my family there was something almost threatening in his words his eyes were held by an approaching figure she looked towards the ringfence which bordered the park mr endacott had just passed through a little gate and was advancing towards them in his rather sombre attire and drooping black felt hat he presented a strange appearance an appearance half grotesque half sinister with expressionless face he shook hands with sir bertram who came forward to meet him although the sun was still very powerful his cheeks were colourless he showed no sign of unusual warmth i regret my tardiness he said in reply to some polite speech from his host i became absorbed in some work i failed to notice the hour sir bertram led him away to be introduced to his sister claire was suddenly aware that her companion had lapsed into speechlessness his eyes had followed the newcomers every movement they were fixed upon him now in a curious set gaze there was an expression in his eyes and about his mouth which for a moment made her shiver mr ballaston she exclaimed he did not appear to hear her instead he seemed to be muttering something to himself she saw his lips move but heard no sound mr ballaston she repeated he was himself again he rose to his feet i beg your pardon he apologised i permitted my attention to wander the coming of your uncle reminds me of a task which i still have to perform he left her with a little bow and turning towards the house stiff formal precise keeping always in the middle of the path and ascending the grey stone steps with measured tread disappeared a few moments later through the wideflung oak doors she watched him until he was out of sight unaccountably disturbed then gregory came and claimed her there was to be still another set of tennis chapter vii endacott laughed cynically but not altogether unkindly when claire had finished her carefully prepared little speech that night after dinner their coffee had been served as usual out of doors under the cedar tree and claire had returned with her uncle to the study still pleading the cause which the events of the afternoon had made to her almost vital he went at once to the sideboard and helped himself to a whisky and soda it is fortunate claire he said that i am a person of even temperament fortunate for you perhaps that i appreciate your presence here and your companionship so much i have listened to you i think you will admit with patience i shall now be as frank with you as i was with your aunt angele last evening he took a long gulp of his drink uncovered a tobacco jar and filled his small pipe afterwards he exchanged his dinner coat for a dressing gown which had been placed on a chair in readiness tied it round him and seated himself at the writing table he dragged the steelclamped coffer of manuscripts to his side and produced the key from his pocket he did not at once open it however he swung around and faced claire you women he pronounced stir my anger with these violent partialities god knows your aunt angele has nothing to love those ballastons for yet she in her pleading was even worse than you father and son they are both of the same mould selfish intolerant proud good to look at if you will but parasites in the great world of deeds and thoughts i will grant them courage but i deny them principle i ask myself in wonder why i find you pleading for them well i know they have the gifts women love the gifts which make women miserable fools your aunt angele is a fool you are a fool i dont think we are anything of the sort uncle she retorted bravely i cant even see that it is foolish to ask a perfectly reasonable thing for people whom you like sir bertram may be everything that you say i only know that i like him i dont like bad people as a rule but i like him and what about the son he demanded his eyes narrowing his thin but bushy eyebrows coming together i like him too she declared stubbornly i was very angry with him on the steamer coming over but since then i think that i understand him better you are not fool enough to be in love with him he asked she stood for a moment without replying the hand which was gripping the back of the chair against which she was leaning moved convulsively her eyes were a little misty her tone when she answered almost indignant that is a horrid question to ask uncle she declared you may be a very learned man but you know nothing about girlsamerican girls anyhow we dont fall in love we leave that to the men of course i know that gregory ballaston is of the same type as his father and they naturally are not the type which would appeal to you but i like him i like to play tennis with him i like to have him talk to me i like his friends he treats me charmingly and i love dear mr henry i have never spent a more interesting hour than i spent with him this afternoon he is delightfula wonderful personality to me it is a tragedy to think that they are going to lose their home if the story of this treasure is true and you can help them to get the jewels why dont you you dont want the money you said the other day that you had more than enough they have one of the images the other one gregory risked his life to obtain you dont want yours let them have both and tell them how to get the jewels endacott puffed at his pipe steadily he had the appearance of seriously considering the matter you talk well child he admitted you remind me of your father you talk sense too that pleases me you shall have the truth from me at any rate i believe in the treasure i believe that in twentyfour hours from now i shall know exactly how to obtain it when i know how i will reconsider the whole matter impartially i promise you that it is practically what i promised your aunt she made a little movement towards him a gesture an exclamation of gratitude he waved her back let me warn you he continued my present inclinations are to devote the treasure which i may discover to building a university in pekin for the benefit of young englishmen and americans who wish to study the inner history and the truth about the greatest nation in the world and if the treasure should realise sufficient money to build others in boston and london for the benefit of the young chinese ask yourself now would not the money be better spent in that way than in handing it over to this piratical degenerate family to gamble away on horses and women and every manner of extravagance to breed another generation of dissolute ballastons who would lead the same life and another very likely after them what do you think claire the girl answered without hesitation i would rather the ballastons had the money you wont argue the matter i cant i would rather the ballastons had the money a part of it at any rate belongs absolutely to them although wu ling actually won back the statue gregory took home with him she hesitated this time but only for a moment you mustnt be angry with me uncle but i have always had it in my mind that wu ling is a chinaman and that he dealt the cards endacott sat quite still for a moment gazing at his niece then he did what was for him one of the rarest things in life he began to laugh he laughed until the tears stood in his eyes until he was compelled to remove his spectacles and wipe them when he had finished he took another gulp of his whisky and soda claire he said you please me you have done your cause no harm at any rate now listen andrews and the servants know but i forgot to tell you i am leaving for london by the train in the morning going to london she exclaimed his face now that the fit of mirth had passed seemed unnaturally stern and strained there is still one visit which i must pay to the british museum he confided one sentence alone which troubles me i know where to look for the key however i shall return by the five oclock train as i have promised you i will then so soon as i am sure of the treasure make up my mind as to its disposition you had better go to bed now let me repeat that you have done your cause no harm by our conversation this evening on the contrary you have probably done good but i wish now to be alone good night she came over and kissed him thankful for that episode of humour somehow or other aware of a vein of more complete humanity in him during the last hour he accepted her salute perfunctorily patted her hand and waved her towards the door as soon as she had departed he turned the key in the coffer for at least a couple of hours endacott worked in peculiar fashion stretched out before him was the sheet of paper upon which he was writing above it the manuscript yellowed with age which he was continually studying on his left were the chinese dictionary a vellumbound manuscript dictionary of phrases having the appearance of great age and a collection of notes mostly compiled at the british museum and secured with a paper fastener on the sheet in front of him were set out the letters of the chinese alphabet at times he slowly transposed these one whole sentence had already taken to itself concrete shape then in the midst of his labours he suddenly paused his pen remained stiff his head was upraised he listened outside it seemed to him that the breathless calm of a hot summer night had formed the background for a slight noise the faint rattle of a pebble displaced a footstep it almost seemed he listened again the night though light enough was moonless and he could only see a few yards through the window he opened the lefthand drawer of his bureau thrust his hand into its furthermost recesses and drew out a small revolver then he rose stealthily to his feet and hesitated he had not passed the greater part of his life in an undisciplined country without learning certain precautions to stand in front of that window was to expose himself a clearly defined mark for assault if indeed there should be marauders about he leaned over and turned out the electric light crossed the room swiftly with the revolver in his hand and passed through the window into the garden he stood still listening with his back to the wall there was an owl calling plaintively in the little grove of trees between the miniature park and the kitchen garden then silencethe faint barking of a dog a long way offsilence again and at no time anything unusual to be seen nevertheless he lingered pebbles can scarcely become detached without human agency his eyes tried to pierce the shadows there was a dark shrub near the wire fenceor was it a shrub he was suddenly convinced that it was the stooping figure of a man he started forward crossing the lawn with swift footsteps which gradually slackened as he grew nearer he was disillusioned the shrub took to itself shape its similitude to a man disappeared he stood and looked around him behind was the gloomy outline of the house with one light burning in a top window from the servants quarters of the village one or two roof tops alone were visible but the lights had long since been extinguished around him was a dimly seen vista of trees and shrubs and flower beds a perfume in the airbut silence he walked slowly towards the house the butt of his revolver still gripped firmly in his hand there was nothing to be seen nor any sound to kindle anxiety yet he was never devoid of that uncatalogued sense which bespeaks the close presence of something concealed something inimical he took to walking in circles he was imagining always some one stalking him from the rear he reached the study windows however without tangible sign of any intruder he pushed them open and entered the room was in darkness he found his way to the switch and turned on the light instantly all his vague premonitions materialised the papers upon his desk were in disorder the curtain in front of the soul had been dragged aside although the image still remained there smiling down upon him he switched on another light and looked round the room searchingly his firmly held revolver following his eyes the room was empty he looked towards the window almost at that moment he heard the soft swingingto and closing of the gate leading from the back avenue the intruder had apparently taken alarm and departed chapter viii gregory on presenting himself at the great house on the following morning received the news of mr endacotts absence with marked interest gone to london has he he observed that means that youre left alone for the day scarcely a tragedy she smiled theres my aunt across the way whom i must go in and see some time a perfectly delightful new piano that only arrived this morning dozens of books to read and if i feel energetic enough i am going to practise mashie shots with the club you gave me a thoroughly selfish programme he pronounced why selfish because it is a solitary one improve upon it then she suggested easily he assented i brought my twoseater round anyhow hoping for the best but with your uncle away the thing is preordained i have given you six lessons at golf in the park youre doing thundering well but not well enough lets go to some real golf links she considered the matter where she enquired cromer he answered promptly it may be rather crowded there but we shall arrive late we can choose two or three vacant holes have some lunch at the club house and motor home another way i should love it she acquiesced enthusiastically ill go and tune up the old bus while you get ready he suggested it was a day which she never forgot a day when all the little things went right into which no jarring note of incident or conversation was ever introduced when the sun shone when everything which happened seemed to become an aid to further content they motored lazily along the country lanes to the links where gregory was obliged to go and fetch the professional to see his amazing pupil afterwards they selected clubs lunched sat on the terrace for a time and motored by a devious way homewards a mile or so from ballaston just inside the park crossing which had afforded them a short cut he stopped the car in the shadow of a great beech tree she looked at him enquiringly puncture sheer fatigue he rejoined mendaciously great strain driving a car like this do you mind just for a moment why surely not she answered leaning back and taking out her cigarette case its perfectly delightful here wont you smoke he shook his head not just for a moment he answered looking straight at the mascot upon the bonnet of his car i want to talk and im a jolly bad hand at it anyway youre not so hopeless she assured him encouragingly you can go straight on ill help you out when its necessary she spoke lightly enough but already a queer little sense of excitement warned her to keep her face turned away from his the things which he might say seemed incredible she was passionately anxious and yet afraid to hear them you see miss claire he began i made a jolly bad start with you and that makes me extra careful i never thought i was going to turn superstitious but i can assure you of one thingi havent trusted myself alone in uncle henrys room with that image since i got back i hope your uncle henrys behaviour she began with a faint smile oh dont chaff he interrupted i think it would take the devil himself to persuade uncle henry to step out of the narrow paths this is what i wanted to sayclaire he paused again unrebuked his eyes looked up the avenue towards the house his slim fingers played nervously with the steering wheel were in for a big family smash we ballastons he confided what little there is left when it comes will have to go of course to the governor and to uncle henry for me there wont be anything im not complaining im young enough still i have wonderful health and although im an ass at all the things that moneys made out of i can ride i understand farming and horses and all that sort of thing i have made up my mind what to do i am going out to canada canada she murmured under her breath yes i know some fellows there who are doing quite decently i shall be able to get just the sort of start i want now of course he went on under the circumstances i ought not to say what im going to say to you but i am going to say it all the same i asked you to marry me once claire it wasnt any good of course you had only seen the rotten side of me then but you understood today i cant ask you to marry me but i want to tell you that i have all that feeling which a man should have when he asks such a thing and ten thousand times more than most men have he paused again she said nothing her face was turned even a little farther away he went on of course ive done no particular good in the worldhave been all sorts of a rotter from one point of viewbut ive kept moderately straight about girls and heres the truth anyhow i never came near caring for one before and i love you gregory she whispered at the sight of her eyes the sound of her voice he was suddenly swept almost off his feet it was amazing sweetheart you mustnt he begged holding her hand firmly i know im doing wrong to tell you on the other hand it seems to me that i would be doing wrong if i went away and you didnt know so there you are i cant ask you to marry me but im going to work like a horse as soon as i get away and if i have any of the luck of the ballastons they used to talk about i shall only value it for one thing im not asking you for anythingnot for a thought even much less a promisebut if at the end of a few years i see my wayi wonder you dear thing gregory she interrupted kiss me at once you know i didnt mean this claire he said a little remorsefully as he stopped the car at the gates of the great house i hoped you did she answered demurely idiot he smiled remember were not engaged you havent promised anything youve been sweet and dear and given me just the stimulus for work i needed supposing she whispered that you found the treasure you might not have to go to canada he shook his head gloomily i darent trust myself to think about that he said your uncle seems to have made up his mind not to help us and im beginning to lose faith in the whole story still she persisted if the story should turn out to be trueand uncle believes ityour home might be saved and you would not have to go abroad at all it would be wonderful he admitted dont give up hope then she whispered uncle was quite sweet to me last nightabsolutely different hes gone to londonbut there perhaps i ought not to tell you just wait something pleasant may happen after all the door was thrown open by andrews the butler she gave gregory her hand which he held for a moment and raised to his lips her farewell glance lingered long in his memory chapter ix endacott although abstracted seemed for him to be in an almost genial frame of mind when he obeyed the summons of the evening gong and meeting claire in the hall waited to enter the dining room with her a tiring day uncle she asked him not particularly he answered i made only two calls phillpots kept me some time at the british museum or i could really have caught the earlier trainhow is the piano i havent tried it she admitted your aunt all right today more confessions uncle i havent even seen her endacott as he took his place removed his spectacles for a moment rubbed his eyes wearily and then looked across at his niece what have you been doing all day then he demanded claire summoned up all her courage mr ballaston called for me and i went over to the cromer golf links with him she confided i had a lesson at golf some lunch and afterwards we came home through blakeney her uncle rather to claires surprise made no comment the service of dinner appeared to interest him more than usual and he certainly ate with appetite railway travelling agrees with me i think he remarked i feel that i shall enjoy working this evening after dinner i shall have a pipe on the lawn with my coffee and thenthe halfhour which i have been looking forward to for so long did you get what you wanted from mr phillpots she asked him with a queer little note of eagerness in her tone i did he admitted unless i am very much mistaken i can fill in all the missing spaces in that manuscript within an hour bytheby claire you didnt come down again last night after you had gone to bed did you or hear anything unusual she shook her head i was much too sleepy why he toyed nervously with some bread upon his plate his eyes sought hers almost furtively just an idea he said i left my work for five or ten minutes and walked around the garden when i came back my papers were all disturbed i didnt stir out of my room after i went upstairs she assured him was anything missing were there any papers there that mattered as it happened there were not he replied if it had been tonightwell it might have been different although a manuscript in chinese even though translated as it will be would be scarcely likely to attract an ordinary thief would it she moved in her chair a little uneasily i should think not she replied in any case if you were only out of the room for a few minutes who could have entered without your seeing them just so he agreed as you suggest it might have been fancy or a breath of wind from outside or the opening of a door you mustnt sit up too late tonight she told him you are looking very tired he nodded gently all the work i have to do he said will be finished in an hour afterwards i may write a letter while you go in and see your aunt his sudden fit of what was for him almost garrulity left him and he relapsed into his usual silence punctuated only by monosyllabic replies to claires remarks he accompanied her into the garden however at the conclusion of the meal and whilst they sat together over their coffee he asked her an abrupt question how old are you claire twentyone she told him twentyone last may you are a sensible girl he went on when i heard that i was going to have a niece to look after and that she was coming out to china for me to take her to england i must confess that i was terrified such an upheaval in my daily life seemed to me calamitous i have been agreeably surprised your coming has been a pleasure to me claire i only wish that you had come before her eyes suddenly filled with tears it was the first time he had ever spoken to her in such a fashion i am a poor adviser for a young girl he continued a little regretfully and i am afraid that your aunt is hopelessly prejudiced in the matter i cannot bring myself to believe however that the society of this young man gregory ballaston is a good thing for you i distrust the family ethics i cannot help thinking that he is hoping through you to arrive at the information which so far i have refused his father and his uncle i was with him for several hours today nunks and he never even mentioned it she ventured he is going out to canada in a month or so to earn his own living endacott sighed i am full of prejudices he confessed the last twenty years of my life have been spent in abstractions have passed like a dream away from the world which counts which one ought really never to lose sight of i should be an illadviser to any onego and play something claire disappeared into the house and soon the sound of her music drifted out in little ripples of melody through the perfumed stillness her uncle listened for some time without any sign of pleasure or the reverse then he rose to his feet and looked up across the roofs of the village over the green slopes in the background to where a few lights were slowly appearing from the windows of the hall presently the music ceased and claire stole out to him she passed her arm through his it is a very beautiful home that uncle she said softly dont you think it would be a sin to have it all broken up a better race might follow he muttered she shook her head they belong she said gently he turned away with a little grunt and entered his study for a few minutes claire flitted round the garden there was a nightingale singing somewhere in the distance to which she stopped to listen even the noises from the village through the gathering twilight became almost melodious presently she passed through the postern gate strolled across the lane and entered the drawingroom of the little house through the wideflung windows madame lay stretched upon her couch listless and weary she welcomed claire with only the ghost of a smile where have you been all day child she asked enjoying myself i am afraid was the remorseful reply gregory came and fetched me and we went over to cromer how did he seem madame enquired with a shade of interest almost eagerness in her manner was he very depressed claire shook her head thankful for the twilight he seemed very much as usual she answered if anything a little nicer i enjoyed my day very much the only thing i felt was that i was neglecting you madame made a faint gesture of denial i am very glad to think that you had such a happy day dear she said i am glad you came in for a moment though i dont know why it is but tonight i have nerves where is your uncle working away as usual at his chinese manuscripts claire replied he went to london this morning and came back at five oclock madame nodded i saw the car go with him and bring him back i dont know how it is but the sight of every one today makes me uneasy even bertram seemed queer he sat with me for an hour this afternoon as a rule he soothes me today somehow or other he frightened me i feel as though there were a sort of psychological thunder in the air aunt you mustnt let yourself imagine such foolish things claire begged everything and every one is as usual uncle as a matter of fact was in remarkably good spirits this evening can any one help fancies and presentiments my dear who lies here hour after hour day by day as i do madame sighed i know it is silly but instinct is stronger than reason and bertram at any rate was strange today every now and then he left off talking and there seemed to be something always behind his eyes miss besant entered the room and claire called to her she began to make preparations with firm capable fingers for moving the couch claire bent over and kissed her aunt no more morbidness please she insisted ill be over early tomorrow morning i may have some news for you your uncle has found what he wanted in london then madame asked claire nodded assent he told me a short time ago she confided that in half an hour he would know everything there is to be known she crossed the lane and passed through the postern gate gazing wistfully over the roofs of the village houses towards the park her preparations for the night when she finally reached her room took her longer than usual it was late when after she had turned out the lights she moved to the window and stood there for a moment looking out suddenly the little reminiscent smile upon her lips changed to one of actuality of real and instant pleasure the moonlight was as yet faint but crossing the stile which led from the park she caught a glimpse of a white shirt for a moment she was tempted he might be coming even as far as the gardens late though it was then she looked back at her neatly folded clothes and shook her head claire she soliloquised youre a sentimental idiot after which she turned out the light got into bed and slept soundly when she awoke the sun was shining into her room the thrushes and blackbirds were singing and there were sounds of unusual movement downstairs still only half awake she sat up listening to the footsteps upon the gravel beneath her window there were voices too muffled yet agitated then she heard one worda dramatic horrible slur against the background of the summer morning deadcold dead he were for a moment she shook herself she felt that she must be in a nightmare then she became conscious of the reality of those footsteps below the renewed murmuring of awestricken voices she sprang out of bed before she could reach the window she heard the same hoarse shocked voice with its quaint norfolk inflexion shot right through the head thats what happened to him writing there at the table with his papers lying all over the place theres a revolver on the floor police sergeant cloutson wont have it touched she leaned screaming out of the window amongst the little crowd below were the village policeman both the gardeners and mr wilkinson the clergyman tell me what has happened she cried out frantically they seemed all stricken dumb tell me tell me what it is she insisted mr wilkinson turned towards the front entrance if you will put on a dressing gown and come to your door he said i will speak to you she met him halfway down the stairs her knees were trembling and she clung to the banisters for support tell me what it is she demanded is it uncle my dear young lady he announced solemnly a terrible thing has happened you must prepare yourself for the worst your uncle has been shot through the head apparently at some time during the night the doctor is with him now butbut he is quite dead dead she repeated mechanically all his papers are in a state of great disorder the clergyman concluded i am afraidit is a terrible thing to say but i am afraid there is no doubt that your uncle has been murdered end of book two book three chapter i the new tenant of the great house installed within twelve months of its dramatic vacancy issued one evening through the small postern gate set in the red brick wall which encircled his gardens into the village street this was his first appearance since he had taken up his residence in the neighbourhood and he was consequently an object of absorbed interest to such few loiterers as were about an elderly roadmender who was making halfhearted assaults upon a broken piece of road with a pickax which seemed too heavy for him looked up curiously and touched his hat the postmistress warned by a subordinate hastened immediately to the entrance of her establishment as though to consult the church clock mr franks the butcher at the corner of the street hurried out on the pretext of giving some parting instructions to a boy who was just starting off on his bicycle with a special order for the hall and mrs moles who kept a small general shop and was reputed to know the genealogy morals and predilections of every one within a dozen miles around stared unabashed over the top of her curtains the first impressions of the newcomer to be privately exchanged within the next hour or so could scarcely fail to be favourable peter johnson appeared to be a man a little under medium height sturdy cleanshaven with bright steady eyes humorous mouth brown sundried complexion and hair inclined to greyness he wore a tweed knickerbocker suit a homburg hat he carried an ash stick and his age might have been anything between forty and fifty no one was more interested in their new neighbour who was now engaged in making his leisurely way along the village street than the three men in the bar parlour of the ballaston arms conscious of their own invisibility behind the muslin curtains they yielded without restraint to their curiosity he do seem an ordinary kind of a man thomas pank the innkeeper observed critically a sportsman maybe mr craske the grocer suggested appreciating the costume of the approaching figure rawson the butler from the hall shrugged his shoulders doubtfully every one listened for his comment with interest he was admitted to be a man of the world and a person of considerable experience i should say not he decided he is wearing the clothes of a country gentleman but to my mind he wears them as though he werent used to them the only stranger in the neighbourhood a young man of sandy complexion of silent habits and with rather sleepy eyes who had lodgings in the farmhouse close by and was understood to be a schoolmaster taking a prolonged vacation set down his glass and intervened he too was watching the newcomer with some interest he is asking for some shooting farmer kershaw told me that dont go to prove nothing the innkeeper declared theres many as shoots now out from norwich and the big towns that dont know one end of the gun from the other what i say is that its a queer thing that a man with no friends around a solitary man too by all accounts should come and settle in a place like this and in that particular house too mysterious i call it i am of the same opinion rawson agreed hold on you chaps the innkeeper enjoined in a tone of some excitement hes coming right in here the pseudoschoolmaster whose name was understood to be fielding was the only one of the little company who did not show signs of embarrassment as the latch of the door was lifted the door itself pushed open and the subject of their conversation made his appearance the grocer had plunged rather too abruptly into the discussion of some local topic with the butler and the innkeeper was too taken aback to conceal his astonishment at this unexpected visit mr johnson however was one of those people who carry with them a composing influence and the slight awkwardness was of very short duration good afternoon gentlemen he greeted them glancing around with quiet geniality i should like a whisky and soda mr landlord thats right sir was the latters prompt reply as he turned to his shelf my name is johnsonpeter johnson the newcomer continued establishing himself in a vacant easychair i have come to live for a time at the great house very glad to welcome you here sir mr craske assured him civilly hope youll find the place to your liking sir rawson put in i am very much obliged to you all was the gratified rejoinder my first impressions are entirely favourable i have been a hard worker and i need a little rest so far as i can judge this seems to me to be a particularly tranquil neighbourhood there was for a moment an almost awkward hiatus in the conversation the innkeeper and the grocer exchanged glances rawson coughed it has always been considered so in the past sir the latter acknowledged this being my first visit you gentlemen will perhaps join me mr johnson invited as he received his whisky and soda every one accepted the invitation including the presumed schoolmaster who had not as yet spoken mr johnson observed him keenly from underneath his rather heavily lidded eyes are you a native of these parts he enquired i am more or less a stranger was the somewhat reserved reply i like you have come down for a little quiet cant say as your manner of living quiet would altogether suit me the grocer remarked cheerily the young gentlemans a naturalist sir he explained turning to the principal guest of the afternoon he goes moth hunting with a net round the mere side and across to cranley swamp at night thats not a job as would suit every one mr johnson was politely interested the young man smiled in expostulatory fashion i am only an amateur he confessed and i only go out odd nights during the week i miss my sleep too much youll not be finding much company in these parts im afraid the innkeeper observed making polite conversation with the stranger theres not so many of the gentry living round as there used to be mr johnson showed signs of interest well he said im a great reader and im fond of the country so i must make the best of it tell me something about my neighbours who lives in the long low house across the way from my garden gate thats what we do call the little house sir the innkeeper replied it belongs to a poor invalid lady who dont seem to get any stronger de fourgenet her name isor something like thatshe having married a foreigner but most of the folk round here just call her madame shes an english lady but she have lived abroad a great deal according to her letters she do be some sort of a titled lady but she dont seem to hold to it herself an invalid eh mr johnson enquired sympathetically they do say sir that its her spine the grocer confided anyway shes mostly lying down some time ago they took her to one of them french places but it dont seem to have done her much good aixlesbains it was the butler put in ive been there with my gentlemen before now in fact it was through us i think that she went there did it do her no good at all some say it made a difference and some say it didnt was the doubtful reply anyway theres a physician comes to see her now once a month and she has massage regularly from norwich it looks as though there were still some hope is sheerinclined to be sociable her new neighbour enquired the grocer shook his head im afraid she isnt disposed that way sir he declared she and the squire have been great friends all their lives and he visits her regular but she dont see none of the other folk round if she can help it that doesnt sound encouraging mr johnson commented does she live quite alone she has a companion the innkeeper answereda miss besant a nice properspoken young woman but keeps herself to herself there was a niece toolived at the great house she didbut she went away about a year agone and she hasnt been in these parts since as a neighbour mr johnson confessed with a little sigh madame appears to be a washout lets hear about the rest of the folk well the innkeeper continued taking a modest pull at his own tankard there do be the vicar for sure but he baint no use to nobody these days a man more changed than he i never did see a sombre silent man he is now surely the grocer confirmed the butler nodded ponderous agreement he used to dine with us once a week regular but hasnt been near the hall sincenot for eleven months they say that he never stirs out of his study now i was looking over his garden wall only last night the innkeeper observed it do seemthe whole placeto be going to rack and ruin and he so proud of his garden too he has had some sort of a loss perhaps mr johnson suggested none as any one knows of the butler affirmed hes a widower and have lived alone ever since he came here there are some who say that hes had a falling out with the squire but if that be so none of us have heard of it the squire mr johnson repeated hopefully and who might he be the butlers manner betokened hurt surprise the squire sirmy masteris sir bertram ballaston of ballaston hall an old family the sixteenth baronet mr johnson was properly impressed any family he enquired one sonmr gregory ballaston then the squires brothermr henry ballastonlives at the hall with him the butler added after a scarcely perceptible pause not that hes much company for any one though indeed mr johnson murmured is he too a recluse or an invalid there seemed to be a marked disinclination to discuss the inmates of the hall the innkeeper looked out of the window mr craske gazed into his tankard the young man remained still almost outside the conversation things up at the hall the butler confided with some reserve are not what they used to be there have come a change over the place a change indeed the grocer sighed gloomily mr johnson sensed reserves and prepared for departure well i must be tiring you with all my questions he declared goodhumouredly im going to ask you one more though is it my fancy or wasnt this placemarket ballastonthe scene of some sort of a tragedy some time ago the namemarket ballastonseemed familiar to me directly i read the advertisement but i couldnt recall what it was if it was anything serious it must have been whilst i was abroad they all looked at him incredulously the innkeeper picked up a glass and began to wipe it the grocer coughed nervously even the butler seemed at a loss for words youll excuse us sir mr craske said at last this is a very small place of course and when a thing happens right in the midst of us like what did happen it seems to us somehow as though the whole world ought to know about it still there was a lot of stira lot of stir in all the london newspapers i am a careless reader of the newspapers mr johnson confessed besides which the last twenty years of my life up to a few months ago have been spent not only abroad but a very long way abroad fill up the glasses mr innkeeper i have asked you so many questions that you must allow me to be host once more now tell me what it was that happened here they all exchanged glances as though by common but unspoken consent the butler became spokesman there was a very terrible murder committed in this village sir just about twelve months ago a gentleman was killed in the nightshot through the head he wasand never a trace of the murderer from that day to this good god peter johnson exclaimed properly shocked i am beginning to remember something about it it was a gentleman of the name of endacott from foreign parts like you the butler continued own brother to madame at the little house he hadnt been here very long but he was a harmless body and well liked he had dined with us at the hallhim and his niece a very beautiful young ladyher as mr pank spoke of being also niece to madameand it seemed as though we were going to become quite friendly one morningthere he wasseated at his desk where he used to work at nightsshot through the head and stone dead and a box of papers that was by his side all scattered about anyhow there was police come from norwich and there was police come from scotland yard in london but from that day to this they do seem to have been fairly outwitted what a terrible thing mr johnson exclaimed in a small place like this too where did it happen where did you say he lived there was another embarrassed silence this time it was the grocer who intervened there was a note of indignation in his tone if the agent as let the propertymr borroughes i suppose it wassaid nothing about it sir then theres no doubt he was very much to blame the murder was committed in the great house where youve come to live mr endacott and his niece were the last tenants chapter ii mr johnson subsided once more into the easychair from which he had risen this is most amazing he exclaimed a murder in the great house only twelve months ago it do seem most unaccountable sir the grocer ventured that you never heard about it i was abroad at the time and until a month or so ago mr johnson explained and it is astonishing how you lose touch with things altogether after a while i sometimes didnt open an english newspaper for a week at a timewell well he went on perhaps thats the reason why they asked such an extraordinarily low rent for the house its amany the innkeeper observed who wouldnt live there rent freenot that im saying that any educated person ought to take notice of such he added hastily its a fine house and the gardens are grand and i only hope sir that youll be comfortable and not be put off so to speak by a thing thats passed and gone and you say that the police have never even made an arrest mr johnson asked incredulously surely thats a very unusual thing in this country unusual it may be the innkeeper admitted but a fact it is all the same for weeks afterwards we had gentlemen from scotland yard almost living in the place one stayed here in this very inn and the questions he did ask were surely ridiculous but there wasnt one of them clever enough to find out who killed mr endacott the new tenant of the great house finished his drink in silence and rose to his feet well gentlemen he observed i strolled in here to make friends with any of my new neighbours who might be around and make acquaintance with the place so to speak but i certainly didnt expect to hear anything like this its a bad start im afraid sir the innkeeper regretted civilly but youd have been bound to have heard of it before long such a stir it did make the grocer reflected every morning and every afternoon there was a fresh rumour as you might say but not a single arrest mr johnson repeated most extraordinary i hope now that you know the worst as is to be told sir rawson ventured that youll soon settle down here and like the neighbourhood mr johnson inclined his head gravely i have no doubt that i shall he declared in many respects the great house suits me perfectly it is just the sort of garden i want to have the neighbourhood seems healthy and it is not too far from the sea i wish you good afternoon gentlemen there was a little chorus of farewells the new tenant took his departure swinging his stick and though naturally a little thoughtful after the news he had heard there was nothing in his manner to indicate that he intended to take it too seriously to heart they watched him from behind the muslin curtains until he opened the gate which led into his gardens and disappeared he do seem to me to have plenty of courage and a proper man for the neighbourhood the innkeeper pronounced wiping up his counter there is amany might have been struck all of a heap at being told what we had to tell him any sort of tenant is better than none the grocer sighed but a family i must confess is what i was hoping for rawson as became his position maintained a somewhat dubious attitude i could wish he observed with a heavy frown that he had given us some indication as to his previous occupation or station in life his coming in here and sitting down for a drink was friendlylike but not exactly usual to me he seemed scarcely the sort of man whom the squire for instance would be likely to take a fancy to the squire be a great gentleman the grocer said reverently there arent many like him left in these parts hes not likely to take up with a stranger why should he why indeed rawson assented yet he seemed to take quite a fancy to mr endacott mr gregory too paid the young lady quite a lot of attention and no wonder the innkeeper remarked she was a properlooking young lady there aint many in these parts could hold a candle to her for looks youre not very gay just now at the hall mr rawson he continued the butler stifled a regretful sigh things at the hall were a great deal less gay than he was prepared to disclose were generally pretty quiet during the summer he admitted the squire was never one for entertaining much before the shooting i did think that mr gregory being at home might have made a little difference but hes due they say to start for foreign parts at any momentsix oclock gentlemen i wish you all good evening there was a simultaneous breakup of the little party rawson ponderous as ever and grey of complexion notwithstanding his country life first made a dignified exit and walking a short way down the village street climbed the stile which led into the park mr craske crossed the street and returned to the pleasantlooking creepercovered establishment behind the long shop windows of which he and his father and grandfather before him had dispensed groceries and gossip for the last hundred years finally the young man fielding took his silent departure mounting a motor bicycle which he had left leaning up against the wall he glanced at his watch and reflected for a few moments be going for a ride mr fielding the innkeeper who had followed him outside enquired the young man looked up and down the sleepy sunbaked street and glanced at a signboard where the road forked i may get as far as norwich he ruminated im wanting some new flies a pleasant ride and all this evening the other observed queer it do seem these days to think of getting to norwich and back afore dark them things as you ride have made a power of difference in getting about the young man smiled twenty miles to norwich he remarked forty minutes taking it easy yes i think i shall run over there he swung on to his machine which started at once and in three quarters of an hour he was writing out a telegram in a post office in norwich afterwards he made a pilgrimage to a sporting emporium in the main street and with the care of an expert selected a fresh assortment of flies with which to tempt a particularly elusive but desirable trout eight oclock was striking as he passed once more through the village street of market ballaston on his way back to his farmhouse lodgings he dismounted outside the ballaston arms and stood looking about him with the air of one absorbing to the full the gentle atmosphere of peace beauty and rustic content at the end of the street a row of houses mostly of grey stone with deep red tiles opened out into the little market place where an ancient covered cross stood in the centre of a cobbled space on a stone trough three or four youths and two young women were seated in peaceful and almost aggressive silence mr houghton the bank manager was standing on the cool flagged pavement outside his neat little house smoking a cigarette and chatting with foulds the veterinary surgeon who had just driven up in his little twoseater car whilst just across the way mr craskes goodlooking daughter had stepped out of the front door to water the row of geraniums in the boxes before the windows from the great house set in somewhat severe isolation behind its encircling red brick wall came the clamorous summons of a dinner gong and almost immediately afterwards a similar invitation from the tinkling of chinese bells sounded from the little house the melody from the latter had scarcely died away before from the hall came the slow booming of the alarm bell rung nightly at the dinner hour the young man listened and into his sleepy eyes there crept a speculative expression as they travelled beyond the village street beyond the park up the great grassbordered avenue towards the windows of the hall it seemed almost as though he could see into the very stately and undisturbed jacobean dining room see the three men who sat together at the end of that desert of mahogany frowned down upon by lines of pictured ancestors their slightest need anticipated by rawson and his welltrained subordinates as though he could hear their languid and stilted efforts at conversation as though perhaps he could see the ghosts behind their chairs as though when he swung round a moment or two later he could see into the more modest but still impressive dining room of the great house where mr peter johnson sat alone before a far simpler repast eating and drinking with a frown upon his forehead and lines about his mouth no traces of which had appeared during those more genial moments of his afternoon visit to the ballaston arms as though turning still a little farther round he could see even into that quaint low dining room of the little house take note of the invalid with golden hair and weary brown eyes who lay upon her long chair drawn up by the side of the round table the discontented but earnest young woman who sat opposite to her the harshfeatured maid their sole attendant in the end he sighed and abandoned his reflections he entered the inn disturbing thereby mr pank the landlord in the middle of his supper and drank a glass of gin and tonic then the quick explosions of his bicycle disturbed once more the quiet drowsy street as he flashed through the village on his homeward way throughout the whole of that long summer day it had scarcely seemed possible that there could be a more peaceful spot in the world than the wide street the cobbled market place and the winding country lanes which emptied themselves into the village of market ballaston at three oclock on the following morning there was not only peace but silence absolute and complete the two hundred and fortythree men women and children who made up its inhabitants had passed into the land of ghosts even the houses themselves with their closed blinds and sightless windows breathed the very spirit of repose the chiming of the church clock notwithstanding its silvery distinctness seemed to carry with it a note almost of apology to a sleeping world silence more complete than ever followed the dying away of its last trembling note for some time not even an uneasy dog or a too eager denizen of the farmyard ventured to disturb the moonlit pall of silence then came the first sign of human movement the small postern gate set in the red brick wall which surrounded the great house was opened noiselessly and peter johnson stepped into the lane he stood there for a moment or two perfectly still with the air of a man listeninga hopeless task it seemed on such a night whilst he listened his eyes wandered up and down the street away across the churchyard and into the wood behind past the steeple and over the sleeping country to the horizon it seemed however that if he watched for any unusual sight or listened for any unusual sounds both efforts were in vain after a few moments he took another step forward and with the postern gate still open stood gazing thoughtfully and watchfully over the medley of redtiled roofs up the great avenue beyond to where the imposing front of the hall with its long rows of uncurtained windows filled the background with a serene and brooding dignity he stood there perhaps for as long as five minutes until he seemed to become part of the dreaming landscape a statue petrified by the moonlight the only living figure in that drama of repose all the geniality and kindliness drained somehow from his expression a sinister and watchful figure alien and inimical suddenly he seemed to stiffen from the outside of a small wood adjoining the hall flashed a lightlittle more than a pinprick of fire but vivid and distinct three times it flashed then it disappeared peter johnson as silently as he had come stepped back and vanishing through the postern gate reentered his own domains chapter iii mr peter johnson on the following morning was indulging in the harmless occupation of practising mashie shots with a dozen golf balls over some shrubs upon the front lawn of the great house when morton his newly engaged butler who had arrived a few days before from a registry office at norwich sallied through the garden door followed by a young lady mr johnson promptly abandoned his diversion and came forward miss besant to see you sir the servant announced mr johnson without committing himself to speech exhibited a certain measure of cordiality he held out a welcoming hand which after a moments hesitation the girl accepted i must apologise for coming in like this mr johnson she said madame de fourgenet the lady to whom i am companion insisted upon it i beg that you will not apologise was the civil reply i am very glad to see you you are my opposite neighbour then it seems we live at the little house the young lady assented for over a yearall the time that the place has been empty in factyour gardener smith has been accustomed to assist our one servant for half an hour each day cutting wood or something of that sort madame has the strongest objection to having a stranger in the house or even in the garden and she sent me across to ask whether it were possible to make any arrangement by which we could continue to have the services of smith for that time each day mr johnson made no immediate reply he was exceedingly interested in the young lady and he seemed to be carrying out a line of thought with regard to her from the moment of her appearance her expression had not changed her tone which was level and indifferent was the tone of a person who had no concern in what she said she spoke mechanically as though choosing the readiest words with the sole object of concluding an unavoidable task she was tall inclined to be of full figure paler than she ought to have been living in the country with eyes which seemed seldom fully open masses of light brown hair brushed back from her forehead and a mouth whose discontented corners gave to her expression a weary almost a petulant note no ordinary person an admirer of the sex studying her as she had crossed the lawn would probably have troubled to look at her again mr johnson however was not an ordinary person it was one of his gifts to appreciate people for what they were not for what they seemed to be he realised that there were certain exceptional characteristics about the young woman who stood waiting for his reply please dont hesitate to say so she went on half turning away if you think madames request unreasonable i really dont see myself why you should consent i am simply the bearer of a message my dear young lady pray sit down mr johnson invited pushing a wicker chair towards her please assure madamei fear that her name is a little beyond methat i should be very glad indeed for smith to continue to render her the services which he has hitherto performed as to remuneration she began mr johnson waved his hand pray settle that with the man himself he begged i shall allow him his half an hour off each dayhe has an under gardener and can spare the time it is only a neighbourly action anything madame may choose to give him is no concern of mine you are very kind she said doubtfully but i do not think that madame will care to accept the mans services in your time without seeing that you are recompensed make your own arrangements then he suggested the matter is scarcely worth serious discussion the young woman rose you are very kind she repeated you must excuse my having come to see you in this informal fashion it was madames desire and i have to obey orders i will excuse it my dear young lady he declared on one condition condition that you sit down and talk to me for a minute or two why should i do that she asked with a querulous uplifting of the eyebrows which he had already noticed were very fine and silky because we are neighbours he replied because i have just returned to this country after many years spent abroad and i am at times lonely because i am quite sure that madame can spare you for half an hour and becausehere is a great ideaif i let you have my gardener for half an hour why shouldnt madame as you call her let me have her companion for the same length of time she looked at him with mild curiosity her selfpossession was so marked as to indicate indifference is it my fancy she asked or are you rather a strange person i like to talk he confided all my life i have had to live amongst silent people that is finished agreeable society is one of the things to which i have looked forward upon my return to england then why on earth did you come to market ballaston she demanded with unexpected vehemence you wont find any society here why did you come why did you choose this place she had without warning adopted an almost inquisitive tone but his eyes met hers steadily he seemed to be trying to divine her sudden access of interest i came he explained because i like a large house and gardens when i can afford them and this place is very cheap i had to settle down somewhere and this neighbourhood is as good as any other as to the peoplewell if there is no one here who wants to be friendly i must make the best of it i have been abroad for a great many years but i have a few friends left who will find me out in time the little spark of interest seemed to have entirely died out of her manner i see she murmured the house certainly is a pleasant one we scarcely expected though to see it let so soon why not people have ideas you know the story of the last tenant here i heard it after i had taken the house he confided she pointed to the library window on the ground floor he was shot one night in the study there she told him terrible and what seems more terrible still i understand that the murderer was never caught surely some one must have been suspected the girl shrugged her shoulders she had accepted one of her companions cigarettes and was smoking lazily and with a certain measure of content i think she said that every one in the village has been suspected including mr wilkinson the clergyman myself every one up at the hall and all the servants the hard thing however has always been to discover any possible motive nothing was taken from the room then i suppose he enquired nothing that could be traced nothing apparently of any value mr endacott had been occupied in the translation of some wonderful chinese manuscripts at the time the affair happened the box containing them was upset and the manuscripts were all over the place but no one could tell if any were missing or if they were of any real value even his niece miss endacott who ought to have known had nothing whatever to say what sort of a man was this predecessor of mine he asked he had been a great scholar in his day she answered a little doubtfully but really i only saw him once or twice some of the papers called him the greatest living authority on chinese art and antiquities he had spent nearly all his life out there of cheerful disposition not very he was exceedingly reserved and seemed all the time engrossed in his work he chose this part of the world i think to be near madame but considering that they were brother and sister he saw very little of her and the young ladyhis niece she was very attractivei suppose you might say beautiful was the somewhat cold reply she left soon after the inquest and hasnt returned yet she is coming to stay with madame i believe very shortly a most mysterious affair mr johnson reflected yet i dare say if one knew where to start the solution would be very simple now supposing miss besant any one were to offer you the thing you most desired in life to discover who fired that shot where should you start your investigations she turned her head and looked at him the sleepy droop of her eyelids had for a moment gone and he saw that her eyes themselves were beautiful i have not the faintest idea she assured him nature never meant me for a detective i have too little imagination there was a brief silence the young lady began to make preparations for departure tell me her companion ventured now that i am settling down here i should like to be neighbourly it is of course impossible for madame to come and see mewould it be possible for me to call upon her in a general way she replied after a moments hesitation i should have told you at once that it was altogether impossible madame detests visitorsthe outer gate is generally kept locked as a hintbut curiously enough she has shown the utmost interest in your coming she will bombard me with questions when i return unless what i say satisfies her it is very possible that she may consent to receive your visit although she added you wont get much amusement out of it in any case he said i hope before long that madame may require some other trifling service and that you will again be her ambassadress she left him vouchsafing only the most casual of farewells and passing round the corner of the house without a backward glance mr johnson watched her every step an ordinary young woman without a doubt wearing ordinary clothes saying ordinary things and with an unusual gift for concealment yet there was something in her very reticence which had its allurement mr johnson who was not a profound psychologist although he had always understood the men with whom he had had to deal had a flash of inspiration she was ordinary just as she was reticentbecause she was by temperament or circumstance intensely selfpossessive he came to the conclusion as he returned to his unaccustomed pursuit and fluffed mashie shot after mashie shot that there existed a miss besant at present entirely unrevealed at precisely halfpast three oclock that afternoon there occurred what was looked upon almost as a pageant in the village with great ceremony the very fine gates leading to the hall were thrown open by the lodge keeper and in the small oldfashioned brougham which only left the ballaston stables three or four times a year drawn by a couple of dark bay horses whose sides shone like satin and whose harness glittered from every point of view in iridescent splendour mr henry ballaston on behalf of the family came to call upon the newcomer at the great house from the lodge gates onward the progress of the seldom seen lesser autocrat of the village and neighbourhood was something like a royal procession the tradesmen hastened to their shop windows to perform their salutes the roadmender stood bareheaded looking downward as one receiving a blessing the solitary occupant of the brougham sat with expressionless face his hand raised all the time to his hat it was impressive and distinctly a survival arrived at the somewhat inhospitablelooking gates of solid oak which formed the entrance to the great house the footman sprang to the ground and drew from its resting place amongst the ivy the knob of the seldomused bell the gates were thrown open morton received the visitor at the front door and escorted him to where his master lay stretched in a basket chair under a cedar tree at the farthest corner of the lawn mr henry ballaston sir he announced peter johnson stumbled to his feet and henry ballaston removed his hat in courtly and formal salute he was strangely dressed for the country in a black cut away coat and grey checked trousers the shape of his collar belonged to a past generation he wore a black satin tie folded over and secured by a pearl pin a bowler hat carried now in his hand and grey suede gloves you are i presume he said withdrawing the glove from his right hand before extending it our new neighbour mr johnson i have called on behalf of my brother and myself for the purpose of welcoming you to this neighbourhood mr johnson took the outstretched hand and released it almost at once here was a man he decided after his own hearta man difficult to read of immense reticences it is very kind of you to come he said i am sure i scarcely expected it i have been given to understand that neither you nor your brother pay many visits i am afraid henry ballaston assented accepting the chair which morton had brought out that we are both a little neglectful of our duties in that respect you are so near a neighbour however that i permitted myself the pleasure of devoting a spare halfhour to making your acquaintance very kind of you i am sure mr johnson repeated fine old property yours ballaston hall has many points of interest the other admitted i trust that we may soon have the pleasure of seeing you there my brother he added with a little sigh finds many calls upon his time he is chairman of the quarter sessions lord lieutenant of the county and he takes some interest in the political activities of our member he is furthermore master of the hounds here as i dare say you know he desired me to say however that he should look forward to the pleasure of making your acquaintanceyou yourself are agreeably housed here i like the place its tenant admitted in many respects it suits me admirably i find it interesting and also laudable henry ballaston observedas no doubt do many other of your neighboursthat you were not deterred from taking up your residence here on account of the tragedythe unfortunate accidentwhich befell the late owner of the house mr johnson looked for a moment steadily across the iron fence close to which they were seated it was a typically restful summer afternoon from the distance came the soothing sound of a grasscutting machine there was a murmur of bees amongst the roses the faintest rustle of west wind amongst the shrubs all the time those cold blue eyes watched him there was no sign of anxiety or even of interest in henry ballastons expressionless face his attitude remained stiff and formal his eyes never wavered in their steadfast gaze i was not told of the incident to which you refer mr johnson confided until after i had signed the contract but in any case i dont know that it would have made any difference the quiet of this place soothes me to one who has lived a busy life in foreign cities there is a great attraction in the peaceful outlook of a village like this that is easily comprehensible henry ballaston admitted judicially still there are many country places with attractions more obvious than market ballaston can offer golf links in the immediate vicinity for instance shooting or hunting that may be so the other agreed my life however has been too busy a one to cultivate any taste for such things i understand there are excellent golf links in the neighbourhood if later on i find it necessary to seek amusement outside my gardens shooting after a fashion i have at times indulged in i gather however that there is none to let within reasonable distance no ballaston shooting has been let for many years was the somewhat stiff reply from what part of the world might i ask mr johnson do you come from all quarters of it i am by birth an american but i have travelled a great deal of recent years the english life is almost unknown to me it is perhaps for that reason that i appreciate these surroundings henry ballaston nodded gravely i trust he said that you will find all your expectations realised it is a surprise to me he added to learn that you are of american birth your accent would not betray the fact i left america mr johnson explained when i was nineteen years old and i have only once returned to new york since then i have learned to speak many languages my business has required it as regards the tragedy to which you have alluded he went on after a momentary pause although having settled here i shall not allow myself to be disturbed by it i will confess that the story i was told last evening of the murder in my library was rather a shock abroad we have always had a very high opinion of the british detective service it seems incredible that in a small place like this such a crime should remain undetected it is i believe was the cold admission a circumstance without precedent i gather that no clue or motive of any sort has been discovered mr johnson persisted from all that one can hear the murdered man appears to have been an entirely harmless individual and his belongings not in the least likely to attract the ordinary type of criminal there are other of your neighbours henry ballaston surmised with marked aloofness who can tell you much more of the affair so far as i am concerned it remains only an unpleasant memorywe hope very muchmy brother and imr johnson that you will give us the pleasure of your company at luncheon at the hall you are very kind i am sure if agreeable to you and if you will pardon the short notice we will say tomorrow at one oclock the visitor suggested rising my nephew is at home for a short time before proceeding abroad otherwise we shall be aloneonce more mr johnson i bid you welcome and trust that you will derive all the pleasure you anticipate from your residence here the tenant of the great house a little speechless escorted his visitor to the front entrance before which the carriage was waiting at their approach a footman threw open the door of the brougham the coachman sat up in his seat the horses fretted from the flies pawed the gravel henry ballaston with a formal bow of farewell took his seat and with the sun glittering upon the silver of the harness and the brightly polished shiny top of the brougham this visit of ceremony was brought to an end back through the village street with eyes looking this time neither to the right nor to the left through the lodge gates where his hand sought the brim of his hat in mechanical salute to the curtseying doorkeeper along the winding avenue and through the iron gates up to the great front of the hall henry ballaston passed on his return journey and finally reached his destination he entered the cool lofty hall handed his hat and gloves to the footman who was waiting and hesitated for a moment the door of the library was unexpectedly opened sir bertram strolled out as though by accident well my dutiful brother he asked his tone though apparently careless betraying an underlying anxiety henry waited until he had reached his brothers side the man appears to be perfectly harmless he confided he will take lunch with us tomorrow good sir bertram approved i shall go and change now i am going to have a few sets of tennis with gregory henry ballaston crossed the hall and passing through the library entered the smaller room which had been devoted to his use gregory in flannels and with a tennis racket under his arm was apparently engaged in examining one of the catalogues he turned around as his uncle entered hullo he exclaimed you back already my call i thought was of suitable length was the measured rejoinder what sort of a fellow is this new tenant of ours gregory demanded his uncle paused for a moment gregorys fingers were nervously tapping the vellumbound manuscript which he held a very ordinary sort of person he pronounced who appears to have found his way here entirely by accident gregory replaced on the shelf the catalogue which he had been studying he failed to notice that he had been holding the volume upside down good of you to do the duty stunt uncle henry he observed it has always been one of my few obligations was the quiet reply mr johnson is lunching with us tomorrow i shant go over to cromer until the afternoon then gregory announced one may as well be civil and i have rather a fancy to see what the fellow is like chapter iv at halfpast twelve on the following morning mr peter johnson dressed in a blue serge suit and patent shoesa costume which after much deliberation he deemed suitable for the enterprise on which he was bentmounted his twoseated car drove through the village exchanging polite greetings with one or two of his recent acquaintances and after a moments wait at the lodge gates proceeded at a subdued pace along the winding road which crossed the park and up through the great avenue to the front entrance of the hall he left his automobile in a secluded place and found the door open as he mounted the steps rawson unrecognising stony of face and feature took his name a footman relieved him of his hat and gloves another subordinate lurking in the background threw open the door of the library into which the visitor was ushered mr johnson the man announced henry ballaston came forward and greeted his guest with punctilious cordiality then he turned to his brother who had been lounging on the hearthrug reading a newspaper but who now came forward with outstretched hand this is my brother sir bertram ballastonmr johnson our new tenant at the great house the two men shook hands mr johnson a little formally his host with an indifferent but pleasant courtesy sir bertram had grown somewhat thinner perhaps during the last twelve months of ever increasing financial anxiety his eyes seemed a trifle sunken and the weariness of his mouth was a little more pronounced his smile however as he unbent was as ingratiating as ever and his voice as insinuating i am very glad to have this opportunity of meeting you mr johnson he said you will excuse my having commissioned my brother to represent the family i happened to be engaged for some days and we were anxious not to delay making your acquaintance your brother was very welcome was the prompt assurance very kind and neighbourly of you to look me up at all i am a complete stranger here and i may add to england indeed sir bertram murmured civilly might one enquire then whilst congratulating ourselves upon your choice what made you select this particular part of the world for your abode every one seems to ask me that question mr johnson observed i imagine there was a certain amount of chance about it i wished to settle down in england for a time and from all i had heard i thought norfolk the most suitable locality i went to an agent in norwich found this house at what i considered a very low rental and established myself and why not indeed sir bertram demanded approvingly for any one who wishes to live a really retired life amongst rural surroundings a better choice could scarcely be madei am afraid mr johnson that we cannot offer you anything in the way of a modern aperitif if a glass of amontillado sherry pleases you i think that you will find this drinkable my father was reputed to be a judge rawson who had entered with a tray poured out three glasses from a bottle reclining in a cradle with something approaching reverence in his manner mr johnson accepted the sherry and drank wine such as he had never tasted before just as he was setting the glass down the door opened and gregory entered he came forward with all his fathers grace but a little more impetuously this is my son gregory sir bertram announced mr johnson gregoryour new tenant gregorys expression as he had advanced to meet his fathers guest had been one of polite but somewhat indifferent curiosity he suddenly stopped short however the light of amazed recognition flashed in his eyes for a brief period of time he was absolutely speechless i am happy to meet you mr johnson said gregorys hand for a moment sought his throat the blank look of nonrecognition in the face of this suave smoothfaced man was arresting yet such a likeness could scarcely be possible his brain was still confused afire with a surge of memories of that still oily river the merciless sun his fleshbiting bonds afterwards the quiet cool warehouse with its pungent odours its jumble of merchandise its sombre silences he became suddenly conscious of his fathers surprise of henrys questioning frown surely he ventured at last we have met before mr johnson shook his head slowly not within my recollection he acknowledged there was another although a briefer silence a matter now only of seconds but intense whilst it lasted gregory looking a trifle dazed held out his hand his eyes however remained fixed upon the others face and the wonder had never left them so sorry to seem such an idiot he murmured politely but even now i am a little bewildered we didnt meet fifteen months ago in chinawu lingthe firm of johnson and company the visitor shook his head his smile was goodnatured but to a keen observer a little sphinxlike his eyes never wavered you are mistaking me for some one else he said my name is certainly johnson but it is not an uncommon one and i am quite sure that this is our first meeting it is my memory which is at fault then gregory observed relapsing with an effort into his usual self glad to welcome you here mr johnson rawson am i to be allowed a glass of the sherry good i need it luncheon was served with a certain measured but not ungraceful ceremony the food was excellent and although the fact was not alluded to the guest of the meal who possessed an instinctive appreciation of such things realised that he was drinking cabinet hock of an almost extinct vintage conversation never flagged but it was conducted upon a level and in a spirit which were a little difficult to the visitor there was no attempt at humour or story telling even personal reminiscences and questionings of all sorts were eschewed there were grave remarks about politics county affairs the prospects of the forthcoming shooting season mr johnson ventured to express once more his hope of renting a little shooting himself i am afraid his host regretted that such a thing is out of the question for the moment the ballaston shooting extends for some distance in every direction and i do not allow my tenant farmers to concede their sporting rights we shall of course be happy for you to shoot with us whenever you feel inclined but from the point of view of sport i fear that you have chosen a somewhat unfavourable neighbourhood i speak of the immediate present in the near future there may be changes the matter does not greatly concern me was the equable reply i have shot birds and beasts in different places but i do not pretend to be a sportsman i shall find a great deal of occupation in my garden in country walks and motoring i was telling my son this morning sir bertram observed that i consider our agent mr borroughes was very much to blame for not having told you the inner history of the great house before you took it it would perhaps have been better mr johnson admitted at the same time it would have made no difference to my plans were you bytheby personally acquainted with my unfortunate predecessor we had exchanged some few civilities sir bertram replied our acquaintance however was nothing but that slight affair which exists between neighbours but for the unfortunate tragedy which occurred we should probably have become more intimate mr endacott happened to be a brother of an old friend of minethe comtesse de fourgenet who resides at the little house it was for that reason i imagine that he elected to settle down in this neighbourhood there was a niece mr johnson ventured a very charming young person sir bertram conceded she naturally enough left the neighbourhood very soon afterwards i understand however that she is expected shortly on a visit to the little house luncheon drew towards its close a very wonderful port was served and drunk after preliminary encomiums in respectful silence sir bertram rose to his feet we shall find cigars and coffee in the library mr johnson he said if i cannot persuade you to drink another glass of wine we might perhaps rise the four men left the room together the guest of the morning on his way across the hall looked about him with an interest which was entirely genuine for in his way he was a lover of beautiful things gregory drew his attention to a famous picture opposite the foot of the staircase and detained him until they became temporarily detached from the others after a casual reference indifferently voiced to a worldfamous old master his tone suddenly changed it was intense curiously vibrant i must ask you once more he said quietlyi must ask you thismr johnson do you remember a mana brave fellow he waswho used to trade up the yuntse river amongst the villages wu ling they called him wu ling mr johnson repeated a chinaman he passed as such gregory admitted he might have been anything his name even might have been johnson the tenant of the great house smiled tolerantly wu ling he commented is a very nice name on the whole i prefer it to my own mine is and always has been johnsonpeter johnsonpeter johnson of new york gregory led the way towards the library it seemed to him that there was nothing more to be said sorry he apologised i am pretty good at faces as a rule and i never thought i could make a mistake about this one glad to hear you are a neighbour mr johnson we shall find the others in here he threw open the door of the library and ushered in his companion his father and uncle were talking together with their coffee cups in their hands they abandoned their conversation precipitately as the door opened i was afraid sir bertram said that gregory was commencing to show you the pictures you would find that rather a lengthy undertaking an undertaking which would interest me very much mr johnson declared i understand that one day a week visitors are permitted to see over the hall i shall venture to present myself with the crowd there is no necessity for you to do anything of the sort sir bertram assured him my housekeeper will be glad to show you over at any time some of the paintings in the gallery are generally considered to be quite worth inspection and our tapestries are famous the chapel has a screen which personally i think the most beautiful in norfolk perhaps you would care to see it after you have drunk your coffee i should like to very much mr johnson confessed sir bertram remained a courteous but reserved host henry with strenuous effort imparting now and then a note of greater intimacy to the conversation gregory remained silent though restless after they had finished their coffee they glanced at some of the tapestries and sir bertram led the way towards the chapel they passed through the smaller library which henry claimed as his own this is my little sanctum he announced my brother leaves most matters connected with the estate in my charge and this is where i deal with them before they pass on to mr borroughes the visitor looked curiously around the lofty but somewhat severe apartment with its neatly arranged shelves of catalogues its piles of volumes of reference its letter cases and many evidences of business detail an exceptionally large writing table filled the window recess on which stood a single bronze statue several curios a blotter and a massive stationery rack on the righthand side the window panelling took a wide inward sweep leaving a space half platform half pedestal in the centre stood a fine china bowl filled with deep red roses on either sidethe body and the soul mr johnson gazed first at one of the images then at the other speechless expressionless but absorbed all the cynical vice and grotesque wickedness of the one leered at him from the lefthand side of those drooping roses from the right the kindly benevolent face of a saint seemed to breathe out a strange atmosphere of peace and sanctity mr johnson made no comment attempted no criticism yet his very silence was in its way suggestive gregory watched him with eager interest conscious of a surging resurrection of certain vague farfetched suspicions in the background henry ballaston though his face showed no sign of emotion also watched it was his movement which dispelled those few seconds of paralysed silence his voice always a pleasant one notwithstanding its formal note was softer and lower even than usual but there was a curious glint in his cold blue eyes you find our miniature buddhas interesting mr johnson he asked the tenant of the great house did not at first appear to hear him his eyes were fixed almost to rigidity both here he muttered both the effect of his exclamation was disconcerting his three companions closed in a little upon him there was something menacing about their silence both sir bertram repeated at last with the air of a puzzled man mr johnson appeared to awake from his lethargy say it seems to me he remarked lapsing into his first americanism that those two ought to be worth a great sum of money ive seen photographs of them when i was travelling in the east they were stolen from a temple somewhere in china i think it was miniature buddhas arent they stolen sir bertram murmured stolen gregory echoed this is very interesting henry declared they came into our possession in a somewhat unusual fashion you think that in the first instance they were probably stolen mr johnson withdrew his eyes from them at last i should say they surely were he agreed i saw a photograph of them in an american magazine about twelve months ago with a gigantic buddha between them they were quoted as having been stolen and being for some reason or other which i have forgotten immensely valuable columns of it there were i remember the young american who started out to get them was discovered with his throat cut in the train from pekin southwards nobody seemed to know what had become of the images there was a brief silence a sudden almost unaccountable lessening of the tension of the last few minutes mr johnson loomed no longer as a sinister figure of fate the circumstances under which we came into possession of these images henry intervened would seem to preclude the idea of their being the ones referred to in your magazine article still the story is interesting mr johnson turned away without further comment the subject of the images was exhausted the screen in the chapel beyond was inspected presently he took a formal leave of his hosts we shall hope to see more of you mr johnson sir bertram said as he accompanied him on to the terrace we do not entertain much at present but my son will be giving some farewell shooting parties before his departure abroad we shall hope to number you amongst our guests very kind of you i am sure mr johnson replied climbing into his car and thrusting in his clutch my visit and brief glimpse of your treasures has been most enjoyable good day sir bertram good day gentlemen he drove off they stood watching him pass through the iron gates into the park sir bertram waved his hand lightheartedly but neither of the other two indulged in any farewell salute an ordinary sort of fellow but harmless i believe sir bertram pronounced there were moments when i thought otherwise but on the whole i am inclined to agree with you henry conceded after a moments reflection gregorys thoughts were too confused for speech he watched the car until it became a speck in the distance then he turned away and followed the others into the house chapter v the afternoon was still young when mr johnson passed through the park gates of ballaston hall and drove slowly down the village street on his way back to the great house he studied the signpost which marked the road to norwich and hesitated at that moment a young woman stepped out of the grocers shop and recognising him nodded in spiritless fashion mr johnson fancied that he caught an almost wistful expression as she glanced critically at his car he drew up by the side of the cobbled pavement good afternoon miss besant he said good afternoon she rejoined looking up as though surprised i thought of motoring in to norwich he confided i wonder whether you would care to come it will take three quarters of an hour to an hour and i need not stay there for many minutes it sounds delightful she admitted but i am afraid that it is quite impossible madame is very restless today and i am quite sure that she would not allow it you might ask her he suggested she hesitated i might she agreed doubtfully but i am afraid it would be scarcely worth while asking you to wait nonsense i have nothing to do he replied cheerfully jump in and ill drive you to the gate id rather you waited at the corner she begged ill come back and tell you anyway mr johnson obeyed instructions he drew up at the point where a byroad curved around to his own and the little house and on to a chain of rather remote villages descended and glanced into his petrol tank lit a cigarette and settled down to wait in a few minutes miss besant reappeared he was conscious of a measure of disappointment which rather puzzled him when he saw that she was still without gloves or coat nevertheless there was a slightly eager expression in her face madame has surprised me very much she announced as she paused by the side of the car she seems willing for me to go but she would like to speak to you first delighted mr johnson replied preparing to alight i proposed myself as a visitor yesterday as you may remember the young woman nodded for some reason or another she confided madame is very curious about you directly i mentioned your name and said that you were outside she told me to fetch you in please be careful what you say to her she is very peculiar and every one humours her whilst you are talking i shall get my coat and gloves ill do my best he promised her as he held open the gate dont keep me too long i can foresee that conversation with madame will be difficult i hope she knows that i have lived abroad for a long time and am unused to ladies society youll manage all right she assured him encouragingly she opened the front door and led him across the low almost square hall oakpanelled to the ceiling and with several strange and to mr johnsons taste not yet educated to futurism extremely bizarre pictures upon the wall then she opened another door softly and beckoned him to follow her this is mr johnson who has come to live at the great house madame she announced she left him then and mr johnson crossed the room towards the couch his curiosity concerning madame rather increased as he bent down to take her unexpectedly beautiful hand she was lying flat on her back in a sort of invalid chair which was drawn up as usual to an open window and from her waist downwards she was covered by a beautiful chinese wrap of light texture he was astonished by the lack of wrinkles in her face the clearness of its complexion the absence of any sign of illness a lace scarf around her neck was fastened by an exquisite pin with ancient paste gems and the fingers of the hand which still remained in his seemed ablaze with jewels all of them with oldfashioned settings which contained however some really fine gems so you are my new neighbour she remarked abruptly her voice gave mr johnson further cause for surprise it was very low and very musical but it possessed other qualities which he found it difficult to define i have come to live at the great house for a time he replied why have you come here she demanded he accepted the chair to which she had pointed imperiously it is a most extraordinary thing he said but every person i have met since i came here has asked me the same question why should i not choose to come and live a quiet life in market ballaston the place pleased me i wished to live in the countryin norfolk for choicethe house and the surroundings were just what i wanted i dont believe a word youre saying she declared shortly mr johnson himself something of an adept in the art of guarded conversation was taken thoroughly aback for a moment he could think of nothing to say why do you want to come and live in a house in an outoftheway village like thisa house too in which another man was murdered do you wish me to believe that it was chance or perhaps morbid curiosity or had you another reason my dear madame mr johnson assured her as to morbid curiosity not a soul even mentioned the matter to me till after i had paid over the contract deposit and secured the lease of the house never mind whether they mentioned it or not she persisted her fine eyes challenging his do you mean to tell me that you didnt know about it mr johnson thoroughly on his guard now adopted a soothing tone how could i he expostulated i am a complete stranger to this neighbourhood and as a matter of fact i have spent most of my life abroad the man who was murdered she continuedyou know he was my brotherhad also lived abroad had you met him coincidences are scarcely likely to multiply themselves he remarked drily i hail from new york and your brother i understand had spent most of his life in china she lay quite still for a moment her hands clasped she seemed to be considering there is an idea here she recommenced abruptly that you are either a detective or that you have come here determined for some reason of your own to solve the mystery of my brothers murder that you knew all about it before you came that you took the house on purpose what about that her eyes seemed to be trying to bore their way through to the back of his head mr johnson remained imperturbable my dear lady he protested i can assure you that this is a foolish fancy she had raised herself a little and she sank back now amongst the cushions the hard insistence had gone from her eyes but she was still uneasy i hope she said that you are speaking the truth i hope you are mr endacott he reflected was as you have just reminded me your brother he was she admitted then why he asked do you feel so strongly upon the matter i mean supposing i were a detectivewhich i am notor an amateur criminologist or anything of that sort bent upon discovering the secret of the crime at the great house surely you should welcome my efforts why not a gleam of horror lit her eyes you know nothing about it she cried it is not a matter for any one to meddle with ralph was my brother it is true but he is dead and there is an end of it i am his nearest surviving relative it is for me to say it is for no one else if any one dares to interfere they shall suffer once more she sank back exhausted amongst her pillows mr johnson bent over her with the air of a doctor soothing a refractory patient my dear neighbour he begged please believe that i am here for no evil or malicious purpose whatsoever under no circumstances should i ever take any course likely to bring distress upon you i am not at all the sort of person you think i am i trust not she acknowledged a little wearily have you taken a fancy to my companion i wouldnt go quite so far as that he answered smiling but i must confess that i find her a very pleasant young person i was just off alone to norwich and i thought that the ride there might amuse her very well madame decided you can take her come in and see me again some time come as often as you like i am not altogether satisfied about you i wish i were the door was quietly opened and miss besant appeared dressed for her excursion madame waved her hand in a little gesture of dismissal is there anything i can do for you before i go the young woman asked nothing was the curt reply it will take you i suppose an hour to go to norwich an hour to frivol there and an hour to return see that you do not exceed that time very good madame and mr johnson madame he answered looking back from the door come and see me tomorrow about the same time unless you are engaged if so find out from miss besant what time will suit me that is all good afternoon mr johnson followed his companion across the hall and out into the street he was feeling a little dazed madame he remarked has a great deal of character and also vivacity for an invalid the girl remained silent she climbed into the car with a little murmur of pleasure madame she declared settling herself down contentedly is very much stronger than she used to be i shouldnt be in the least surprised if she recovered altogether and then she wont need a companion any longer mr johnson swung round the corner with the skill of a practised driver in that case he observed my sympathies are divided chapter vi mr johnson found plenty of time during the journey to norwich to exchange remarks with and take notice of his companion the sulkiness of her expression lightened considerably with the pleasure of the rapid motion the sense of freedom springing from this unexpected holiday the road wound its way between hedges from which the late honeysuckle still drooped through a tract of pleasant and varied country corn fields where harvesting machines with their musical mechanism were at work rich meadows where the cows stood kneedeep in flowerstarred herbage across a great common where clumps of heather and gorse stretched away to the borders of a thick encircling wood the ballaston pheasants strutted about on every side from a slight rise in the road a mile or so beyond the village they caught a glimpse of the back of the hall i lunched there today mr johnson confided the girl looked at him curiously who was there she enquired only sir bertram and his son and mr henry ballaston i thought it was rather decent of them to ask me she made no reply do you know them he asked i see sir bertram often she replied he comes down to the little house two or three times a week when he is here and mr henry mr henry does not visit madame to my knowledge do you know sir bertrams son gregory he continued she turned and looked at him her eyes were quite wide open now and he was once more astonished to find how beautiful they were nevertheless their expression at that moment was not pleasing she seemed surprised at his questionif such a thing were possible a little frightened i know him of course she replied he too visits madame occasionally i am interested in the family mr johnson confessed and i have faith in your instincts what do you think of gregory ballaston what should i think of him she answered indifferently a goodlooking young man run after at times by all the young women in the county a great sportsman a great traveller and i suppose a great libertine how on earth should i madames companion know or think anything about him one forms impressions he murmured if i allowed myself to form any she rejoined they would be favourable he treats me always just a little more politely because i am a dependent if i were a silly girl i dare say i should be like the rest of them in this horrible neighbourhood why do you call it that he protested i call it that she rejoined because i detest nearly all the people i know in it well there dont seem to be many he remarked goodhumouredly even if you include me i certainly do not include you she assured him you may disappoint me like the others but at the present moment you seem to me a very simple goodnatured person who actually takes the trouble to go out of his way to do a kindness not in the least he protested youre not suggesting i hope that there is any kindness in driving you to norwich why not she retorted what else can it be it is certainly pleasanter for me he pointed out to have you by my side than to go alone she shrugged her shoulders why she demanded i am not goodlooking i am not agreeable i am not amusing if you are fond of gallivantingwell i am sure that you have sense enough to know that it doesnt appeal to me how can i possibly therefore be of any interest to you he smiled youre all there with the words he acknowledged i rather depend upon feelings i only know that i feel it pleasanter to have you where you are than to be alone as a matter of fact there are several of those glib statements of yours i could quarrel with if i wished well your manner he admitted is rather difficult no one could call you particularly amiable as to not being attractive however i differ from you i think if you took the slightest trouble about yourselfput your hat on straight for instance gathered up those wisps of hair and indulged in a smile now and thenyou would be distinctly goodlooking for a moment her frown seemed even a little more sullen than ever there was a positive scowl upon her face until to his amazement she suddenly burst out laughing he saw then that she had the whitest of teeth and the little flush of colour which had been gradually finding its way into her cheeks completely dispelled the sallowness of her complexion her eyes seemed to reflect her unexpectedly kindled sense of humour she straightened her hat and felt her hair you really are a very nice person she said you can go on talking nonsense if you want to i rather like it and if it will give you any satisfaction i will spend that hour during which you are going to leave me alone in norwich at the hairdressers i knew i was right he declared youre a good sort so are you she rejoined lets be friends i am going to start by asking you a question for gods sake he begged dont ask me why i came to settle at market ballaston why not because every ones pestering me to death with the same thing he complained no one can get that murder out of their heads it seems to have absorbed every effort at individual thought in the whole place why ive seen men killed by the dozen ive lived in a place where there was a murder every day yet here they seem obsessed by their one little tragedy i can never get away from it i go down to the village inn the tradespeople are just like the tradespeople in any other village i should like a little local information and gossip not a bit of it the murder and nothing but the murder i lunch at the hall before i have been there half an hour i know that i am an object of suspicion i must have come to the neighbourhood because of the murder hang it all in selfdefence i shall have to set to work and find out who did kill this fellow endacott and tell you all about it i hope you wont try she begged earnestly another mystery he exclaimed what the mischief can it matter to you i dont know she answered i dont care much about any of these people but i dont like unhappiness the mans dead i think all over the village the same feeling exists i think they are afraid of what might happen if the truth really came to light she leaned a little forward in the car her eyes fixed upon the steeple of the cathedral slowly emerging to definite form slender exquisite yet dominating as it rose from amongst an incongruous mass of redtiled buildings mr johnson waited for several moments then as he swung into the main road he broke the brief silence thats queer he confided i had formed the same impression myself anyway we will drop it for the present she nodded assent i wonder if you realise she said what a great holiday this is for me i have never been in norwich i have not been in a car for years i am enjoying myself thoroughly and i am not going to think of another disagreeable thing please put me down wherever you like and when you have done your business i will meet you wherever you say have you any shopping to do beyond your visit to the hairdresser he asked her shopping she repeated scornfully why should i have any living the sort of life i do one needs no clothes one thing does as well as another still the hairdresser will take a little time and i can amuse myself very well looking at the shop windows i shall put you down in the market place he decided i shall be gone for about three quarters of an hour at the end of that time i will meet you at the tea shop you can see on our right hand after that if we have any time to spare we will look round the place together is that agreed delightful she assented the chief constable was in and happy to see mr johnson he was an amiable exofficer as competent as could be expected and exceedingly popular in the county of which he was a native i am major holmes he announced glancing at the card which he still held in his hand what can i do for you mr johnson give me a little of your time and a great deal of your patience was the quiet reply i have just come to live in your county at market ballaston i have taken the great house there the great house the other repeated reminiscently oh yes i remember of course so you are living there the scene of a very unfortunate tragedy which cost us a lot of time and trouble lately so i hear mr johnson murmured major holmes leaned back in his chair i am afraid he confessed that norfolk has added to the somewhat scanty list of undiscovered crimes we dont lay it too much to heart however as scotland yard took the whole business out of our hands in the early stages a little unwise of them perhaps mr johnson observed local police may not be so intelligent but they are at least tenacious and they often have the better grasp of the situation the chief constable remained silent he had his own opinion but it was not a matter for discussion with an outsider i imagine his visitor proceeded that it would be rather a score for the county police if they were to achieve a success where scotland yard has failed major holmes glanced across at his caller keenly have you brought me any information he asked yes was the laconic reply the chief constable was startled but eager god bless my soul he exclaimed sitting up youre a welcome visitor look here let me ring for my superintendent mr johnson held out his hand not for the moment if you please he begged i would rather say what i have to say to you in confidence afterwards i understand the information must be used in such manner as you think fit the other nodded very well he agreed the tenant of the great house squared himself up to the desk he was a differentlooking man to the kindly person who had driven miss besant over to norwich major holmes he said i shall ask you to consider as private so much of this conversation as does not come under the heading of official information certainly the murdered man endacott and i were associated in a very large business established in china alexandria and new york we were together for over twenty years for the last ten years he was my partner we wound up the business a little over twelve months ago and he brought a great fortune to england you were his partner major holmes repeated in a tone of considerable surprise no one in this neighbourhood knows of my connection with endacott mr johnson continued i have chosen to keep it secret now let me come to the more precise information which i have to offer a month or so before endacott left the east a chinese temple near pekin was robbed and two statues wooden images they were with a very peculiar history were stolen there were two young men concerned in the robberyan englishman and an american the american got as far as the railway and although he was murdered by a band of robbers who boarded the train one of the images reached its destination the englishman was captured by the priests and as by their religion they are unable to shed blood he was handed over by them to a notorious river pirate with instructions that he was to be thrown to the alligators i heard of the affair in a village where i was trading up the yuntse river rescued him from the pirate and brought him down to the coast the name of the young man was gregory ballaston the chief constable stared across the table it was an odd story to hear told in such a matteroffact way in the lawabiding city of norwich greg ballaston he exclaimed good lord mr gregory ballaston the narrator continued found his image waiting for him on the steamer although his friend was dead the second of the images with which the robbers had decamped came by means of indirect traffic with them into my possession i showed it to mr ballaston in my warehouse he coveted it if the old superstition were true his image without mine was useless how useless major holmes asked puzzled because both were supposed to contain hidden somewhere in their interior a sacred treasure of jewels accumulated by the priests in the temple if i attempt to explain the matter more fully you will think that i am telling fairy stories so i will content myself by saying that according to an ancient superstition credited by many who had knowledge of the affair and also by these two young men the possession of one image without the other was useless gregory ballaston left for england taking his image the other when we wound up the affairs of the firm was brought home to england by ralph endacott together with a number of old manuscripts from the temple which had also come into our possession up to at any rate a few days before his murder that image stood in his study the room where he was found shot today that image is in ballaston hall major holmes sat for a moment or two without speaking it was scarcely to be wondered at that his prevailing impressions were of blank incredulity you are telling me a most extraordinary story mr johnson he said guardedly the truth is sometimes extraordinary the other agreed you can easily verify however the correctness of the main points of my statements i can give you references for instance to my bankers in london who will assure you that i was the head of the firm in which mr endacott was partner that i am a man of wealth and reputation and in a position to know the truth concerning these matters gregory ballaston half recognised me but as out there i passed as a chinaman he is only suspicious i adopted the garb and speech of the chinese very early in life because no confessed european has a chance of trading successfully in the interior of the country gregory ballaston is a young man against whom i have no illfeelingin fact i rather like himbut endacott was my associate for twenty years and i was responsible for the image being in his possession it was arranged between us that with the help of a friend of his at the british museum he should obtain a translation of the documents we had acquired concerning it and we should then on my return to england discuss the possibility of the existence of the jewels i am very certain that in his lifetime he would never willingly have parted with the image to gregory ballaston and you say that that image is now at ballaston hall the major demanded it is there at the present moment was the unequivocal reply i lunched there today and saw it together with the fellow image which gregory ballaston brought home the chief constable moved uneasily in his chair the story to which he had listened was barely credible but there was something very convincing about this rather ponderous man of slow speech and steady eyes you are a stranger in these parts mr johnson he said after a moments pause you probably dont know that the ballastons are one of our oldest and most prominent county families sir bertram is lord lieutenant at the present moment he hunts the hounds and occupies a great position i am aware of that mr johnson replied i also know as probably you do that the family are in great financial straits it comes to this then the chief constable summed up unwillingly you are practically accusing young ballaston not only of theft but of the murder of your late partner endacott i have not gone so far as that the other pointed out i have supplied you with a motive for the murder i have given you information that property belonging to the dead manequally to me bythebyis now in the possession of the ballastons but is this image really of great value major holmes asked leaving out the other improbabilities could its possession be considered as a possible incentive for the perpetration of such an atrocious crime the jewels supposed to be concealed in the two images mr johnson confided are estimated if they exist at all to be worth anything up to a million pounds it was sir bertram who first heard the story when he was in the diplomatic service and persona grata at the late emperors court in china he passed it on to his son and without doubt the two together planned the expedition major holmes felt a certain amount of conviction creeping in upon him it was only his sense of officialdom which enabled him to conceal his growing sense of horror you must forgive me mr johnson he begged if i accept your story with some reserves as a man of common sense i am sure you will see that it has its incredible side especially when one considers the great position of the ballastons and the horrible results which must ensue if your story be proved true bytheby didnt i hear that gregory ballaston was going abroad again for some years it is that fact mr johnson admitted which has induced me to pay you this visit instead of pursuing a few investigations myself major holmes pushed pen and paper across the table will you write down the address of your bankers he invited to whom i may refer if you also care to give me a reference to your lawyers or some private person i must confess that i should proceed with more confidence mr johnson acquiesced without hesitation there was something convincing about the name of the bank and the solicitors written in his firm handwriting you have no further suggestions to make i suppose the chief constable asked none at all mr johnson replied except that i should much prefer your keeping my intervention in this matter entirely secret for a short time you will probably place such investigations as you decide to make in the hands of your subordinate who first took charge of the case if you can arrange to let him pay me a visit at the great house i should be glad major holmes sat for a moment or two in silence let me see he reflected cloutson was the man who had the matter in hand before we were overrun by the scotland yard people he is travelling inspector now for the northern part of the county i shall catch him tonight at lynn and will have him return at once there is one thing more i should tell you mr johnson concluded it was my intention before i heard of gregory ballastons impending departure to deal with this matter myself i have a young man from a private detective agency stationed down at ballaston he watches however for one purpose only unless you have any special reason for not telling me the chief constable suggested i think especially as we are going to act i had better know what that one purpose is i anticipate at some time or another mr johnson confided a burglarious visit at the great house from some one at ballaston now that i have discovered that the image has already been stolen the possibility is not so great but it is obvious that as yet gregory ballaston has not learned the secret of helping himself to the treasure now there is one rooman annex to the studylocked and boarded on the windows of which miss endacott has had bars placed i believed that the image was in there but what certainly is there is the coffer of chinese manuscripts which endacott brought home with him and which we believed to contain instructions as to the connection between the images and the treasure i have examined that room and though of course a professional burglar could manage it easily enough it wouldnt be a simple matter for an amateur to tackle still having gone so far i expect gregory ballaston to make the last effort that is why my young man watches ballaston hall at night major holmes was a matteroffact man of limited vision and once more he had the sensation of having been plunged into a world of phantasies chinese manuscripts he muttered images greg ballaston finest captain oxford ever had you know mr johnson and captained the gentlemen two years its awfully hard for me to get a coherent grip of this especially when you sit there and tell me that you lived in the east disguised as a chinaman the whole thing seems fantastic mr johnson tapped with his forefinger the slip of paper upon which he had written the two addresses when you take up my references with the lawyers he suggested write to mr stockton personally ask him his opinion of me as a man of business a practical man you can have him down if you like my affairs are of some importance to him and he would not hesitate to make the journey you must have confidence in me because now that i have moved in the matter at all i wish to be sure of the end major holmes rose to his feet and opened the door for his visitor you can rely upon my taking the necessary steps in the matter he promised the whole business is more painful to me than i can tell you but it will proceed from now on automatically i will send inspector cloutson in to see you the first time he is at market ballaston mr johnson as he walked down the hill from the castle glanced more than once at the grim jail with its fortresslike walls and bare windows he was no sentimentalist fifteen years trading upon the yuntse river had accustomed him to scenes of horror and bloodshed but nevertheless he gave a little shiver as he passed the nailstudded entrance it was here only a week ago that a man had been hanged he recalled the circumstances only to dismiss the memory immediately he was concerned with more immediate events he himself had started into relentless motion the cumbersome machinery of the law the memory of the chief constables room waxed faint the tolling of the castle clock startled him he glanced up above was the scaffold chapter vii mr johnson was genuinely surprised at the expression in his companions face when at the end of that drive home through the drowsy afternoon she put out her hand to wish him goodby he forgot her shabby little black lace hat with its two rather battered red roses her scratched and mended gloves the thin readymade wrap around her linen frock she was no longer a sulky tired young woman for a single moment she was beautiful you have given me quite a wonderful afternoon mr johnson she said and i am ashamed of myself for having been so quiet all the way home i am afraid i must have seemed almost ungracious i wasnt i was just enjoying it all andthank you she was gone before he could do anything but return heartily the warm pressure of her fingers but she seemed to him to walk with a new grace as she stepped lightly up the tiled path turned the shining brass door handle and disappeared into the little house he turned round to his car but instead of making for his own heavy oak gates he reversed slowly down the lane swung round in front of the ballaston arms and entered the same little company were assembled in the bar with the exception of rawson and the addition of walter beavens the local wheelwright and tom foulds the veterinary surgeon good afternoon gentlemen mr johnson said cheerfully a long and dusty ride from norwich mr landlord ill take a whisky and sodaa large soda please and a piece of lemon if you have such a thing he settled down into a chair with the air of a man who intends to make himself at home and began to fill his pipe mr craske was his immediate neighbour a little distance away the young man fielding was busy with a box of flies so you had a look at the hall this morning sir the grocer remarked i saw you coming through the gates i lunched there mr johnson confided a magnificent place it is and full of treasures too why the pictures and tapestries alone must be worth a fortune mr foulds joined in the conversation he was a ruddyfaced young man inclined to be stout dressed in somewhat sporting fashion with riding leggings which he was continually tapping with a switch worth a mint of money those tapestries he declared came from versailles some of themthe more modern onesat the time of the revolution good pictures too any quantity of them i should say the contents of the hall were worth the best part of half a million queer situation aint it in what way mr johnson enquired the young man wielded his switch assiduously well its no secret round here he proclaimed dropping his voice nevertheless that sir bertram is devilish hard up they dont know where to turn for money any of them and yet with all that valuable property they cant touch it hows that every yard of tapestry every picture worth a snap of the fingers is an heirloom foulds explained every acre of property is entailed i suppose theres plenty of money been raised on mortgages but i think theyve come to the end of that from what one hears shame too fine old family sir bertram i suppose has been extravagant mr johnson suggested the veterinary surgeon glanced around well he said our friend rawson being absent we may venture to speak of his lordship of the manor freely there isnt a person in the county could find a word to say against himhim or mr gregory eitherbut i should say that for making the money fly they are just about the limit mr gregory is reputed to have led a very fast life in town the grocer interposed timidly and then i dont know as he was a patch on his father was the veterinary surgeons complacent rejoinder mr henry seems to be the sober one of the family mr johnson remarked hes a character he is foulds declared a real oldfashioned dickens character youre right about him being the sober one though hed never spend a sixpence he could help and id back his conscience against the archbishop of canterburys have a drink mr craske with pleasure tom will you honour me mr johnson the honour is mine as the thirst certainly is was the prompt response very kind of you i am sure the young man fielding having succeeded with his fly entered diffidently into the conversation have the family a town house he enquired not now mr craske replied there was one in grosvenor square but that went ten years ago the year sir bertram lost seventy thousand pounds on the derby they spend most of their time down here then i suppose i wouldnt say that the grocer rejoined mr gregory soon after the war disappeared altogether for a year or so and hes always taking long trips abroad the squire he just goes up to those things that the gentry from everywhere seem to meet atthe eton and harrow and varsity cricket matches at lords and ascot and goodwood mr johnson made an effort to bring the discussion back to what was to him its point of greatest interest these financial embarrassments of sir bertram and his son he said i presume there is nothing absolutely urgent about them i wouldnt go so far as to admit that mr foulds replied cautiously there was a rumour yesterday that there was a conference of lawyers in london fixed for next week mr jenkins from norwichhes the lawyer who deals chiefly with the mortgageshe did say last week that they couldnt see the year through the entrance of rawson interfered with the trend of the conversation it was a matter of etiquette at the ballaston arms that gossip concerning the hall was not indulged in while he was present unless he himself introduced the subject the butler greeted the tenant of the great house with the slightly extra respect to which his recent visit entitled him glad to see you at the hall with us today sir he remarked you will find the squire a kindly gentleman and hospitable when he takes the fancy i found him most agreeable mr johnson acknowledged i enjoyed very much too my brief glimpse of your marvellous art treasures marvellous they are rawson sighed as he held up his glass to the light a bit of tantalisation about them though as you might say hundreds of thousands there doing nobody any good by the way mr johnson continued there were two wonderfully carved wooden images in mr henrys room do they set much store by them i should say they did sir rather a curious thing about those images one of them is damned ugly thats the one mr gregory sent home from abroad and that mr henry seemed to take a fancy to mr gregory himself he has a sort of dislike to it all the time it was in mr henrys room alone he never went in if he could help it then about a year ago the other one turned up a nice bit of work that theyre side by side now and mr gregory dont seem to mind ive seen him handling them and looking at them for hour after hour and sir bertram too theres a man been down from london to examine themmade me think they might be worth a bit of money i should think they very likely might be mr johnson agreed its a curious thing the butler observed filling his pipe that more than once the squire has been for having them broken up but mr gregory wouldnt listen to it they had almost words about it one night broken up mr johnson repeated for what purpose i couldnt quite follow the argument sir rawson admitted the squire seemed serious enough at the time but mr gregory had his own way the tenant of the great house rose to his feet a few minutes later and amidst a little chorus of good evenings strolled out and starting his car drove slowly up the lane homewards afterwards he left the paved courtyard by a side entrance and paused for a minute or two to look around lovingly at the old kitchen garden the peaches ripening upon the wall the apple and pear trees full of fruit the boxbordered paths and the little patches of cottage flowers in unexpected places he walked contentedly around his property his hands behind his back his pipe still in his mouth looked into his tomato house and approved of its appearance exchanged a few words with the gardener about the trimming of a hedge and passed out on to the lawn here he drew a chair into the shade of a cedar tree and still in a reflective frame of mind leaned back with halfclosed eyes his peaceful surroundings seemed to fade away from him he was back in the steep tangled streets of a chinese city on a handborne rickshaw out in the country travelling up to the top of a hill beyond which through the wood gleamed the green dome of the temple of yuntse he was back on the turgid river where the cruel sun was blistering the deck of his strange craft and the sound of his little engine suddenly breaking the hot silence brought consternation to the tall evil figure who had been leaning over the side of his boat to watch the oars thrust through the opened places he watched the coming to life of the young englishman heard his talk fancied that he smelled again the peculiar odours of that strange warehouse he saw endacott once more in his quaint costume immersed in his beloved laboursdead now for the sake of the treasure which was still withheld the tenant of the great house sat there until a very slight breeze stirred the leaves of the tall elm trees and the church clock from across the way struck seven then he rose to his feet knocked out the ashes from his pipe and entered the house that rustle of west breeze which heralding eventide broke the calm of the summer day did not as usual die away with the setting of the sun a little bank of clouds crept up from the horizon and the wind which seemed to come suddenly from nowhere bent the tops of the trees and drove them before it in black and broken pieces the afterglow from the sunset passed into a stormy obscurity no rain fell but the wind ever increased in volume and the darkness grew thicker mr johnson drank his accustomed whisky and soda at ten oclock and retired to his room a few minutes later he lay down however with a small alarm watch by his side and at three oclock he left the silent house passed through the postern gate and into the street the morning darkness at first baffled him he had to feel the wall to know where he was he stood there with the palm of his hand flat against it looking in the direction of the hall suddenly from the middle of the gulf of darkness three little flashes of light followed one another quickly there was a brief pausethen two morethen one mr johnson turned hurriedly back to the house changed from his sleeping attire and dressing gown back into his discarded dinner clothes slipped some cartridges into a revolver which he took from his bedside and descending the stairs carefully passed into the library silence still reigned throughout the house and complete darkness mr johnson with the composed mien and even pulse of a man who is used to dangers settled down to wait chapter viii towards halfpast five in the morning mr johnson was awakened from a heavy slumber by the clamorous and increasing twitter of birds in the shrubberies and gardens outside he woke with the sensation of being exceedingly uncomfortable and of being in an entirely unaccustomed spot he sat up looking around him he was on the floor of the library his revolver with one barrel discharged by his side a dried but painful cut upon his cheek bone and with the haunting remains of a most unpleasant odour still hanging about the room he staggered to his feet with poignant apprehensions of disaster a panel in the door communicating with the smaller apartment which it had been his purpose to guard had been neatly cut out and the spring lock apparently picked from the other side the door itself stood open inside the steelclamped coffer in which endacott had kept his manuscripts lay upside down and empty upon the carpet mr johnson nodded slowly to himself it was a moment of great humiliation after fifteen years of adventurous life of scraps with chinese cutthroats malay thieves scamps of every sort armed with every kind of weapon he had notwithstanding ample warning been tricked by an amateur he made a closer examination and realised how it must have happened he had waited in the darkness for the opening of the garden door and the intruder whoever it might have been had surprised him by coming in the other waythere were after all a dozen windows on the ground floor by which he might have enteredand stealing upon him from behind he could recall even then with his dazed senses as he leaned out to get a little fresh air the absolute noiselessness of that encounter it was less a sound than the consciousness of somebodys presence which had made him suddenly alert and then before he could even turn arms like iron bands were around his throat and the handkerchief was pressed to his nostrils night after night he had waited for what had happened and when his opportunity had comewell this was the end of it he moved to the telephone rang up the police station and after a few minutes delay conducted a conversation with the inspector in charge afterwards he locked up the library proceeded upstairs took a bath changed into his ordinary tweed morning clothes and drank several cups of tea disturbed at all during the night morton he asked the butler cant say that i was sir the man replied looking curiously at the slight wound on his masters face you sleep well then was the latters dry comment there was a burglary here between three and four oclock keep your mouth shut until after the police have been god bless my soul sir the man exclaimed you look as though youd been hurt sir nothing to speak of i heard a noise and went down fellow got at me before i could turn the light on remember not a word morton the police sergeant will be here in a few minutes the sergeant came a tall and ponderous man slow of speech persistent and given to repetitions he spent a thoroughly enjoyable hour notebook in hand on a blank page of which he made a rough sketch of the room itself and the window through which it was discovered that the intruder had entered and you miss nothing of value in any other part of the house sir he enquired for the sixth or seventh time prior to taking his leave nothing that i can trace mr johnson replied you must remember that i am only a subtenant nothing of my own is missing nor any of the familiar objects in the library the sergeant returned the book to his pocket a mysterious affair he pronounced nothing gone apparently but a pile of old papers we must telephone to the lawyers who let the place and interview the tenant the inspector will be over this afternoon sir and i dare say he will be along to see you the man took his leave and mr johnson crossed the road and knocked at the door of the little house miss besant opened it herself and greeted him with a smile i was just coming across she said madame wants to see you mr johnson was ushered into the cool drawingroom where madame was lying upon her couch she held out one hand and with the other waved imperiously to miss besant to depart something has happenedsomething happened last night she exclaimed what was it he took the chair to which she pointed close to her side a burglary he confided i was coming in to ask you to communicate at once with miss endacott the whole of the papers in the chest which was locked up in the inner library are gone the burglar she demanded breathlessly has he been caught is there any clue not at present mr johnson acknowledged there hasnt been much time he got away then yes he got away she looked at the scar on her visitors face did you see him she asked i didnt see him but i felt him mr johnson rejoined a little ruefully we had scarcely more than a few seconds scrap in the dark he came up from behind with a chloroformed handkerchief she lay back and closed her eyes in a moment or two she seemed to recover herself papersnothing but papers stolen she murmured that doesnt sound like an ordinary burglary it wasnt he agreed what do you think about it she asked eagerly what is there to think he rejoined some one wanted those papers we must communicate with miss endacott at once and ascertain what they were and to whom they would be of value you neednt trouble to do that madame confided my niece will be here this afternoon she is coming down to stay with me for a few days mr johnson was thoughtful for a moment or two well he observed it is perhaps opportune what do you mean by that she demanded nervously clasping and unclasping her fingers he laid his hand upon hers soothingly you are distressing yourself needlessly madame he said i only mean that her visit will make it unnecessary for us to communicate with her she will be able to tell us whether the papers were of great value there was another silence i think i can solve that problem madame declared they are of no value at all the coffer contained a collection of chinese manuscripts some of which my brother had already translated and a few others which he had not examined is that so mr johnson observed seems queer doesnt it if that was all that there should be bars on the windows and a double lock on the door my niece will explain that madame replied there was one which he translated just before he died which might have had some value claire did not feel like examining it at the time she wished it kept safely however i see mr johnson murmured what do the police say about it she demanded so far was the somewhat sardonic rejoinder the police have been represented by sergeant may his opinion is i think that it is a mysterious affair what do you think of it yourself she asked him suddenly i think he replied that the burglar whoever he was was after those chinese manuscripts and nothing else therefore i dont think it was an ordinary sort of burglar at all i should say not it was some one who knew what he wanted and he seems to have got it i wish i knew the truth about you madame sighed he smiled well he said im a pretty obvious sort of person arent i no she answered on the contrary you puzzle me you frighten me just why at the present moment he asked tolerantly because she confided her eyes fixed upon his i dont understand what you were doing in the lane out by your gate this morning about a quarter of an hour before the burglary did you see me he enquired after a moments pause yes i have seen you there other mornings at the same time what do you do for whom do you watch i am a light sleeper he explained last night i fancied that i heard some one stirring i had a walk round the place as it happens you see i was right she shook her head you were out in the lane she persisted perhaps you think i committed the burglary myself he suggested the eyes which were fixed upon his so steadily grew even more intense i should not be surprised she said i should not be surprised at anything i heard about you i do not believe that any of the stories you tell about yourself are true you frighten me living there i hate it you have nothing to fear from me he assured her i am a very harmless person but you havent told the truth about yourself she persisted there was the sound of hoofs in the lane madame looked out of the window and a wonderful light swept over her face sir bertram was dismounting from the hack which he had ridden across the park he handed the reins to the roadmender who came hobbling up threw away his cigarette and with the familiarity of habitude turned the handle of the door and immediately afterwards entered the drawingroom he nodded to mr johnson as he came over to madame with outstretched hands dear angele he said you see i anticipated the time of my usual call i thought perhaps that this news might have upset you you have heard then she exclaimed a lurid account of the affair was served up with my morning tea sir bertram replied my commiserations mr johnson i am relieved to find you in such good shape however the least sensational story is that you were battered almost to death by several brawnylooking ruffians and had already been moved to norwich infirmary the report mr johnson declared is exaggerated anything of value gone the newcomer enquired miss endacott is the only one who can tell us that was the quiet answer the box containing her uncles manuscripts was broken open and the manuscripts themselves have disappeared sir bertram drew up a chair and lit one of the cigarettes from the box which madame pushed towards him his long lean figure looked at its best in the wellcut riding clothes he was wearing the summer had brought an extra tinge of brown sunburn into his cheeks his eyes were bright and clear he seemed in the best of spirits and health that lends quite a note of romance to the affair he remarked i wonder what our local sherlock holmes will make of it he has pronounced the affair mysterious mr johnson confided i find it so myself he continued a moment later one would not have imagined that there were many people with a craze for chinese manuscripts more useful to us than any one sir bertram remarked gregory has a couple of wonderful wooden images up at the hallyouve seen them mr johnsonwhich are supposed to be full of jewels if we could only discover the key that poor fellow endacott knew all about it he was at work on some papers which he had brought home with him from china just before his death but up to then he had not come across anything that helped us mr johnson rose to his feet if i might be permitted to pay my respects to miss endacott as soon as she arrives he begged i should be glad certainly madame assented is miss endacott expected here sir bertram asked this afternoon she replied i only heard last night for a single second there was a curious change in sir bertrams face the insouciance almost the gaiety seemed suddenly to have fallen away as though it had been a mask his eyes were hard and tired then he recovered himself opportune he remarked lightly come and see us again soon up at the hall mr johnson the latter bowed to madame and turned away there was something almost menacing in his gravity you are very kind sir bertram he said as he took his leave chapter ix mr johnson returned to find a motor car standing outside his door and major holmes with a subordinate in colloquy with morton he led them himself to the library showed them the door with its picked lock the empty coffer and the window on the ground floor through which the marauder had made an easy entrance the chief constable was perplexed you are only a subtenant here i understand mr johnson he asked only a subtenant the latter acknowledged and you yourself have never been in this room i gather that it was locked up by miss endacotts instructions quite so then you really dont know what has been taken the contents of the coffer evidently mr johnson replied it was always understood that it contained chinese manuscripts which mr endacott brought home with him from abroad there was a moments silence then major holmes continued i have told inspector cloutson here he said of your visit to me and of my suspicions yes the inspector coughed he had a heavy but ingenuous countenance disbelief was stamped upon it will you gentlemen follow me mr johnson invited he led them on to the lawn well away from the house at a safe distance he came to a standstill and pointed to the library endacott he said was murdered for the possession of that other wooden image and for the manuscript which indicated the whereabouts of the jewels the object of the murder was achieved in part a wooden image was taken you will find it now at ballaston hall for some reason or another the murderer failed to secure the document he probably heard some movement in the house the burglary last night was undertaken to secure it nothing else was touched but the manuscripts are missing the only person to whom the manuscripts are useful is the possessor of the images inspector cloutson stroked his chin thoughtfully he looked across towards the great front of the hall his was not the type of brain to quickly absorb suspicion and much of this talk concerning wooden images and chinese manuscripts he looked upon as fantasticalmost as fantastic as the idea that a member of one of the great county families whom he revered could so far forget their lofty station as to commit a misdemeanour under the shadow of the law crime in inspector cloutsons opinion was for the criminals the idea of a ballaston as a criminal was grotesque you refer to the ballastons major holmes observed after a pause mr johnson inclined his head i refer to the ballastons he assented wait please a moment morton came towards them followed by the young man who was interested in moths mr johnson welcomed him pleasantly but with no indication of intimacy glad to see you fielding he said i sent word down that those trout flies had arrived ill show them to you directly that will do morton the butler departed mr johnson turned to the chief constable this is mr fielding he announced he is a member of the firm of watts and fielding private enquiry agents he has been staying in the neighbourhood for the last month making a few investigations for me the relations between the accredited representatives of the law and a private enquiry agent were scarcely likely to be cordial major holmes however nodded slightly to some extent as i told you i have been anticipating last nights visit mr johnson continued mr fielding therefore has spent a considerable portion of his time after midnight watching the egress from the hall he will tell you that this morning a man slipped out of one of the side entrances a door in fact which opened from the small library into the garden at ten minutes past three and that he followed him to this house is that a fact the chief constable asked gravely that is a fact fielding replied i am prepared to swear to it did you recognise the man major holmes enquired the other shook his head i was obeying orders in keeping strictly out of sight he explained i was not near enough to recognise him once before some one left by the same door at about the same time but he looked behind in the park and saw me so nothing happened if you saw this person enter these premises at that hour of the morning the chief constable enquired why did you not follow in case mr johnson needed assistance my express orders were that he should do nothing of the sort the latter intervened i wished for many reasons to keep the matter in my own hands i have been used to scraps he went on in every part of the world i understand jiujitsu boxing and how to draw a gun as quickly as any one i never dreamed that i might be outwitted the visitor from the hall who stole the manuscripts last night was too clever for me now sir mr johnson continued impressively i want everything done in an orthodox fashion and i know very well your prejudice and a very natural one against the interference of private detectives mr fielding will withdraw from the case from now onwards but i do expect that on the basis of the information you have already received you will at once proceed with the necessary enquiries i have no alternative but to do so the chief constable admitted reluctantly i must warn you however that i shall do so in the manner which seems to me the most desirable i shall approach sir bertram himself you will use your own discretion of course mr johnson said but action must be taken at once there mustnt be time for any one to slip off abroad or anything of that sort and i want you to remember this majorwhen youve found last nights burglar and that ought not to be a difficult job you should also be able to solve the mystery of my poor friend endacotts murder that may be so mr johnson the other answered a little sadly i can only say that i sincerely hope not we shall probably meet later in the day i shall be here or in the neighbourhood the other promised the chief constable and his subordinate entered the car and drove off they swung round the corner of the lane and a dozen curious pairs of eyes saw them turn in at the park gates what do you think of this cloutson the former asked bunkum was the prompt reply thats what i thinkbunkum and between you and me major i dont think much of that fellow johnson a stranger to the neighbourhood no one knows anything about him come here for god knows why and spinning yarns like this bunkum is what i think of it and as for this burglar who else except that pettifogging enquiry agent saw any one leave the great house not a soul weve heard of jobs major done from the inside done by the victim havent we those manuscripts or whatever he calls them were just as likely to be valuable to johnson as to any one else supposing he wanted them well hes gone the best way he could to help himself if you ask me what i think about our present errand sir i should call it a maresnestnothing more nor less my idea of the job is to get mr johnsons dossier and search the great house the chief constable smiled he had not fully confided in his subordinate yet when he came to reflect upon the matter mr johnsons bona fides had not yet been established in the depths of his companions bucolic mind might lurk after all the germ of truth chapter x so far as the countenance of so perfect a servant as rawson could betray any expression at all there was both welcome and a suggestion of hospitality in his manner as he received the callers certainly sir bertram was in mr gregory was in and mr henry was in sir bertram appeared almost at that moment coming out of the gun room with a rook rifle under his arm hullo major he exclaimed genially glad to see you warned in for lunch i hope very much obliged sir bertram was the somewhat hesitating reply to tell you the truth ah business i see the other interrupted come along to my den it is so long since i signed a warrant that upon my word i forgot i was a magistrate bring the inspector with you if you want him he led the way to a small and seldom used room plainly furnished where he was accustomed at times to interview a tenant seated himself on an uncomfortable chair before a formallooking desk and pointed to an easychair for his visitor nothing serious i hope he enquired major holmes waited until the door was closed sir bertram he began you have heard no doubt of the burglary at the great house my dear major was the reproachful reply this is a country village in norfolk and the burglary happened as long ago as last night i have heard seven versions of the affair and been given the names of at least seven suspectedly guilty parties i have come to call upon you in connection with that affair major holmes continued there is a person willing to declare upon oath that a quarter of an hour before the burglary occurred last night some one was seen to leave your house cross the park and enter the grounds of the great house through a gap in the hedge beyond the stable wall sir bertram sat quite still for a moment then his lips protruded slightly and he whistled well thats the eighth version he observed i like the last one holmesspicy to say the least of it this is not hearsay the chief constable went on i have seen the witness myself and heard the story from his own lips i come to you naturally for help sir bertram i want a list of your male domestics and i wish to know from your staff whether any one was known or heard to leave this house last night simple as abc sir bertram declared ringing the bell rawson keeps tabs on them all weve a couple of ladsunder footmen i suppose theyd call themselveswhom i dont know much about the others are about as likely to commit a burglary as i should be to rob a hen roost send rawson to me he ordered the man who answered the bell it was a matter of seconds only before the butler made his appearance his master leaned back in his chair as he questioned him rawson he asked do you know any oneany manwho could have left this house between midnight and three or say four oclock this morning certainly not sir was the confident reply you didnt hear any unusual sound in the night like a door opening or anything of that sort nothing sir bertram if you were told that some one had left this house at about three oclock and gone down to the great house what should you have to say about it i should say that it was impossible sir rawson asserted as you are aware sir i sleep in my own quarters adjoining the butlers pantry on the ground floor my window and door were both wide open last night and i am a light sleeper i was not once disturbed sir bertram turned to the chief constable did your informant specify the door which was made use of it was the door opening from the smaller library sir bertram glanced towards rawson see if that door is fastened he directed here youd better take the inspector with you the two men left the room sir bertram tapped a cigarette upon the table and lit it where did you get hold of this cockandbull story holmes he asked the chief constable frowned from a perfectly reliable source he replied i have no doubt that rawson is honest but i shall want the names of all your servants i shall also require to interview them all sir bertram smiled lord love us you dont suppose i want to stand in the way of your duty holmes he said when rawson comes back you shall have them all up one by one and put them through the mill bytheby there was nothing much stolen was there i understand the burglar had only tumbled out a coffer full of manuscripts the manuscripts themselves are missing major holmes confided i have seen the lot sir bertram observed carelessly some of them were curious there wasnt one of them worth sixpence intrinsically endacott was supposed to have one telling us all about the treasure in my buddha heads but it never materialised rawson returned in due course preceded by the inspector the door is properly locked on the inside sir the latter announced there are no evidences of any one having used that way out into the grounds lately so thats that sir bertram observed with a little shrug of the shoulders how many servants are there sleeping in the house major holmes enquired eleven sir rawson answered i shall require to interview each one of them get along with it then sir bertram assented resignedly dont forget we lunch at one rawson had better take you round to the servants quarters when major holmes has finished rawson bring him out on to the lawn and serve some sherry he dismissed them all carelessly with a little wave of the hand waited until the door was closed waited until some minutes afterwards before his expression changed or a sound escaped from his lips then he rose slowly to his feet lit another cigarette and looked reproachfully at his shaking fingers what a nerve these great criminals must have he murmured to himself as he strolled out into the hall henryhullo henry a still motionless figure stood in the shadow of the staircase on the first landing looking downward a figure so still that except for his clothes he might have stepped out of one of the frames which lined the wall are you coming down or going up or rooted sir bertram enquired i will descend henry ballaston replied he came down the stairs with slow yet even footsteps one hand always upon the carved balustrade i heard voices he said holmes is here from norwich sir bertram confided and the immortal cloutson with himyou know the travelling inspector for the district they have an idea that some one crossed the park from the hall last night in connection i presume with the burglary at the great house henry observed his brother nodded a silly business have you seen anything of gregory not since breakfast time he spoke of going to norwich he found he wanted another trunk sir bertram sighed the brothers walked out together through the fine gothic side entrance which led on to the lawns and gardens you had no communication from mr borroughes this morning i suppose henry ballaston asked a little hesitatingly nothing was the level reply there was a letter from kershawthe lawyer fellow of whom emily spoke so highly he said that he had studied the position from every point of view and regretted to find that he could discover no means remaining by which sufficient money to pay the overdue interest on the first mortgage could be legitimately raised the timber will be the only thing and the timber is ballaston the timber is sacred henry agreed has mr kershaw examined the position so far as regards the romneys and the three gainsboroughs heirlooms just the same as the others they are not to be touched the brothers stood side by side upon the lawn their faces turned towards the house sir bertram was his usual cool and gracious self henry had somehow or other a suggestion of suspended life in his colourless face his stiff attitude his cold eyes major holmes is examining the servants he enquired that was his idea will he wait until gregory returns very likely as i think i told you they seem to have come across some one who can swear that they saw a man leaving the hall last night just before the burglary took place but there was no actual burglary henry objected a quantity of documents appear to be missing sir bertram confided holmess attitude seemed to me a little suspicious i fancy that some one has been getting at him i am not surei must confess to having some doubts about this man johnson doubts explain yourself bertram johnsons account of himself has never been an entirely credible one do you remember the day when he lunched here and he saw the images he certainly betrayed surprise henry reflected gregory has a queer idea about it although it only made us laugh at the time he said he reminded him of the chinaman who saved his life on the yuntse river and who was an important person in the firm of johnson and company mr johnson is not a chinaman henry ballaston replied confidently his brother took his arm and moved towards the house major holmes was standing in the entrance no sir bertram agreed but the chinaman might have been mr johnson chapter xi the chief constable had little to report but his air of uneasy disquietude remained i think he announced that so far as i can make out the servants are all right curiously enough however it seems that gregory has a key to the door in question which he uses sometimes very probable sir bertram assented he likes to come and go out of the house at all times i wonder when hell be back major holmes enquired he had very little to do his father observed found himself a trunk short or something of that sort i thought he had bought all his outfit in london but i suppose he miscalculated when does he go abroad saturday week sails from liverpool to montreal i think by an allan liner the county will miss him the chief constable remarked as he accepted a glass of sherry from the tray which rawson had just brought out so i am afraid shall i sir bertram admitted it is one of the signs of approaching age when one begins to rely upon other people i remember the time when i used to find it devilish uncomfortable to have a grownup son todaywell i would rather there were something he could do in england shall we go in major no use waiting for gregory hes just as likely as not to lunch in norwich luncheon was at times a difficult function holmes was in a sense an unwilling guest and sir bertram was unusually silent it was henry with his stilted phrases and oldfashioned sense of the obligations of a host who kept conversation going towards the end of the meal gregory put in an unexpected appearance he shook hands with holmes of whose presence he had obviously been informed and apologised to his father so sorry dad he explained it took me some time to find just the trunk i wanted and then i remembered that i had ordered some riding kit at houghtons and i thought i might as well be tried on any news about the burglary major nothing of any moment at present the latter replied gregory busied himself for some time with his lunch whilst the others loitered afterwards they strolled out on to the lawn together for coffee as soon as it was served holmes set down his cup and faced the situation gregory he said i know you will remember that as well as being your friend and i hope the friend of every one here i am a government official gregory paused in the act of lighting a cigarette and stared at him why thats all right he assented what about it the police have evidence major holmes continued that at about three oclock this morningthat is to say twenty minutes or so before the burglary at the great house was committedsome one was seen to leave the hall cross the park and enter the great house or at any rate to disappear in that neighbourhood gregory finished lighting his cigarette where on earth did the police get hold of their information he enquired from a poacher from a person whose word it would be a little difficult to upset the chief constable replied acting on his information i have come up here to pay an official visit i have interviewed all the servants without result i understand that you possess a key to the smaller library door which you sometimes use i often use it gregory admitted if i dine out or anything of that sort or come home by the mail from london i use it to avoid undoing all the bolts of the front door where was the key last night anywhere where any one could have got hold of it i shouldnt have thought so its in my dressing room somewhere you didnt lend it to any one certainly not no one has ever asked me for it you didnt use it yourself last night no i havent used it for weeks major holmes nodded well he said thats that i now appeal to you all can you help me a reliable witness states that some one left the hall through that library door last night was seen to walk across the park and to all reasonable supposition was the person who assaulted and chloroformed mr johnson and committed the burglary you will realise that this is a serious statement can any of you suggest anything which might throw light upon the affair all that i can suggest gregory remarked is that your informant must have been seeing spooks who is he one of the villagers there need no longer be any secret about his identity major holmes decided our informant is a private detective employed by mr johnson there was an intense and ominous silence henry ballaston drew his chair a little farther back into the shade as though he suddenly felt the sun too strong sir bertram whistled softly but for once in his life seemed guilty of an almost unnatural action gregory stood as though turned to stone across his face for a moment there flitted an expression of dismay the chief constable saw it and his heart sank it was sir bertrams brain which moved the quickest how the mischief did this mr johnson get hold of a private detective at a moments notice he enquired he has had him in the neighbourhood for some time major holmes replied his presence in the park last night was not accidental he was employed by mr johnson in connection with certain theories which hejohnsonheld as to the murder of mr endacott this is all most amazing sir bertram observed a very curious action on the part of a man who is a total stranger to the neighbourhood henry put in the chief constable brooded for several moments his official duty was hard to follow the whole circumstances were unusual he faced the situation from the commonsense point of view johnson may be a stranger to the neighbourhood he admitted but i do not think that his appearance here is so entirely casual as he tried to make out it transpires that he was a partner of endacotts in the great firm of johnson and company i believe that the real object of his coming here was to solve the mystery of endacotts murder wu ling my god gregory exclaimed in genuine excitement the moment i saw him i thought i recognised him then it seemed incredible why of course i was a fool ever to doubt it he went on he played the chinaman out there to do his trading up in the villages he had lived there most of his life it was easy enough then when he finished with the business and came back here he europeanised himself my god what a fool i have been i dont know anything about that major holmes observed he came to me in norwich a short time ago and he placed before me some very serious information i am using my own discretion in what i am about to say by now you must know just what i am up against again i appeal to you for your help in the background henry shook his head gravely sir bertram with the slightest possible shrug of the shoulders turned away and lit a cigarette gregory completely at his ease again lolled a little deeper in his wicker chair my dear fellow he expostulated how the deuce can any of us help you i tell you frankly if any one left the house last nightand i dont believe they didi for one dont know anything about it as to the murderwell if mr johnsons private agent can find out anything about that the whole neighbourhood will be indebted to him how on earth is he likely to succeed however when you and scotland yard have failed the murder so far as our investigations took us major holmes said patiently was entirely lacking in direct motive the burglary on the contrary does seem to have had an extraordinary but clear object the burglar got away with a number of chinese manuscripts amongst these manuscripts i know what you are going to say gregory interrupted smiling as though in amusement but youre wrong all the same old endacott had been through them there wasnt one which could help the owner of the images to discover the treasure where are these infernal images major holmes asked they have been moved upstairs into my apartments henry ballaston intervened if it would afford you any satisfaction to inspect them i will take you there with pleasure i should like to see them major holmes decided they all returned to the house gregory quitting his chair with an air of reluctance the two images stood in a small sitting room opening out from henry ballastons bedroom at the top of the house an apartment of extraordinary almost monastic simplicity they stood side by side on an old black oak bureau and against the white of the walls they showed up with almost glaring effect the body and the soul gregory pointed out i dont think they have ever been worth what poor old bill hammonde and i went through for them they got bill too good chap he was the legend is sir bertram explained politely that those heads are filled with jewels yet we have never been able to discover an opening or aperture of any sort if there is any truth in the story major holmes suggested why dont you break them up sir bertram shivered that at least he said one would keep for a last effort those images holmes are nearly a thousand years old and if you are any judge of such things you will see at once that they were carved by a great artist with their history i should imagine that their value at christies would be at least several thousand pounds each so long as they are intact major holmes took one into his hands and set it down again amazed at the weight why theyre almost as heavy as bronze he exclaimed the wood of which they are fashioned is a species of teak woodalmost extinct now sir bertram explained their weight of course is rather an argument against their being hollow on the other hand they might be hollow and filled with jewels there is a further legend gregory confided that there is inside some sort of infernal machine invented during the last century by the priests which would go off at any rough usage that i must say seems to me a bit thick at the same time the chinese were always rather great at explosives i imagine major holmes said that you will not let this superstition stand in your way provided you are unable to discover the secret opening as a last resort sir bertram declared we have decided to destroy the less pleasing of the images and i gregory announced in a low tone his eyes fixed upon the leering image of the body mean to be the one to strike the blow one gets kind of superstitious over there you know holmes he went on i lost possession of the other image for a time the robbers got off with it when they raided the train and killed poor old hammonde but that unpleasinglooking devil i brought home with me all i can say is that i dont want to be left alone with him again for a month or six weeks you wouldnt have much chance would you at the norwich assizes if you pleaded that you had been driven to commit a murder through the influence of an image a chinese judge would have understood it all i know is that on that boat i was never myself and here holmes asked curiously i kept out of the way of the thing when it was once here gregory replied uncle henry took care of it then and i think it would take more than the power of an image to move him from the paths of rectitude thenthrough old endacott bythebywe got hold of the other one so now i dont mind it is only when hes out of reach of the soul that that chaps supposed to do any harm you were lucky to regain possession of the other image the chief constable observed after a moments pause through mr endacott i think you said in a sort of way gregory answered coldly you couldnt be a little more explicit the other persisted the silence which followed was portentous charged with electricity it was sir bertram who laid his hand gently upon his sons shoulder gregory is rather sensitive about this business he said considering all that he went through i do not wonder at it if ever it becomes expedient for us to explain exactly how the second image came into our possession we will do so that moment scarcely seems to have yet arrived major holmes abandoned the subject a little abruptly he walked along the great corridor with its rows of pictures upon one side and mullioned windows on the other speechless and absorbed the whole place seemed flooded with afternoon sunshine which found its way into the gloomiest corners touching some old suits of armour with a gleam of fire tracing zigzag hieroglyphics upon the smooth white stone floor he had made up his mind what course of action to adopt and it had not been an easy task he sent for inspector cloutson and stood making his adieux to his hosts at the last minute he drew gregory on one side i hear you are starting off on another of your long rambles gregory he said something a little more permanent this time i am going to try the far west firstlose myself for a year or two nothing definite seems to be known just yet but there are rumours that there have been some big finds of gold right up the yukon if i dont have any luck i shall come back and try ranching ive got a job out there its true then what they are saying the major continued diffidently things here are pretty bad rotten gregory admitted unless a miracle happens such as those jewels materialising or something of that sort ballaston must go before the autumn it is bad news the other sighed it is almost a tragedy enough to drive any one crazy he added his rather kindly eyes resting for a moment upon gregorys face i am going to give you a word of advice if i may we were at school together and i practically owe my position here to your father i shall have to settle with my conscience for saying iti may decide to chuck up my jobbut im going to say it if youve got your kit ready move off i dont like the look of things down here for you thats all for a moment gregory was speechlessnot exactly from surprise but from some mixture of emotions which found outlet in speech difficult then he suddenly took the hand which holmes had extended and wrung it youre a good fellow holmes he said i dont like the look of things myself and thats a fact i may pop off if i see my way clear if i dontwell you wont have any disagreeable duties to perform at the castle ill promise you that the inspector put in his appearance and the two men took their leave gregory remained for a few minutes motionless upon the broad semicircle of white stone stretching out from the front door gazing after the receding car presently his father moved up to his side holmes seems to have a bee in his bonnet gregory he ventured tentatively gregory nodded hes a good fellow he declared it cost him something to do it i know but hes given me the office advised me to clear out within the next twentyfour hours its that fellow johnson well if you have made up your mind to go sir bertram said why not they cant do anything in a desperate hurry and youll get a run for your money at least out there gregory seemed for a moment puzzled then distressed he turned and looked at his father sir bertrams expression however was inscrutable finally he swung on his heel at any rate he decided ill finish my packing chapter xii things do be happening round about here for sure mr pank remarked as he moved down the whisky bottle from its shelf what it all may lead to is more than a body can say but i dont like the look of it mr craske the grocer added less than his usual modicum of water to his whisky his aspect was gloomy so also were the aspects of mr franks the butcher who had strolled across for news and walter beavens the wheelwright who had come on a similar errand its almost as bad mr craske declared as the week after the murder every one went about then as it were on tiptoe now this burglary taken by itself aint anything to make special mention of why mr johnson himself he was in the morning after it happened and he treated it mostly as a joke its my belief mr pank pronounced that theres something more serious brewing theres inspector cloutson come to stop in the village theres major holmes the chief constable up and down from the hall all day theres mr johnson he dont come near any more mr fieldinghim we took for a schoolmaster and whom they do say was a kind of detectivehe aint been in and mr rawsonwhy no one aint seen him for four days we shall have news before long and bad news im afraid it may be theres wild talk going about mr craske sighed and what it may mean no one can say for sure but what i do say is reason is reason and is it likely that any one here could have a grudge against a poor old harmless fellow like mr endacott all this talk of images and chinese documents and suchlike seems as though it had come out of the pages of one of these serial novels as folks read in the newspapers i dont take no stock of such stuff mr franks pushed his tankard across to be refilled theres one bit of bad news at any rate may be sprung upon us at any moment he said they do say that every servant in the hall had a months notice yesterday i heard that from miss shane the housekeepers niece the landlord shook his head gloomily things do seem to be pointing that way he admitted and mr rawson keeping away and all if so be that its true it will be a sad loss the squire be a proud man in his way but he be a true gentleman and so be mr henry and a more popular young gent than mr gregory has never been known in the county its a wonderful property to have to give up well get some one here i suppose mr craske predicted pessimistically whos made pots of money by being careful and goes on saving pots the same way some of those big houses the way they do go through their books and talk about the stores to you why heres mr rawson the butler entered solemn ponderous and dignified as ever he raised his black bowler hat in acknowledgment of the greetings which assailed him from all sides and sank slowly into a chair good afternoon gentlemen he said mr pank ill take double my usual quantity of scotch whisky with me mr rawson the grocer insisted weve missed you the last few days rawson sighed i felt too worried in my mind for company he confessed its no secret to you all so why should i act mysterious about it theres skeery doings at the hall there was a little rustle of interest rawson disposed for gossip waited until his drink was placed in his hand and solemnly pledged its donor to begin with he confided its no secret now that were in trouble we may have acted foolish he went on nothing of course can be said for seventy thousand pounds lost at newmarket and a trifle more than that last year foolish we may have been but the gentry have always had their weaknesses the hounds have cost us a cool eight thousand a year for the last five years and subscriptions getting less all the time then the taxes it seems whatever sort of government we get these days they want your moneyfingers all itching for it get you all ways income tax and land taxwhy its a wonder they dont grab the breath out of your body its the first time such a things happened to me in my career but last nightyoull believe me gentlemeni had my notice there was a murmur of sympathy rawson raised his glass and drank it was mr henry as usual who had to tackle the job he continued he sent for us one by one to his study where he sat as prim and formal as ever with all his catalogues around and his books of reference rawson he said you have been an excellent servant but conditions render it necessary for my brother and me to close this house for the present we are in fact ceasing to keep an establishment i am compelled therefore to ask you to accept a months notice all very proper and regular gentlemen but i could see that mr henry were feeling it mrs shane came out all crying i seen him afterwards though and he were just the same as usual except that his face were as white as parchment it do be a sad loss for all mr pank declared theres no word of anything but good in these parts for any of themfor the squire or mr henry or mr gregory either as though this werent trouble enough rawson proceeded portentously theres all sorts of mysterious doings and rumours afloat about enough to drive a body crazy you mind the young man fielding who called himself a retired schoolmaster and sat in the corner pretending to make flies the hypocrite mr craske exclaimed a detective thats what he was rawson went on not a police detective you understand but one of them that goes about spying for a living now he is up and swore that the night of the burglary he seen some one leave the hall by the oak library which is mr gregorys private way almost twenty minutes or half an hour before the burglary were committed there was a little buzz of exclamations and remarks a general feeling of indignation against the pseudoschoolmaster if he were one of these paid spies mr craske enquired who were paying him that i cant say for sure the butler acknowledged but i have my suspicionsvery grave suspicions too and whom might you be fancying to be the man mr rawson one of the little group asked him as has taken the great housemr johnson by name was the injured reply weve had him up to lunch too and treated him as it were beyond his station im glad to find hes not here today gentlemen theres a word or two i might have had to say to him it do seem most mysterious the innkeeper declared what do you suppose this mr johnson has got to do with it all mr rawson that hes putting his oar in mr johnson the butler announced has come to these parts under false pretences theres many has wondered why he settled here and many asked him the question and all the time he answered innocent like that he just wanted the country and the house suited him and so on do you mindall on youwhen he pretended to be surprised about the murder he knew about it all the time he was mr endacotts partner out somewhere in foreign parts and he settled down here in a mischievous kind of way to make trouble and disturbance amongst his betters well i never mr pank exclaimed a pleasanterspoken body never came in the place or a more harmless looking theres nothing fresh is there mr rawson about the murder god knows was the butlers ponderous pronouncement theres strange things all around us and what they may mean or where they may lead to we none of us can tell at this present moment there is mr johnson the grocer exclaimed looking out over the muslin blinds and inspector cloutson with him look at em walking together so confidential like id like to know what theyre saying mr craske confessed heads almost touching as you might say and did you see the inspector turn around and look across towards the hall the two men halted outside the postern gate presently they separated and with a brief nod mr johnson entered his own domain whilst inspector cloutson turned and made his way back towards the police station the little company watched mr johnsons retiring figure as they had once watched his progress down the village street on the day of his first visit in my opinion rawson declared emphatically thats the man whos brought most of the mischief into this neighbourhood im not one to wish any of my neighbours harm but if the chap who broke into the great house the other night had been of my way of thinking hed have given him one which would have kept him quiet for a bit longer than this mr johnson moved rather wearily to his favourite seat under the cedar tree and sat there for several minutes in tired contemplation he awoke from a fit of brooding to find katherine besant crossing the lawn towards him she was bareheaded and it was obvious that she had been running he rose to his feet come and sit down he begged i cant stop she answered i just came in i wanted to have a word or two with you he took her hands in his and looked at her steadily she was a little flushed with her hurrying but it struck him that her hair was more carefully arranged and that her linen frock simple though its fashion was becoming the slight eagerness in her manner communicated also to her expression gave her an air of greater life and vivacity mr johnson she exclaimed i really cant stop i dont know when madame may want me but what does it all mean every one seems wildly unhappy and it all seems to centre round you what are you doing to everybody you were so kind to me my dear he replied gently it would take a long time to explain very soon you will know everything but the everything that i am to know seems as though it were going to be horrible she cried madame looks as if she were about to die every moment sir bertram rode away from seeing her this morning looking like a ghost they say that mr gregory left last night for abroad miss endacott sent three notes to him yesterday i know that she wanted him to come to see her he wouldnt and the place seems fullfull of phosphorescence its like a pause before a thunder storm no one seems to know quite what to expect is it you who have been stirring up all this trouble he shook his head the trouble such as it is he assured her solemnly was caused by those who must suffer for it who are they she demanded he pointed over his shoulder towards the hall the ballastons he answered but what have they done he shook his head dont ask me too much he begged its an ugly story and youll know it soon enough only believe me it isnt i who am bringing it all about but you could stop it she expostulated nothing in the world could stop it he answered i dont look like a superstitious man do i miss besant i shouldnt have said so she admitted i have this belief though he went on which you may call superstitious or you may not there are some things which a man who meddles with must suffer for i have seen it in my younger days in egypt and i have seen it also in china i have seen a man who posed as a great savant and egyptologist destroy a sacred tomb the newspapers of the world were filled with accounts of the treasure he discovered he died within a few months and to this day no one knows how and then tell me this by what right does a young man like gregory ballaston simply because he has courage and enterprise and because he is faced with ruin dare to come out to a strange country break into a sacred temple and rob it well he found no treasure but for the evil which has come because of his wrongdoing you must not blame me who point the finger to his guilt you must blame something which neither you nor i fully understand but which is working for a punishment just as surely but you dont think she faltered you cant believe that gregory ballaston killed mr endacott the law will have to decide that he answered gravely she sat for several moments pensive and still then she rose to her feet i think it is all very horrible she sighed life has its grim and terrible side he declared but underlying it all there is a sense of justice which has made us humans frame laws and institute a code of punishment the instinct to do this and abide by the results is a part of nature itself no one really escapes the consequences of illdoing will you promise me one thing miss besant she had been in the act of turning away she paused everything may be changed here in a few days he went on and of course i may be pretty unpopular will you promise me that you will not go away without seeing me she hesitated for a moment then she gave him her hand quickly to his surprise there were tears in her eyes i promise she said you have been kind to me at any rate you are the first person who has been really kind to me for years she moved away too quickly for him to detain her mr johnson returned slowly to the house over which the shadow of tragedy seemed once more to be brooding chapter xiii doing me well for our farewell dinner dad gregory murmured appreciatively as he set down his glass with a little gesture of reverence port sir bertram smiled pleasantly it was not for the two footmen standing motionless at either end of the magnificent sideboard or even for rawson behind his masters chair to know that this was anything but an ordinary function conversation throughout the meal had taken no account of possible catastrophe they had talked of the sporting side of gregorys expedition sir bertram himself had shot big game in canada more than once there are only a few bottles left i regret to say sir bertram remarked we started on the last bin at the commencement of the year this is the cockburns shipping henry put in we have always considered it the finer wine if you will pass the decanter bertram i will indulge in my second glass before the decanter was finished rawson and his satellites had departed sir bertram glanced at his watch you have nearly an hour he said what time did you tell holmes you would leave at ten oclock gregory replied the train leaves norwich at eleventhirty sir bertram rose from his place they strolled into the library drank coffee and liqueurs and lit cigarettes there was still nothing in their conversation to indicate the great crisis henry was the first to introduce a note of unexpectedness if i may claim ten minutes of your time gregory he said it would gratify me if you would pay a visit to my room you too i trust bertram he added why of course uncle gregory acquiesced ill just fill my case with these cigarettes if you dont mind dad may save me opening my travelling bag by all means his father begged they ascended the great staircase gregory pausing every now and then to look at one of his favourite pictures henry led the way to his own room with its quaint air of monasticity and severity accentuated by the orielshaped windows he closed the door carefully behind him i should like before you depart gregory he began to assure you that my sympathies have been entirely with you in your gallant but nonsuccessful attempt to restore the fortunes of our family i may or may not agree with you in your decision that thesehe waved his hand towards the two imagesshould remain unbroken there are times he went on when i fancy that our friend there with the very evil and mocking leer is trying to boast of the treasures he possesses and with which he refuses to part that however is an effort of the imagination in which i seldom indulge it occurred to me further that i should like before you leave to prove to you that my sympathy with your enterprise was not confined to a merely passive attitude my actions may not have been entirely judicious but they were wellintentioned it was i who on a certain night made use of your key entered the great house in i must confess a surreptitious manner relieved myself of interference on the part of mr johnson i am afraid in somewhat inconsiderate fashion and purloined the manuscripts which i had hoped might help us towards the discovery of the treasure the cigarette which sir bertram had been holding between his fingers slipped on to the carpet and lay there almost unnoticed he gazed at his brother with a great astonishment in his face gregory taken even more by surprise stared at him speechless and openmouthed neither of them said a word henry stooped down picked up the lighted cigarette and threw it into the fireplace henry youre crazy sir bertram exclaimed at last uncle henry gregory cried something which was finally a smile parted henrys lips as he pointed to a neat package upon the table these are the manuscripts he said i regret to say that my expedition was a failure nothing there helps us in any degree but how the devil do you know gregory demanded whom did you get to read them during the last few months his uncle confided with a view to making this enterprise a success i have studied and read chinese god bless my soul sir bertram gasped the language presented its difficulties henry admitted during my last visit to london in january i consulted a chinese scholar who put me in the right way and i have attained to a certain proficiencyenough at any rate for the purpose it struck me that major holmess enquiries into the matter were becoming somewhat unpleasant and i thought therefore that i would confide the truth to you in case at any time suspicion should fall upon another person this parcel containing the documents contains also a letter from me acknowledging my exploit and a letter of apology to miss endacott whose property i suppose they must be considered they are undamaged and except for the slight injury to mr johnson which i regret was necessary the affair seems to me to be trivial gregory clasped his forehead trivial he groaned there will i fear be a certain loss of dignity should i be called upon to answer for my misdoing henry concluded but i can assure you that i shall take no steps to evade any action which may ensue that i think is all it only remains for me gregory to wish you success abroad of our own future here we will not speak whilst the ballaston treasures and heirlooms remain intact my place is with them a pleasant voyage gregory he shook hands and conducted them courteously to the door his little pat on his nephews shoulder was the nearest approach to affection he had ever shown gregory and his father descended the stairs almost in silence when they reached the hall gregory sank into a chair and held his head in his hands dad was that a dream he demanded i cant conceive it uncle henry of all men in the world it is the ballaston spirit concealed sir bertram murmured for a quarter of an hour or so father and son sat in the great hall without speech there was a curiously intense silence broken only by the ticking of a large clock and through the wideflung window the twittering of a nightingale preparing for his aftermath of song sir bertram rose at last to his feet let us walk on the terrace gregory he suggested the car will be round in a few minutes they strolled out together sir bertram correct and debonair from the polish of his wellbrushed hair to the pearl studs in his shirt and his scrupulously cut dinner clothes gregory in travelling tweeds prepared for his journey sir bertram took his sons arm as they commenced their leisurely promenade i am afraid he said in a tone of very rare gravity that its all up with us ballastons gregory youre young and fit though and ive got quite enough to amuse myself withit will have to be france i suppose or spain its all a compromise of course and a cursed compromise theres only one place for an englishman to live and thats on his own land its the devils own luck to lose ballaston but weve gone the limit eh gregory to try to keep it yes gregory admitted we made a bid for it at any rateeven uncle henry his tone had grown more serious the shadow of something unspoken seemed to be lying between them personally sir bertram continued i regret nothing i blame nobody for anything i consider that everything was justified you have to make a fresh start gregory dont do so with that somewhat bourgeois impedimenta slurred conscience what has been done has been done and is finished with gregory for a moment did not reply his puzzled eyes sought his fathers but sought them in vain for my part sir bertram repeated steadily i regret nothing it was worth the effort and as for henrygod bless him the lights of the car flashed from the stable yard and so my dear boy his father concluded in his ordinary tone you swing your bundle figuratively speaking at the end of your stick and set out on your allegorical journey only for gods sake dont come back lord mayor of london gregory had already taken his seat the chauffeurs hand was upon the change speeds gear when rawson hurried forward there is another car coming up the avenue sir he announced would it be as well to wait for a moment gregory looked out of the window he could see the twin lights flashing in the distance gleaming slantwise through the trees then again pools of light in the semidarkness for only a moment he hesitated but during that moment it seemed to him that he was taking leave of much that was dear in life then he stepped out of the car and stood upon the edge of the terrace it might be as well rawson he agreed with somewhat elaborate casualness i wonder who the devil it can be at this time of the night sir bertram speculated the car resolved itself into shape its very crudity its ugliness seemed symbolic the driver was in plain clothes but he sat stiffly and there was something official about his appearance by his side was major holmes behind sat inspector cloutson the two latter descended as the car drew up well major sir bertram exclaimed what new thunderbolt are you going to launch the chief constable rather avoided his eyes we want a word with you please he confided laying his hand lightly upon gregorys arm they all entered the house together sir bertram led the way to the library thrust open the door and closed it again when they had all entered now what the devil is it this time holmes he asked a little testily you mustnt be annoyed with me if i say that i am getting rather tired of these visitations i deeply regret the necessity for the present one was the grave reply gregory ballaston i am sorry to tell you that inspector cloutson here has a warrant for your arrest i should strongly advise you to make no reply to the charge and to come with us to norwich what is the charge gregory demanded a very serious one i am afraid major holmes announced i have as a matter of fact two warrants the first charging you gregory ballaston with assault on one peter johnson and burglary at the great house on the night of july th and the second by which you stand charged with the murder of ralph endacott at the great house on june th of last year there is nothing to be gained by denial or comment or anything else at the present moment i beg you gregory not to attempt any reply but to come with us the door behind had been opened so softly that no one heard it they were all standing motionless when henry with a brown paper parcel under his arm entered but that is ridiculous major holmes he said quietly you must have been very greatly misled it was i who was guilty of the burglary here in this parcel you will find all the documents i purloined or i might say borrowed the instrument with which i cut out the panel of the door another with which i picked the lockinstruments i may say obtained with the greatest possible difficulty from an establishment in london there was a moments blank silence major holmess expression after the first shock of surprise was one of complete incredulity this is a very remarkable statement on your part mr ballaston he observed i presume you wish us to take note of what you say at the same time i have i am sorry to remind you a warrant against your nephew on a more serious charge henry ballaston apologised with dignity i regret he said not to have mentioned the two affairs together i also on june th of last year after a few words of unpleasant discussion with mr endacott shot him through the head once more there was a brief spell of breathless silence henry ballaston was entirely master of the situation perfectly selfpossessed slightly apologetic father and son were gazing into each others eyes with mutual and amazed interrogation you see henry continued in explanatory fashion mr endacott was a very unreasonable man he admitted that he had made a translation of the manuscript but he refused to give it to me he desired his niece to profit by it i suppose i must have lost my temper i shot him and secured the other image but could find no trace of the manuscript hence my second effort within the last few days have i made myself quite clear sir bertrams fingers upon his sons arm had grown like the grip of a vice he leaned forward do you mean to say that you didnt do it greg he whispered hoarsely before god i didnt was the passionate reply i thought it was you chapter xiv mr johnson that same evening was smoking the cigar of discontent drinking the coffee of bitterness and sipping the brandy of fire around him was all the stillness and the sweetness of the summer twilight which he loved so much stars burning in a violet sky the breath of roses in the air the peaceful village sounds in his ears more lulling and soothing than absolute silence yet he was filled with disquietude he rose and with his hands in his pockets paced the long strip of velvety lawn what he had done what he had worked for seemed to him to be a simple act of justice yet with its accomplishment he was acutely conscious of an intense isolation no one was in sympathy with him every one loved the wicked ballastons even katherine besant had left him her eyes streaming with tears madame had sent imploring but vain messages in the village he felt that it was barely safe to show himself then when he was wondering where to look for consolation the postern gate opened quickly two women enteredkatherine besant and claire he moved forward to welcome them miss endacott katherine explained wants to see you immediately and talk to you take her away somewhere i will wait i am pleased to talk to miss endacott anywhere she wishes mr johnson acquiesced in the study quickly claire begged she swung round upon him as soon as they had entered the roomsuperb beautiful but furious mr johnson she began i have come to beseech you to insist that you move no further in this horrible affair nothing can bring my uncle back to life nothing can ever still the remorse of whoever killed him beyond that let it rest i implore you mr johnson to do nothing more my dear young lady he replied gravely think of what you are proposing you can scarcely be content to let your uncles murderer go scot free that is just what i do want she persisted he gained nothing by it andi am quite sure that whoever it was he was not altogether sane even on the steamermr johnson i beg you to believe megregory ballaston was under the influence of that horrible image all the time he behaved quite strangely as soon as he had parted from it he was as different as possible if whoever killed my uncle came from the house where that image isits a terrible thing to say but i honestly believe itthey couldnt help it they werent responsible the tenant of the great house shook his head it is too late he said what do you mean too late she demanded with a sudden fear in her eyes what have you done what right have you to interfere anyway gregory ballaston is going abroad tonight that is the best thing that could happen it is nevertheless too late mr johnson declared the local police have consulted with scotland yard by telephone and they have decided that the evidence they hold at present against gregory ballaston is sufficient for them to stop his going abroad they have issued two warrants tonight he will be arrested i should say within the next few minutes she seemed suddenly to tower above him white passionate menacing her eyes blazed her fingers seemed to seek a weapon it was the first vital fury of youth you brute she exclaimed oh gregory for a moment the earth seemed to darken around her mr johnson groaned as he led the halffainting girl to a couch miss endacott he said this is a terrible business but believe me justice must be done murder is an unforgivable crime to take another mans lifehave you thought what it means what about my life she moaned dont you understand i was content never to see him again i lied about the image to save him but i love him if this horrible thing happens i think that i shall kill you i shall either do that or die myself i cant bear it i tell you i cant bear it she leaned forward in her chair and began to sob mr johnson mopped his forehead feverishly it was perhaps in his eager desire to escape from the horror of the moment that he took particular note of the long key which was attached to the chain which hung around her neck and which had temporarily escaped its resting place what key is that he asked her sharply she took no notice at first he repeated his question she looked as though she could have struck him key she echoed scornfully what does it matter why do you ask me about keys at a moment like this theres only one thing that mattershe must be saved you must do something take back something you have said of course i know he did it or i should be with him at this moment hes not bad he mustnt be killed ioh my god she began to sob again he laid his hand upon her shoulder listen he said i will do all that i can i promise you but you must tell me what this key is i have a reason for asking it came from some safemakers about eleven months ago she answered wearily they said it was the duplicate which my uncle had ordered the last time he was in london he removed the chain from her neck crossed the room and entered the little annex the door of which since the burglary had stood open and where in a corner a rusty old safe had been fitted into the wall at the first turn the key slipped in and the lock yielded he swung the door open in the darkness there was the gleam of a bulky white envelope he took it out it was addressed to claire endacott he examined it for a moment then he closed the safe and returned to the library miss endacott he announced that key of yours has solved something which has puzzled me for a very long time it has opened the old safe here the other key to it was inside this letter as you see is for you i have always felt convinced that your uncle before his death had succeeded in making some sort of a translation of the document which he possessed indicating the whereabouts of the jewels this is probably the solution she flung the letter away and but for his intervention would have trampled it with her foot upon the floor do something she begged you must stop what is going to happen it isnt fair it isnt right he rescued the letter and himself broke the seal she snatched it from his fingers dont waste time she pleaded do something letters what does it matter about letters it is from your uncle he told her solemnly probably the last thing he ever wrote she tore open the envelope with quick nervous fingers anxious yet reluctant she began to read with a sort of sullen indifference then she seemed suddenly galvanised into a new and amazingly altered state of living mr johnson as he watched her was terrified she sprang to her feet and shrieked out at the top of her voice read it read it yourself she cried gripping him by the arm so that her fingers bored their way into his flesh read it and tell me that it is the truth let me see too spell it out read it their heads touched her breath came hot upon his cheek she grasped the letter as though afraid it might be torn from her the great house saturday night my dear claire i went to london this morning with the shadow of a fearno more i come backdoomed you can hear all about it if you like from sir francis moore harley street three months to live and much suffering i think not i shall end it tonight you will be richmuch richer than you think malcolms have my will you and your aunt will share alike i enclose in this letter a translation of a document which will tell you unless the document lies how to obtain the treasure in the images use it as you will i have no interest i should have liked a year or two here but i prefer what is to come to an increase of the agony of which i have already had a foretaste i hope that you will be happy ralph endacott he read it through word by word she repeated them after him then a calm seemed to come upon her which was almost unnatural take care of the letter he enjoined dont lose it he rushed out across the lawn and through the postern gate down the great avenue from the house he could see the lights of two cars flashing he ran on to the crossroads and stood there with arms extended presently they swung round the corner and at the sight of him were brought to a standstill with a grinding of the brakes in the front one were major holmes sir bertram and gregory in the rear one cloutson and henry ballaston mr johnson gripped major holmes by the arm major he exclaimed an amazing thing has happened you must come round to the great house at once major holmes frowned i am afraid mr johnson he said it is too late for any sort of intervention the criminal has confessed mr johnson was staggered but still frantically eloquent there can be nothing to confess he insisted come and ill show you the letter ill show you where i found it you must come youre in charge of this case im sane it was i who wanted justice done you must see what has happenedsee the open saferead the letter major holmes descended and gave an order to the sergeant behind both cars were driven to the great house almost pushed in by mr johnson they crowded into the library he pointed to the open safe visible through the door of the annex miss endacott had the key he explained i noticed it round her neck tonight it came a month after mr endacotts death i opened the safe and found this letter that you must all read i will swear that it is in ralph endacotts handwriting his niece will swear it i took it from the safe ralph endacott shot himself he was dying he shot himself gregory gasped there isnt a doubt about it mr johnson declared the name of the doctor is there he was a dying man across the room their eyes metgregorys and claires it seemed as though nothing could keep them apart without conscious movement he was by her side her hands in his all the time with slow deliberate emphasis major holmes was reading the letter aloud reading the words penned by a dying man the supreme yet ghastly irony of which no one properly apprehended in those few minutes of immense relief why didnt you tell me claire faltered as soon as she could find words gregory glanced behind at the little group and drew her nearer and nearer a nightmare was passing from his brain i thought it was dad he whispered under his breath what could i do the letter appears to be genuine major holmes decided looking up with an air of great relief and the name of the doctor fortunately provides us with corroborative evidence but under the circumstances i must confess that i fail to understand mr henry ballastons position he added turning towards him the latter coughed a little nervously it has never been my custom he declared to countenance any deviation from the truth in others or to indulge in anything approaching a falsehood myself i have to admit however that on the present occasion i made a false statement which i beg leave to withdraw the fact is he confided with a touch of that ingenuousness which was one of his characteristics i never doubted for a moment that my nephew gregory in the interests of the family was guilty of this misdemeanour i am a useless person in this world he is a young man and our direct heir i did what i thought best but the image sir bertram demanded in bewildermentthe second image of the soul how on earth did that get to the hall i brought it was henrys complacent reply but when gregory asked helplessly on the night of mr endacotts unfortunate decease henry replied i must confess that on the previous evening i paid a surreptitious visit here i had no idea on that occasion of purloining the image but i was anxious to secure if possible a translation of any of the chinese documents which mr endacott was known to possess which might assist us towards the recovery of the jewels i found mr endacott however at work and i was unfortunate enough to disturb him during his brief absence in the garden i endeavoured to peruse his papers but his unexpectedly prompt return forced me on that occasion to abandon the enterprise on the following evening i saw gregory leave the house i came to see if you were still in the garden gregory interrupted turning to claire precisely henry acquiesced but i was not at that time aware of yourerattachment nor did i attribute any sentimental purpose to your nocturnal excursion i followed youand at the side gate here after some considerable interval i heard what i imagined to be a muffled revolver shot i crept from my place of concealment and entered the library mr endacott was lying there quite dead i listened for a moment i was perhaps unnerved i imagined that i heard your retreating footsteps from the anteroom into the courtyard i listened again there was nothing to be heard the image was lying on the floor by mr endacotts side he had probably been examining it prior to his lamented action and the fall of his body had displaced it i considered i decided that your nerve gregory had failed you that having committed the preliminaryermisdeed you had hurried away without the image i accordingly picked it up and brought it home i placed it by the side of the other in my room it has been there ever since i saw the shock which its presence caused you my dear brotheryou too gregorybut i did not think an explanation advisable sir bertram laid his hand upon his sons shoulder my god gregory he muttered i thoughti thought of course that it was you gregory groaned and i he explainedas i knew it wasnt ithought it must be you my god these ballastons major holmes exclaimed with amazed fervour a wonderful halfhour sir bertram had slipped away and was on his knees by madames couch mr johnson whilst every one else was talking confusedly hastened down to the cellar gregory led claire out into the garden in his hand was the paper she had passed over to him the images he whispered lets go and find them they drove in the limousine car still laden with his luggage through the scented darkness back to the hall his arms around her her head resting contentedly upon his shoulder whilst she waited he ran upstairs to the amazement of rawson and the footman who had admitted him and presently returned with the two images rawson met him at the foot of the stairs his face was full of astonishment and piteous appeal you will excuse me mr gregory sir he begged if theres any news gregory staggered past him borne down by his burden everythings all right rawson he exclaimed mr endacott shot himselffound out he was going to die anyway we shall be back all three of us to sleep i may not be going abroad at all get yourself a bottle of wine rawson tell you more about it when we get back another drive which seemed to pass like a dream a dream during which the agony of the last hour appeared to fade into nothingness then the great house again the images upon the library table and a little crowd gathered around mr johnson to whom gregory had passed the paper called out the instructions you press the right eye of the body he directed and press at the same time the inner lobe of the left ear then you move the image forward three times slowly pressing most at the lowest point now then gregory obeyed the instructions at the end of the third movement there was a slight noise inside like the whirring of a spring a ticking began they stood a little distance away suddenly the right eye opened and a stream of what seemed to be red and crystal and green fire came out and discharged itself upon the tablecloth every one drew closer fascinated breathless until with a final whirring the shower ended mr johnson passed his hands over the stones the finest emeralds i ever saw he declared there is one diamond there i wouldnt dare to valuenow for the soul you reverse the process press the left eye and the lobe of the right ear this time after the whirring ended the left eye opened and a slow stream of pink and white pearls fell on to the table the tears of buddha mr johnson exclaimed its the oldest superstition on the river when buddha weeps the tears are pearls again they watched spellbound this stream continued even longer than the other one then there was a little click and all was over the eye slipped back the image seemed to smile in beneficent fashion claires fingers tightened upon gregorys arm without expert advice mr johnson pronounced in an awed tone i wouldnt take less than a million for them they belong to you every stone gregory whispered to his companion she laughed up at him does it matter she murmured chapter xv once more five men from a safe distance behind the muslin curtains watched the approach towards the village inn of the tenant of the great house this time however conditions were different the strip of road lay clean and hard in the grip of a four days frost there were little pools of ice near the pavement the trees leafless and stark stood motionless against the clear sky although it was early in the afternoon the sun was already sinking beneath a bank of ominouslooking clouds mr johnson in thick tweeds and leggings with a powdering of snow upon his coat carrying a gun over one shoulder and a cartridge bag suspended from the other made his appearance coming along the lane from the hall he do be a changed man that for sure mr pank observed and for that matter mr craske put in his wife be a changed woman i mind when she used to come in for groceries for madame always looking a little tired almost sulkylike as though there were nothing in life worth caring about now i do call her one of the bestlooking women in these parts its worth going a mile to see her and mrs gregory together either on horseback or out with the beagles they say the innkeeper began hush rawson interrupted i believe hes coming in mr johnson had hesitated at the corner and glanced at his watch instead of taking the turn to the great house he swung towards the inn and pausing for a moment outside to look down the breech of his gun entered with a cheery greeting rawson at once stood up the newcomer goodhumouredly waved him back to his seat dont let me disturb any one he begged finding a convenient corner for his gun and relapsing into the easychair which had been discreetly vacated by mr craske ill take a warming drink if you please mr pank a wineglassful of sloe gin if you have it and if any of you gentlemen will join me i shall be proud i forgot my flask this morning youve been out along with mr gregory sir rawson enquired weve been after snipe on the mere side good sport but chilly ive shot snipe in china before now but they dont seem in such a hurry as these norfolk devils mr gregory wiped my eyes more than once mr gregorys a fine shot at what i may call the irregular birds the butler ventured snipe and woodcock and suchlike youll pardon me saying so though sir id rather see you at the pheasants ive noticed the last twice that the squires put you at the awkward corners well well mr johnson admitted its a great life this if i could only learn to stick on a horse mr foulds youll have to keep your eye open for another one up to my weight i had to miss a days hunting last week ill do that with pleasure sir the veterinary promised theres a sale at norwich next week ill be over yonder surely mr johnson drank his sloe gin and held out the glass for replenishment good warming stuff he pronounced bytheby you may all like to know that i heard from the squire this morning they found the villa at cannes in great shape and her ladyship has walked a mile every day since theyve been there it do seem wonderful the innkeeper declared a most amazing recovery mr craske echoed to see her lying on that chair month after month no one would ever dream that shed end her days marrying and walking about like any one else theres been amany changes in these parts mr johnson sir since youve come the latter nodded his head thoughtfully there have indeed he agreed one did feel six months ago the grocer continued as though some sort of cloud were hanging over the village what with the poor gentleman as we thought had been murdered and the police acting so suspiciouslike round the place and all the time talk about the hall and the ballaston lands coming under the hammer and you mr johnson not half the cheerful gentleman you are now looking so solemn as though you had something on your mind all the time if one might make so free things have changed certainly mr johnson acquiesced knocking out the ashes from his pipe and relighting it preparatory to departure the ballaston mortgages for instance as every one knows have been paid up to the last farthing and enough left over from mr gregorys little enterprise to keep every one in comfort for the rest of their lives no talk nowadays either of having to sell the old pictures or bits of china that werent heirlooms theres mr henry up at christies once a month looking for missing pieces hes starting a new catalogue the first of the year and the poor gentleman as was supposed to have been murdered found to have shot himself mr foulds remarked that sort of lifted a weight from the place mr johnson took up his gun well he said we certainly seem in smooth water now i am afraid i was rather an unpopular resident at one time mr craske was the only one on us the innkeeper rejoined with a grin as had any complaint he did say when you came as he was hoping for a family man the tenant of the great house turned and faced the little company there was a twinkle in his eyes and a gleam of mutual understanding passed between them well he exclaimed goodhumouredly this is no sort of a place for keeping secrets youll have another health to drink before long i hope good afternoon every one he took his leave and they watched him from behind the muslin blinds as he walked briskly up the lane and entered his domain by the postern gate that do seem to me to be a proper sort of man the innkeeper declared emphatically the end novels by e phillips oppenheim he is past master of the art of telling a story he has humor a keen sense of the dramatic and a knack of turning out a happy ending just when the complications of the plot threaten worse disastersthe new

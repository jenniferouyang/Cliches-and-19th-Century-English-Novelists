the hampstead mystery chapter i in a few seconds the door opened again to admit frederick walcheren leaning on the arm of his cousin philip at first the jury wished the latter to withdraw but he refused to do so is it not sufficient he cried for you to look at this unfortunate man to see what he is suffering and that he is incapable of confronting you alone i refuse to leave him if you insist upon it we will both withdraw this is a court of inquiry not of justice how dare you treat this gentleman as if he were a criminal i am not aware that the jury were doing so mr walcheren retorted mr procter however as he seems ill and you insist upon remaining by his side let it be so it is not however the usual thing for a witness to be examined in the presence of another person i dont care if it is the custom or not replied philip firmly you may commit me for contempt of court if you like but my cousin is too ill to stand by himself and i refuse to leave him very well sir very well replied the coroner tartly if mr frederick walcheren answers the questions put to him nothing more will be said about it frederick did indeed look more like a criminal than anything else his dark hair which he wore rather long for the general fashion was dull and damp with the sweat which agony had forced from him his features were pinched and his eyes sunk whilst his clear olive complexion had assumed a yellow waxen hue the whole man seemed to have collapsed under the force of his grief he did not raise his eyes to the faces of his inquisitors but sat leaning back in his chair with his gaze fixed on the ground and his hands clasped together between his knees rouse yourself if you please sir commenced the coroner and let us have as succinct an account as you can of all you know concerning this distressing affair do you recognise the deceased jane emily walcheren as your late wife yes answered frederick in a low voice speak up if you please the jury cannot hear your replies when did you see the deceased lady last on saturday morning well well what more cried mr procter impatiently tell us all about it where did you see her and when did you part with her and what did you do in the interim we want the whole story and cant go dragging it from you piecemeal say all you know frederick whispered philip it will be so much the sooner over and done with the unhappy young man made a visible effort and said i saw her last alive on saturday morning at the castle warden hotel at about half past eleven or twelve oclock we had just finished breakfast and i left her to have a swim i never saw her again until i came here how long were you away from the hotel i did not return till nearly three that hour was fixed for our luncheon three hours is a long time to be taking a swim what were you doing for the rest of the time i was occupied in the water all or nearly all the time replied frederick but mr procter who had never indulged in a bath but once in his life and that was the day before his wedding when he caught such a cold that he had never ventured into the water since was not to be taken in by so transparent an untruth in the water for three hours sir do you expect the jury to believe that i was in the sea for the best part of the time swimming and doing feats of skill some part of it must be allowed for dressing and undressing myself but the day was fine and i did not care to come out sooner than was necessary i believe i am right mr walcheren in saying that you were only married to the deceased on the friday previous that is the case is it usual for a bridegroom to leave his bride alone for three hours the day after their wedding in order that he may have a swim i dont know said frederick wearily but i did well when you came back at three oclock you found your wife was gone i did was it not rather strange considering that you had gone to the beach that she did not go to the beach also in order to find you at first i thought she must have done so but i searched the beach and the town and finally the cliffs without finding any trace of her and then you returned to the hotel at what time might that have been i am not sure at about five or half past i think with the exception then of a run home for a few minutes you were absent from the castle warden from half past eleven to half past five six hours and all that time you were bathing or looking for your wife i have already told you so answered frederick who saw you during that time mr walcheren what witnesses can you bring forward to testify that it was spent as you tell us witnesses reiterated frederick with a stare how can i bring witnesses from a place where i am utterly unknown i have never been in dover to stay a night before now nobody in the town knows me i have not spoken to an individual excepting a young man who accosted me whilst swimming and a girl whom i asked if she had seen had seen my my wife that is unfortunate remarked the coroner drily now mr walcheren am i right in supposing that your marriage was not conducted very regularly that it was undertaken in fact entirely against and in opposition to the wishes of the parents of the deceased i dont know what the devil business that is of yours exclaimed frederick roused from his lethargic condition by the impertinence of the question everything is my business sir in the pursuit of my duty and if you address me again in that manner i shall commit you for contempt of court i understand further that not only was your marriage with the deceased an irregular one but that you took a false oath in order to procure a licence for it by stating the deceased to be of age when she wanted a year of that time i did if you will have it so said the young man sullenly are you aware mr walcheren that in consequence of your behaviour in the matter your father in law mr crampton altered his will and cut his daughters name out of it of course i knew it who told you of it i forget my wife i suppose mr crampton never informed you of the fact himself not that i remember you did not hear of it in fact until after your unfortunate marriage had taken place beyond recall can you deny it sir i dont know if i did or did not i cannot remember my head is so dazed by the events that have taken place since that i cannot trust my memory in anything perhaps i can jog it for you you took a false oath in order to enable you to marry the deceased whom you believed to be an heiress and it was not until you had brought her down here that you found out your mistake your wife told you of the fact and you probably had a few words on the matter before you left her so suddenly in the hotel its a lie cried frederick vehemently as he sprang up from his chair an action which caused the coroner to dodge behind two of the jury in case his witness might prove dangerous its a lie i tell you we never had a word of misunderstanding between us and if you dare to mention her in that way to me again i will knock your dirty head against the wall for you he would have sprung at the coroner in reality if his cousin had not restrained him frederick frederick for her sake restrain yourself you would not mix up her name or memory with a low row gentlemen of the jury exclaimed the coroner another such insult on the part of that witness and i will put him in arrest for assault you have heard him threaten me the whole case is one of suspicion in my opinion this man runs away with a lady under age whom he believes to be an heiress and the very day he finds out his mistake she is found thrown over the cliffs under every appearance of there having been foul play the witness would have us believe that he a bridegroom not two days married left his young wife for six mortal hours to indulge in swimming that when she was missed he made every effort to find her that he even went along the cliffs where she lay dead and never saw her body but the body lay under the cliffs interposed a juror and the gentleman walked along them he couldnt have found her unless he had descended to the beach thats right mr colly said procter spitefully always interrupt at the most important moments the witness has eyes in his head i suppose he could have looked over if he had been very energetic in his search he would have looked over and what was he doing all that time and is it likely the deceased would have ascended the cliffs by herself in a place where she had never been before you have heard the witness of the landlord and waiters of the hotel to the effect that they never saw the deceased leave the hotel after her husband that she must have been gone almost as long as he was for another witness mr hindes called twice with the view of seeing her and each time she was out now where was she all that time if she were not as is most probable with her husband dr mcoll gave us his opinion that the deceased might have been thrown over the cliffs or she might have fallen over or she might have thrown herself over on purpose now it seems to me highly improbable that a young woman of twenty should tumble over such a place by mistake still less that she should have committed suicide the very day after her marriage but words lead to quarrels gentlemen and quarrels lead to pushing sometimes and a hasty push is a very dangerous thing you know when near a steep cliff i dont wish to bias your decision in this matter in any degree if you find the deceased came by her death by misadventure you will give your verdict to that effect but if you think the circumstances are such as to demand a stricter inquiry you will say so i leave the case in your hands now and i feel sure you will do it justice the jury shambled out of the room and frederick looked up into his cousins face with open eyes that were half mystified and half alarmed philip what does that man mean he cannot no it would be too gross too impossible he cannot mean us to understand that he suspects me me of having had any hand in this misfortune hush fred hush replied philip laying his hand soothingly on the others arm never mind what he says or thinks he is a cad any one can see that in mind as well as breeding let the brute think what he likes he cannot make others agree with him and all your friends will know that you are innocent in the matter as far as the poor girls death is concerned but to be suspected and by a creature like that i who would have given my worthless life for hers a thousand times over my god it is hard philip squeezed his hand i know it it is part of the trial but it will soon be over now here are the jury they have not been long in coming to a decision well gentlemen and what is your verdict demanded mr procter with an unctuous smack of his lips as if he longed to hear them say they considered that there had been foul play in the matter our verdict sir replied the spokesman is that the deceased came by her death from a fall over the cliffs but whether she was thrown over or fell over by accident there is not sufficient evidence to show it is unsatisfactory that your verdict should be undecided said the coroner had you not better reconsider it we are quite unanimous on the subject sir and we would like to add a rider to the effect that some sort of fence should be put along the edge of the cliffs to prevent accidents in future very well if you are agreed it is no use detaining you any longer said procter with an aggrieved air for he had quite made up his own mind that frederick walcheren had killed his wife you have only to sign the papers and end the proceedings as soon as they were set at liberty philip hurried his cousin out of the room for frederick was in that reckless condition that he dreaded what he might say or do to the coroner here they found that the body of poor jenny had already been moved to an upper chamber by the orders of mr crampton and was being prepared by womens hands for its last receptacle that she should have been touched without his authority made her husband furious who has dared to do this he exclaimed wrathfully as he glared at mr crampton and henry hindes i have dared sir replied the father determinedly you stole my living daughter from me but you shall not have her now that she is dead i have ordered or rather my kind friend hindes here has ordered every preparation to be made for the conveyance of her precious remains to hampstead where i shall take her by train to morrow and there our connection ends you have done me all the injury in your power and i never wish to see your face again either in this world or the next but you shall not have her i say cried frederick in a fury she was my wife and i defy you to take her from me dead or alive i shall take her myself to my brothers place in northampton and see her laid in the family vault of the walcherens that is the only place where my wife shall lie she was not your wife exclaimed the old man you married her under false pretences and if you attempt to cross me in my purpose i will appeal to the law to see me righted and give me back all that your villainy has left me of my child by heaven you shant said the younger man as he made a rush forward as if he would have seized mr crampton by the throat if you persist in your intention i will fight you inch by inch old man as you are for the possession of her remains frederick interposed philip restraining him think what you are saying and doing is such wrangling seemly in the very presence of the dead you know what this gentleman says is the truth you did rob him of his daughter and by a fraud in strictest justice therefore she belongs to him now as she did whilst alive but even were it not so cannot you make up your mind to yield your wishes to his think of all he has lost of how little he has remaining and dont deny him this sad consolation of laying his daughter to rest where he can see her grave it is really of so little consequence when you come to think of it and if it is a sacrifice on your part cannot you make it as a little expiation for what has gone before an atonement which heaven may accept for the wrong you did them both be reasonable fred after to day neither you nor her father will ever see her in this world again why deny him the sorry comfort of taking her body home for her poor mother to weep over come my dear fellow yield this little point gracefully i fancy your dear young wife could we ask her would rather choose to lie at hampstead amongst the flowers than in our musty old vault at northampton where you never go frederick gave a tremendous gulp perhaps so he answered perhaps so then to mr crampton take her sir then take my angel back to her own people but let me bid her a last farewell before she is carried away from me certainly certainly said mr crampton shamed out of his brawling manner by the others submission and i thank you for yielding the point but i feel it is my right the only right unfortunately which you have left me philip drew frederick upstairs he felt the less these two men met in the future the better the room where jenny now lay was already set to rights and she was stretched upon the bed clad in fair fresh raiment with her hands crossed meekly on her breast she looked very different poor child from the saucy merry wilful girl who had run away with her lover without giving a single thought to the consequences the women had smoothed her hair upon her forehead her eyes were sunk her mouth pathetically closed and rigid the little perfect nose her lover had so much admired was drawn and pinched almost out of all likeness to itself and the inside of the hands were turning purple her unhappy husband prostrated himself with a cry of anguish by the side of the bed and philip withdrew and left him for a little while whilst he made arrangements for their departure for london he felt that frederick could have no possible desire to remain in dover when jennys body had been removed thence and that the sooner he left it the better mr crampton and henry hindes had decided to remain there till the following day when the sad preparations for their return to hampstead would be completed and philip walcheren was glad to see them leave the bottle and spurs for a hotel where they had arranged to pass the night he accompanied them to the town and when the coast was clear he secured a close carriage and returned to the public house for his unfortunate cousin come dear frederick he said as he re entered the room where the body lay let me take you away from here i have settled your bill at the castle warden and your portmanteau is waiting us at the station the the other things there i have arranged with mr crampton to take away it is best that we should return to london at once and is this the last last time that i shall ever see her asked frederick in a tone of unutterable woe on this earth my dear cousin yes replied philip and it is just as well the sight can only increase your misery in a very short time the undertakers will be here to do their work why not spare yourself the extra pain of watching them and after they are gone what will there be for you to gaze upon a box of wood be a man my dear fellow and say good bye to her oh philip philip if you only knew what that word costs me it is like dragging my very entrails out to pronounce it i do know it but it must be done better now than before strangers good bye good bye my angel cried the young man as he kissed the corpse from head to feet dont forget your wretched husband in the land you have gone to but remember he has but one wish left on earth to join you there good bye my only love no other woman can ever take your place with me i dedicate the rest of my unhappy life to your sweet memory oh philip how can i tear myself away from her you have forgotten to take this frederick said his cousin drawing off poor jennys fatal wedding ring and holding it out to him it is yours by right to keep for her till you meet again sacred and inviolate exclaimed frederick as he pressed the pledge of their married love to his lips my god hear me swear that this ring shall keep me faithful to my darlings memory for ever that with it i pledge myself to fidelity and virtue as long as my life may last and god has heard the oath said philip solemnly come frederick the carriage is waiting at the door do not prolong this trying scene any more shall i see anybody asked his cousin in a fearful manner as they gained the outside of the door at last shall we encounter either of those men again crampton or hindes i mean or those dreadful creatures who wanted to accuse me my god philip he continued stopping short of what was it they wanted to accuse me of nothing nothing frederick replied philip soothingly you must not think of it again it is the business of a jury to make everything look as black as possible and they never think of the pain they may inflict by their unworthy suspicions try and forget it with all the other incidents of this most trying day you will meet no one unless it be the people of the house you may take my word for that just put yourself in my hands and i will manage everything for us both frederick was only too thankful to be relieved of all responsibility for he was utterly worn out with grief and incapable of thinking or acting for himself so he clung to the arm of his cousin who hurried him into the carriage and off to the railway station before he hardly knew where they were going but as they neared london he roused himself sufficiently to ask their destination i intend to take you to my house first replied philip cheerfully for you are not fit in your present condition to look after yourself nor would i allow you to go back alone to your flat in nevern mansions in our house you shall have a couple of rooms to yourself and marion will take care that you are undisturbed when you are better you shall decide what to do at present you must resign yourself into my hands frederick pressed his cousins hand and murmured thank you without making the slightest objection to the plan he was indeed too intensely miserable and worn out to care about anything and when their journey came to an end he allowed philip to do with him exactly as he chose chapter ii a telegraphic message early in the day had told mrs walcheren the time to expect them and warned her to keep herself and the children out of the way so that when the travellers arrived in kensington gardens square they encountered no one but the servant who opened the door to them and frederick was conveyed to his apartments without meeting another soul two rooms adjoining one another had been prepared for his reception and as he cast himself languidly upon a couch he stretched out his hand to his cousin what you have done for me yesterday and to day philip i shall never forget and can never repay i think you have saved my reason god bless you for it to hear you say that my dear frederick is more than sufficient to repay me for any trouble i may have taken on your behalf but now will you not try to take a little refreshment and rest have a warm bath it is ready for you in the next room yes i should like to have a bath said frederick with a distorted smile although that beast procter did seem to imagine it was impossible that i should care to go into the water water is about the only luxury i could never dispense with and i feel so dirty with a heavy sigh all right then go at once replied his cousin everything is prepared for you and dont be afraid of meeting anybody you are as much alone on this floor as if you were in your own flat no one will come near you unless you ring and for to night i shall wait on you myself how good you are to me said frederick as he went into the bathroom when he came out again with the taint of death as it were washed off him he found a tray awaiting him with a basin of strong soup and a decanter of sherry and philip insisted upon his taking some refreshment before he dressed himself anew his portmanteau had been unstrapped and a fresh suit of grey tweed laid out for him to put on but unfortunately it was the one which he had worn on saturday morning and the sight of it made him break down weakly again as people will after having sustained a prolonged nervous strain my darling my darling he sobbed how little i thought when i left you on that fatal morning that i should never see you again except except come frederick take your soup and drink a glass of sherry you neednt be afraid of two or three glasses for it is the oldest in my cellar and you know i am rather a connoisseur in wine never mind dressing yourself again there is no occasion your dressing gown will be far more suitable and then you can lie down comfortably on the sofa you must be sadly in want of rest yes i do feel rather tired replied frederick as he drank several glasses of the generous wine and lay down as his cousin directed him and i almost think that i could sleep a little i suppose one does go on sleeping and eating as long as one lives even if one has lost everything one cared for in the world he added with a wintry smile well then i will leave you for a little while and see my wife and children said philip taking no notice of his remark try and compose yourself rest will do you more good than anything else and i will be with you again in an hour sooner if you care to have me and will ring your bell no no go to marion said frederick in a drowsy voice i have been trouble enough to you already and philip seeing that he was really inclined to rest left him to himself of course his wife had much to hear and he to tell of the unhappy scenes he had passed through and an hour slipped away before he went up to his cousins room again he opened the door softly and peeped in frederick was still lying on the couch in an attitude of extreme exhaustion he was breathing heavily and catching his breath in his sleep sobbingly as children do whilst ever and anon a half muttered word showed how grief pursued him even in his dreams philip watched him for a few moments and then withdrew and left him to his slumbers heavy as he knew the awakening must be frederick needed strength above all other things in order to bear what lay before him physically he had never been a very strong man and his dissipated life had further tended to undermine his constitution so that his cousin had feared for the effect of so violent a grief upon his health when he descended to his family again he found the party augmented by the arrival of father tasker who had come to hear what news marion had received from dover philip welcomed him warmly you have come in the very nick of time he exclaimed but i felt your good angel would direct your footsteps hither frederick is far more resigned than i hoped to see him but then he is so exhausted at the present moment that one can hardly judge i left him asleep on the sofa in his room it is the first time he has closed his eyes since this terrible calamity overtook him say rather my son since this great blessing was vouchsafed him for i fully believe that this visitation dreadful as it appears at first sight is simply the voice of god calling to his unhappy child to repent and be saved i believe you are right father said philip for his sorrow has already made a great change in frederick he swore before me on his dead wifes wedding ring to pledge himself to virtue and fidelity for the rest of his life i am sure he regards her death as a species of punishment for his former sins may he continue to do so replied the priest but such feelings are but too often evanescent if we are to take advantage of this softening on his part philip it must be while his memory is still fresh his feelings yet lacerated we must strike whilst the iron is hot or with time and forgetfulness his heart may harden as did the heart of pharaoh and this salutary lesson be lost i do not think his sorrow for her loss will soon pass father i never remember to have seen frederick so prostrated with grief before i believe this poor girl must have been as he says the one love of his life to the exclusion of the church and his religious duties my son yes perhaps so but those are the very loves that the lord is jealous of that he will not permit and so cuts off in order that we may find our joy in him alone stay to dinner with us father said philip eagerly poor frederick may be glad to see you later on and you can direct his thoughts to these great truths marion my dear the father will stay with us i know let the servants know that he will do so philip peeped once more into his cousins apartments before he descended to the dining room only to find him still sleeping though brokenly and it was not until dinner was concluded that he ventured upstairs again but then his worst fears were realised frederick had woke up with strength renewed by his temporary relief to the full horror of his bereaved position his cousin found him prostrated on the couch in an agony of suffering during which he was calling upon the almighty to put an end to his existence or to give him back that of which he had so cruelly robbed him frederick this is blasphemy cried philip in a tone of horror gods will is not to be altered by mans ravings your wife is in his keeping has that thought no power to calm your transports would you have her back again even if you could in this world of pain and disappointment yes i would i would returned the young man a thousand times over do you suppose that my darling can enjoy even heaven without me whom she loved so tenderly no no she is weeping for me as i weep for her you told me yourself that you did not believe that she was happy oh my love my love would god i might have died for you or with you frederick father tasker is below would you like him to come up and speak to you he can make the reason of such things clearer to you than i can father tasker exclaimed frederick no he will only talk to me of submission and obedience to gods will and make me more miserable i cant submit its no use telling me to do so and i cant see gods love in the matter either i can only see hard heartedness and cruelty and utter indifference to my trouble i have only one wish left to die too and join my darling wherever she may be if you were sure of joining her certainly that would be the easiest plan out of it all but frederick father tasker will tell you the best way the only way by which you can hope to join your wife when your time comes believe me he has no intention or desire to wound you by any allusion to your trouble unless you desire it he has come to see you only as a friend who deeply sympathises with your pain let him come up then replied frederick in a muffled voice and in another minute the priest entered the room whilst philip discreetly remained downstairs father tasker went up to the couch where the stricken man still lay and kindly laid his hand on his god bless you my son and comfort you he said how can god comfort me demanded frederick he will not give me my lost wife back again not in this world but is this world all we live for at the best we are here but for a few short years whilst the next will last for all eternity had you the choice of fifty years spent with your late wife frederick or fifty thousand which would you prefer how can you ask me when you know she was the life of my life father you have heard so much of my loose style of living that you may think my love for her was like the rest but it was no more to be compared to them than light to darkness i loved her i loved her all the other feelings i have ever experienced for women look like horrible nightmare dreams or flimsy shadows beside the strong deep passion she evoked in me i should have become a better man for her sake perhaps even religious like philip who knows the possession of her the knowledge of her love for me made me feel so grateful that i might have ended by loving god in very gratitude for what he had given me in her and now now it is all over it is not all over my son it has but just begun frederick raised his swollen features to gaze with astonishment in the priests face i mean what i say love cannot die your wife is gone from your mortal gaze but she still exists and her love exists with her and now is the time for you to show the world if you did love her or not i am not questioning your passion for her earthly body i understand she was very beautiful and such things take a great hold on mens fancies but her body is no longer here for you to lavish your affection upon what are you going to do for her soul were i a good man i would pray for it but who would hear the prayers of such a sinner as i am besides my darling was infinitely purer and better than myself she can have no need of my prayers that is to say then that she was not mortal for all mortals have need of each others help besides if she had no need of your prayers have you none of your own ah father you touch me on the raw there i have felt even since i comprehended what the awful news they brought me meant as if it were a judgment upon me for my sins as if the lord had taken my innocent darling in his exceeding wrath at my past wickedness in his love not his wrath interposed the priest gently but frederick did not heed him ever since i lost her he went on with the tears streaming down his cheeks i have done nothing but think of rhoda berry and that girl down at southampton and other certain black marks on my unhappy life but is god so hard as that can he have stricken down my angel by so cruel a death just as she was happy with me because i have made a beast of myself why her and not me i was the sinner i should have been the sufferer and you are suffering greatly my son but it is a suffering which may result in exceeding joy why did the almighty not take you instead of your wife the girl whom you led to fly in the face of her parents and to err greatly on that account i think i can tell you he was too gracious to cut you off in the midst of your sins without giving you a chance of reparation and by taking her instead he has left you behind to pray for the salvation of her soul frederick that poor child is even now holding out her pale hands to you through the gates of purgatory and saying husband it was you who led me astray it is to you i look to release me from these purgatorial fires show your great love for me by dedicating the rest of your life to this pious purpose so that when i have risen i may join my prayers to yours and requite your goodness by praying for you this poor girl was not of our faith she was a heretic so much the more does it behove all those who loved her to entreat the blessed mother of god to use her interest with her son in order to gain her salvation if you love her frederick as you say you do now is the time to prove it come back to the church you have deserted and spend your future life so as you may meet your wife again when your time comes to leave this world you mean said frederick that i shall give up my fortune to the church as my godfather intended i should do well if you will use it in masses for the repose of my poor darlings soul you may have it it is worth nothing to me now my life to all intents and purposes is over i do not mean only that replied the priest i do not think that the church would accept your money without yourself but you must not forget frederick what was your sainted mothers wish and aim she designed you her favourite son for the service of the church she educated you for that purpose but as soon as you were left without her counsel and guidance you abandoned your studies and elected to go your own way but the church has never given you up she considers you still as her child and disciple and is ready at any time to welcome you back into her ranks a very few more months of study would fit you to pass the necessary examination for ordination as a priest is it no inducement to you to know that in that capacity you might offer the mass every time you celebrated it for the repose of your wifes soul that you would live as it were in the presence of god pleading for her and for your eternal re union if you really desire her everlasting salvation if you long to meet her again and in a state of bliss if you regret your past life and desire to lead a purer one in the future you will take it up where you dropped it at your mothers death and fit yourself for eternity i do wish all that you say cried frederick whose body was sorely weakened and whose mental calibre had never been too strong for his love of vicious courses in the past proved the weakness of his moral character i care nothing more for money or the pleasures that money bring and i have but one desire to be assured of my darlings happiness and that we shall meet again hereafter oh father if these things are to be gained by my entering the church let me do so as quickly as i may for if you do not find me occupation and distraction i shall go mad the holy church will take care of you my son said father tasker as he rose to leave the room she will envelop you with her arms like a loving mother and soothe all your sorrows and your fears to rest upon her holy breast and the blessed mother of god who is weeping tear for tear with you every moment will rejoice so exceedingly to regain her lost child that she will do her utmost to reward you by the salvation of your wife whom she will accept as her child too because of her great love for you you could not have chosen a truer means to ensure the happiness of both you will live my son to call this sad time the most blessed of all your life but meantime i must live without her cried frederick relapsing into a storm of grief not without her replied the priest but with her in spirit every hour this is where our blessed faith comforts us exceedingly over those of less favoured people they talk of the communion of saints but act as though the dead once removed from our sight had no more part nor lot with mortal flesh but we know that this doctrine is erroneous else what would become of our many instances of saints and angels appearing to men after their demise the dead so called are not beyond the reach of our prayers and our tears they hear us and see us and pray for us and it is our blessed privilege to ask their prayers as in the case of your sainted mother who has doubtless wearied the throne of god with her entreaties on your behalf now about to be so mercifully and almost miraculously answered or to give them ours as in the case of your young wife who will in after years rise up and call you blessed for what you have done for her as you have cause to call your dear mother i am hers and the churchs for evermore exclaimed frederick in a fervour of exaltation as he stretched forth his hands and clasped those of the father only tell me what to do and i will do it take a day or two to think over the idea my son and then if you are still of the same mind i will speak to my old friend canon bulfil on the subject and see if he cannot receive you into his college until you are ready to pass for holy orders i am persuaded that a few months study is all you will require to regain what you may have lost and then and then exclaimed frederick with raised eyes and clasped hands i shall offer the blessed mass for the repose of her soul every day five and six times a day if they will let me do so i shall tell them that they cannot give me too much work if it kills me so much the better it will send me all the sooner to her he remained in this mingled state of despair and hope for many days to come and it was whilst in this condition that philip walcheren and the priest took advantage of him and persuaded him to give himself and his fortune to the church not that they entertained the slightest idea of fraud or chicanery in doing so on the contrary they honestly rejoiced in their success believing that they were securing the salvation of his soul and the commendation of their superiors in the faith they were both good men in their way and earnest to promote the cause of the catholic church and their religion we judge our fellow creatures too hardly in this world on the supposition that what is good for tom and dick must necessarily be good for harry a protestant can see nothing but idolatry in the worship paid by a catholic to the image of his patron but he is quite blind to the fact that when he exclaims with horror if one stands on a ginger bread covered bible in order to increase ones stature he practises the same idolatry in another form the catholic regards the protestant as a heretic because he does not bow his head at the elevation of the mass but when the catholic church forbids her children to kneel in prayer with their protestant brethren she is as openly contemptuous of their faith as she believes them to be of hers such extremes are folly and go far to make one disbelieve in the uses of religion at all except as a plea for fighting intolerance has caused more people to forsake the ordinances of their childhood than anything else and those who set the faction going and the flame alight will have much to answer for if the day of judgment which they foretell ever comes to pass both catholics and protestants may do many things which appear intolerant to outsiders and yet act in the most perfect faith and desire to serve god this was how philip walcheren and father tasker acted with regard to frederick they wanted to help him save his soul they thought they saw a way of doing it and they brought all their arguments to bear upon that way and frederick was as tinder in their hands his whole mind was absorbed with the idea that his sins had in a measure brought this awful calamity upon him and that the loss of jenny was due to himself alone he loathed the thought of his past life with its licentiousness and folly he wanted to put it right out of his head to forget it had ever been to lose sight of anything that should remind him of it the idea of a cloister and hard study strange to say held no horror at that moment for this man of the world who had lived his life on race courses and behind the scenes of theatres all he longed for was oblivion and he hoped to find it in the exercise of religion have we not all felt so at times when the hopes of earth were shattered at our feet and we could turn nowhere in the world for comfort it is then and especially when death has removed what we loved best from our sight that we feel as if we must make the heaven for ourselves in which we only half believe that is well enough it is the cry of the human heart for the love of god without which it cannot exist if it could be followed by a realisation of the presence of god the soul would be satisfied and all life changed the burdens of earth would roll off our shoulders as christians bundle rolled off his back in the pilgrims progress and instead of despairing mortals reviling our fate and the almightys ordinances we should be contented grateful children waiting patiently till our father saw fit to call us home but the mistake is to suppose that religious ceremonies designed of men will heal our wounds unless gods balm has dropped upon them first church going is all very well for those who like it but it should never be made a superstition as so many people make it since it was only instituted to do honour to god which mission it too often sadly fails in and god is everywhere ready to be done honour to yet we are too apt to fly to it in our sorrow and believe as frederick walcheren believed that by making a great sacrifice of all his pleasures and making a great sweep of all his sins at one and the same time he would be pleasing god and securing his own happiness chapter iii of all the people who suffered and were destined to suffer from jenny walcherens death the heart that bled the most has been mentioned the least because it bled so silently and unobtrusively poor mrs crampton who can estimate the depth and length and breadth of a mothers love whilst mr crampton had been noisily giving way to his indignation and suspicions down at dover and frederick walcheren had been lapped in despair and henry hindes had been compelled to hide his dastardly dread under an assumption of friendly concern she had been bowed beneath the weight of her sorrow at home it was so hard to believe it her jenny whom she had never parted from since she was a little baby at her breast she sat passive silent and incredulous in her darkened room trying to realise that jenny would never come home again except in her coffin her husband had wired her to say that he and mr hindes would return on the tuesday evening bringing that with him which was all that was left of their daughter the poor stricken mother could not believe it she tried to make herself do so she kept on talking to aunt clem about jenny of her childhood her wilfulness and her beauty but still the tears would not come and the poor heart was unrelieved i wish i could cry clem she said pathetically i wish i could cry but whenever i think it is coming a great hard lump seems to rise in my throat and drive it back again i fancy i should feel better in my head if i could cry talk to me clem of when she was a little girl she was a sweet little girl said poor aunt clem mendaciously a little fond of her own way perhaps but very loving and obedient oh no clem not obedient i think replied mrs crampton but always loving i remember when she was a baby how i used to look at her and wonder if she would ever grow up to be a woman i had lost so many of them you see clem five darlings buried one after another until i was quite afraid to grow fond of a baby for fear it should be taken from me i can never forget those burials they used to tear my heart in two and bury a piece of it every time i went to see the two first buried those were little john and edmund you know clem but afterwards i couldnt bear the sight it seemed so hopeless my having any children until my jenny came so different from all the others who had been sickly little creatures but she was so fat and bonny that the doctor said to me well youve got a thriving child this time mrs crampton and yet it was many years clem before i dared to spend my whole love on her i felt as if she were to go too that i must die and yet you see she has gone and i can sit and talk about it to you and do not even cry it is very strange i am afraid there must be something wrong with my head and she passed her hand in a puzzled manner over her forehead as she spoke oh my dear sister exclaimed aunt clem whose own features were almost indistinguishable from the effect of her tears do try and cry i am sure it would do you good it has not done you any good clem replied the poor mother besides we may expect her home at any moment now and john has never been very patient of my tears i should not like to meet them i mean him with my eyelids swollen it might upset him for we must be very quiet over it you know clem it is a very solemn occasion is everything ready for her reception yes dear i have arranged they shall carry her into your boudoir it will make the room more dear to you afterwards ellen bradshaw helped me to remove the ornaments and drape the tables in white and decorate the room with flowers i think you will like it when you see it dear at least i have done my best i remember said the mother in a monotone how averse i was to call her jane john would have it so because his sister jane had only died a month before her birth but i thought it such a plain name i had set my heart upon calling her ethel after the heroine in thackerays story of the newcomes but her father said it was romantic nonsense on my part and he would have her nothing but plain jane but mrs sellon stood godmother to her so she was called emily also after her ah well with a heavy deep drawn out sigh it doesnt signify now does it hark exclaimed miss bostock changing colour as the sound of carriage wheels was heard slowly advancing up the drive what is that mrs crampton rose trembling they both knew but too well it was the funeral coaches which they heard coming back from the station where they had been ordered to await the nine oclock train let me go cried mrs crampton wildly rousing herself from her apparent apathy for the first time let me go to my child my jenny i must be there to meet her but miss bostock held her back dear dear ellen she said pray dont go down stairs till john has come to fetch you there is so much to be done yet stay here quietly theres a dear till the arrangements are complete bradshaw promised to meet john and tell him where they were to carry her dont make a scene in the hall you know how he objects to any publicity a scene in the hall clem said mrs crampton in a voice of surprise and when i am going to meet my own child and welcome her home i dont understand you let me see though isnt she married didnt she marry that mr walcheren or is it a mistake it must be a mistake clem or why should she come back to us my pretty jenny the beauty of hampstead as they call her how glad i shall be to have her home again good god cried miss bostock in an agony of terror her brain is going john john she called out over the banisters come here quick to ellen she is very ill the mournful cortge had by this time entered the house and deposited their burden on the white draped table in the boudoir on the ground floor the coffin had been temporarily closed but the undertakers who had met it at the station unclosed it again and jenny walcheren lay revealed placid and immovable under her fathers roof mr crampton hearing his sister in laws appeal and thinking his wife had fainted ran upstairs at once but was surprised to meet her on the landing with a strange look in her eyes but an unmoved countenance as she extended her hand to him john she said in a muffled voice our jenny has come home i heard her enter the house take me down to see her without delay oh john whispered the terrified aunt clem it will kill her ought she to see her i believe she is going out of her mind with grief poor soul and well she may replied mr crampton as he looked into his wifes staring eyes but let her come the sight cant make her worse than she is come ellen he added affectionately come and see your lamb then god has taken her from us nelly but there is no help for it and railing wont bring her back again come and see how peacefully she sleeps he led the bereaved mother downstairs and into the boudoir as he spoke the servants who had been gazing tearfully on the remains of their young mistress withdrew respectfully as they saw the approach of their employers and as they entered the room mr crampton closed the door behind them the most expensive coffins that dover could produce had been procured to convey poor jennys remains to hampstead and there she lay in a white satin lined shell enclosed in a polished oak sarcophagus heavily clamped and ornamented with brass mrs crampton had had her jenny before her mental eyes all day dead indeed but plump and filled out as when she had parted with her she was prepared to see a corpse but a corpse that was only a marble likeness of her child and when her husband reverently and solemnly lifted the cambric cloth that hid the features of the deceased and she perceived a little shrunken and fallen in body with a pallid face looking half the size it used to be and flattened hands with purple nails and palms she drew one gasping breath and gave a scream that echoed and re echoed through the mansion that my jenny she exclaimed that my child my daughter oh god be merciful be merciful and dropped upon the floor in a dead faint miss bostock who was sobbing at the sad sight before her as if her heart would break flung herself down in terror beside her prostrate sister john john she cried it has killed her i told you it would dont say that clem exclaimed the unhappy man for if i lose her as well i shall have nothing left to live for go and send william for dr sewell at once where is mr hindes said miss bostock did he not travel with you yes but he would not enter the cedars there was no need and he feared to intrude on our sorrow at this sad home coming but he did everything for me whilst at dover and worked night and day in my behalf to save me trouble i can never repay him for all his goodness but send for sewell clem and tell bradshaw to come here and help me carry poor nelly to her room she must not come back to her senses here mrs bradshaw who was the house keeper appearing at that moment they lifted the poor mother between them and conveyed her upstairs and when she came to herself again and remembered what had occurred a violent burst of weeping relieved her overcharged brain and rendered her grief more natural and consequently less acute the sad days which succeeded until that of the funeral arrived were spent in silence and gloom in a darkened house where meals were prepared as usual but never touched and even the domestics spoke with bated breath and went about their work with red rimmed eyes the preparations for the interment went on and were conducted without the slightest regard to expenditure mr crampton felt a melancholy pleasure in determining that it should be the most magnificent funeral that had ever taken place in hampstead and be succeeded by the most magnificent monument that had ever been erected over so young and insignificant a girl he would have an inscription on it he said to himself that should hand down her cruel story to posterity and be a standing shame against frederick walcheren forever more and all hampstead sympathised in his ambition if jenny had not been an universal favourite during her lifetime she became so upon her death the girls who had been jealous of her unusual beauty and the admiration which it excited were shocked at her sudden removal from amongst them and the young men were as deeply moved everyone sympathised with the unfortunate parents who had lost the hope of their old age and when the day of the funeral arrived there was hardly a household in hampstead who did not send a wreath of flowers to place upon the bier and a representative to swell the crowd about the grave mr cramptons city friends too turned out in large numbers to pay their last token of respect to his daughter so that the line of carriages seemed unlimited and the cemetery was filled with spectators mr crampton had purchased a large plot of ground in the principal avenue with the intention of making a garden round the grave and here assembled on that beautiful august afternoon old and young rich and poor friends and strangers to see his lovely daughter laid to rest in the warm bosom of her mother earth all but the man who humanly speaking had caused all the trouble but who was about to expiate it by a sacrifice greater than anyone else would have thought of dedicating to jennys memory amongst the chief mourners and standing next to old mr crampton was henry hindes clad in a suit of the deepest black and with a face the colour of ashes the bystanders even those least well acquainted with the principal performers in the tragedy remarked that he seemed to suffer as much if not more than the father did he did not weep so openly as poor mr crampton said a woman who had stood near him but he shook so violently that i could see him do it and when the clergyman came to the part of dust to dust and ashes to ashes mr hindes swayed as if he was going to fall into the grave i was quite frightened i thought every moment that he would faint ah well replied her companion he is one of the firm you see and a great friend of the family i daresay he has known the poor girl ever since she was born i wonder who the cramptons will leave their money to now some one told me that this is the last of their family and the sixth child they have lost and they have no heir left itll be a nice pot of money for whoever gets it they are reported to be as rich as crsus mr crampton said something of the same thing to henry hindes that evening as they sat together in the library at the cedars the old man had insisted upon his friend accompanying him home and the latter had not known how to refuse with any grace why i want to speak to you my dear hindes is this said mr crampton as they sat in the gloaming together you see it behoves me now to make a new will everything i had was to have gone to my poor girl that is after her mothers death but thats all over now in fact everything is over for me and i dont fancy i shall last long myself you mustnt say that my dear friend replied hindes in the strange muffled voice he had adopted of late and which he attributed to a bad sore throat you are hale and hearty and have many years of life i hope before you yet and when this this terrible event has somewhat faded from your memory of enjoyment also no hindes no i am too old a man to forget so easily you see it is not as if it were the first nor the second and it has given me my death blow i am certain of that we men dont make so much noise about our troubles as the women do poor things not that they dont feel as keenly perhaps but their tears are their salvation now people to have heard me talk over this business might have thought maybe that all i cared for was my revenge on the scoundrel who stole my pretty one from me but it isnt so only the other feeling lies too deep for words but i am sure of one thing and that is that my wife there will outlive me and that it wont be so long either before shes a widow now of course shell be provided for amply and her sister into the bargain but two women of such quiet tastes and habits can never use one half of the money i have to leave behind me and who are they to leave it to when they die they stand alone in the world of course i had meant i had intended to leave my jenny more than half of it thats what ive been working for all these years but as it is here the old man stopped and leaning his head on his hand pressed the burning eyeballs which refused to shed tears but let his dry heart feed upon itself my dear friend interposed hindes do not pursue this torturing subject to night i entreat you think of the trial you have already gone through and have some pity on yourself no hindes i wish to say what i have to say to night and i am quite equal to it i must see throgmorton my solicitor about my will to morrow without fail for the next day i intend taking my wife and her sister to scotland for a change but i will be as brief as i can i mean therefore to alter my will with respect to the names but not to disposition of property to my wife and her sister i shall leave for their lifetimes the half of my fortune and the other half my poor jennys share to you to me exclaimed henry hindes starting from his chair no no it is impossible the very idea is horrible to me i will not take it mr crampton gazed at this sudden eruption in mute surprise but why not you my dear hindes he said after a pause you are the best i may say the nearest and dearest friend i possess and now that shes gone your children are the only ones in whom i feel any interest i can never thank nor repay you for all you have done for me during this sad time i do not mean to offer you my fortune as a requital only to show you how deeply i have felt your goodness to me and how truly i value your friendship and the love you felt for my poor girl i cannot take it it is impossible gasped hindes as he nervously swept his brow over and over again with his handkerchief i know you are rich enough for every ordinary purpose my dear fellow but wealth is never unwelcome even with our combined fortunes you will not be a rothschild and even if you were you have three children to spend it on and may have more if you absolutely refuse to be my heir i will make little walter so you will not refuse to let me benefit your child to pass on to him that which was intended for my own i would rather not indeed repeated hindes walter will have plenty the idea of his being your heir is painful to me surely there are members amongst your own or your wifes family who would be thankful to be remembered by you and need your kindness more than my children do mr crampton looked puzzled and a little vexed he had wished to show his appreciation of the hindess affection for his dead daughter and his partners determined refusal of his offer wounded him it is not pleasant to have an intended kindness thrown back in ones face but all he said was you have disappointed me i am sorry said hindes spasmodically but it took me by surprise it is more than i deserve at your hands i feel as if i had no right to accept your bounty people might think it strange they might begin to question what could they question what right would they have to think it strange demanded mr crampton querulously have i not a right to dispose of my money in my own way come hindes if it is not to be you it must be your son so i give you fair warning and you can divide your own money amongst your children as you choose but little walter will be my heir will take the place of my poor murdered jenny whether you like it or no i will give throgmorton the necessary directions to morrow my god my god groaned hindes below his breath my poor friend i know you are feeling this trouble almost as much as myself continued mr crampton that is what has endeared you so to me since it occurred i wonder what that fellow walcheren who has been the cause of it all is thinking of at the present moment if he has a conscience by jove i dont envy him the possession of it say what you will hindes i shall always look upon him as her murderer if he didnt push her over the cliff which i am half inclined sometimes to believe his carelessness was the real cause of it why did he leave her alone such a wild thoughtless heedless creature as she was plucky to a fault and ready to dare anything why wasnt he by her side either to defend her against the villain who assaulted her or to save her from her own wilfulness oh sir pray do not discuss the matter any more at least to night said hindes in a voice of abject entreaty suppose you found out the truth how could it alter matters now try to think that no one was to blame that it was the will of heaven and that no no hindes i cannot think that replied the old man her death may always be shrouded in mystery but god never designed so young and beautiful a creature to die so foully there is some villainy at the bottom of it and i have not done with it yet for if ever i can discover the real author of the mischief i will kill him with my own hand i will if he proves to be a prince of the blood royal henry hindes did not answer for a few minutes and then he said in a low voice have i your permission to go home mr crampton i am not well and this conversation has upset me it is all too new too fresh my dear friend it will not bear discussion yet if you can do without me i should be thankful to try and procure a little rest at home we have to be early at the office to morrow go then hindes by all means i am afraid i am sadly selfish but it is a relief in such cases to have a friend to unbosom oneself to god bless you for all you have done for me i could never have gone through that ceremony to day if you had not stood by my side i will go up to my poor wife now and see what i can do or say to comfort her he grasped hindes hand as he spoke and the two men separated for the night hannah was anxiously expecting her husbands return she knew his emotional nature and how he suffered after any trial to his feelings she had been suffering through the day very much herself in jenny walcheren she had lost the female friend whose society she had enjoyed the most and her sympathy with the bereaved and heart broken parents was extreme she wept more for their sakes than for her own and she knew that her husband felt for them equally with herself but as he entered her presence she was shocked to see the ravages of grief upon his countenance it seemed unnatural to her that he should mourn so deeply as this as if too something more than grief mingled with his feelings if it had not seemed derogatory to his manhood she would have said he must have become superstitious since jennys death for he seemed to have grown frightened of shadows and to glance about him with a startled air as if he expected to see something that was not there she was a sweet placid tempered woman herself with a strong sense of religion who would never have been alarmed at the idea of any supernatural appearances who did not believe in them in the first place and if she had done so would have said they came of god and therefore could never harm those who believed and trusted in him she could not therefore account for her husbands altered appearance unless indeed there was something in his constitution which unfitted him for resisting the attacks of sorrow and she had always been aware that he loved the dead girl equally with herself my dearest she said as soon as they were alone and he had cast himself upon a sofa you must not give way like this you must not indeed you will make yourself ill if you fret so continuously and you have your work to do remember do leave me alone he answered sulkily its all very well to preach but everybodys not so cold blooded as yourself cold blooded henry she exclaimed oh dont say i am that with regard to our darling jenny i think i mourn her loss as much as you do but you frighten me my dear you can have no idea how altered you have become in these few days you are like a wreck of your former self its enough to make a man a wreck to pass through such trying scenes as i have been doing you seem to forget that everything has fallen to my share from that terrible inquest to this afternoons ceremony mr crampton has depended on me for every mortal detail you would feel like a wreck if you had done as much yes yes dear she answered soothingly for without having seen it all i cannot get it out of my head i have been trying so hard this afternoon to picture darling jenny to myself as she used to be as i have seen her a thousand times and more with her bright merry face and her saucy smile driving those cobs of hers at such a rate through the town without a fear or a care but i cant i can only see that little mournful pale face which i looked on in her coffin with its sunken eyes and closed lips and damn it all cried hindes furiously as he leapt from the couch you have the most ingenious faculty of any woman i ever knew for torturing a man why on earth cant you leave these harrowing details alone what good does it serve to rake them up ad nauseam is that the way to make one forget i cannot stand it any longer i shall go to bed and without another word he rushed from the room hannah was in dismay she did not know what she had said to make her husband so angry with her his irritation raised her suspicions had there been more in henrys affection for jenny crampton than she had ever thought of she was not a prying or curious woman by nature but hindes behaviour was enough to make anyone suspicious the mere idea was a revelation to her never in the whole course of their married life now extending to eight years had she conceived the slightest notion but that her husband cared for herself alone he had never been very demonstrative but on the other hand he had never been unkind and yet when she remembered how very lovely the dead girl was she wondered she had never seen danger in henrys familiar intercourse with her she could not feel jealous of poor little jenny now lying so meekly with her hands crossed upon her breast out in the cemetery but hannah did feel very sorry for herself and less effusive than usual towards her husband yet after all as she told herself it was only a supposition it might turn out to be a delusion on her part but she would watch henry carefully and find out the truth for herself chapter iv henry hindes had passed through the fearful ordeals of the inquest and bringing home and funeral of jenny walcheren with surprising boldness and equanimity never having been betrayed into displaying more emotion than was considered becoming under the circumstances but now that all possible danger was over that all inquiries had ceased and that the dead girl was laid in her grave safe from prying curiosity his nerve forsook him and he was haunted by his own memory the dread which had oppressed him ever since that fatal moment on the cliff was set at rest there was no chance that jenny would bear witness against him from her grave the world had accepted what appeared to be the most natural version of the tragedy that had befallen her and no tongue would reveal the truth until the judgment day he was safe his childrens good name was safe he might sit down securely amongst his lares and penates and comment on the shocking number of murders that were reported in the newspapers with impunity why then did his native audacity take that opportunity to desert him and leave him a prey to his doubts and remorse during the suspense and fear he had endured he had never given a thought to anything but his possible danger he had had no time as it were to grieve over the loss of the girl he loved but now that the danger was past he could think of nothing else but jenny done to death by his own hand had he been a better man the terrible deed would never have been committed and had he been a worse man he would have sat down at this juncture congratulating himself that all had ended so well for him and banished the thought of her thenceforward but henry hindes was neither a villain nor a hero he was common clay like the rest of us and he had loved jenny crampton very dearly he had not realised how much he loved her nor how much he had longed to possess her until the fatal truth was revealed to him by her marriage with frederick walcheren he had seen her blossom into a bonny maiden day by day and knew that her presence pleased and excited him but he had not dreamt that his affection for her came between him and his duty to hannah until her lover came on the scene and she resented all interference between them then he realised what his true feeling for his partners lovely daughter was but subsequent events had caused him to think of nothing but the awful risk he ran but now the worst was over the high tension to which his nerves had been strung for the last few days was relaxed and he had leisure to dwell upon what had occurred and to recognise what his love for the murdered girl really was and to feel that he would give his miserable life a thousand times over if the sacrifice could only bring back hers he saw her as well as hannah but in a dozen shifting moods now she was flourishing her whip at him as she drove clattering down the principal street of hampstead and then she was laughing at some funny story or teasing her parents or himself or pouting her pretty lips because they thwarted her or thanking him with those lovely eyes of hers for the american candies or the illustrated papers or the hot house flowers he had brought her from town but the picture however fascinating always changed to give place to that in which she stood at the edge of the cliff on the last day of her young life defying him with the contemptuous words i hate you i hate you he would go through the scene again and again would hear her mocking voice see her indignant flashing eyes give the fatal push that snuffed out her bright being like the flame of a candle and then stand gazing at the empty space where she had been but a moment before and which now was void and silent in fancy the wretched man would see what hed never seen in reality her slender body falling down the steep declivity dashing against the pointed crags and projections of chalk every instant and then arriving with a dull thump at the bottom and lying on the rough shingles without life or sense or motion in fancy he would cast himself down beside her and entreat her forgiveness by every means of speech in his power would tell her how passionately how truly how devotedly he loved her that he hated and cursed himself for having given way to the impulse that prompted him to touch her and would die a million deaths to restore her bright beauty to life and strength again this was the state of mind into which henry hindes fell as soon as jenny walcheren was buried he went up to his bed that night a shivering craven he had always professed to disbelieve in ghosts or anything supernatural and to condemn those who credited the possibility of their appearance as fools or madmen but now he glanced around him as he entered his own apartment as if he feared to meet the wraith of jenny walcheren lurking in the corner ready to confront and accuse him the hindes had always adopted the foreign plan of occupying separate rooms so that he was alone although his wife slept next him with a door between them hindes wished that night that it were not so for the sense of solitude bore in upon him very heavily yet he did not like to propose seeking her companionship for fear she should guess the agony he was undergoing so he crept into his own bed and lay there sleepless and staring vaguely into the darkness as if he dared not close his eyes lest a ghostly hand might be placed upon his shoulder or a ghostly voice whisper in his ear hannah following her husband upstairs about an hour after peeped into his room to see if he required anything what still awake henry she exclaimed seeing his eyelids quiver as the light of her candle fell upon them are you in pain shall i get you anything no no i am all right all i want is rest and quiet well i will leave you but you forgot your usual visit to the bairns this evening ive just come from the nursery you must have infected wally with your wakefulness for i found him sitting up in bed and crying for his dada wally wants me exclaimed hindes springing out of bed give me my dressing gown i will go to him he is quiet now my dear you need not disturb yourself said hannah but her husband was already out of the room and on his way up to the nursery my wally my wally he thought as he sat with the little boy closely folded in his arms if anything should happen to him if god should be revenged on me by taking my child i couldnt bear it i couldnt it would kill me then he remembered that his friends had more than once said the same thing in his presence and jenny seemed to be standing on the opposite side of the carved cot and whispering as you killed me as you killed me and he laid little wally hastily down again dadas boy will go to sleep now he said to him with a kiss but master wally liked better lying in his fathers arms and was quite cunning enough to know how to get his own way no wally wants dada he replied fretfully and but half awake wicked peoples come out of corners and frighten poor wally wicked peoples what do you mean wally demanded hindes the perspiration breaking out immediately upon his face with apprehension there is no one here to frighten my wally only elsie and laurie sleeping like good little girls in their beds and nursie in the next room with the door wide open oh yes there is replied the little boy oracularly peoples with black faces and white faces and ladies with ribbons good god exclaimed his father with unnecessary fervour what ladies wally not a pretty lady with curling hair oh yes cried the child delighted to have found a theme to build his fables on a boo ful young lady with long hair just like jenny that used to love me and bring me sugar plums dada where is my jenny she hasnt been to see wally for a long long time so he was babbling on in his childish ignorance and cunning combined when hindes suddenly left his side and called the nurse from the adjoining room rosa you must get up and attend to master wally he is very restless to night and cannot sleep come at once and then with a hasty kiss to the child he said nurse is coming darling she will stay with you dada must go now and bolted from the nursery was it possible that jenny had appeared to the boy would her coming portend good or evil surely she could never have the heart to harm the little child on whom all his hopes were set as you harmed me as you harmed me he seemed to hear whispered through the darkness had the man been in his sober senses he would have recalled how many times master wally had invented the most marvellous stories of things which he declared he had heard and seen in order to detain his parents by his side things which they both knew existed only in their little sons imagination but to night the childish fibs assumed gigantic proportions in the eyes of his craven hearted father he lay in his own bed trembling as he recalled how fond jenny had always seemed of wally above the other children how often she spent her money on toys for him and how eagerly the little fellow used to welcome her appearance was it true she had visited his bedside and had she come in love or anger he found it more and more impossible to sleep after this exciting incident so he crept out of bed softly that his wife should not hear him and took a dose of the morphia which he had used before for the same purpose he wished as he drank it that he had the courage to take the whole contents of the bottle and so end his perplexities and regrets at once but he had not the courage for that life was not yet a sufficiently heavy burden to him the world had condoned his offence and there were doubtless many years of peace and prosperity before him and for the sake of wally and the others it was his duty to live on and struggle to forget so he only took a rather full dose of the narcotic and after many moans and groans and restless turnings and tossings on his bed nature succumbed to its influence and he fell asleep when he first woke in the morning he thought he was all right again his long sleep had removed his lassitude and his mind was in a dreamy condition from the effects of the morphia so that he was not in a fit state to worry himself by idle fears or expectations come come he thought as he was dressing this is better i was sure my nerves were unnaturally upset last night if the feeling returns all i need do is to have recourse to my little friend here the worry i have gone through is enough to make any man ill to make him exaggerate matters into the bargain and see everything in its worst light it was an accident which might have happened to scores of people who have not troubled themselves about the matter i am not even sure at this date if i really caused the disaster i put out my hand i know but i could not swear that i touched her she stepped backwards most likely of her own accord and so fell over without any aid from me i believe it was so it is best i should believe it for all our sakes i shall mourn her loss none the less dear darling girl because i persuade myself that it was heavens will and not my hasty temper that caused it his wife was surprised to see the placid humour in which he descended to the breakfast table he did not eat much it is true but all his appearance of despair had vanished until she began to think she must have been mistaken and that his mood of the night before had been due to the cause to which he had ascribed it over fatigue and worry mr crampton being about to start for the highlands that evening there was a good deal to arrange before they parted so henry hindes went off in good time to the city and for the rest of the morning was immersed in business the appearance of the poor father in his deep sables and with his lowered tones and depressed air did prick his conscience a little but the influence of the morphia was still upon him and a few glasses of wine soon dispersed the feeling the first thing which renewed the discomfort of the night before was the fact of mr crampton leaving the office to seek that of his solicitor mr throgmorton henry hindes knew what he was going for and tried to prevent him my dear friend he said in an expostulating voice i hope you are not thinking of putting the idea you mooted to me yesterday into execution you must not indeed you will give me great pain if you do for i neither deserve it nor desire it but the old man would not listen to him my dear hindes i shall tell you nothing about my intentions they are locked in my own breast i do not know but that i shall not take your advice after all my wife as you reminded me has many needy relatives who will be thankful to be remembered in my will but you acknowledge the necessity for an alteration you will come and see us off from euston at eight oclock this evening wont you i know that my wife and miss bostock would be grieved to leave without shaking hands with you i will be there without fail replied hindes as he walked to the office door with his partner what a terrible change in mr crampton sir remarked the clerk who was waiting to speak to him on his return do you think so mr davidson said hindes mechanically think so sir why its the talk of the whole office theres death marked in the poor gentlemans face he wont be with us long sir i feel sure of that i trust you are mistaken davidson mr cramptons going away for change to scotland to night and will not return to business until his health is quite restored i hope it may be sir i hope im sure with all my heart that it may be for mr cramptons been very good to all of us but if you ask me my opinion i dont believe hell ever come back at all well i didnt ask your opinion davidson replied mr hindes fretfully and as mr crampton has the very best of advice i think we may safely leave him in the hands of his doctor oh yes sir of course and i hope i havent said too much but he does look very bad indeed not like the same gentleman repeated the clerk as he went back to his work this little conversation disconcerted henry hindes and his uneasy condition was augmented by the entrance of an old friend a colonel brinsley whom he had known for years my dear hindes exclaimed the colonel as he threw himself in an arm chair you might knock me down with a feather i was on my way here when i met poor mr crampton never saw such a change in any man in my life why hes the shadow of his former self of course ive heard about the sad loss he has sustained but hang it all hindes although it is a terrible thing to lose a child it doesnt as a rule shrivel a man up to half his usual size he is a mere skeleton his clothes hang upon him in bags i never was more shocked in my life she was his only child and he cared for her very much replied hindes in a low voice as he played nervously with a paper knife ah yes yes doubtless and he lost her by some terrible accident or other didnt he what was it some people say she committed suicide but that doesnt seem likely to me only the young people of the present day think no more of taking their lives than of threading a needle how did it happen it was an accident a pure accident said hindes she fell over the cliffs at dover very dreadful no wonder the poor old fellow feels it she was very pretty was she not the beauty of hampstead so they tell me and only married a few days how sad is it true that it was a runaway match it was but i think my partner would rather the matter were forgotten now that she is gone replied hindes god bless my soul hindes you look very ill too now i come to look at you exclaimed the colonel have you taken it to heart as much as that it has been a trying time for everyone concerned naturally replied his companion but i rather fancy my looks may be attributable to my having had a bad faceache lately and been obliged to take morphia to induce sleep it always leaves me feeling more ill than before but it is impossible to keep a head for business without rest true but why dont you try opium by inhalation thats the stuff to make you feel jolly my wife says i shall ruin my health by it but as ive practised it now for twenty years and am none the worse i fancy i shall continue it till i die but only now and then you know only now and then i contracted the habit whilst i was in china where i suffered terribly from ague and fever and it has never quite left me so when i feel a fit coming on out comes my hookah and by jove in a quarter of an hour im ready to dance a jig it must be wonderful stuff said henry hindes musingly its magical in its effects perfectly magical returned the colonel enthusiastically i dont care if its injurious or not i shall never part with my hookah till i die you try it next time you have the toothache my boy and youll thank me evermore but where is it to be procured demanded hindes i thought the sale of opium was prohibited in england so are the sale of several other articles that are in general use said colonel brinsley laughing but wheres a will theres a way you know hindes and thereupon he gave him all the necessary information for purchasing the deadly narcotic and using it as an ansthetic and took his leave fully persuaded that he had done his friend hindes an inestimable benefit chapter v mr cramptons prognostications with regard to himself proved to be but too true he had intended to take his wife and sister in law to a lovely place called fochabers in the highlands of scotland but on the way thither he was taken so ill that it was thought advisable they should stop at aberdeen for the sake of medical advice within a month of which time the old man had an apoplectic fit and died without recovering consciousness the news of this disaster was a fresh blow to henry hindes but the intimation of it was accompanied by such an earnest appeal from the widow that he would go to them and help them in this calamity as he had done in the last that he was obliged to pack his portmanteau at once and start for aberdeen to go through the same painful scenes he had done before mr cramptons last wish was that he should be carried back to hampstead and laid by jennys side so the same melancholy preparations had to be made the same melancholy coming home to be gone through and the same melancholy funeral rites to be solemnised till mr hindes almost thought the former misery must have been a dream and that jenny walcheren was only now being laid in her untimely grave no wonder that he looked ill and distracted people said the high estimation in which he had been held by the dead man was proved by the fact that he had left him half his fortune no not to him perhaps but to his son which amounted to the same thing for what henry hindes had dreaded and tried to prevent had indeed come to pass his late partners will left half his fortune which was to remain in the business to walter james henry hindes the son of his best friend henry hindes the other half to be his wifes for her lifetime and after her death her sisters on the same terms and when both were deceased it was to be divided between the child or children of his best friend aforesaid henry hindes so he was forced to take it to benefit by jennys death to see his offspring in the enjoyment of that wealth which her father had accumulated for her and which but for himself she might have lived half a century to take advantage of hannah was naturally delighted that their old friend had remembered her little son in his will and could not understand why her husband would not hear the subject alluded to however unhappy he may have been made by jennys death still as the dear girl was gone beyond recall she could not see why their darling wally who surely must be more to his father than any friend however missed and mourned should not benefit by mr cramptons generosity the elaborate monument which mr crampton had designed for his daughters grave and had set in hand before he left for scotland was now complete and ready to be erected this task also fell to mr hindes for the widow was incapable of acting for herself and looked to him for everything it was a massive column of red granite lettered in gold it stood twenty feet high and could be seen over all the monuments in the cemetery a second inscription had been added to commemorate the fathers death and a few weeks after mr cramptons funeral the masons having sent hindes word that their work was completed and the monument placed in the cemetery he walked down by himself to see if the orders given had been properly carried out before payment was made he dreaded the task beyond everything he had been alternately fortifying his courage during the last few weeks by doses of morphia pipes of opium and glasses of brandy until he had made himself physically as well as mentally ill but he must go through this trial once he said to himself once and for all for he had left off going to church lately he was too great a coward to pass by the spot where she lay twice every sunday but mrs crampton had commissioned him to see that the monument to her husband and daughter was properly erected so he was compelled to do so he could not afford to neglect the wishes of the widow of the man who had so greatly benefited his son that cursed legacy would bind him her slave for life he entered the cemetery with folded arms and his eyes cast on the ground the plot of earth surrounding jennys grave had already been made beautiful by cartloads of flowering geraniums and other plants transferred from the garden at the cedars and in the centre of them now reared the head of the red granite column henry hindes knew the inscription by heart he had seen it glaring at him through the darkness of the night and had repeated it to himself until it seemed to be written in letters of fire on the tablets of his memory but he had not calculated what it would look like revealed in the glaring light of day calling out as it were by its golden letters to all men to come and read of his infamy he looked up at it and it seemed to blind his eyes something floated before them like a mist that prevented his seeing distinctly and yet the very stones seemed to cry out the words sacred to the memory of jane emily crampton the only child of john crampton esq of this parish who was killed by a fall over the dover cliffs on the th of august in the twentieth year of her age thou god knowest after which was written also to the memory of john william crampton her father who survived her loss only five weeks vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord not a word of her marriage not a mention of frederick walcherens name only those words and quotations which to those who knew the circumstances of the case revealed but too plainly what the friends of the dead girl thought about her mysterious death to the guilty conscience of henry hindes it was almost as if the monument cried out to the whole world to come and read how he had thrown the daughter over the cliff and killed her father into the bargain it terrified and alarmed him he would have liked to have rooted it all up again but he knew it must stand there for ever for centuries perhaps after his own death an enduring testimony to his shame and remorse and disgrace and it was jenny jenny whom he loved who lay there condemning him the unhappy man sunk down on his knees before the red granite column and sighed forth the anguish of his soul oh my darling my darling he groaned within himself you know dont you that i never thought of the awful consequences of my hasty act that i never meant to harm you that it was your unkind words that led me on until i was no longer master of my self you know i didnt want to take your fathers money your money jenny and i would give it back with all that i possess myself to undo the fatal accident of that day for it was an accident my darling you must know that now and how your miserable lover is suffering for his rashness oh jenny if i could only think so if i could only think so he had buried his face in his hands and was unaware of the approach of any one until he was roused by the voice of frederick walcheren demanding indignantly and pray mr hindes may i ask by what right i find you weeping over my wifes grave he had come as privately as possible to see the spot where they had laid his jenny intending to give himself the poor consolation of praying above her ashes for the repose of her soul but to find his intentions forestalled and by the man he so much disliked and distrusted roused all the old adam in him again at the imperious question henry hindes also felt the fighting spirit rise in his breast the instinct of self preservation made him resent the idea that it was anything out of the way for him to be found kneeling on the grave of his friends he drew himself up haughtily and replied i am not aware mr walcheren that this cemetery belongs exclusively to you or that you have any right to forbid my mourning the loss of my friends there are two victims beneath this stone the father as well as the daughter owes his death to your behaviour he has only survived her five weeks my god murmured frederick below his breath and then looking at the inscription he added but why is my name not recorded here why is there no mention that she was my wife whom have i to thank for this insult the monument was designed and the inscription written by mr crampton himself sir before he died replied hindes i dont believe it cried frederick hotly and these texts they are a positive reflection upon me they say as plainly as possible that there is a doubt about the manner of my darlings death that she was not killed by accident but design is this some of your doing mr hindes as well as the suppression of my wifes real name i have already told you that the whole thing is of mr cramptons ordering he did not believe in the legality of your marriage that i know as to the texts he had his own reasons doubtless for selecting them but he did not confide them to me and i have told you that i do not believe you you were in all mr cramptons confidences and a precious bad use you made of your knowledge my poor girl told me as much as that she said several times how much she feared and suspected you she said you were against her in everything that you were always persuading her father to thwart her wishes and refuse her requests and that she hated you for it she jenny said she hated me and to you exclaimed henry hindes it is impossible you are deceiving me we were the greatest friends you may have thought so she did not and i will thank you to speak of my dead wife by her proper name as mrs walcheren cried frederick in a fury you should never have been allowed to call her by her christian name and i forbid you to do so now henry hindess natural impulse would have been to retort by saying that mr walcheren had no rights whatever in the matter and he should call his late friend by what name he chose but his former assertion was still rankling in his memory jenny said she hated me he murmured to himself and to him it was not on the impulse of the moment then as i hoped as i have believed she meant it good heavens she meant it and i i loved her so his face was white as ashes as he turned it towards frederick walcheren we will not quarrel sir he said and especially here i came to the cemetery this afternoon at mrs cramptons request to see if her orders had been carried out with respect to the initialing and erection of this monument with neither of which as i told you have i anything to do but since you doubtless would wish to be left in privacy i will withdraw saying which he made a low bow and walked out of the cemetery but he had left his sting behind him frederick walcheren no longer felt in the disposition for prayer or even tears what is it about that man that makes him so repulsive to me he thought as he found himself alone he speaks fair enough but there is something behind it all that i cannot understand well they have taken care between them that i shall not want to visit this spot too often my poor darling what must she think of their depriving her of the title which made her my wife i was a weak fool for letting them take her from me so easily but i little thought they would insult us both in this manner perhaps it is as well she is my wife no false inscription can unmake her that god be thanked and father tasker says i must wean my heart from all these earthly longings as soon as may be one is squashed at any rate i shall never want to look upon her grave again with those vile texts written beneath her dear name thou god knowest yes god does know that i am innocent of all blame in this matter except of tempting her to leave her home well well it is not to be thought of the sooner i turn my mind to other things the better he stooped down and gathered two or three little blue flowers that were blossoming above jennys remains and kissing them put them carefully between the folds of his pocket book then he knelt down and said a prayer above her and dashing his hand across his eyes turned slowly away meanwhile henry hindes was walking back to the old hall with his heart on fire he had been trying hard to persuade himself lately that jenny had meant nothing by the hasty words she had used to him just before her death hannah had reiterated so often how fond the girl had been of them both and it had pleased him to think that she was right and that when he met jenny again there would be no cloud between them but only the old feeling of affection he had begun to address her in the solitude of his own chamber as his darling and his love and his true wife from whom he had been separated only by the conflicting circumstances of the world but walcherens statement had blown all his airy fancies away at a breath she had really meant what she said it had not been the meaningless outcome of a young girls petulance it was ante dated to the moment jenny had even told her bridegroom of a day of the feelings she entertained against her fathers friend the truth made him feel fierce and wretched and revengeful all at once for the moment he was not sorry that he had pushed her over the cliff and deprived her and her husband of their lifes happiness but this feeling did not last and it was succeeded by a paroxysm of unusual despair in which both earth and heaven seemed to have arrayed themselves against him he retired to his room on the plea of a headache and there indulged in the custom which was fast becoming habitual to him of inhaling opium until his senses were stupefied and all his fears laid to rest he remained alone all the evening and retired to bed without seeing his wife again this was now so much his custom that hannah was beginning to think nothing of it she believed that her husband suffered from acute neuralgia which necessitated his taking a soporific after which it was unwise to disturb him so she walked over to the cedars where she was always very welcome now and tried to cheer up the two lonely women who would persist in sitting down with their grief in their laps instead of doing their utmost to dispel it hannah almost talked them into a promise that evening that they would spend the winter abroad they had never visited paris and she pressed them so hard to have a little pity on themselves that mrs crampton actually authorised her to make inquiries about the best means of getting there and which hotel would be the most suitable for her sister and herself to stay at she therefore returned home well satisfied with her success and feeling she had done a good nights work it was past her usual bed hour when she reached the hall so that after a brief visit to the nursery hannah retired herself she was not very sleepy however so having dismissed her maid she sat down in her room to discuss a new novel that mrs crampton had lent her it was an interesting tale and engrossed her attention to that extent that she pored over it much longer than she had intended she was first roused to a sense how time was going on by hearing a noise as she imagined in the passage outside her door and glancing at the clock on the mantelpiece found to her surprise that it was past two the household must have long retired to rest what then could the noise be which she had heard on the landing hannah was not a nervous woman as a rule but it had sounded so much like voices that she began to fear that some one might have got into the house with the intent to steal she rose therefore and listened attentively a moments consideration showed her that the sound proceeded not from the passage but her husbands bedroom perhaps he was ill and perceiving the light in her room had called to her so she unclosed the door between them and peeped in what she saw there paralysed her into a silent witness she did not speak to him but stood leaning against the door post listening with all her ears she felt her flesh creep as the full meaning of his words riveted itself upon her memory but she did not scream out nor do anything to disturb the speaker henry hindes was in his night shirt sitting on or rather leaning against the side of the bed he was not asleep at least his eyes were wide open but it was evident that he neither saw nor heard anything around him the sweat was pouring off his face and his hair was damp with it but it did not appear to inconvenience him as he stared wildly into the darkness and muttered to himself it was an accident jenny you know it was an accident i did not push you intentionally how could i tell it would cause your death why did you aggravate me so why should you hate me i who love you love you my god dont say it i cannot bear it cannot bear it and to him too my rival the man who stole you from me jenny jenny dont look so dont speak so or i shall push you over the cliff ah she is gone it is done why did i do it why did i do it i have killed her jenny my god this is hell hell hell he glared with his opium laden eyes straight before him and had just sense enough left to catch sight of hannahs white night dress as she stood horror stricken at the open doorway through which a light streamed from her bedroom ah he screamed in terror dont come near me dont touch me i didnt mean to do it jenny it was the devil prompted me to push you have mercy dont haunt me dont haunt me or you will drive me mad mad mad he slid down upon his bare knees as he concluded hiding his face in his hands and hannah had just strength left to withdraw herself and close and lock the door between them she understood it all now her husbands unaccountable grief and sleeplessness and irritable temper he was pursued by an undying remorse and for what oh it was terrible terrible hannah reached her bed but it was only to sink down by the side of it and pour out her soul in prayer for her wretched husband and herself and when she was exhausted with prayer and weeping she threw her dressing gown around her and sat down to consider what she ought to do about the dreadful truth that had been made known to her her husband was a murderer there was no end served by disguising the horrid truth from herself he had pushed sweet darling jenny crampton over the dover cliffs oh how could he have done it how could he have done it their pretty loving jenny it was too awful to think of but it was true she had heard him confess it with his own lips but the idea that she could desert him on that account or deliver him up to justice on his own confession never entered the wifes mind he was hers and she was his for better or worse there must be no treachery between them he had told his secret to the darkness with the darkness it must remain only how ought she to act herself so as not to become a particeps criminis what steps should she take to prevent further wrong to betray henry even if she could have made up her mind to do so would not bring back poor murdered jenny or the old father who had followed her so quickly to the grave but the money which mr crampton had left in such good faith to the son of his best friend wally should not touch it now or ever she would not let her innocent childs hands be stained by the touch of blood money it must be spent on some other purpose it should never go to wally hannah sat and pondered over these puzzles all night how could she do her duty to her husband and children and yet not become a participator in his crime a crime which must under any circumstances have caused a great revulsion in her feelings towards him but when connected with jenny crampton made her feel as if it were impossible for her to live with him again yet if she left him what depths might he not fall to the only hope for him seemed to be in her presence and protection but for her children it was different at all risks she would separate her girls now growing old enough to understand the meaning of most things that took place around them from so tainted a father elsie and laurie must leave home hannah felt as if she could not endure to see him kiss them again or touch them with the hands that had sent their darling jenny to her death she was not aware that her husband had adopted the fatal practice of inhaling opium she attributed the strange manner which he occasionally exhibited to too much alcohol or the doses of morphia which he said he took for toothache she would have borne patiently with all that to whatever lengths he had carried it but what she had heard was beyond the limits of womans forbearance to tolerate her duty perhaps was to remain by him but her children should at all risks be saved from contamination henry hindes came down the next morning looking haggard and stupid and heavy eyed after the fashion of men who indulge too much in any sort of narcotic but he could scarcely have looked worse than hannah who was as white as her gown and trembling with dread of what lay before her henry she said as soon as their breakfast was concluded i wish to speak to you will you come into the library whats up now he grumbled as he followed his wifes footsteps i will soon tell you i have come to the conclusion that it will be better for my daughters to leave home i intend to take them over to my old friend mrs tredgold this afternoon and leave them with her for their education what on earth do you mean exclaimed henry hindes send the girls away are you mad i think not you will understand my reason if you think a little i do not consider that they ought to live any longer at home and if wally were old enough to leave my care i should send him away too i never heard of such an extraordinary thing in my life said her husband who nevertheless was becoming rather uncomfortable under the coldness and decision of her manner so different from the gentleness of hannahs general demeanour what the h l will you do next how long have you arrived at this decision not long she answered passing her hand in a weary manner over her aching brow but this is not all henry the money that mr crampton left to wally the child shall not keep it it must be drawn out of the business at once and if it is useless to try and persuade mrs crampton to take it back again it must be spent in charity no child of mine shall touch it hannah said her husband fiercely catching her by the wrist what does all this mean you have some latent reason for talking to me in this fashion what is it i insist upon knowing i dont think there is any necessity to force me to put my meaning into so many words henry replied his wife quietly but with a fast beating heart as she disengaged her wrist from his grasp the reason is that you have taken to talking in your sleep of late and last night you were so noisy that i opened the door between our rooms and i heard all hindes became as white as a sheet as he stood gazing at her and breathing hard after a long pause he said well and what are you going to do the money must be given up of course she answered as quietly as if they were discussing the most ordinary topic and the children must be removed from home it seems hard but i could not i could not bear to see them playing with you or caressing you hindes groaned and turned away that he had rendered himself an unfit associate for his little ones was perhaps the worst thing he had been yet called upon to bear and you hannah he whispered after a moments pause what shall you do i am your wife henry she answered simply my place is with you you will stay by me knowing all hating all he asked fearfully knowing all and hating all she said softly but not necessarily hating you he crept to her side and burying his face in the folds of her dress burst into a flood of tears chapter vi the town of luton is almost entirely devoted to the business of plaiting straw for hats and bonnets the windows of the cottages are filled with specimens of the art from the finest plait possible for the manufacture of tuscan and leghorn straw to the coarse rustic twist that has been so fashionable of late years the town is consequently full of young women who instead of going to service earn their livelihood by plaiting straw amongst them was rhoda berry who lived with her widowed mother in a cottage on the outskirts of the town mrs berry enjoyed a world wide repute for being what was called in olden times a wise woman but who in these more enlightened days would be spoken of as a clairvoyante by whatever name one chose to call her however there was no doubt that she was a very wonderful woman and possessed occult powers in no small degree had mrs berry been in a position to rent apartments in bond street and to keep clean nails and a courtly manner half the aristocratic ladies in london would have besieged her door for admittance but being unknown excepting to the good people of luton she was fain to be content with the credit they accorded her and the sixpences they could spare in return for the prophecies she made for them notwithstanding the source from which she derived the best part of her income mrs berry was held in high respect and not a little fear by her fellow townsmen and there were few found bold enough to taunt or jest with her on the misfortune which befell her daughter rhoda rhodas story was a very common and a very sad one about a year previous to the time when we first see her she had received an offer from a london house in connection with the firm for which she worked in luton to take up her residence in town in order to do some of the finishing work which was necessary after the straw had been made into shapes she was a particularly skilled workwoman in the department and the salary offered her was double what she could earn at home mrs berry had not wished her daughter to leave her she had foretold all sorts of disasters which would befall her in london but the girl was dazzled by the advantages she was promised and the pleasant life she anticipated leading so she laughed her mothers prophecies to scorn told her that forewarned was forearmed and that she would be very careful to avoid the dangers she prognosticated so mrs berry let her go with a sad heart but she never ceased to lay the cards for her absent child and to foretell a disastrous coming home for her and so it turned out rhoda berry met frederick walcheren at some place of public amusement from which he struck with her beauty followed her to her lodgings made acquaintance with her and pursued it until a fatal intimacy was established between them it was the old game of the moth and the candle the young man thoughtless and dissipated dreamt of nothing higher than amusing himself whilst the girl flattered by his attentions and with all sorts of romantic stories such as the prince and cinderella and king cophetua and the beggar maid floating through her brain believed that love must conquer over every obstacle and fred would make her an honest woman in the end and the end was disgrace dismissal and despair mrs berry was sitting one evening laying the cards for her daughter with a foreboding heart when rhoda rushed into the cottage with wild eyes and incoherent words and a face of crimson which she could only hide in her mothers lap the poor are much better to their relations in distress or poverty or shame than the rich are to theirs they dont hound them down or turn them from their doors or refuse to share their bite and sup with their less fortunate brethren it is only the well bred and well educated and rich people who do such things mrs berry received her daughter back with a good deal of regret she often told her that she was a shame and a disgrace to her and that her dead father would turn in his grave if he knew how badly she had behaved but for all that she kept her whilst she could not work and nursed her through her illness and would have stood up for her against any who had dared to cast a stone at her but as has been said the wise woman was thought to be so powerful and held in such awe by the residents of luton that no one would have risked offending her through her daughter and rhoda was a favourite amongst her young companions also she was a superior sort of girl her father had been a respectable city tradesman who had failed before his death and left his widow and orphan to shift for themselves rhoda had therefore received an education far above that of most of her associates which should indeed have saved her from the fault she had fallen into did we not know that it is a fault which is committed by ladies of every degree though money like charity has the power to cover a multitude of sins when rhodas baby was born mrs berry had unknown to her daughter written to frederick walcheren to inform him of the event and ask him what he intended to do to remedy the wrong he had inflicted on her child his answer was that much as he regretted the unfortunate termination to his friendship with rhoda it was out of his power to remedy it as he was just about to be married to another woman he enclosed a cheque for a hundred pounds with best wishes for the girls health and happiness and hoped she would forgive him for the unintentional injury he had done her some people in the position of mrs berry would have said that mr walcheren had done the handsome thing by her daughter and that she was lucky to have got so well out of the scrape but rhodas mother thought differently she enclosed the cheque in another letter and sent it back to frederick walcheren with an intimation that she could support his son without his help and that she wanted no hush money for her daughters misfortune but she warned him that the curse of heaven was on his marriage and that it would come to no good nor he either when frederick received this letter he was on the eve of running away with jenny crampton and full of hope as he was it still had the power to make him feel uncomfortable but he had paid no heed to it rhoda berry in his estimation was only a girl who had thrown herself into his arms and he thought a hundred pounds was very handsome pay for his amusement if the old woman wouldnt take it that wasnt his fault but he remembered it afterwards he told both his cousin philip and father tasker that whilst he was bending in agony over the remains of his wife he fancied he saw rhoda berry gibing at his misery and rejoicing in it it was the very last thing that poor rhoda would have done she had loved the vaurien too well to take any pleasure in what troubled him but his conscience told him he deserved her scorn and so he fancied she gave it him poor rhoda did not have a very good time with her mother after her babys birth for mrs berry could not forgive her for having so totally disregarded all her warnings against the trouble that loomed in the future for her there was not another girl in luton she declared who would not have declined the london situation after what she had told her but her daughter thought less of her prophecies than strangers did had she not laid the cards for her the very evening before she left home and did she not warn her as plainly as she could speak to beware of a gentleman with dark eyes and hair who would promise her all sorts of fine things but would leave her with a curse upon her back and hadnt everything come to pass just as she had foretold and wasnt the curse sleeping in a cradle at their feet that moment in the shape of a little boy as black as a crow it was the end of november by this time poor jenny had been laid for months in her untimely grave and frederick walcheren was hard at work studying for his ordination rhoda berry had returned to her work of straw plaiting at luton and everything went on the same in the cottage where her mother lived except for the little child and her subdued spirits come rhoda exclaimed mrs berry tartly but not unkindly theres that brat of yours crying again take him up do nothings good enough for him i suppose as it wasnt for his father before him my gracious i believe he grows uglier and uglier every day youre as unlike as light and darkness the childs a perfect nigger rhoda did not make any retort she was a fair slender girl of about nineteen with blue eyes and yellow hair a very elegant young woman in appearance but of a sad countenance she raised her youngster in her arms and kissed him fondly he was certainly unusually dark for so young an infant but bore unmistakably frederick walcherens features and complexion have you heard the news said mrs berry mr jenkins has come in for five hundred pounds by the death of an uncle in australia that he never remembers to have heard of mrs jenkins is half out of her mind with joy she couldnt believe me last week when i told her there was money on the road for them she said there wasnt a creature in the wide world that it could possibly come from but im always right the cards never fail me never theres fanny benson pronounced out of danger this morning notwithstanding all the doctors verdicts i met her mother in the street just now and she says shes wonderful been sitting up in bed and eating rice pudding why when mrs benson came to me last thursday crying her eyes out because the doctor had said there was no hope i told her it was all nonsense and there was no death in her cards nor nothing like it i wish youd let me lay the cards for you rhoda its ages since ive done so no no mother cried the girl shrinking backwards i would rather not really but why not asked mrs berry who was very proud of her gift of second sight and could not bear to hear it discredited you know how right they came before you went to london if youd followed the cards then youd never have had that young crow upon your lap now and ive never laid them for you with your own cutting since dont you believe in them rhoda oh yes mother perhaps it is because i believe in them so much that i dont care to see them laid for me troubles come soon enough without our knowing them beforehand and if you were to tell me anything unpleasant that i should lose my baby or have some other trouble i dont think i could bear it mother not just yet im so eaten up with disappointment already my poor girl said mrs berry compassionately you mustnt mind all i say about that little crow rhoda he reminds me too much of your misfortune thats why i speak short of him sometimes but bless you i wish him no harm nor will he come to harm either hell live to be a man and a comfort to you yet i can read that in his face thank god for it replied the girl as she lifted the babys brown hand to her lips and kissed it fondly i know hes a disgrace mother but it would kill me to part with him now hes all ive got left of fred i dont know that my girl ive dreamed some strange things about that fred as you call him lately thats why i want to lay the cards for you that marriage of his hasnt turned out well i feel sure of it though weve heard nothing of him since the letter he sent me to say it was coming off hes in trouble of some sort as sure as he lives i can see so much by the influences round the child and i verily believe its death not for him mother cried rhoda quickly if its not for him its very near him but if you wont cut the cards i cant say more your fate and his are so mixed up that i cant read one without the other very well mother i will cut them replied rhoda as she laid her boy in his cradle and seated herself at the table you make me uneasy when you speak of fred so and i shall not rest till i know the worst mrs berry produced her favourite pack of cards which had been laid for all the inhabitants of luton and having withdrawn some from the pack directed her daughter to cut and shuffle the remainder and lay them on the table in three portions with their faces downwards as she raised and dealt them out she went on rapidly with her reading there he is you see she commenced pointing to the king of clubs as black as the little crow yonder and i was right theres death round him if it hasnt come its coming and its for his wife not for himself see how he counts to the marriage ring in the lap of death theres no escaping it for him one way or another shuffle them again my dear and cut as before rhoda did as she was desired and her mother scrutinised the cards attentively theres trouble around him as sure as he lives and danger threatens him very nearly danger mother what danger exclaimed the girl in a voice of alarm not illness or death my dear so you neednt look so frightened but he seems to me to be surrounded by a net of some sort as if there were people about him who are trying to take advantage of him to rob him perhaps or to entangle him in difficulties he is full of perplexities i dont like the look of this fair man who is mixed up with him hes an enemy of his and has done him or will do him a great mischief hes been a bad man to you this mr frederick walcheren but he ought to be warned against those who are about him and especially of this fair man or he will get into more trouble still mother said rhoda timidly do you really think that fred has behaved so very badly to me he never promised to marry me you know he never mentioned such a thing i dont say that i didnt think of it and hope for it perhaps but it was very foolish of me to do so how could he have married me he comes of a very high family i have heard and under any circumstances i am not fit to be his wife of course i should have thought of that before and weighed the consequences of my weakness but then mother you see i loved him and fred loved me in his way so we were equally to blame cannot you think of this trouble as you would if two children had gone out to play together and the weaker of the two had fallen down and cut himself whilst the stronger came back safe and well we were equally thoughtless and equally wrong why should fred be blamed more than i because i have brought the worse trouble on myself she looked up shyly to see how her mother had taken her argument when she saw to her surprise that mrs berry had sunk back in her chair in a trance she was not alarmed for it was an usual thing for her to pass under control but it struck the girl with a sense of awe presently her mother sat upright and addressed her in her ordinary tone of voice if you love this man she said gravely you must try to save him in a few days it will be too late he is about to imprison himself for life to deliver up his will his mind his very senses into the keeping of others and he will be miserable under the discipline you will not be able to dissuade him from his purpose now but your visit to him will have a good effect dont worry him about your own troubles only ask him to pause before he delivers himself over body and soul a prisoner for life his wife has passed over he thinks she died by an accident it was not an accident there was a man mixed up with it not very tall and rather stout with light hair plainly parted in the middle blue eyes a straight nose and a pleasant smile he is very particular about his hands and nails he has been your lovers worst friend and her worst friend he he he pushed her over here mrs berrys control took flight and she yawned once or twice and opened her eyes have i been asleep she said as she met her daughters startled gaze yes mother replied rhoda who was much excited and you have been telling me the most extraordinary things who was it demanded mrs berry paul or daisy i dont know said the girl in a bewildered manner i never asked but they said i mean you said that is whoever it was said that fred is in great danger of some kind and i must go up to london and warn him to be careful and his wife is dead you were right and they said something i couldnt understand about someone being pushed over somewhere and they described a man who is freds worst friend i dont know how but i am to warn him against him and oh mother may i go to town and see him she concluded with glistening eyes i dont half like the idea rhoda replied mrs berry what should you go thrusting yourself into this mans way again for he may quite misconstrue your motives the girl drew herself up proudly no mother he could hardly do that i would not let him do that besides fred is a gentleman remember if i go to warn him and ask him to consider before he takes any important step he will know i only do it as a friend and his poor wife is so lately dead too please mother do me more justice than that i know child i know but when there has once been such intimacy it is hard to break through or forget it however if the controls urge you to go go you must do you know where mr walcheren is now no but i know his flat in nevern mansions and doubtless i can find out his present address there i wont say anything for it nor against it rhoda but you mustnt take the child i wont have my daughter calling at a gentlemans house with a baby in her arms remember who your dear father was and dont make him turn in his grave poor man no no mother replied rhoda as if such a feat were possible but im afraid it will be such a trouble to you if i leave baby behind me you mean you think ill smack the little crow as soon as your back is turned no my girl im not quite such a brute as that though the sight of the little rascal does make me swear sometimes but its only for your sake rhoda ive no spite against the poor innocent baby after all isnt he yours before anyone elses and arent you the only one i ever had to call my own no my dear whatever happens well stick to the little crow you and i and bring him up between us and be mother and father both to him and so saying mrs berry lifted her little grandson from his cot and held him to her heart oh mother mother when you talk like that you do make me feel so happy exclaimed poor rhoda as she embraced mrs berry indeed i know what a trouble and a shame ive been to you and baby too but i cant help loving him mother never mind what he is and you neednt be afraid ill say anything to fred to remind him of his obligations to me im much too proud for that only if he is in danger and i can warn him i feel its my duty to do so but if i find its a mistake and the lady is living still i shall come straight away again without seeing him its no mistake rhoda shes gone sure enough but ive no idea what danger mr walcheren can be in unless hes got into another scrape rhoda reddened like a rose oh no mother indeed its something to do with men the controls said so its all very misty to me but one things clear that im to go and see him and my visit is to do him good i shant be more than three or four hours gone mother and im sure baby will be good with you for that time so the following day the injured girl set forth with her heart full of nothing but love and concern for the man who had ruined her good name and an earnest desire to return him good for evil how some women can forgive how they revel in forgiving they seem always ready to take their betrayers and traducers back into their loving arms as a mother receives her child at the first note of repentance rhoda would have suffered very keenly at any other time on re visiting london here it was that she had dreamed such delicious dreams and woke up to find them delusions here it was that she had been publicly dishonoured and disgraced and told to go home to her mother and receive her reproaches alone friendless and without protection but she forgot all that trouble now that she was on her mission of mercy to frederick walcheren she went to his flat in the nevern mansions first and found it had been let furnished to new tenants can you she asked timidly of the servant who had opened the door give me the present address of mr frederick walcheren at this appeal the mistress of the apartments came to have a look at her and seeing that she was not a beggar said she had received mr walcherens address for the purpose of forwarding his letters but she did not know if he would receive any visitors i can but try replied rhoda gently and if i cannot see him they may deliver a message for me that is true said the lady and if you are a friend of his you may as well take a packet of newspapers that have been waiting an opportunity to go to him she gave rhoda a large parcel of papers and magazines as she spoke and added mr walcheren is staying at present at canon bulfils college in winters lane southwark thank you very much returned rhoda and then she said wistfully may i ask you madam if the report i have heard of the death of mr walcherens wife is true oh dear yes that happened months ago replied the lady as she closed the door again one part of her mothers revelation was true then and so might the rest be rhoda knew that frederick was a catholic but also that he had been a very lax one as he had been lax in everything else and could not help wondering what on earth he could be doing in a college and whilst sheltered within its walls what danger could threaten him he had been such a joyous devil may care young fellow when she knew him that she could not fancy him mured up in a religious house what sympathy could he have with its inmates what pleasure could he derive from its customs or mode of living however she would fulfil her mission whether her warnings were needed or not it was a long journey down to southwark but rhoda reached it at last and found her way by dint of inquiries to canon bulfils college it was a large red brick building more like a jail than anything else she could liken it to and rhoda felt very timid as she pulled the iron chain which sustained the bell and heard the loud echoes it evoked in the vaulted hall beyond it was answered by a lay brother who demanded in a grave voice what was her business i have come with a packet and message for mr frederick walcheren and wish to see him replied rhoda the man unlocked the massive door and admitted her to a cold looking passage with brick walls unpapered and unpainted what name shall i say asked the lay brother as if he were conducting a funeral say please that i have come from mrs pattison replied rhoda who had ascertained that was the name of the tenant of the flat in nevern mansions after what appeared to her to be an unconscionable delay the man returned and ushered her into a parlour the only furniture in which was a piece of matting on the oaken floor a large table four rush bottomed chairs and a fald stool placed in front of an oil painting of the assumption of the blessed virgin rhoda remembering the luxury in which frederick walcheren used to live and revel in thought it all very cold looking and uncomfortable and precise and wondered how he enjoyed himself there and what could make him stay in a few minutes the door opened and frederick himself appeared for the first moment rhoda did not recognise him his dark hair was cut close to his head he had shaved off his moustache and wore a long black cassock which reached to his heels his face was pale and careworn and darker than usual as he recognised his visitor he gave a slight cry and staggered to a chair rhoda he exclaimed faintly what on earth have you come to see me for chapter vii the girl was almost as taken aback as he was is this you fred she said in a tone of the utmost astonishment what have you done to yourself i hardly knew you but he only asked again why have you come what do you want with me i thought our acquaintanceship was at an end i have not come to ask anything of you fred said rhoda in a reproachful voice i think you might know that without my telling you i am here as your friend only i heard that you were in trouble and i wanted to see if i could be of any use to you thank you thank you he replied nervously it is kind of you to have thought of it wont you sit down rhoda seated herself on one of the rush bottomed chairs whilst frederick took another as far as possible from her what is it that i can do for you he commenced in a stiff voice nothing replied the girl only tell me about yourself is it true that you are a widower i am so sorry for you and why are you living in this place what have you to do with a training college i am here as a probationer or novice rhoda it is evident you know nothing about me i am about to enter the church and become a priest a priest oh fred never you a priest youll never stick to it you will be tired to death of it in three months this prophecy seemed to offend the young man exceedingly the more so as he had occasional doubts whether it might not be true you do not know what you are talking of he returned grandiloquently a priest once is a priest for ever there will be no going back once ordained my fate is fixed for life will there be no getting out of it not even if you thought it right exclaimed rhoda with open eyes certainly not once admitted to the church there can be no leaving her without everlasting disgrace and loss of ones salvation oh fred cried the girl think twice before you take such an irrevocable step you will repent it i am sure you will but what made you think of it what put such an idea into your head the almighty in his infinite goodness replied frederick you have heard you say of my great loss it was that which first brought me to my senses it was so sudden so terrible i could see gods finger of wrath so plainly in it that it mercifully opened my eyes to my true condition do you think then said the girl timidly that god revenges himself on us for our petty thoughtless sins by torturing or cutting off the life of some one we love if you were the sinner why should she have died to bring you to a sense of your wickedness why should an innocent girl be used as a burnt offering for your sins and how can you better matters by becoming a priest are there not plenty of priests is it impossible to show god that you are sorry for the past in some other way rhoda as you truly say you do not understand you have not been brought up in our blessed faith i wish you had then you would know there is no expiation for sin without blood shedding when my beloved wife was taken from me i was nearly mad tell me of her interposed rhoda softly i would rather hear about her than the church oh rhoda exclaimed frederick with the selfishness of grief not heeding how his praises of the dead might sting the girl before him she was so young so loving so beautiful she was the most perfect creature i have ever seen and we had been married only one day when she met with a terrible accident that deprived me of her she fell over the cliffs at dover and was killed on the spot it nearly drove me out of my mind poor frederick said rhoda kindly but are you sure it was an accident i am sure of nothing except that my darling parted from me in health and spirits and that i never saw her alive again she was found at the foot of the cliffs crushed to death some thought she might have thrown herself over but i am sure she did not do that but whether some villain insulted her or tried to rob her and so made her take a false step in agitation and alarm i cannot say no one will ever know the truth now the only thing certain is that god has taken her from me and that i shall never see her again this side eternity poor frederick repeated the girl gently but why should you become a priest because of that it will not bring your wife back to you not in this world rhoda but in the next i need not mind saying to you that i have been a very bad man and led a sinful life you know it only too well my mother intended me for the service of the church and educated me up to the age of twenty with that end in view but as soon as she died and i became my own master i left college and entered the world and you know the bad use i made of my time whilst there i have to ask your pardon rhoda for the way in which i treated you dont dont said rhoda quickly i cant bear it i have not reproached you frederick nor in my own heart have i blamed you i always spoke my mind you know we were very happy whilst we knew each other and thought we cared for each other and if we have had to pay for our whistle let us do so bravely and without any cant i have borne my share without crying out do the same by yours god will accept our secret grief and prayers quite as soon as any public display of regret i daresay you are right replied the young man who however did not like being cut short in his protestations of repentance but to return to what we were talking of my godfather sir frederick ascher who died before i can remember him left me all his property coupled with a hope that i should either enter the church when it would be confiscated to its use or failing that that i should leave it to the church at my own death or endow some ecclesiastical building with it this behest i laughed at and had no intention of obeying until my eyes were so mercifully opened to the sins of which i had been guilty and i saw that the only reparation i could make to heaven would be to do as my dear mother and godfather wished me and become a priest but how demanded rhoda will that repair the wrong you have done in the world it seems to me that it benefits really no one oh rhoda you speak in ignorance said frederick walcheren in right of my blessed office i shall have the privilege of offering the mass for the repose of the souls of those i have loved and injured every day i shall live as it were in the sight of heaven and weary it with prayers for the pardon of my own sins and the sins of those i have led by my example or otherwise into error i shall live i trust blameless henceforth in the eyes of god and men so that when my time comes to leave the world i may be found worthy to join my friends and relatives and to live in the sight of god and angels for evermore and could you not effect these objects just as well by living in the world instead of burying yourself alive asked rhoda drily i could not trust myself to do it rhoda my aspirations are good but my flesh is frail and the temptations of this life might prove too strong for me then i dont see much good in your repentance fred said the girl if you are obliged to shut yourself up to prevent your sinning your abstinence cannot be of much value in gods eyes your virtue will lie in the four walls of your clergy house not in yourself the young man sat silent he did not like the tone adopted by his former friend it was too much an echo of something which he could not drive out of his mind nor his heart is this all you have to say to me rhoda he asked after a pause no fred i came up from luton this morning expressly to see you i heard through my mother you know how that you were in trouble and danger and i see now that both reports were true i couldnt think what the danger might be i was told that you were being entangled in a net that would close round you and deliver over your soul and body into the keeping of others i understand what they meant now when you have become a priest you will no longer be a man you will be a slave obliged to go here or there or do this or give up the other as your superiors choose but it will be all for my good rhoda i am not fit to look after or take care of myself perhaps so but i entreat of you fred not to do this thing in too great a hurry you are not in a fit state to judge for yourself at this moment you are so grieved by the loss of your wife that you have but one wish to give up the world and everything in it and be left to yourself and your own thoughts for ever i know what the feeling is do you suppose that i have not felt it also do you suppose that i do not know what it is to despair of gods existence and to believe that he neither sees nor hears what his unfortunate creatures are doing or suffering you rhoda you but what trouble have you had to make you despair like this the girl turned and looked him full in the face was it possible that he could be so selfish and absorbed in his own sorrows as entirely to have forgotten hers you dont mean to tell me that you cared for me as much as all that demanded frederick with a touch of the old vanity no she answered no i did not care for you as much as all that and if i had done so the time is past for telling you of it let me finish what i was going to say to you be warned by me if you become a priest you will regret it you are not fitted by nature or constitution for such an artificial life neither is your present feeling a permanent one i feel it something tells me so your mind has been upset and you are not capable of judging for yourself dont take the final step without further consideration and tell me one thing do you know a man not very tall but rather stout with blue eyes and fair hair parted down the middle a man with a pleasant smile and manner and who is especially natty about his hands and nails yes yes cried the young man what of him i recognise your description perfectly he is an enemy of yours fred replied rhoda i was told to tell you that he stop cried frederick suddenly who told you mother did last night or some of her controls i told you ages ago you may remember that she has the gift of second sight a soothsayer a woman with a familiar spirit condemned alike of god and our holy church exclaimed her companion excitedly and you bring me warnings and admonitions from such a source away silence i will hear no more of it i sin each moment that i listen my poor friend do you know the danger you run by giving heed to anything you may hear from such a source you are playing with the devil listening to his advice delivering your soul into his hands you must promise me never to have any dealings with such people again or you will imperil your immortal soul but rhoda though deeply attached to the man before her was too sensible a woman not to have opinions of her own and the courage to stick up for them into the bargain not have dealings with my own mother she retorted what will you tell me next i wonder if you dont choose to heed what i say to you its no fault of mine fred but ive done my duty in telling you what was told to me and as for its being wrong i dont believe it if my mothers controls were evil spirits why did they warn me against you before ever i came to london and say that nothing but trouble would come of our intimacy why didnt they tell me that life was short in this world and i had better make the most of it whilst it lasted instead no that was your teaching not theirs but youd like to make out your principles the better of the two you may not take my advice i cant help that but dont set up your own against it for youll only anger me and i came to see you from a pure wish to do you good and with that and a suspicious sound in her voice as if she could not trust herself to speak any more rhoda gathered up a little shawl she had carried over her arm and her umbrella and prepared to quit the room rhoda dont be vexed with what i said replied frederick you did it in good faith i am sure but i must obey the teachings of our most holy church on the subject she strictly forbids all tampering with such knowledge with any communications from spirits of the dead we are taught to regard them with horror as temptations from the evil one and sent in order to lure us to our own damnation yes said rhoda incredulously but i thought that saints in the roman catholic church were often made so because they had seen or talked with spirits of the dead and that the pope called a convocation to decide if such reports were true and if they were the saintship was confirmed that may be correct rhoda but it is very different how frederick began to fidget well you see the reports as you say are confirmed by a court of inquiry and established by the approval of the church so that there remains no doubt of their honesty and you need say no more fred my mother is as much to me as your church is to you perhaps a little more and i have the same faith in her honesty and impossibility of dealing with the devil so that we may cry quits i hope i have not offended you said frederick but i dare not listen to communications from such a source if not actually ordained i am pledged to become a minister of the church and am bound to follow her commands in everything poor fred said the girl compassionately i can do nothing more for you so i had better go good bye believe how i sympathise in your great trouble that i would have saved you from it if i could i dont suppose that i shall ever see you again but i shall never forget you never she held out her hand to him as she spoke and the warm human touch seemed to frederick walcheren like a last farewell of the world he had loved so much one moment rhoda he said tremblingly you said just now that you had had sorrow enough to make you despair what was it was it connected with me you know how you left me she answered colouring surely i neednt remind you of that no no but i thought perhaps i hoped as you had said nothing of it that that that god had mercifully buried the proof of your treatment of me with your other sins i suppose fred replied the girl scornfully your mother wrote me a letter some time ago now i remember but later events have put it out of my head and i sent her a cheque for one hundred pounds for expenses but she returned it to me and said she did not want it and not having heard since you flattered yourself you would never hear again retorted rhoda well you were right you never will good bye but he would not let her go tell me he urged tell me everything dont think because im going to be a priest that i have lost all trace of human feeling is the child alive and well is it a boy or a girl what is the good of my telling you asked rhoda dashing away the tears that had risen to her eyes youll never see him nor will he call you father but since you ask me he is a boy and strong and healthy and i love him dearly is that sufficient my little son said frederick musingly the only child i shall ever have and him i have disgraced god forgive me rhoda you must let me settle some money on this boy before my fortune passes out of my hands he is mine you have no right to refuse me no no i will not have it he shall not take it exclaimed rhoda passionately mother and i have enough for him and he shall never know who his father is dont be afraid but that he will be well looked after he is all all with a sudden break in her voice that i have left in a moment the injury he had done this girl whose existence he had almost forgotten flashed across frederick walcherens mind oh let me make you some amends he cried dont leave me with this remorse tearing at my heart if you do the child and you will come between me and my prayers the money is my own still to do as i will with let me put a thousand pounds in the bank only a thousand pounds rhoda in your name that you may have something to fit the boy out with when he is of an age to enter the world but she shook her head i will not take your money she said i will not be paid for my love then what can i do for you he cried in a voice of despair how can i show you how sorry i am for the past how much i would do to repair it if you wish to make me happier she answered turning so as to face him dont become a priest give up this mad idea you will regret it bitterly if you do not ah fred she continued drawing closer to him i dont ask i dont wish to be anything to you ever again but come back to the world and live in it a little longer before you take a step you can never recall i do not expect nor ask to receive your love i know that has gone from me to the girl you made your wife but if i can comfort you by my friendship and my devotion it will be yours to your lifes end come back and let me try and comfort you for all you have lost i will be your servant and your friend and nothing more so long as i can smooth your path in life dear dear fred you know i loved you let us go away to some distant land together till your grief is assuaged and your mind is more fit to decide upon your future plans she laid her hand affectionately upon his arm as she spoke but he flung it from him as if it had been a serpent woman he cried have you been sent from the devil to torture me and tempt me to forsake my duty leave this hallowed spot go back and wallow in the slough of despond from which i have been lifted are you mad to speak to me like this what hellish design have you in your brain regarding me do you want to drag me down to the abyss with yourself go and never come near me more you have planted a sword in my breast that it will take weeks perhaps months to draw forth again go go dont let me curse you oh god have i not suffered enough without this is it thy will to crucify me afresh sancta maria ora pro nobis and with a look of agonised entreaty at the pictured face that hung above the mantelpiece frederick walcheren crossed himself and fled from the college parlour and rhoda saw him no more she was a little offended and very much hurt to have her overtures received in so ungracious a manner she cried bitterly as she took her way back to luton but she told her mother nothing beyond the bare facts of the case fred was no longer the gay debonnair young man she had given her heart to so much the easier she told herself to forget all about him still as she dreamt over the past she could not but believe that some day she and the father of her child would meet again chapter viii as soon as frederick walcheren had left rhodas presence he hurried to his private study and locked himself in his interview with her had greatly disturbed him for not only had it brought back the past in all its vividness but made him conscious how dear that past had been to him how dear it was still he sat down by the table and buried his face in his clasped hands how plainly he could see all that he had promised to relinquish the racecourse and the cricket field the regattas and the football matches the private theatricals and the picnics and then the midnight revelries the theatres and music halls and dances he had attended and enjoyed with all the zest of youth and health combined was it possible he should never let him live to the age of a hundred see them evermore it was not that frederick mourned the loss of such pleasure now jenny and jennys cruel death were still uppermost in his thoughts and the idea of dissipation of any sort was repulsive to him his passion for the pretty petulant self willed daughter of old crampton had been no chimera of his passing fancy it was an ingrained feeling of his soul a love which he would never forget nor replace to the last day of his life but jenny had now been gone for some months and the fierce desire that had first obtained the mastery over him to kill himself or hide himself for ever from the world was not so vehement as it had been rhodas warnings had affected him chiefly because he felt that they were needed that she was right in saying that he might live to repent the step he was about to take and that he would do well to pause and consider before he made it irrevocable he had bade the poor girl begone and told her she was an emissary of the devil because her entreaties that he would give up the idea of entering the church and go to some distant land with her had taken so pleasant a hold on his imagination in fancy he had beheld himself in the wilds of northern india or south america wandering through totally new scenes and jennys memory becoming fainter and fainter as time went on the picture had been too fascinating he dared not dwell on it and instead he had chosen the cloister and the interminable services and the strict standard of living and seclusion of a priest had he been wise had he been wise in the solitude of his own chamber and to his own heart the young man could not deny that the future held but few charms for him in the violence of his untutored grief he had seized at the first rope held out to him that seemed likely to guide him to a haven of peace he had been willing then to sacrifice everything for the chance of seeing his beloved again to secure their re union to make sure they should not be parted for ever but rhodas searching questions had shown him what was really in his heart and increasing instead of diminishing his discomfort he was terribly afraid he had mistaken his vocation he might make a priest for he was clever and highly educated he would also he hoped faithfully stick to his duty but would he be an honest and conscientious one frederick shuddered when he thought of the answer to that question for his ordination was drawing very near the day when he would take the final vows upon himself was close at hand and after that there would be no drawing back all would be fixed and settled for him after that the rising at dawn to celebrate early mass for the rest of his life the daily services the administering of sacraments the cloistered prayers the grave address the repression of all laughter and jesting and pleasure for evermore and yet his heart had beat faster to think of worldly amusements and merriment and brave companionship as he mused over these things frederick groaned within his clasped hands could he stand it all he thought could he go on for the rest of his life he was only just thirty he might have another half century of work before him in a service so utterly opposed to all his tastes and habits he was still pondering on the subject when a second visitor was announced for him it was his cousin philip who followed on the steps of his messenger well frederick he commenced shaking hands i thought i would not pass another day without coming to see you father tasker tells me you have made such rapid progress with your studies that you are going up for ordination some weeks sooner than was intended i congratulate you heartily your fate is now settled your life for this world and the next provided for what a blessed privilege were it not for marion and the children i could find it in my heart to chuck up everything and follow your example it must be a state of such complete calm and security and happiness the very gate of heaven you lucky fellow do you think so demanded frederick in a melancholy tone think so my dear friend theres no thinking in the matter it is an assured certainty you have dedicated the remainder of your life to the church and in return she gives you everlasting bliss there can be no doubt on the matter from the day of your consecration to her service she will stand security for your salvation what can be more assuring more consolatory the church can only stand security for my everlasting happiness if i fulfil my duties from my heart what about luther and his nun had they not pledged themselves to gods service for ever did that secure their salvation will the church allow they are in heaven at the present moment my dear frederick what put those two unfortunate heretics in your head surely you do not liken yourself to either of them perhaps i am not so good as they were no philip i do not wish to liken myself to anybody but i sometimes fear that i am not worthy of the high calling i propose to take upon myself i find my heart is still too much with the world not sufficiently weaned from earthly things and though my trouble is still so fresh that i have no inclination to mix in the scenes i used to love i am afraid it only needs time to make me enjoy them as much as heretofore my dear cousin before that time arrives you will be folded in the bosom of the church and she will keep you safe from all the dangers you have so mercifully escaped since you turned your eyes once more towards her have no fear once ordained your sacred calling will wrap you round as a mantle and keep you from every harm you will have nothing to do with the world her voice will be drowned in that of god you do not understand me philip if the devil is in my heart nothing will eradicate him my sacred vestments will become a mockery a falsehood i am afraid i have been too hasty in deciding on this i was so mad with grief when it was first suggested to me that i hardly calculated what i was signing my name to but i see more plainly now and i feel afraid this ordination must be put off i will not go up for it with these feelings in my mind it would be a sacrilege philip walcheren now felt really alarmed if frederick once left the college again they might lose him for ever and his money would go with him it was not to be thought of for a moment at all costs the notion he had got into his head must be battled with and overcome but not by force by suasion my dear frederick he commenced mildly these feelings do honour to you they prove your modesty your want of self esteem your high standard of the duties that lie before you but at the same time they are a worse temptation to you than those of the world you were speaking of your thoughts come straight from the devil frederick who under the guise of humility is trying his utmost to dissuade you from pursuing the glorious career you have dedicated your life to even if my fears do come from the devil philip it is better that i should not do this thing without further consideration there is no real hurry next month or next year will do just as well for my ordination i dont think the world will lose much from the want of my ministrations and if i am in the same mind then it is easy enough to carry out my plans if you are in the same mind then oh frederick how you make my heart ache by those words how do you know that god will permit you to be in the same mind then that he will not have delivered you over to the machinations of the evil one that you may not like esau fail to find repentance though you seek it carefully and with tears my dear cousin i beg of you to put all such terrible doubts out of your head at once for they are only temptations sent to try your faith have you not read that often when dying christians are at their last gasp satan is permitted to try them by implanting blasphemous doubts in their minds of the truth of god or christs salvation it is so with you you have been allowed to reach as it were the very gates of heaven and the devil attempts to drag you thence resist him by every means in your power frederick stamp these unnatural doubts under foot and think only of the great good before you and the few steps left to gain it still frederick was unconvinced it will not be good if i find i am unable to perform the duties required of me conscientiously and with my whole heart philip this is not a new fear with me i have experienced it often during the last few months and i cannot believe but that it is sent as a warning i have tried hard to keep such thoughts out of my head but it is impossible when i sleep i dream of the world of the scenes i used to mix in the amusements i engaged in the people i associated with and i wake feverish excited and anxious to see them all again what feelings are these with which to enter the church all temptations diabolical temptations said philip with a look of distress but i cannot help them they are unavoidable replied his cousin and if they continue when i am a priest what shall i do have you any doubt do as i have told you stamp on them as you would on the head of the old serpent himself frederick beware how you give way to such fancies you have been plucked as a brand from the burning you have consecrated your life to the service of our church your prayers to gaining the salvation of your young wife who was hurled into eternity without a care for her soul and at your peril renounce these sacred objects for a mere dream what have you forgotten jenny so soon that you no longer desire to work out her salvation by the sacrifice of your own inclinations have you lost the wish to meet her again purified from the sins which bound you together and free to enjoy heaven in each others company oh no no my poor darling never cried frederick in a burst of remorse you will forfeit it all if you do not fight against this horrible snare replied philip sternly i knew that such doubts were likely to oppress you frederick but i little thought to find you so weak in dispelling them do you suppose that any priests are entirely free from such feelings that each one is not obliged at times to wrestle with the earthly part of his nature and kill the old man within him but where would be their crown of glory without their cross to carry is it to be earned for nothing are the angels to record no deeds of valour on the roll of the martyrs names to counteract the dark plots which might otherwise efface them if you imagined the road you elected to travel was one of roses i am sorry for you i thought you had more sense yes yes you are right i see i have been very weak said frederick as he sat upright and assumed a more cheerful aspect it was a devilish temptation as you say philip the fact is i had been talking with an old friend this morning and it brought the past back a little too vividly the dark cloud has passed again and i feel braver please dont think of it any more but philip walcheren did think of it he made inquiries before he left the college as to what visitors his cousin had received and heard that a young woman had been closeted with him for nearly an hour in the early part of the day so he went straight to father tasker with the story the result of which was that the priest also paid frederick a visit and had a long conversation with him upon the subject philip had told him that his cousin showed such signs of wavering that if he were allowed to converse with many more young women or to renew his old worldly associations there were grave doubts if he might not give up the idea of being a priest altogether and that meant in the estimation of them both not only the loss of his fortune for the church but the loss of himself for heaven so the father used his utmost casuistry to persuade the novice that the feelings he complained of were only so many signs of gods interest in him and that it was because he loved his son so much that he permitted him to be chastised by doubts and perplexities he ran over the old gauntlet of jennys peril in purgatory of her present sufferings which frederick would augment tenfold by any defalcation of his promises to offer the mass daily for her relief and of the probability that if he drew back after he had put his hand to the plough she would be the innocent victim of his defalcation he raked up the old wound now gradually closing till it streamed with blood he made his disciple writhe under his scathing reminders and finally he made him look so mean in his own eyes that the young man was fairly baited into retracting all he had said to his cousin and declaring he had never had any intention of giving up the church or going back from his plighted word the priest however was not satisfied and sought an early interview with his superior during which they decided that for the good of the church and this poor wavering soul frederick walcherens ordination had better take place as soon as possible for which purpose several letters passed between them and higher authorities and the day for the ceremony was fixed for a much earlier date than had been at first intended meantime frederick was silenced but not convinced had he been less sick of the world and its gaieties at the time had his nerves not been so unstrung from the shock they had received he would not have given in a second time so easily but he was too tired mentally to argue the point it was less trouble to say yes than to keep on repeating no and he really did not seem to care which way it turned out so he yielded with a sigh and tried to persuade himself that it was of no consequence that nothing would be of any consequence to him evermore but though he returned to his studies he could not fix his attention on them as heretofore for the face of rhoda berry would come between him and the written page he feared he had spoken unkindly and roughly to her and if so he was a brute the poor girl had never harmed him the wrong had been all on the other side he had never been really attached to her but he had been fond of her during the days of their courtship and he could remember that he had regretted the fact of her birth precluding the idea of his asking her to be his wife he could remember also that he thought her a very intelligent and well read girl and a most interesting companion more interesting perhaps and sensible than his sweet jenny who needed nothing but her own beauty to make all men worship her rhoda was a pretty girl too not quite in his style perhaps for how could he admire blue eyes and yellow hair with jennys big hazel orbs and chestnut locks forever before his mental vision still whatever rhoda was like he had deeply wronged her and she had never even reproached him for his baseness never hinted that he had behaved badly to her or that he ought to be ashamed of himself for deserting her and her child in order to marry another woman it was awfully good of her almost angelic and he could weep tears of blood when he thought of it he said one or two long prayers on her behalf and then returned to his books and tried to banish her from his mind but it was in vain strive as hard as frederick would to fix his thoughts on saint augustine or saint chrysostom or any other of the holy fathers of the church their revered memories had to give way to a pair of tearful blue eyes and a willowy figure bearing a little image of himself in its arms he felt that he could settle to nothing until he had made peace with his conscience by making such amends as lay in his power for the grievous wrong he had done poor rhoda berry hang it all he said to himself after a most unclerical fashion i must make some provision for that child whether rhoda likes it or not i cant make up my mind to give thousands to a church who is as rich as old crsus whilst i leave my own flesh and blood unprovided for but she never even told me the little beggars name and if i write to her for it she will refuse again to take the money well i can settle it on her instead i must see mr sinclair on the subject at once this resolution on his part resulted in his sending a request to his solicitor to call on him as soon as convenient when he received him in his private room i have asked to see you mr sinclair he commenced in order to place a confidence in you you are aware i believe that in a very short time i am to be admitted to holy orders and that when that happens my money of which you have hitherto had the charge will be confiscated to the church i have heard so mr walcheren and frankly i was very sorry to hear it ah well never mind that it is all settled so the less said soonest mended but before the deeds are drawn up in favour of the church i wish to make the disposition of a small portion of my property to an old friend i conclude i am at perfect liberty to do so most certainly mr walcheren you can give or will the whole of it away if you like the money was left absolutely to you for your own use pray dont be persuaded into thinking that you are in any way morally or legally bound to give it to the church no no i am aware of that i make it over of my own free will only i should like to make this little provision first what does my income really amount to mr sinclair i have been such a careless dog that i never made myself master of the amount you have the estate of tetley in shropshire you know mr walcheren which brings in about five hundred a year and forty thousand pounds in consols and from fifteen to twenty thousand in scrip its a tidy little fortune and might be greatly increased by judicious handling im truly sorry to find you throwing it away hush hush man what would the reverend fathers think if they heard you speak of increasing the revenues of the church by such a term and it will be all one you know when i am ordained what good will money be to me then i shouldnt be allowed to spend it if i had it true but is it quite impossible that you may not yet change your mind quite so but let us keep to the matter in hand i need not tell you mr sinclair who have known me through my green sallet days that i have been a bit wild at times and amongst other peccadilloes i deeply wronged a young friend of mine named rhoda berry in fact she she has a little child of mine and it is this child i am desirous of providing for but the mother has refused to take any money from me cannot it be settled on her without any consent on her part most certainly any amount you like provided you are in possession of the young womans full name yes her only names are rhoda berry and she lives with her mother at elm cottage harrow lane luton very good replied the solicitor as he noted down the information and the amount to be settled five thousand pounds replied frederick promptly thats a large sum mr walcheren for a case like this it means a couple of hundred a year remember and which do you suppose wants it most this poor girl who is thrown probably on her own resources for life with a child to keep into the bargain and all through my beastly selfishness or the catholic church who has thousands of benefactors and is rich in every sort of treasure oh i am not blaming you replied mr sinclair who being a protestant would rather have seen the money thrown into the gutter than go to enrich the coffers of the roman church i think you are quite right and doing most handsomely by the young lady most handsomely indeed no money can make amends for sin said frederick sententiously and how is this sum to be settled on miss berry mr walcheren demanded the solicitor in trust for the child or unconditionally on herself unconditionally on herself please i know if she uses it at all it will be for the benefit of the boy keep a note of my directions mr sinclair but dont draw up the deed until you do the two together there will be less chance then i think of my being bothered from either side when you draw the five thousand pounds take it from the sum in consols there will be the less chance of its being missed oh dear how glad i shall be when all this worry is over and matters settled for good and all am i to draw out this sum and re invest it in miss berrys name no put it back in consols it is a lower rate of interest than rhoda could get elsewhere but it is safer and women are idiots about money matters when you write and tell her about my present perhaps you will advise her not to take it out on the chance of getting more interest and sinclair i wish you to have five hundred pounds over and above what i may owe you i couldnt think of taking such a sum mr walcheren it is far too much nonsense you were a good friend to me when i was knocking about town and got me out of many a scrape and i know no one whom i would rather give it to why whats the odds to me i shant have a halfpenny in my own hands in a fortnights time why shouldnt i have the pleasure of making my old friends a little present whilst i can youre very good mr walcheren and i dont say that the sum will not give me pleasure and be very useful to me but believe me when i add that i would rather a thousand times over see it in your own hands this step you contemplate makes me very uneasy it seems so unnatural so sudden it is sudden sinclair but not unnatural in losing my beloved wife i have lost everything and i dont care what becomes of the rest of my life the vocation i am about to adopt is the one chosen for me by my mother and i am only following her express wishes by entering the church it appears unnatural to you because you have never known me except as a wild devil may care fellow up to any pranks and utterly careless all round but you dont know the complete difference a shock like the one i have experienced makes in a man it opens his eyes in a moment as it were to the folly and wickedness of his past life and makes him see that there is only one thing worth living and striving for and that is the next once convinced of that truth there can be no returning to the past existence it fades away like a dream and nothing can content one in the future but hard solid substantial work very true mr walcheren i suppose that time comes to every man after a certain period of carelessness you remember the old song sir each dog must have his day and when the best part of the day is over we all feel if we have any sense that it is time to give up play but you can work whilst you remain in the world mr walcheren and set a good example to your neighbours into the bargain the same axiom that rhoda had hurled at his head though clothed in other words frederick recognised it at once and the recognition made him assume a colder air towards the solicitor no doubt mr sinclair he responded no doubt but we all have different tastes and the church is mine i am afraid i shall have to dismiss you now as the time is getting on for refectory and i have some preparations to make before the bell sounds you will bear all my instructions in mind i am sure good morning good morning mr walcheren i cannot thank you enough for your kind intentions respecting myself for which you know that i should receive your instructions in writing and if i have in my sincere regard and friendship for you said more than i should i hope you will forgive me i had not the least intention to offend i am sure of that sinclair but there are things that will not bear talking of i am fairly sick of life my dear old friend terribly sick and tired of it and one lot is quite as good as another in my eyes my greatest wish is that it may all be over as quickly as possible and i may join my darling girl again he held out his hand to his companion as he spoke and as mr sinclairs eyes met the careworn haggard face of the young man whom he remembered as one of the handsomest most dbonnair fellows about town they became so moist that he could hardly see and grasping the hand offered him firmly he quickly left the room chapter ix the whole talk of the employs in the firm of messrs hindes son late hindes crampton was of the extraordinary change that had taken place in their employer clerks whether they be head or under clerks are shy as a rule of whispering anything so derogatory to the head of their firm as the suspicion that he takes more than is good for him but there was really no other possible reason to be adduced for the condition in which henry hindes constantly presented himself in the office formerly he had been a keen vigorous active man of business always ready to detect an error in the accounts or to make a good bargain for himself and his partner but since mr cramptons death he seemed as if he had lost all his capacity vendors bearing samples of their wares walked in and out of the counting house shaking their heads over mr hindes altered condition and wondering what had become of the powerful brain and courteous manners to which they had been accustomed for so long the cashier declared he might as well take in his books to be checked by a child for all the attention the governor accorded them and the younger clerks affirmed that when they carried a message to the inner office they had to shout at him sometimes three or four times before he seemed to hear them or understand what they were saying had he gone deaf they inquired amongst themselves or was he growing stupid he seemed to be always more or less asleep and when roused to take an active part in the affairs of the firm was not always as good tempered as he might be one lad had given him notice because he said he could not stand mr hindes bullying any longer and this was the more remarkable because the senior partner had ever been distinguished for his urbanity and soft spoken ways with all the younger members of the firm but his office companions were on alfred jones side for the change in henry hindes was too remarkable to be denied he who had been noted for being so well dressed and perfectly appointed who was wont to come each morning to town in a suit of the latest fashion with a flower in his button hole and his white hands carefully encased in well fitting gloves would now lounge in at all hours sometimes disgracefully late in a shooting coat or a rough suit of tweed with sleepy eyes and careless hair looking as if he had just tumbled out of his bed his manner which had had the credit of being so polite even when under the necessity of telling an unpleasant truth that even strangers were warned before they set foot in the office to ask for the senior partner had become curt irritable and sometimes exceedingly rude so that intending customers went away offended and never showed their faces there again mr bloxam who had been cashier to the firm for forty years past and known henry hindes from his cradle used to shake his head and say that the business was fast going to the devil and the sooner they put the shutters up the better the younger men whispered and made jokes amongst themselves and hinted that old harry as he was familiarly termed amongst his employs had been looking at the outside of a whisky bottle and things would go on much better if he would stay at home and leave them to manage the business but these comments naturally never reached the ears of the man they pointed at the unfortunate governor still continued to attend the office and furnish jokes for the lads under him he was little aware of how well he deserved them his gait had now become slouching and he trembled as he walked his hands shook so that it was with difficulty he could sign his name intelligibly and more than once the manager of the bank he lodged his money with had sent over to identify his signature it was so unlike what it used to be he always seemed to be asleep or nearly so he would rouse himself with a start when spoken to and then curse the intruder for having addressed him in so low a tone more than one youth followed jones out of the office because hindes declared he mumbled on purpose to annoy him and he threw a heavy book at the head of a third because on having failed to make his master hear he rang a hand bell which stood at his elbow the office where all had been conducted so pleasantly was now the scene of continual quarrelling and henry hindes bid fair to be left alone in his glory the mans whole appearance had changed his clear keen eyes were bloodshot and dropsical looking his nails were permitted to grow and the skin about them to become irregular he often appeared with an unshaven chin and a limp collar mr bloxam was the only person in the office he ever spoke to and him he took curiously into his confidence playing uncertain notes on him as on an instrument of which he was not quite sure but from which he longed to extract harmony there was a case occupying the attention of the papers just then in which mr hindes seemed to take an unusual interest a man had given himself up to justice for having committed a murder twenty years before and the persons who might have borne witness against him being dead he had provided all the necessary information himself even taking the police to the spot where he had committed the crime and making them disinter the dust and bones that remained of his victim the reason the case attracted particular attention was on account of the length of time that had elapsed since the murder and also that the murderer had been very prosperous and esteemed since occupied a good position in society and had a wife and family to be plunged into disgrace by his confession i cant understand the motive of rayners confession bloxam henry hindes would observe confidentially to his cashier it would never have been found out to the day of his death and what good does the disclosure effect here is a respectable tradesman with a wife and family dependent on him respected by his friends and customers rich and flourishing in his trade and he throws it all away for the sake of confessing his participation in a crime which the world has forgotten ages ago and which he cannot rectify even by swinging on the gallows that is true sir replied mr bloxam but you dont take into consideration that rayners conscience would not in all probability let him keep silence any longer a murder must lie pretty heavy on a mans soul mr hindes i dont suppose he has had much rest at night poor creature however much he may have prospered outwardly and he is an old man too sixty the papers say and begins to think no doubt of meeting his maker face to face with that sin unconfessed my wonder is how he has managed to live through so many years with such a burthen on his conscience he must have led a terrible life hindes face grew very yellow during this exordium but the subject fascinated him as fire is said to fascinate some people and a precipice others until they can hardly resist the temptation to cast themselves down headlong but why should a murder dreadful as it is lie so much heavier on a mans conscience than his other sins look how many murders are committed by most of us we strike a blow perhaps which might have killed a fellow if it had we should have been arraigned as a murderer since it does not we go scot free but the feeling of murder was there all the same we are just as guilty in the sight of heaven why should we vex ourselves about one sin more than the other im not fit to argue the point with you mr henry answered the cashier but theres surely a difference we dont always mean to murder a friend when we hit him if we do kill him even by accident we have to pay the penalty but when a man deliberately injures another knowing it must kill him like this rayner who strikes a fellow creature on the head with a hammer why that was deliberate murder he meant to kill thompson and he must be a thorough bad man to have kept the secret in his breast for twenty years hangings too good for him thats what everybody says but telling wont bring thompson back again thats my argument said henry hindes sullenly rayner hangs himself by his confession and does no one any good except himself sir hell save his own soul maybe by the expiation of his crime however tardy see what a hypocritical life he must have been leading mixing with all sorts of people who would have spurned him with their feet had they known his real character kissing his innocent children and wife setting up for a respectable member of society when hes the lowest creature amongst them all the deceit has been too much for him at last mr hindes and he feels now doubtless that he would rather be standing on the gallows platform as an honest man than keep his place and go on deceiving why he must have been thoroughly miserable no one could enjoy life however wealthy under such circumstances it must have been nothing but a burden to him henry hindes sat for a few minutes musing silently bloxam thinking the interview was over prepared to leave the office dont go bloxam exclaimed his employer rousing himself stay a little longer this subject interests me i feel so much for this poor fellow i wonder if he is in his right mind oh yes sir theres no doubt of that why he remembers everything connected with the murder as if it happened yesterday he described the whole scene to the officers with the minutest details such as a lock of poor thompsons hair getting stuck on the hammer with the blood and his holding the hammer in the flame of the candle afterwards till it was completely cleansed he could tell exactly what the poor fellow wore and mentioned a gold ring he had on his little finger and when they found the bones and dust under the cellar flooring there was the ring amongst them just as he said yes i read that but wouldnt it have been wiser and better of rayner to have kept this secret to the end for the sake of his wife and children he had kept it so long you see and as i said before confession could not remedy the evil he had done no sir but we are not sure you see that he had entirely kept the secret to himself he has a wife and women are powerfully cute about such matters married men dont keep secrets long i can say that on my own authority i know i shouldnt care to have one that mrs bloxam wasnt to find out perhaps rayners wife got at his and had threatened him with discovery it isnt unlikely and then he had better be beforehand with her at this proposition hindes went positively grey but but he stammered i thought bloxam i always have been told that the evidence of a wife cannot be taken against her husband in a court of law ive heard the same sir but bless you if a woman once got hold of a secret like that shed have a hundred ways of bringing the walls of a mans house about his ears without meaning it women cant help gossiping its their nature and if a thing of that sort once gets repeated the police would soon get hold of it i wouldnt trust my neck to mrs bloxams tender mercies i know that though shes a good woman and fond of me in her way but news leaks through women theres no other name for it it leaks through them do you think so asked hindes with a shiver im sure of it sir many a woman has been murdered for gossiping alone they taunt the men with the things they may have done and threaten to expose them till they aggravate them into kicking or beating them to death half the cases of manslaughter come through womens taunts theyre not generous as a rule dont you think said hindes putting a suppositious case that it would have been much wiser for rayner to have gone out to the states or australia and have commenced a new life there under another name he appears to have plenty of money i think instead of making confession that i would sooner leave my wife and children comfortable and fly the country pretend to be lost overboard or to die on reaching my haven lose myself to the world in fact and begin life over anew i am sure that if i did that you you if you did that mr henry exclaimed mr bloxam in a voice of surprise henry hindes recalled to the trip his tongue had made changed countenance to a kind of dull red purplish hue i i he stammered did i say i i must have been dreaming we were talking of poor rayner surely why didnt he take a sum of money and go away and make a new name for himself in a new country did you suppose that i was talking of myself bloxam why should i say such things of myself do i look as if i had committed a a the thing that rayner did and he finished up his sentence with a feeble cackling laugh god forbid mr henry responded the cashier solemnly i knew of course you were speaking of that unhappy man why shouldnt he have fled the country instead sir why because it would have been of no use wherever he went he couldnt have left his conscience behind him and once that was awakened he would have had to confess his guilt whether he found himself in england or australia he might have run away from his wife and children mr hindes but he couldnt have run away from his crime that would have followed him anywhere even to the ends of the earth poor wretch i pity him from the bottom of my heart hed better by far have given himself up to justice at once fancy the life he must have been living for the last twenty years lying down and getting up with the ghost of his poor murdered victim always by his side looking at him with his reproachful eyes and asking him silently what right he had to be eating and drinking and making merry whilst he lay in his unhallowed grave but it was bound to come out at last sir murder always does always does it always bloxam demanded his employer fearfully do you mean to say that no murders have ever been successfully concealed very few sir if any they lie too heavy on the conscience for that why isnt rayner a case in point if any have been kept dark for ever it must be amongst roman catholics for they can ease their consciences by confession and if they receive absolution they are set at rest they have such entire faith in the power of their priests to absolve them from their sins i have a friend of that religion and its wonderful how bright he seems after hes been to confession quite a different creature but if a man were to confess a murder in the confessional the priest would give him up to justice surely said henry hindes oh no he wouldnt begging your pardon my friend tells me that the secrets of the confessional are inviolate no priest would dare reveal them on penalty of being stripped of his cloth what he hears there never passes his lips again not even to another priest i shouldnt like to trust him all the same said hindes human nature is subject to too many accidents a priest might lose his brain and babble everything he had heard i fancy mr henry replied bloxam laughing that he hears so many things good bad and indifferent that he forgets them as soon as he has heard them and he doesnt know the names of half his penitents a catholic may go to any confessor he likes it is his director only that he does not change you seem to know a lot about it said hindes indifferently only what my friend tells me sir replied the cashier but catholics seem to derive so much consolation from confession that i often wonder the practice is not more largely used in other churches will you see the books now mr henry no not now replied hindes in a languid voice im awfully tired but you did not see them last week sir and if youll excuse my saying so it is too long to let them run on without casting an eye over them oh theyre sure to be all right bloxam i can trust you better than myself i hope you may trust me mr henry after forty years service with your honoured father and yourself but still it would be a satisfaction if you would look into matters a little more closely than you have done of late youre not yourself sir if youll forgive my saying so since poor mr cramptons death hindes roused himself directly and sitting upright in his chair pulled the ledger towards him why since mr cramptons death bloxam he said irritably ive had plenty of time to get over that but im not well i havent been for months and i ought to go away go away he continued muttering to himself now whats the matter with these confounded ledgers he stuck his fingers through his hair and stared in a vague way at the rows of figures before him theres nothing the matter sir i trust replied the cashier i can detect no error in them but here are the bills of lading and the accounts of sale for you to compare with the entries mackintosh prome of antwerp sent us five hundred bales of the december order but in consequence of a fire taking place on the wharf they were unable to complete the order oh hang it man take the beastly things back do cried hindes pushing the books across the table and look into them yourself im not well enough my eyesight has failed terribly of late and the long rows of figures dazzle me i trust it all to you all to you do as you think best but dont worry me about it im going home and reaching down for his hat and coat mr hindes stumbled out of his office followed by the winking eyes of the clerks who with their tongues stuck in their cheeks whispered to each other that the governor had got em again but poor old bloxam returned to his desk shaking his head and repeating that the business was going to the devil chapter x henry hindes reached hampstead quite early in the afternoon and his wife met him with a foreign letter in her hand hannah was much changed by this time as well as himself always quiet and refined her manner had settled down into a general melancholy she tried to smile sometimes and to look cheerful for the sake of her little wally whom it was sad to think should be brought up between such a father and mother but the attempt was usually abortive how could she smile whilst memory remained to her but she never mentioned the terrible secret between them to her husband only he could see but too plainly by the expression of her eyes that she never forgot it and it made him nervous and uneasy in her presence they had been as happy as most husbands and wives before and much happier than some but though hannah clung to him through a sense of duty she shuddered if he touched her or attempted to caress her and henry hindes saw it the little girls too being banished from home made a great difference in the old hall elsie and laurie never came back even for the holidays though their mother saw them frequently and their father dared not ask to see them wally too was confined to the nursery whenever he was indoors and if he wanted to see him it was almost by stealth he was obliged to accomplish it so the house which once had rung with childish laughter was very much changed as well as everybody in it and the servants though not admitted to their employers confidence saw and heard enough to make them participators in the fact that something very unpleasant had come between the master and the mistress but on that particular day as hannah met him with the foreign letter in her hand she tried to assume one of her old smiles and to welcome her husband cheerfully here is a letter from arthur henry she said it came by the twelve oclock post just after you had driven away this morning she held out a large thin envelope to him as she spoke and with a species of grunt which was the usual salutation henry hindes accorded her he took the letter and tore it open the contents did not appear to please him heres a pretty kettle of fish he exclaimed the doctors out there say that edith must not pass another hot season in bombay so arthur has applied for furlough and they are all coming home as soon as they can pack up their traps this announcement took hannah completely by surprise captain arthur hindes was her husbands younger and only brother indeed his only near relation who had married a very nice girl from their house some seven years before and taken her out to bombay where they had a family of five children they had visited england once during that period when they had resided for a year at the old hall and now they were coming home again and expected evidently to do the same thing now when they least expected them least needed them coming back so soon she faltered why in one of her last letters edith said they were bound to remain in bombay for at least three years more why doesnt arthur send her to the hills instead does he mention it as a settled thing if you dont believe me read for yourself and see replied her husband as he tossed the letter across the table hannah picked it up and read dear harry youll be surprised but i hope not sorry to hear that we are all on the hop for home again edith has had a nasty attack lately uncommonly like cholera and it has left her so weak that the doctor says i must not keep her in bombay another hot season we thought of the hills at first but he so strongly recommends england that i have applied for my long leave and as all our fellows are here have no doubt that i shall get it i think after all it is just as well we should make a move fanny and hal have grown so tall and thin that they look more as if they had been run up through gas pipes than ever and the last addition has suffered terribly with its teething so we shall be none the worse for seeing dear old england again we shall be there three years so as to settle the elder chicks at school before we return to india how i am longing to see the old hall again and your lovely garden it will be in its spring dress by the time we arrive i hope the son and heir is flourishing and not grown too proud to acknowledge his poor relations under his accession to the fortune that has come to him there are only six months between him and my little charlie they will be nice playmates what a jolly old fellow mr crampton must have been how you must regret his loss our best love to hannah and the girls you may expect to see us home about the middle of april or beginning of may good bye old chappie ever your affectionate brother arthur hindes hannah read the letter through in silence and laid it down well ejaculated her husband you see they are coming and mean to share the old hall with us as they did last time let me see how long is it since they were in england three years isnt it or nearly so and a couple more youngsters in that time artie will have his hands full before he has done still she was silent whats the row now demanded hindes are you going to set your back up against their coming here theres plenty of room all the more now the girls have gone to school the children can have the whole of the top floor they need not inconvenience you henry said his wife slowly they cannot come here cannot come here he repeated reddening what do you mean is the house yours or mine its a pretty thing when you commence to shut my doors against my own relations but they expect to come here and they must they cannot come here repeated hannah decidedly why not said hindes boldly she lifted her eyes and looked him full in the face oh youre there are you he exclaimed dropping his own you want to make what you learnt by your eavesdropping public property you will prevent my brother entering my house and make him curious to learn the reason cause a quarrel between us and drive me into a corner until i let the cat out of the bag thats your object is it a neat way to get rid of me altogether i want none of these things henry she replied but you must act honestly in this matter you must not let your brother and his wife and children do anything for which they may reproach you in after years you must think of an excuse to keep them away they shall not take up their residence here to be brought in hourly contact with to be contaminated by association with with say it out at once retorted hindes angrily let all the world know what you know run up to the house top and bawl it out from the roof that all hampstead may hear the story of your devotion to me why dont you ring the bell and assemble the servants and tell them what a master they are serving a man who is not to be trusted with his own children nor to associate with his brother youve been itching to do it ever since that accursed night you women can never keep a secret i might have been prepared for that from the beginning but mark my words madam the first moment you hint at such a thing you go out of my house and never see your children more theyre my children and i will submit to no more of your tantrums concerning them you only say these things to try and show your power over me but after all what power have you where are your witnesses a man cannot be convicted on the testimony of a nightmare it was a nightmare all these silent accusations of yours are the outcome of your own vivid imagination you have no more power over me than that snapping his fingers in her face and i defy you to injure me i defy you he sank down exhausted in a chair after this outbreak and shook like an aspen the habits he had contracted had robbed him of all physical and moral courage hannah stood for a few moments in silence until he was in a fitter state to listen to her and then she said it is true that legally speaking i may have no power over you nor would i wield it if i had but if you show so little sorrow for what i know to be a fact so little consideration for arthur and his family i will not stay in the old hall to be a partaker in it if you cannot or will not devise some plan by which you can induce your brother to take up his quarters elsewhere i shall leave you to entertain them by yourself i shall go back to my mother and take my children with me the law still permits me the custody of two of them but if you attempt to touch any one of the three i will appeal to its protection and tell all i know in extenuation of my conduct you must accept this henry as my ultimatum i will not remain here to receive your brothers family was it possible that this was hannah hannah who was renowned for her gentleness and meekness and docility her face did not flush as she spoke nor did she show any signs of anger but she stood facing her husband calm and pale but perfectly decided guilt had made a coward of him and he turned from her shuddering and hid his face in the sofa cushion you want to ruin me he murmured no henry no i want to make you regard your past in its true light and to make what amends for it you can what if this terrible secret should ever come out do you wish to involve others in your disgrace would you rather be quoted as having led the life of a hypocrite or that of a penitent man come out come out he echoed how can it come out unless you betray me you need not be afraid of that but god has his own ways of working if it is his will to reveal it no efforts of ours will prevent it but the more persons you have in the house the more risk you run who can answer for what servants and children overhear you are so strange sometimes even in the middle of the day that i hardly know what to think of you you do not seem like yourself or as if you had your proper senses you ramble at such times and are not safe i am protecting instead of betraying you by advising you not to let arthur bring his family to the old hall a grey shade passed over hindes features do i talk much he inquired fearfully do i talk of her what do you do at such times hannah how do you keep the servants out she crossed the room then to the sofa where he lay and sitting down beside him took his head and laid it on her bosom as he felt the warm touch he clung to her as a child clings to its mother in the dark dont be afraid dear she said softly neither servants nor friends shall gain access to you at such times i guard you too well for that should you be downstairs i take you to your bedroom if the fit comes on whilst you are in your own room i lock the door have no fear on that score i will never leave you whilst you are true to yourself he sunk his face lower and lower in her bosom and kissed her arm and her shoulder and any part of her that came within his reach dont leave me dont leave me he murmured my only hope is in you but henry said hannah thinking this a favourable opportunity for remonstrance are you not taking too much morphia or brandy or something for your health you must be careful or you will circumvent the object you have in view i must take it hannah i must i have such dreadful dreams without it i cannot sleep or think or act it is my salvation you mustnt take it from me no no i had no thought of that and if you suffer from neuralgia i do not see how you could go through your daily work without some sort of remedy only morphia is dangerous if taken in too large quantities and you mustnt cloud your active brain or where will the business be how i hate the business he said hannah we have more than enough for our need couldnt we go away together somewhere all together and let me begin a new life out in australia or new zealand in a purer air you would trust me with the children wouldnt you i will be so good darling if you would i will try so hard not to bring any further disgrace upon their name or yours but here life is killing me it is so full of bitter memories bitter associations sometimes i feel as if i could cry on these stones of hampstead to cover me i feel so desperate but in a newer air and amidst new scenes perhaps if you will let me have the children i may forget the tears were running fast down hannahs cheeks by this time the man she held in her arms was no longer the one she had feared and shrunk from and almost loathed in her contempt for months past but the lover of her girlhood the husband of her youth the father of her children and her heart went out with a mighty compassion towards him notwithstanding his weakness and his sin would you come with me he whispered in her ear would you try to forget everything but that once we loved each other very dearly yes yes i would she answered as she kissed his forehead you are right harry we ought to have thought of it before we will leave this country together it is too full of hateful memories for both of us and see if it will please god to prosper us in another land how soon can we start dear how soon can we be ready the sooner the better it cannot be done in a moment replied hindes a business like mine requires time to wind up but i will put it in hand as soon as possible yet on what plea your health henry i am sure it is bad enough for anything mr moreton said yesterday that you looked as if you were in a decline heaps of people have commented on your looks before me i am sure they would accept your state of health as a plea for anything but arthur arthur is coming home said hindes with the old look of fear i will manage arthurs business for you returned his wife with decision i will write to him at once and say that we are very sorry but the state of your health and nerves is so bad that we have been obliged to send elsie and laura away from home and you are quite unequal to standing the noise of children about the house that will be sufficient explanation for everything and soon i hope we shall be far beyond the need of explaining our actions to anybody there will be a great deal to do first you know hannah said her husband the old hall must be put up for sale or to let i wonder what arthur will say to that if you wish to reach the goal you have set before you henry replied hannah you must cease to think what people will say to your decision they have no right to say anything and your anxiety may betray your motive you have proposed this plan very suddenly you had better consider it well before you decide but oh my dear if i saw you trying to purify yourself by leading a newer and better life i should be happier than i ever expected to be in this world we must see about it we must see said hindes as he staggered to his feet but what i am thinking of now is what arthur will say she found it useless to try and lead his mind back to the softening mood which had for awhile possessed it so she let him maunder on in his old style but took care to write the letter to her brother in law before she retired to rest that night captain arthur hindes was very much surprised and just a little put out when he received it which was just as he was on the point of starting for home with his wife and family it arrived too late to enable him to make any alteration in his plans but to spend a long furlough in england on his own account and to live with his brother paying a complimentary sum towards the housekeeping were two different things the henry hindes had appeared so pleased to receive them on the former occasion of their visiting home and the old hall was such a big place that want of room there could never be an excuse for not taking them in i never was so vexed in my life edie he observed to his wife as they read the letter together i had so hoped and expected that the former arrangement would have held good and hannah would have taken all the trouble of housekeeping off your hands youre not in a fit state to be worried about anything just now i feel almost inclined to chuck it all up and go to the hills instead oh no arthur dont do that said his wife who was ready to cry over the disappointment perhaps henry will feel better after a while and able to receive us you see you mustnt forget dear that we are two more in number since we were in england last and seven people are really a formidable addition to any household nonsense my dear the old hall contains about twenty bedrooms and hannah says their own girls are away and with their seven or eight servants what difference should we make especially as you take your nurses im afraid there is some other reason than the one given i cant fancy old hal being nervous or seedy he has always been so jolly and hearty and strong there cant be anything wrong with the business surely oh no not likely but dont you remember artie that when those poor cramptons died hannah told us that henry was terribly upset perhaps he has not recovered the shock yet no my dear im afraid that sentimental explanation wont hold water men dont mourn their partners demise quite so long as all that particularly when they remember their sons so handsomely in their wills let me see how long has old crampton been dead quite nine months if not more hal has had plenty of time to get over that however much it may have shocked him at the time he must have worked too hard at the business thats what shatters mens nerves more than anything but what shall we do arthur when we get home inquired mrs hindes thats easily enough settled dear i see hannah offers to look out for a furnished house near them but it will be best to go a little further off if we are too near there will always be a temptation to run in and out and that will be more distracting to henrys nerves i should imagine than if we lived there altogether i shall take you on arrival to a hotel in london and when we have been there for a few weeks and seen a few sights we will get a cottage in the country somewhere where i can have a little fishing and you can keep your cocks and hens and have a pony carriage to drive about the lanes in oh artie dear that will be delightful i like the idea better that the other i never had you a moment to myself last time we were in england and thereupon mrs arthur embraced her husband so heartily that it was evident that here at least was a happy couple with no secrets between them they reached their native land about the time they had intimated and the first thing they did was naturally to go down to hampstead and see their relatives it was about nine oclock one evening that they were suddenly announced hannah was sitting alone in the drawing room occupied with needlework when the footman showed her brother and sister in law into her presence she rose in the utmost confusion letting her crewels and canvas fall to the ground without noticing it edith arthur she exclaimed nervously oh how you have taken me by surprise i did not think the mail was due till to morrow or next day when did you arrive where are you staying how glad i am to see you but she did not appear glad to judge from the tremulous sound of her voice my dear hannah replied captain hindes henry might have told you the mail was due this morning we reached london at noon and only waited to settle the little ones at a hotel and see their creature comforts attended to before we came on here we couldnt wait till to morrow you know to see you and dear old hal by the way where is he not out i hope no replied hannah in the same timid manner he is not out he never goes out of an evening now but he is in bed he retired quite an hour ago hal in bed at eight oclock exclaimed arthur oh impossible whats come to him i must go and wake him again i never heard of such a lazy fellow in my life he was about to suit the action to the word when hannah stopped him no arthur please dont go you must not wake him indeed he sleeps very badly and is sometimes quite light headed if roused unexpectedly i cannot let him be disturbed captain hindes sat down with a serious face so bad as that he said you quite alarm me hannah light headed what should make him that oh nothing very serious if he is only left to himself she answered trying to smile henry suffers from neuralgia you know and he often takes morphia to dull the pain it always causes a person to ramble and talk nonsense if disturbed but why does he not consult the doctor for this neuralgia asked arthur my wife has suffered very much from it at times but it has always yielded to medicine henry is not much addicted to doctors you may remember replied hannah no he never needed them i never saw a stronger or healthier man than he used to be what is he suffering from what has caused the difference i dont know said hannah shaking her head but he has much gone off in strength and appearance lately you will see a great difference in him when you meet hes been moping i suppose over this crampton business returned captain hindes but now ive come home i wont let him mope any more ill make the old boy come out with me and show me round town we used to have no end of larks in the old days well have them again but now come hannah he added taking his sister in laws hand just tell me the plain truth what is the matter with him end of vol ii colston and company printers edinburgh transcribers

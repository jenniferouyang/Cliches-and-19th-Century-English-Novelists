the red triangle being some further chronicles of martin hewitt investigator by arthur morrison short story index reprint series books for libraries press freeport new york first published reprinted standard book number library of congress catalog card number printed in the united states of america contents i the affair of samuels diamonds ii the case of mr jacob mason iii the case of the lever key iv the case of the burnt barn v the case of the admiralty code vi the adventure of channel marsh the affair of samuels diamonds i i have already recorded many of the adventures of my friend martin hewitt but among them there have been more of a certain few which were discovered to be related together in a very extraordinary manner and it is to these that i am now at liberty to address myself there may have been otherscases which gave no indication of their connection with these some of them indeed i may have told without a suspicion of their connection with the red triangle but the first in which that singular accompaniment became apparent was the matter of samuels diamonds the case exhibited many interesting features and i was very anxious to report it with perhaps even less delay than i had thought judicious in other cases but hewitt restrained me no brett he said there is more to come of this this particular case is over it is true but there is much behind ive an idea that i shall see that red triangle again i may or of course i may not but there is deep work going onvery deep work and whether we see more of it or not i must keep prepared i cant afford to throw a single card upon the table so as many notes as you please brett for future reference but no publication yetnone of your journalism hewitt was right it was not so long before we heard more of the red triangle and after that more though the true connection of some of the cases with the mysterious symbol and the meaning of the symbol itself remained for a time undiscovered but at last hewitt was able to unmask the hideous secret and for ever put an end to the evil influence that gathered about the sign and now there remains no reason why the full story should not be told i have told elsewhere of my first acquaintance with martin hewitt of his pleasant and companionable nature his ordinary height his stoutness his round smiling facethose characteristics that aided him so well in his business of investigator so unlike was his appearance and manner to that of the private detective of the ordinary persons imagination therefore i need only remind my readers that my bachelor chambers were during most of my acquaintance with hewitt in the old building near the strand in which hewitts office stood at the top of the first flight of stairs where the plain groundglass of the door bore as inscription the single word hewitt and the sharp lad kerrett first received visitors in the outer office next door to this old house at the time i am to speak of a much newer building stood especially built for letting out in offices it happened that one day as hewitt left his office for a late lunch he became aware of a pallid and agitated jew who was pervading the front door of this adjoining building the man exhibited every sign of nervous expectancy staring this way and that up and down the busy street and once or twice rushing aimlessly halfway up the inner stairs and as often returning to the door apprehension was plain on his pale face and he was clearly in a state that blinded his attention to the ordinary matters about him just as happens when a man is in momentary and nervous expectation of some serious event noting these things as he passed with no more than the observation that was his professional habit hewitt proceeded to his lunch this done with he returned to his office perceiving as he passed the nextdoor building that the distracted jew was no longer visible it seemed plain that the person or the event he had awaited with such obvious nervousness had arrived and passed one more of the problems anxieties or crises that join and unravel moment by moment in the human anthill of london had perhaps closed for good or ill within the past halfhour perhaps it had only begun a message awaited hewitt at his officean urgent message the housekeeper had come in from next door kerrett reported with an urgent request that mr martin hewitt would go immediately to the offices of mr denson on the third floor the housekeeper seemed to know little or nothing of the business except that a mr samuel was alone in mr densons office and had sent the message with no delay hewitt transferred himself to the nextdoor offices there the housekeeper who inhabited a uniform and a glass box opposite the foot of the first flight of stairs directed hewitt with the remark that the gentleman was very impatient and very much upset third floor sir second door on the right name denson on the door theres no lift wf denson was the complete name followed by the line foreign and commission agent this hewitt read with some little difficulty for the door was open and on the threshold stood that same agitated jew whom hewitt had seen at the front door a little less actively perturbed now he was nevertheless still nervously pale mr martin hewitt he cried while hewitt was still only at the head of the stairs is it mr martin hewitt hewitt came quietly along the corridor using eyes and ears as he came the jew was a man of middle height very obviously jewish and with a slight accent that hinted a continental origin i have just received your message hewitt said and as you see i am here with no delay is mr denson in nogood heafens noi would gif anything if he was mr hewitt come in do i haf been robbedrobbed by denson himself witout a wort of doubt it is terribleterrible fifteen tousant pounds it ruins me mr hewitt ruins me unless you can recover it if you recover it i will paypayoh i will pay fery well indeed there was a characteristically sudden moderation of the clients emphasis when he came to the engagement to pay hewitt had observed it in other clients but it did not disturb him first he said you must tell me your difficulty you say you have been robbed of fifteen thousand pounds tiamonts mr hewitttiamonts all from the casehere is the case empty let us be methodical we will shut the door and sit down hewitt pressed his client into a chair and produced his notebook it will be better to begin at the beginning first i should like to know your name and a few such particulars as that lewis samuel hatton garden hatton gardentiamont merchant yes and what is your connection with mr denson businessjust business samuel responded he pronounced it pishness and it seemed his favourite word like this i will tell you i haf known him some time and did at first small pishness he bought a little tiamont and haf it set in pracelet and he paystraightforward pishness then he bought some very good paste stones all set in gold and he payquite straightforward pishness at the same time he says i am pishness man myself mr samuel he says and i like to make a little moneys as well as pay out sometimes dont you want any little agencies done i do all foreign commissions and i can forwart and receive and clear at dock and custom house if you send any tiamonts i can consign and insurevery cheapest rates to you special if you want brokerage or buy and sell for you confidential i can do it with lowest commission especially i haf good connection with america i haf many rich americans principals and customers he says and often i could do pishness for you when they come over by which he meant he might sell them diamonds hewitt queried just so mr hewittreglar pishness and after that two or three little parcels of tiamonts he boughtfor american customers he says but he says he can do bigger pishness soon ay so he hasgoot heavens he has but i tell you i do also one or two small pishnesses with him and that is all righthe treat me very well and i pay when it suits then he says samuel he says very friendly now inteet samuel could you get a nice large lot of tiamonts for an american customer i expect here soon and i say of course i can enough he says to fit out a rich mans wifethat is to pegin he is not long rich and he will want more soonah she will make him pay but to pegina good fitout of tiamonts eh i tell him yes and i offer usual commission but no says denson he wants no commission he will make his own profit that i dont mind so long as i get mine so i agree to put the tiamonts in at a price the american he says is to come over about a big company deal and when it is through he will pay well so last week i pring a peautiful collection all cut but unset and i wait out in that room while denson shows them to his customer you mean you let them out of your sight yesthat is not so uncommon reglar pishness you see i was out herethis is the only way out denson was in the inner office with the stones and the american neither could get out without passing here and i had done pishness with him alretty well you see i wait downstairs with my casethis casetill denson sends down he doesnt want me to showfery natural you see in pishness when i sell to make a profit perhaps for somebody else i dont want that somebody to know my customer else he sells direct and i lose my profitfery natural see of course i understand its a point of business among you gentlemen to keep your own customers to yourselves and often no doubt diamonds pass through several hands before reaching the eventual customer leaving a profit in each always mr hewittalways you might say well you see denson sends down that his customer is in and i come up denson comes out from the inner office takes my case and i wait in there the case which samuel showed hewitt was of black leather perhaps eighteen inches long by a foot wide the arrangement of the office was simple in this the outer room a small space was partitioned off by means of a ground glass screen and it was in there that samuel meant that he had waited well he took the case in and i could hear some sound of talkingbut not much you see the door being shut after a time the door opens and i hear denson say very well think over it but dont be long or youll lose the chance excuse me while i put them back in the safe then he shuts the door and brings the case to me and goes back but of course i stay till i haf looked very carefully through all the tiamonts in the different compartments of the case in case one might haf dropped on the floor or got changed you know that is pishness just so and they were all right all right and same as the listi know well a tiamont that i haf seen once so i go away and afterwards denson tells me that the american liked much the stones but wouldnt quite come up to price that of course is fery usual pishness but he will rise samuel denson says i know him quite well and them tiamonts is as good as sold with a good profit for me and a good one for you too i bet he says i was putting the lot to him for fifteen tousant pounds and it would have been a nice profit in that for me and then denson he chaffs me and he says ah samuel he says wasnt you afraid my customer and me would hook it out o the window with all your stones i dont like that sort o joke in pishness you see but i say all righti wasnt afraid o that the window was a mile too high and besides i could see it from where i was asitting and so i could you see plain enough to see if it was opened the groundglass partition in fact cut off a part of the window of the outer office which being at an angle with the inner room gave a side view of the window that lighted that apartment denson laughed at that samuel went on haha says he i never thought of that then you could see the americans hat hanging up just by the windowrum hat aint it and that was quite true for i had noticed ita big grey wideawake almost white hewitt nodded approvingly you are quite right he said to tell me everything you recollect even of the most trivial sort the smallest thing may be very valuable so you took your diamonds away the first time last week what next well i came again just the same today by appointment just the same i sat in that place and just the same denson took the case into the inner room hes come to buy this time i can see denson whispers and winks but hell fight hard over the price well see and off he goes into the other room well i waited i waited and i waited a long time i looked out sideways at the window and there i see the americans big wideawake hat hanging up just inside the other window same as last time so i think they are a long time settling the price and i wait some more but it is such a very long time and i begin to feel uneasy of course i know you cannot sell fifteen tousant wort of tiamonts in five minutesthat is not reasonable pishness but i could hear nothing at all nownot a sound and the boythe boy that came down to call me uphe wasnt come back but there i could see the big wideawake hat still hanging inside the window and of course i knew there was only one door out of the inner room right before me so it seemed foolish to be uneasy so i waited longer still but now it was so late i thought they should have come out to lunch before this and then i was fery uneasyfery uneasy inteet so i thought i would pretend to be a new caller and i opened the outer office door and banged it and walked in very loud and knocked on the boys table i thought denson would come when he heard that but nothere was not a sound so i got more uneasy and i opened the window and leaned out as far as i could to look in at the other window there i could see nothing but the big hat and the back of a chair and a bit of the roomempty so i went and banged the outer door again and called out hi mr denson youre wanted hi dyear and knocked with my umbrella on the inner door and mr hewittyou might have knocked me down with half a feather when i got no answer at allnot a sound i opened the door mr hewitt and there was nobody therenobody there was my leather case on the table openand empty fifteen tousant pounds in tiamonts mr hewittit ruins me hewitt rose and flung wide the inner office door this is certainly the only door he said and that is the only windowquite well in view from where you sat there is the wideawake hat still hanging theresee it is quite new obviously brought for you to look at it would seem the door and the window were not used and the chimney is impossibleregister grate but there was one other waythere the inner wall of each of the rooms was the wall of the corridor into which all the offices opened and this corridor was lightedand the offices partly ventilatedby a sort of hinged casement or fanlight close up by the ceiling oblong and extending the most of the length of each room plainly an active man not too stout might mount a chairback and climb very quietly through the opening thats the only way said hewitt pointing yes answered samuel nodding and rubbing his knuckles together nervously i saw itsaw it when it was too late but whod have thought o such a thing beforehand and the americaneither there wasnt an american at all or he got out the same way but anyway here i am and the tiamonts are gone and there is nothing here but the furniturenot worth twenty pound well hewitt said so far i think i understand though i may have questions to ask presently but go on go on but there is no more mr hewitt quite enough dont you think there is no morei am robbed but when you found the empty room and the case what did you do send for the police the jews face clouded slightly no mr hewitt he said not for the police but for you reason plain enough the police make a great fuss and they want to arrest the criminal quite righti want to arrest him and punish him too plenty but most i want the tiamonts back because if not it ruins me if it was to make choice between two things for me whether to punish denson or get my tiamonts then of course i take the tiamonts and let denson goi cannot be ruined but with the police if it is their choice they catch the thief first and hold him tight whether it loses the property or not the property is only second with themwith me it is first and second and all so i take no more risks than i can help mr hewitt i have sent for you to get first the stonesafterwards the thief if you can but first my property you can perhaps find denson and make him give it up rather than go to prison that would be better than having him taken and imprisoned and perhaps the stones put away safe all the time ready for him when he came out still the police can do things that i cant hewitt interposed stop people leaving or landing at ports and the like i think we should see them samuel was anxiously emphatic no mr hewitt he said certainly not the police there are reasonsno not the police mr hewitt at any rate not till you have tried i cannot haf the policejust yet martin hewitt shrugged his shoulders very well he said if those are your instructions ill do my best and so you sent for me at once as soon as you discovered the loss yes at once without telling anybody else i haf tolt nobody did you look about anywhere for densonin the street or what not nowhat was the good he was gone there was time for him to go miles very good and speaking of time let me judge how far he may have gone how long were you kept waiting two hours and a quarter very nearwithin five minutes by your watch yesi looked often to see if it was so long waiting as it seemed very good do you happen to have a piece of densons writing about you samuel looked round him theres nothing about here he said but perhaps we can findoh hereheres a postcard he took the card from his pocket and gave it to hewitt there is nothing else to tell me then queried hewitt are you sure that you have forgotten nothing that has happened since you first arrivednothing at all there was meaning in the emphasis and a sharp look in hewitts eyes no mr hewitt samuel answered hastily there is nothing else i can tell you then i will think it over at once you had better go back quietly to your office and think it over yourself in case you have forgotten something and i need hardly warn you to keep quiet as to what has passed between usunless you tell the police i think i shall take the liberty of a glance over mr densons office and since his office boy still stays away i will lend him my clerk for a little he will keep his eyes open if any callers come and his ears too wait while i fetch him ii it was at this point that my humble part in the case began for hewitt hurried first to my rooms brett he exclaimed are you engaged this afternoon nonothing important will you do me a small favour i have a rather interesting case i want a man watched for an hour or so and i havent a soul to do it kerrett may be known and i am known besides there is another job for kerrett of course i expressed myself willing to do what i could capital replied hewitt come alongyou like these adventures i know or i wouldnt have asked you and you know the dodges in this sort of observation the man is one samuel a jew of hatton garden diamond dealer ill tell you more afterwards kerrett and i are going into the offices next door and i want you to wait thereabout presently i will come downstairs with him and he will go away an hour or so will be enough probably i followed hewitt downstairs he took kerrett with him and locked his office door i saw them both disappear within the large new building and i waited near a convenient postal pillarbox prepared to seem very busy with a few old letters from my pocket until my mans back was turned in a very few minutes hewitt reappeared this time with a mana jew obviouslywhom i remembered having seen already at the door of that office more than an hour before as i had passed on the way from the booksellers at the corner the man walked briskly up the street and i on the opposite side did the same a little in the rear he turned the corner and at once slackened his pace and looked about him he took a peep back along the street he had left and then hailed a cab for a hundred yards or more i was obliged to trot till i saw another cab drop its fare just ahead and managed to secure it and give the cabman instructions to follow the cab in front before it turned a corner the chase was difficult for the horse that drew me was a poor one and half a dozen times i thought i had lost sight of the other cab altogether but my cabman was better than his animal and from his high perch he kept the chase in view turning corners and picking out the cab ahead among a dozen others with surprising certainty we went across charing cross road by way of cranborne street past leicester square through coventry street and up the quadrant and regent street at oxford circus the jews cab led us to the left and along oxford street we chased it past bond street end suddenly my cab pulled up with a jerk and the driver spoke through the trapdoor that fares getting down sir he said at the corner o duke street i thrust a halfcrown up through the hole and sprang out es crossing the road sir the cabman finally reported and i hurried across the street accordingly the man i was watching was strikingly jewish enough and easy to distinguish in a crowd i had almost overtaken him before he had gone a dozen yards up the northern end of duke street he walked on into manchester square there a small neat brougham with blinds drawn was being driven slowly round the central garden i saw samuel walk hurriedly up to this brougham which stopped as he approached he stepped quickly into the carriage and shut the door behind him the brougham resumed its slow progress and i loitered keeping it in view though the blinds were drawn so close that it was impossible to guess who might be samuels companion if he had one i think i have said that when the jew came to the office door with hewitt i perceived that he was a man i had seen before that day i was now convinced that i had also seen that same brougham at the same time but of this presently the carriage made one slow circuit and then samuel got out and shut the door quickly again i took the precaution of turning my back and letting him overtake and pass me on his way back through duke street at the end of the street he mounted an omnibus going east and i took another seat in the same vehicle the rest was uninteresting he went direct to no hatton garden and there remained i read his name on the doorpost among a score of others and after a twentyminutes wait i returned to my rooms i had no doubt that it was the meeting in the brougham that hewitt wished reported and i remembered his rule was never to watch a man a moment after the main object was secured hewitt was out and he did not return till after dusk then he came straightway to my rooms well brett he said whats the report as a matter of fact samuel is my client as i shall explain presently i dont like spying on a client as a rule but i was convinced that he was keeping something back from me and there was something odd about his whole story but what did you see i told hewitt the tale of my pursuit as i have told it here i came away i concluded after it seemed that he was settled in his office for a bit but there is another thing you should know when he first came out with you i recognised him at once as a man i had seen at that same door a little after two oclocksay a quarter past yes answered hewitt i saw him there myself a little soonersomething like two i should say what was he doing well i replied he was doing pretty well what he did in manchester square for as a matter of fact the brougham also was here thenjust outside the nextdoor office i think i might swear to that same broughamthough of course i didnt notice it so particularly that first time hewitt whistled oh he said tell me about this did he get into the brougham this time yes he came out of the office door with a black leather case in his hand and a very scared look on his face and he popped into the brougham leather case scared look and all hoho said hewitt thoughtfully and whistled again a black leather case eh come come the plot thickens and what happened did the carriage go off no i saw nothing moreshouldnt have noticed so much in fact if the whole thing hadnt looked a trifle curious nervous pallid jew with a black caseas though he thought it was dynamite and might go off at any momentclosed brougham blinds drawn jew skipped in and banged the door but brougham didnt move and i fanciedperhaps only fanciedthat i saw a womans black veil inside but then i turned in here and saw no more hewitt sat thoughtfully silent for a few moments then he rose and said come next door and ill tell you how we stand the housekeeper will let us in and well see if you can identify that black case anywhere it seemed that hewitt had by this established a good understanding with the housekeeper next door nobodys been sir the man said as he admitted us and closed the heavy doors office boy not come back nor nothing we went up to densons office on the third floor the door of which the housekeeper opened and having turned on the electric light he left us now is that anything like the case hewitt asked when the housekeeper was gone and he lifted from under the table the very black case i had seen samuel take into the brougham i said that i felt as sure of the case as of the brougham and then hewitt told me the whole tale of samuel and his loss of fifteen thousand pounds worth of diamonds just as it appears earlier in this narrative now see here said hewitt when he had made me acquainted with his clients tale there is something odd about all this see this postcard which samuel gave me it is from denson and it makes this mornings appointment see be down below at eleven sharp is the message he came and he waited just two hours and a quarter as he tells me being certain to the time within five minutes that brings us to a quarterpast onethe time when he finds he is robbed and he came downstairs in a very agitated state at a quarterpast one as i have since ascertained at two i pass and see him still dancing distractedly on the front stepscertainly very much like a man who has had a serious misfortune or expects one at a quarterpast twothat was about it i think i nodded at a quarterpast two you see him still agitated diving into the brougham with this black case in his hand and a little afterwardafter all this mindhe tells me this story of a robbery of diamonds from that very case and assures me that he sent for me the moment he discovered the lossthat is to say at a quarterpast one a positive lieand has told nobody else he further assures me that he has told me everything that has happened up to the moment he meets me then he goes awayto his office as he tells me but you find him posting to manchester square in a cab and there once more plunging into that same mysterious closed brougham now why should he do that he has seen the person in that brougham presumably an hour before and there can be nothing more to communicate except the result of his interview with mea thing i warned him to keep to himself its odd isnt it it is what can be his motive i want to know his motive i object to working for a client who deceives meindeed its unsafe i may be making myself an accomplice in some criminal scheme you observe that he never called for the policea natural impulse in a robbed man indeed he expressly vetoes all communication with the police of course he gave reasons but the reasons are not good enough i cant stop a man leaving this country anywhere round the coast except by going to the police can it be i suggested that samuel and denson are working in collusion and have perhaps insured the stones and now want your help to make out a case of loss scarcely that i think for more than one reason first it isnt a risk any insurer would take in the circumstances next the insurer would certainly want to know why the police were not informed at once but there is more i have not been idle this while as you would know i will tell you some of the things i have ascertained to begin with samuel is known in hatton garden only as a dealer on a very small and peddling scale a dabbler in commissions in fact rather than a buyer and seller of diamonds in quantities on his own account his office is nothing but a desk in a small room he shares with two otherssmall dealers like himself when i spoke to the people most likely to know of his offering fifteen thousand pounds worth of diamonds on his own account they laughed an investment of two or three hundred pounds in stones was about his limit they said now that fact offers fresh suggestions doesnt it hewitt looked at me significantly you mean i said after a little consideration that samuel may have been entrusted with the diamonds to sell by the real owner and has made all these arrangements with denson to get the gems for themselves and represent them as stolen hewitt nodded thoughtfully theres that possibility he said though even in that case the owner would certainly want to know why the police had not been told and i dont know what satisfactory answer samuel could make and more i find that no such robbery has been reported to any of the principal dealers in hatton garden today and so far as i can ascertain none of them has entrusted samuel with anything like so large a quantity of diamonds as he talks oflately at any rate isnt it possible that the diamonds are purely imaginary i suggested mightnt there be some trick played on that basis perhaps a trick on the american customerif there was one hewitt was thoughtful there are many possibilities he said which i must consider the diamonds may even be stolen property to begin with that would account for a great deal though perhaps not all but the whole thing is so oddly suspicious that unless my client is willing to let me a great deal further into his confidence tomorrow morning i shall throw up the case did you direct any inquiries after denson of course which brings me to the other things i have ascertained he has not been here longa few months i cannot find that he has been doing any particular business all the time with anybody except samuel with him however he seems to have been very friendly the housekeeper speaks of them as being very thick together the rooms are cheaply furnished as you see and here is another thing to consider the housekeeper vows that he never left his glass box at the foot of the stairs from the time samuel went upstairs first to the time when he came down again vastly agitated at a quarterpast one and sent a message and during all that time denson never passed the box and the main door is the only way out but wasnt he there at all yes he was there certainly when samuel came but note now observe the sequence of things as we know them now first there is denson in his office i can find nothing of any american visitor and i am convinced that he is a total fiction either of densons or samuel and denson together denson is in his office to him comes samuel neither leaves the place till samuel comes down at a quarterpast one oclock i told you he sent some sort of message the housekeeper tells me that he called a passing commissionaire and gave him something though whether it was a telegram or a note he did not see nor does he know the commissionaire nor his numberthough he could easily be found if it became necessary no doubt samuel sends the message and waits on the steps watching in an agitated manner as would be natural perhaps in a man engaged in an anxious and ticklish piece of illegality for an hour when this mysterious brougham appears he takes this black case into the brougham and he obviously brings it out again for here it is whatever has happened he brings it out empty then he sends the housekeeper for me when at length i arrive denson has certainly gone but there was an opportunity for that while the housekeeper was absent on the message to my officeafter all samuels agitation and after he had carried his case to and from the brougham the whole thing is odd enough certainly and suspicious enough have you found anything else yes denson lives or lived in a boarding house in bloomsbury he has only been there two months however and they know practically nothing of him today he came home at an unusual time letting himself in with his latchkey and went away at once with a bag but the accounts of the exact time are contradictory one servant thought it was before twelve and another insisted that it was after one he has not been back and the office boycant you get some information out of him he hasnt been seen since the morning i expect denson told him to take a whole holiday i cant find where he lives at the moment but no doubt he will turn up tomorrow not that i expect to get much from him but i shant bother unless mr samuel will answer satisfactorily some very plain questions i shall askand i dont expect he willi shall throw up the commission he called by the way not long ago but i was out we shall see him in the morning i expect a look round densons office taught me no more than it had taught hewitt already there were two small rooms one inside the other with ordinary and cheap office furniture it was quite plain that any man of ordinary activity and size could have got out of the inner room into the corridor by the means which samuel suggestedthrough the hinged walllight near the ceiling hewitt had meddled with nothinghe would do no more till he was satisfied of the bona fides of his client certainly he would not commit himself to breaking open desks or cupboards and so the time for my attendance at the office approachingi was working on the morning phoenix then and ten at night saw my work beginwe shut densons office and went away iii in the morning i was awakened by an impatient knocking at my bedroom door going to bed at two or three i was naturally a late riser and this was about nine i scrambled sleepily out of bed and turned the key hewitt was standing in my sittingroom with a newspaper in his hand sorry to break your morning sleep brett he said but something interesting has happened in regard to that business you helped me with yesterday and you may like to know crawl back into bed if you like but i was already in my dressinggown and groping for my clothes no no come in and tell me i said what is it hewitt sat on the bed ill tell you in due order he said first i saw samuel again last nightafter you had gone away you remember i went back to my office i had a letter or two to write which i had set aside in the afternoon well i wrote the letters shut up and went downstairs i opened the outer door and there was samuel in the act of ringing the housekeepers bell he said he was very anxious and couldnt sleep without coming to hear if i had made any progress he had called before but i was out i half thought of taking him back to my office but decided that it wasnt worth while so i walked along to the corner of the strand till i got him well under the lights then i stopped and talked to him you ask about the progress in your case mr samuel i said now i have sometimes met people who seem to consider me a sort of prophet seer or diviner as a matter of fact i am nothing but a professional investigator and even if i were possessed of such an amazing genius as i lay no claim to i could never succeed in a case nor even make progress in it if my client started me with false information or only told me half the truth more when i find that such is the state of affairs and that if i am to succeed i must begin by investigating my client before i proceed with his case i throw that case up on the instantinvariably do you understand that now i must tell you that i have made no progress with your case none for that very reason he protested of coursevowed he had told me the simple truth and so forth i replied by asking him certain definite questions first i asked him whose the diamonds were he repeated that they were his own to that i simply replied good evening mr samuel and turned away he came after me beseechingly and prevaricated he said something about another party having an interest but the matter being confidential to that i responded by asking him with whom he had communicated before sending for me and who was the person in the brougham which he had twice entered that flabbergasted him he said that he couldnt answer those questions without bringing other parties into the matter to which i answered that it was just those other parties that i meant to know about if i were to move a step in the matter at this he got into a sad stateimploring actually imploring me not to desert him he said he should do something desperatesomething terriblethat night if i didnt relieve his mind and undertake the case what he meant hed do i didnt know of course but it didnt move me i said finally that i would deal only with principals and that until i had the personal instructions of the actual owner of the diamonds in addition to a complete explanation of the brougham incident i should do nothing and i recommended him to go to the police and with that i left him and you got nothing more from him than that nothing more but it was something you see he admitted to all intents that the diamonds were not his own and now see here i suppose i left him about ten oclock here is a paragraph in one of this mornings newspapers it is only in the one paper the matter seems to have occurred rather late for press hewitt gave me the paper in his hand pointing to the following paragraph horrible discoverya shocking discovery was made just before midnight last night near the york column where a policeconstable found the dead body of a man lying on the stone steps the body which was fully clothed in the ordinary dress of a labouring man bore plain marks of strangulation and it was evident that a brutal murder had been committed a singular circumstance was the presence of a curious reddish mark upon the forehead at first taken for a wound but soon discovered to be a mark apparently drawn or impressed on the skin at the time of going to press no arrest had been made and so far the affair appears a mystery well i said this certainly seems curious especially in the matter of the mark on the forehead but what has it all to do to do with samuel and his diamonds you mean ill tell you that dead man is denson denson i exclaimed denson how i get it from the housekeeper next door it seems that when the police came to examine the body they found among other thingsmoney and a watch and the likea piece of an addressed envelope used to hold a few pinsthe pins stuck in and the paper rolled up you know there was just enough of it to guess the address bythat of the office next door and it was the only clue they had so they came along here at once and knocked up the housekeeper he went with them and instantly recognised denson disguised in labourers clothes but denson he says unmistakably and the mark on the forehead that is very odd it is an outlined triangle rather less than an inch along each side it is quite red he says and seems to be done in a greasy sticky sort of ink or colour was anything foundthe diamonds no he says there was moneytwo or three fivepound notes i believe some small change a watch keys and so forth but theres not a word of diamonds i paused in my dressing does that mean that the murderer has got them i asked hewitt pursed his lips and shook his head it may mean that he said but does it look altogether like it when fivepound notes are left on the other hand there is the disguise the only reason that we know of for that would be that he was bolting with the diamonds but the really puzzling thing is the mark on the forehead why that of course the picturesque and romantic thing to suppose is that it is the mark of some criminal club or society but criminal associations such as exist dont do silly things like that when criminals rob and murder they dont go leaving their tracks behind them purposelythey leave nothing that could possibly draw attention to them if they can help it also they dont leave fivepound notes but im off to have a look at that mark inspector plummer is in charge of the caseyou remember plummer dont you in the stanway cameo case and two or three others well plummer is an old friend of mine and not only am i interested in this matter myself but now that it becomes a case of murder i must tell the police all i know merely as a loyal citizen ive an idea they will want to ask our friend mr samuel some very serious questions will you go now yes i must waste no more time you get your breakfast and look out for me or for a message hewitt was off to vine street and i devoted myself to my toilet and my breakfast vastly mystified by this tragic turn in a matter already puzzling enough it was not a messenger but hewitt himself who came back in less than an hour come he said plummer is below and we are going next door to densons office ive an idea that we may get at something at last the police are after samuel hotfoot they think he should be made sure of in any case without delay and i must say they have some reason on the face of it we joined plummer at oncei have already spoken of plummer in my accounts of several of hewitts cases in which i met himand we all turned into the office next door there we found a very frightened and bewildered office boy whom denson had given a holiday yesterday after sending him down to samuel he had come to his work as usual only to meet the housekeepers tale of the murder of his master and the end of his business prospects he had little or no information to impart he had only been employed for a month or six weeks and during that time his work had been practically nothing plummer nodded at this information and sniffed comprehensively at the office furniture i know this sort o stuff he said this is the way they fit up long firm offices and such this place was taken for the job thats plain by one or both of em the boys address was taken and he was given a final holiday and asked to send up the housekeeper as he went out plummer passed hewitt a bunch of keys the housekeeper entered now hutt said martin hewitt you were saying yesterday i think that the main front door was the only entrance and exit for this building thats so sirthe only one as anybody can use except me oh then there is another then well not exactly to say an entrance sir theres a small private door at the back into the court behind but thats only opened to take in coals and such and i always have the key this house isnt like yours sir you have no back way into the court as we have its a convenience sometimes ah ive no doubt do you happen to have the key with you its on the bunch hanging up in my box sir shall i fetch it i should like to see it if you will the housekeeper disappeared and presently returned with a large bunch of keys this is the one mr hewitt he explained lifting it from among the rest hewitt examined it closely and then placed beside it one from the bunch plummer had given him it seems youre not the only person who ever had a key exactly like that hutt he said see herethis was found in mr densons pocket plummer nodded sagaciously all in the plant he said seeits brand new clean as a new pin and file marks still on it take us to this back door hutt hewitt pursued well try this key is there a back staircase there was a small back staircase leading to the coalcellars and only used by servants down this we all went and on a lower landing we stopped before a small door hewitt slipped the key in the lock and turned it the door opened easily and there before us was the little courtyard which i think i have mentioned in one of my other narrativesthe courtyard with a narrow passage leading into the next street martin hewitt seemed singularly excited see there he said that is how denson left the building without passing the housekeepers box and now im going to make another shot see here this key on densons bunch attracted my attention because of its noticeable newness compared with most of the others most of the others i say because there is one other just as brightsee this small one now hutt do you happen to have a key like that also hutt turned the key over in his hand and glanced from it to his own bunch why yes sir he said presently yes sir its the same as the key of the firehose cupboards does that key fit them all how many firehose cupboards are there two on each floor sir one at each end just against the mains and one key fits the lot show us the nearest to this door a short narrow passage led to the main groundfloor corridor where a cupboard lettered fire hose stood next the main and its fittings we have to keep the hosecupboards locked the housekeeper explained apologetically cause o mischievous boys in the offices this key fitted as well as the other a long coil of brown leather hose hung within and in a corner lay a piece of chamois leather evidently used for polishing the brass fittings this hewitt pulled aside and there beneath it lay another and cleaner piece of chamois leather neatly folded and tied round with cord hewitt snatched it up he unfastened the cord he unrolled the leather which was sewn into a sort of bag or satchel and when at last he spread wide the mouth of this satchel light seemed to spring from out of it for there lay a glittering heap of brilliants what cried plummer who first got his speech diamonds samuels diamonds diamonds at any rate replied hewitt whether samuels or somebody elses but they cant have been there long how often is this cupboard opened every saturday reglar sir replied the housekeeper just to dust it out and see things is right now see here said martin hewitt ive had luck in my conjectures as yet and ill try again here is what i believe has happened every word that samuel told me about the theft of those diamonds was true except as to their ownership denson has planned all along to rob him of as big a collection of diamonds as he could prompt him to get together and he has played up to this for months his smaller dealings one way and another were groundbait very artfully he let samuel take the diamonds safely away once in order that he should be less watchful and less suspicious the second time this second time he does the trick exactly as we see he hangs up the imaginary americans hat he escapes by the fanlight and he goes out by the back way to avoid the housekeepers observation he has arranged beforehand for this too he has seized an opportunity when the housekeeper has been out of his box to get wax impressions of these two keys and he has made copies of them and here we come on a curious thing it is easy enough to understand why he should foresee and get himself a key for the back door in order to make his escape but why the key of the hosecupboard why indeed should he leave the diamonds behind him at all it is plain that he meant to come back for themprobably at night he would have been wholly free from observation in that quiet courtyard and he could let himself in get the diamonds and leave again without exciting the smallest alarm or suspicion but why take all the trouble why not stick to the plunder from the beginning the plain inference is that he feared somebody or something he feared being stopped and searched or he feared being waylaid sometime during yesterday by whom theres the puzzle and i cant see the bottom of it i confess if i could perhaps i might know something of last nights murder as to samuels prevarications there is only one explanation that will fit now that the rest is made clear he must have been entrusted with these diamonds by a private owner for salesecretly some lady of conspicuous position in difficulties probablyperhaps unknown to her husband such things occur every day a common expedient is to sell the stones and have good paste substituted in the same settings samuel would be just the man to carry through a transaction of that sort that would account for everything the jewels are en suite cut but unsettaken from a set of jewellery and paste substituted samuel arranges it all for the lady finds a customerdensonwho treats him exactly as he has told us when he realises the loss samuel doesnt know what to do he mustnt call the police being bound to secrecy on the ladys behalf he sends her a hasty message and remains keeping watch by densons office she hurries to him with all possible secrecy keeping her carriage blinds down he dashes into the brougham to describe the disaster taking his case with him in his frantic desire to explain things fully the lady fears publicity and wont hear of the policeshe instructs him to consult me and consequently of course when i recommend communicating with the police he wont listen to the suggestion samuel has arranged with the lady to hurry off and report progress as soon as he has consulted me and this he does the lady having appointed manchester square for the interview perhaps she hints some suspicion of samuels honestyrather natural perhaps in the circumstances that terrifies him more than ever and leads to his frantic appeals to me when i throw the case up come theres my guess at the facts of the case and ill back it with twopence and a bit more eh plummer i dont take your bet answered plummer the things plain enough except the murder theres something deeper there hewitt became grave thats true he said and something i can see no way into as yet but comeyou take this parcel of diamonds as representing the law and here comes one of your men i think we had been approaching the front door during this talk and now a police constable appeared and saluted plummer samuels just been brought in sir he reported hes half dead with fright and hes sent a message to lady h in p square and he says he wants mr martin hewitt to come and speak for him poor samuel hewitt commented come well go and make him happy here are the diamonds and those safely accounted for theres no evidence to connect him with the murder well get him out of the mess as soon as possible and so they did hewitts reading of the case was correct to a tittle as it turned out and with very little delay samuel was released but with the message from the police station the fat was in the fire as regarded lady h her husband necessarily became acquainted with everything and there was serious domestic trouble samuel was glad enough to get quit of the business with no worse than a bad fright as may well be supposed he showed himself most grateful to hewitt in after times giving him excellent confidential advice and information more than once in matters connected with the diamond trade he is still in business i believe in a much larger way and i have no doubt he is the wiser for his experience and for the lesson which hewitt did not forget to rub well in that it is useless and worse to place a confidential matter in the hands of a man of hewitts profession and at the same time withhold particulars of the case however unessential they may appear to be but meantime on the way to vine street i asked hewitt what led him to suppose that the new key on densons bunch fitted a lock in that particular office building call it a lucky guess if you like hewitt answered but as a matter of fact it was prompted by pure common sense plummer showed me the things found on the body and i saw at once that the keys offered the only chance of immediate information i went through them one by one there was his latchkeythe key with which he had gone into his lodgings to fetch away the disguise there was another largish key equally oldprobably the key of his office door there were other smaller keys also oldplainly belonging to bags and trunks and drawers and so forth and then there was the large perfectly new key what was that it was not the key of any bag or drawer clearlyit was the key of a doora door with a lever lock what door had denson some other office perhaps he had but first it was best to begin by trying it on places we were already acquainted with at once i thought of densons disappearance unobserved by the housekeeper could this be the key of some private exit from the office building i resolved to test that conjecture first and it turned out to be the right one being successful so far of course i turned to the other new key and tried that as you saw but what of that triangular mark on the mans forehead martin hewitt became deeply thoughtful that he said is a matter wholly beyond me at present as indeed is the whole business of the murder whether we shall ever know more i cant guess but the matter is deepdeep and difficult and dark as to the mark itself that seems to have been impressed from an engraved stamp of some sort it is a plain equilateral triangle in red outline measuring about an inch on each side it is in a greasy sticky sort of red ink which may be smeared but is very difficult if not impossible to rub away what it means i cant at present conjecture i have told you my reasons for not thinking it the sign of any gang of criminals but whose sign is it surely not that of some selfconstituted punisher of crime for such a person with no risk to himself could have handed denson over to the police if he knew of his offence can he have been murdered by an accomplice but he used no accomplice if one thing is plain in all that story of the stolen diamonds it is that denson did the thing wholly by himself besides an accomplice would have taken the keys and have gone and secured the diamonds for himself else why the murder at all but no keys were takennothing was taken as far as we can tell and why was the body placed in that conspicuous position it is pretty certain that the crime cannot have happened where the body was foundsomebody must have heard or seen a struggle in such a place as that as it is i should say the body was probably brought quietly to the spot in a cab or some such conveyance but mystery envelops this crime everywhere so far as i can see there is no clue whatever beyond the red triangle which as yet i cannot understand the strangling points to the murder being committed by a powerful man certainly and it is a form of crime that may have been perpetrated silently but beyond that i can see nothing the apparent motivelessness of the thing makes the mystery all the darker and the circumstances we are acquainted with instead of helping us seem to complicate the puzzle what was it that denson feared when he left those diamonds behind him when he might have carried them away and why should he fear it in daytime and not at night since it would seem plain that he meant to have returned for the stones at night where did he go to disguise himself yesterdaywe know it was not in his lodgingsand where has he left the clothes he discarded all these doubts and mysteries were destined to be cleared up in more or less degree but it was not till hewitt and i had witnessed other singular adventures that the answer came to the problem the real meaning of the red triangle was made apparent and its connection with the theft of samuels diamonds grew clear for indeed the connection proved in the end to be very intimate indeed once a little later we were allowed to see a shade farther into the mystery as i shall tell in the proper place but even then the real secret remained hidden from us till the appointed end so ended the case of samuels diamonds so far as concerned samuel himself and the owner but the case of the red triangle had only begun the case of mr jacob mason i the mystery of densons death remained a mystery despite all the police could do the coroners jury returned a verdict of murder by some person or persons unknownwhich indeed was all that could be expected of them for they had no more before them than the bare fact that the body disguised in the clothes of a labourer had been found on the steps near the duke of yorks column just before midnight by a police constable but for the housekeepers identification even the name of the victim would have been unknown the jury certainly wasted some time in idle speculation as to the strange triangular mark found on the forehead without a speck of evidence to help them but in the end they returned their verdict and went home but the police knew a little more than the jury though that little rather confused than helped them they exercised their judgment at the inquest in withholding all evidence of the theft of diamonds on which the victim had been engaged the curious particulars of which i have already related in this they followed their usual course in cases where the evidence withheld could give the jury no help in arriving at their verdict and at the same time might easily hamper further investigations if revealed for the theft had been frustrated by martin hewitts exertions as we have seen and in any case the thief was now dead and beyond the reach of human punishment the one matter now remaining for the police was inquiry into the murder of this same thief and the one object of their exertions the apprehension of the murderer or murderers the case as i have already said was in the hands of inspector plummer an intelligent officer and an old friend of hewitts a few days work after the inquest yielded plummer so little result that he called at hewitts office to talk matters over i suppose plummer began its no use asking if youve heard anything more of that matter of densons murder hewitt shook his head i havent heard a word he said if i had it would have come on to you at once but i hope youve had some luck yourself not a scrap time wasted and the few offchance clues i tried have led nowhere so that im where i was at the start the thing is quite the oddest in all my experience see how we stand heres a man denson who has just pulled off one of the cleverest jewel robberies ever attempted he so arranges it that he walks safely off with fifteen thousand pounds worth of diamonds leaving the victim samuel stuck patiently in an office for an hour or two before he even begins to suspect anything is wrong and then unable to set the police after him for the reasons you discovered but this denson doesnt carry the plunder off straightway as he so easily might have donehe conceals it in the very house where the robbery was committed taking with him a key by aid of which he may return and get it why as you explained it was probably because he feared somebodyfeared being stopped and searched on the day of the robberynot after since it was plain he meant to return for his booty at night who could this have been and why did denson fear him mystery number one then this denson is found dead that same night disguised in the clothes of a labourer in a most conspicuous spot in londonthe last place in the world one would expect a murderer to select for depositing his victims body for it is evidently not the place where the murder was committed more on the forehead there is this extraordinary impressed mark of a red triangle now what can all that mean robbery perhaps one thinks but the body isnt robbed there are three fivepound notes on it besides a sovereign or two and some small change a watch and chain keys and all the rest of it then one guesses at the diamonds perhaps it was an accomplice in the robbery who finds that denson is about to bolt with the whole lot but if theres one thing plain in this amazing business it is that denson had no accomplice he did the whole thing alone as you discovered and he needed no help more than that if this were the work of an accomplice why didnt he get the jewels there were the keys to his hand and he left them and would such a person actually go out of his way to put the body where it must be discovered at once instead of concealing it till he could himself get away with the diamonds of course not but there was no accomplice and its useless to labour that farther all these arguments apply equally against the theory that it was the work of some criminal gang they would have taken all they could get notes keys diamonds and all and they wouldnt have been so foolish as to exhibit the body with that extraordinary mark criminal gangs are not such fools as to take unnecessary chances and gratuitously leave tracks behind them as you know well enough well then there we stand so far do you see any more in it than i do hewitt shook his head no he said i cant say i do all the considerations you have mentioned have already occurred to me i talked them over in fact with my friend brett my connection with the case ceased of course with the discovery of the jewels and about the murder i know no more than has been told me i never saw the body and so had no opportunity of picking up any overlooked clue though doubtless you have seen to that i know not a tittle more than you have just summarised and on that alone the thing seems mystery pure and unadulterated all there is beyond that was ascertained by the divisional surgeon on examination of the body the man died from strangulation as you know and the natural presumption from that was that the murderer must have been a powerful man but the surgeon is of the positive opinionhe is certain in factthat denson was strangled with an instrumenta tourniquet a tourniquet yes a surgeons tourniquet such as is used to compress a leg or arm and so stop a flow of blood he considers the marks unmistakable now that might point to the murderer being a medical man conjecturally yes though of course it justifies nothing more than conjecture precisely well that was something but precious little a tourniquet is a common thing enoughno more than a band with screw fittings and there was nothing to show that the tourniquet used was any different from a thousand others and i can see no particular reason why a doctor should commit a murder like this any more than any other man in which the divisional surgeon agreed with me and doctor or none that red triangle was altogether unaccounted for about that too by the way the divisional surgeon told me a little but a very useless little the mark was not properly dried owing to its slightly greasy nature and although it was almost impossible to remove it wholly it was possible to scrape off a little of the ink or colour here is a little of it on a paperquite dried now of course plummer carefully took from his pocket a small folded paper unfolded it and revealed a smaller paper within on this were two little smears of a bright red colour therethats the stuff he said the surgeon examined it and he reports it to be rather oddly constitutedso as to bear some affinity of meaning possibly to the triangle for the stuff is a compound of three substancesanimal vegetable and mineral there is a fine vegetable oil he says some waxy preparation certainly of animal origin and a mineralcinnabar vermilion in fact but though there may be some connection between the triangle and the substances representing the three natural kingdoms it gives nothing practicalnothing to go on martin hewitt had been closely examining the marks on the paper and now he answered im not so sure of that though plummer i think at least that it gives us another conjecture i should guess that the man you want as well as being acquainted with the use of the tourniquet has at some time travelled in or to china why unless i am wider of the mark than usual this is the pigment used on chinese seals a chinamans seal acts for his signature on all sorts of documents it is impressed or printed by hand pressure from a little engraved stone die precisely as this triangle seems to have been and the ink or colour is almost always red compounded of vermilion wax and oil of sesamum plummer sat up with a whistle phew then it may have been done by a chinaman hewitt shrugged his shoulders its possible he said of course though the sign the triangle is not a chinese character as a character of course it is the greek delta but it may be no character at all in the signs of the ancient cabala the triangle apex upward as it was in this case was the symbol of fire apex downward it signified water plummer patted the side of his head distractedly heavens he said dont tell me im to search all china and greece andwherever the cabalistic pundits come from well no hewitt answered with a smile i think i should at any rate begin in this country i rather think you might make a beginning at denson that is what i should do if the case were mine see if anything can be ascertained of his previous lifeprobably under another name or names he may have been in china yes certainly as we stand at present i should begin at denson i think i will the inspector replied though theres precious little to begin on there id like to have you with me on this job but of course thats impossible since its purely a police matter but something some information may come your way and in that case youll let me know at once of course of course i shallits a serious matter as well as a strange one i wish you all luck plummer departed to grapple with his difficulties but in fact it was hewitt who first heard fresh news of the red triangle and that from a wholly unexpected quarter it was indeed only two days after plummers visit that kerrett brought into hewitts private room the card of the rev james potswood with a request for a consultation mr potswoods name was known to hewitt as indeed it was to many people as that of a most devoted clergyman rector of a large parish in northwest london who devoted not only all his time and personal strength to his work but also spent every penny of his private income on his parish it was not a small income that mr potswood spent in this unselfish way for he came of a wealthy family and though a good part of his parish was inhabited by welltodo people there was quite enough poverty and distress in the poorer quarters to cause this excellent man often to regret that his resources were not even larger he was a spare active greywhiskered man of nearly sixty with prominent and not very handsome features though his face was full of frank and simple kindliness my errand mr hewitt he said is of a rather vague not to say visionary character and i doubt if you can help me but at any rate i will explain the trouble as well as i can in the first place am i right in supposing that you were in some way professionally engaged in connection with that extraordinary case of murder a week or so agothe case in which a man named denson was found dead on the steps by the duke of yorks column yesand no hewitt answered i was professionally engaged on a certain matter about which you will not wish me to particularisesince it is the business of a clientand in course of it i came upon the other affair then before i ask what you know of that mysterious event mr hewitt i will tell you my story so that you may judge whether you are able to reveal anything or to do anything of course what i say is in the strictest confidence of course i have a parishioner a mr jacob mason of whom i have seen very little of late yearsscarcely anything at all in fact till a few days ago he is fairly well to do i believe living a somewhat retired life in a house not far from my rectory for many years he has laboured at natural sciencechemistry in particularand he has a very excellently fitted laboratory attached to his house he is a widower with no children of his own but his orphan niece a miss creswick lives under his guardianship mr mason was never a very regular churchgoer but years ago i saw much more of him than i have of late i must be perfectly frank with you mr hewitt if you are to help me and therefore i must tell you that we disagreed on points of religion in such a way that i found it difficult to maintain my former regard for mr mason he had a curiously fantastic mind and he was constantly being led to tamper with things that i think are best left alonewhat is called spiritualism for instance and that horrible form of modern superstition which we hear whispers of at times from the continentthe alleged devilpropitiation or worship it was not that he did anything i thought morally wrong you understandexcept that he dabbled and he was always running after some new thinganimal magnetism or telepathy or crystalgazing or theosophy or some one of the score of such things that have an attraction for a mind of that sort and it was a characteristic of each new enthusiasm with him that it prompted him to try to convert me and that in such termsterms often applied to the doctrines of that religion of which i am a humble ministeras i could in nowise permit in my presence so that our friendly intercourse though not interrupted by any definite breaking off fell away to almost nothing for which reason i was a little surprised to receive a visit from mr mason on the afternoon of the day on which the newspapers printed the report of the finding of the body of denson you may remember that only one morning paper mentioned the matter and that very briefly but there were full reports in all the evening papers yes the discovery was made very late the previous night so i gathered well i was told that mr mason had been shown into my study and there i found him he was in an extremely nervous and agitated state and he had an evening paper in his hand with scarcely a preliminary word he burst out have you seen this in the paper thisthis murder theretheres the report and he thrust the paper into my hands i had not seen or heard anything of the matter in fact till that moment and now he gave me little leisure to read the report he walked up and down the room nervously clasping his hands sometimes together sometimes at his sides sometimes before him shaking his head in a shuddering sort of way and bursting out once or twice as though the words were uncontrollable what ought i to do what can i do i looked up from the paper and he went on have you read it its a murdera horrid murder the poor wretched fellow was trying to escape but he couldnt its a murder it certainly seems so i said but whatdid you know this man denson no of course not mason replied but there it is plain enough and heres another paper with just the same report but a little shorter he pulled the second paper from his pocket i got what different papers i could but these are the two fullest its plain enough its a brutal murder isnt it and the man was a merchant or an agent or something in portsmouth street but he was found in labourers clothesproof that he feared it and was trying to escape it but he couldnthe couldntno nor anybody its awful awful but i dont understand i said wont you sit down for mason continued to pace distractedly about the room what is it you think this unfortunate man was trying to escape and what am i to do in the matter he stopped pressed both hands to his head and seemed to control himself by a great effort you must excuse me he said im a bit run down lately and my nerves are all wrong im talking rather wildly im afraid i really hardly know why i came to you except that i havent a soul i can talk to aboutwell about anything scarcely he took a chair and sat for a little while with his head forward on his hand and his eyes directed towards the floor then he said in a musing way rather as though he was thinking aloud than talking to me you were right after all potswood and i was a fool to disregard your warnings i oughtnt to have dabbledi should have left those things alone i said nothing thinking it best not to disturb him but to leave him free to say what he wanted to say in his own way he remained quiet for a minute or two more and then sat up with an appearance of much greater composure you mustnt mind me potswood he said as ive told you im in a bad state of nerves and at best im an impulsive sort of person as you know i neednt have bothered you like thisi came rushing round here without thinking and if the house had been a bit farther off i should have come to my senses before i reached you after all theres nothing so much to disturb onesself about and this manthis densonmay very well have deserved his fate dont you think that likely he added this last question with an involuntary eagerness that scarcely accorded with the indifferent tone with which he had begun i answered guardedly i said of course nobody could say what the unhappy mans sins might have been but that whatever they were they could never justify the fearful sin of murder and i added if you know anything of the matter mason or have the smallest suspicion as to who is the guilty person im sure you wont hesitate in your duty my duty he said oh yes of course my duty you mean of course that any lawabiding citizen who knows of evidence should bring it out just so of course i havent any evidencethat paper gave me the first news of the thing i think i rejoined that anybody who was possessed of even less than evidenceof any suspicion which might lead to evidenceshould go at once and place the authorities in possession of all he knows or suspects yes he saidvery calmly now though it seemed at cost of a great effortso he should so he should no doubt in any ordinary case but sometimes there are difficulties you knowgreat difficulties he stopped and looked at me furtively and uneasily a man might fear for his own safetyhe might even know that to say what he knew would be to condemn himself to sudden death and more perhaps more supposeit might be you knowsuppose for instance a man was placed between the alternatives of neglecting this duty and of breaking awell an oath a binding oath of a very seriousterriblecharacter an oath we will say made previously without any foreknowledge of the crime i said that any such oath taken without foreknowledge of the crime could not have contemplated such an event and that however wrong the taking of such an oath might have been in itself to assist in concealing such a crime as this murder was infinitely worseinfinitely worse than taking the oath and infinitely worse than breaking it though as to the latter i repeated that any such engagement made without contemplation or foreknowledge of such a crime would seem to be void in that respect i went furthermuch further i conjured him to make no secret of anything he might know and not to burden his conscience with complicityfor that was what concealment would amount toin such a terrible crime i added some further exhortations which i need not repeat now and presently his assumed calmness departed utterly and he became even more agitated than when first he came he would say nothing further however and in the end he went away saying he would think over the matter very seriously it was quite plain to me that my poor friend was suffering acutely from the burden of some terrible secret and that in his impulsive way he had rushed to confide in me at the first shock of the news of this murder and that afterwards his courage had failed him but i conceived it my duty not to allow such a matter to stand thus therefore giving mason a few hours for calm consideration i called on him in the evening i was told that he was not very well and had gone to bed he had however left a message in case i should call to the effect that he would come and see me in the morning i waited the whole of that next morning and the whole of the afternoon and saw nothing of him in the evening urgent parish work took me away but next morning i called again at masons house and saw him this time he avoided the subjecttried to dodge it in fact but i was not to be denied and the result was another scene of alternate agitation and forced calmness i will not weary you mr hewitt with useless repetition but i may say that i have seen mason twice since then without bringing him to any definite resolve as a matter of fact i believe that he is restrained from saying anything further by fearsheer terror he has even gone so far as to deny absolutely that he knows anything of the matterand then has contradicted himself a minute afterwards at last this morning i have brought him a degree further in the last few days i made it my business to acquaint myself as far as possible with the exact circumstances of the tragedy so far as they are known and in course of my inquiries i saw the housekeeper of the offices next doorthe man who identified the body as densons he either could not or would not tell me very much but he did say that you had been working in some way in connection with the case and that you knew as much of it as anybody that gave me an idea this morning i told mason that not only he but i also had a duty in respect to this matter and my duty was to see that nothing in connection with such a crime as this should be hushed up on any consideration or for anybodys fancies i said that if he liked he need tell me no more but might take you into consultation professionally as your client allowing me first to see you and to assure you that consistently with his own safety he was anxious to further the ends of justice i said that as your client your first duty would be to protect him that your professional practice would keep your mouth absolutely sealed and that you already knew a good deal about the crimeperhaps more than he suspected i protested that this seemed to me the very least he could do and i warned him that if he refused to do even this i should have to consider whether it was consistent with my character as a clergyman and a loyal citizen any longer to conceal the fact that he was keeping back information that might lead to the apprehension of the murderer this frightened him and between the fear of the threat and the fear that you might already know more than he suspected he authorised mehe was even eager about itto come and see you always of course under a pledge of strict professional secrecy so far your account is quite clear mr potswood hewitt said you have done your best now i must do mine you wish me to see mason at once no doubt i arranged to bring you to his house if you were willing and your engagements permitted at three this afternoon will that do i have been keeping you i seeit is past one already will you lunch with me at my club with great pleasuremore especially as i have a few questions to ask as we go along is it far just at this end of pall mallwe will walk if you like tell me now said hewitt as they went anything you know about mr masons habits family connections and so forth as fully and as minutely as you please has he any friends connected with china for instance china why no i think not exceptbut ill tell you all i know mr mason has no family connections so far as i am awareat any rate in londonexcept his niece miss creswick she is within a few months of twentyone a charming girl but horribly shut in for mason has almost no visitors miss creswick was his sisters daughter she lost her mother first and then her father and was left to the guardianship of her uncle he was also trustee under the will and he has i believe discretion to keep charge of her property if he thinks fit till she reaches the age of twentyfive though in case of his death she is to inherit in the ordinary way on coming of age she is a very dutiful and indeed an affectionate niece though i must say he is scarcely fair to her keeping her as he does so completely secluded from the society of young people of her own age mere thoughtlessness i think he has had no children of his own his mind is wholly occupied with his science and his fads and he makes himself a recluse without a thought of the girl and that brings me to what i was about to say at first when you asked me if mr mason had any friends connected with china there is a young doctorlawson is his namesome very distant connection of the family i think who had a professional appointment of some sort in shanghai for a year or two but who is now in london trying to work up a small practice of his own if you hadnt mentioned china i shouldnt have thought of him since he never goes to the house nowor at any rate is supposed not to go doesnt go to the house and why is that well there was a disagreement what it was i dont quite know but in the first place it had some connection with some of masons experimentssomething which lawson declined to help him with for professional reasons or else something he declined to do for lawson i dont know which but the thing went further for as a matter of fact there was something between the young peoplelawson is only twentyeightand mason put an end to that it had been something like a formal engagement i think but in the quarrelmason was always quarrelling with somebody when he had friends and thats why he has so few nowin the quarrel things were said that ended in a rupture whether young lawson was fortunehunting or not i cannot say but mason certainly accused him of it and promised to keep back the girls money as long as he could in the meantime mason declared an end to the engagement and poor helen was brokenhearted for as i have said she is an affectionate girl and she hadnt a friend to confide in but im boring youyou dont want to know all these things surely on the contrary i cant possibly know too much and the particulars cant possibly be too minute nine cases out of ten i bring to an issue by means of a triviality you were saying a little while back that there were almost no visitors at mr masons house but you said almost and that means there are some who are they very occasionallyrarely in factthere are one or two members of learned societies with whom he had been in correspondence or who are old friends there is a professor hutton and a dr burge i believe but they dont appear once in six months and there is mr everard myatt who is more frequent he does not profess to be a great man of science but he is interested in chemistry as an amateur and is i fancy a sort of disciple of masons he has noticed a sad difference in mason just lately and he even called on me yesterday though i hardly knew him by sight in the hope that i would back up his urgent suggestion that mason should go off for a change and a rest beyond these i dont think i know of a single visitor but here we are at the megatherium ii mr jacob masons house stood in its own grounds in a quiet suburban road it was not a very large house but it straggled about comfortably in the manner of detached houses built in the suburbs at a time when space was less valuable than now and it consisted of two floors only the front door was not far from the road and was clearly visible to passengers who might chance to look through either of the two iron gates that opened one on each end of the semicircular drive all these things martin hewitt noticed as the rev mr potswood pushed open one of these gates and the two walked up the drive the front door stood in a portico and a french window gave access to the roof of this portico from a bedroom or dressingroom as hewitt and his companion approached the house the french window was pushed open and a man appeareda middleaged slightly stoutish man with a short grey beard commonplace enough in himself but now convulsed with noisy anger shaking his fists and stamping on the porticoroof get out he shouted dont come near my house again or ill have you flung out go away and take your friends with you dyou hear go away sir and dont come here annoying me go go at once mr potswood absolutely staggered with amazement why he gasped its mason hes madclean mad why mason my poor friend dont you know me get out i say cried mason give me no more of your talk i wont have you here and now hewitt caught a glimpse of a girls face at the window behind the mana pale and handsome face drawn with anxiety and fear hewitt seized the clergyman quickly by the arm come he whispered hurriedly come away at once there is a reason for this get away at once if you can answer back angrily do so but at any rate come away he hurried back to the gate half dragging the astounded rector who was all too honest a soul to be able to counterfeit an anger he did not feel even if his amazement had not made him speechless hewitt closed the gate behind him and said as he walked where is the rectory we will go there he may have sent a message while you were out mechanically the rector took the first turning but hes mad he protested mad poor fellow merciful heavens mr hewitt his whole tale must have been a delusion a mere madmans fancy poor fellow we must go back mr hewittwe really must we cant leave that poor girl there alone with a raving maniac no hewitt insisted come to the rectory that is no madness mr potswood couldnt you see the colour of the man under the eyes and the shaking of his beard that was not anger and it was not madness it was terror mr potswoodsheer sick terror terror or some emotion very much like it but if terror why that outburst what does it mean if it were terror why not rather welcome our company and help dont you see mr potswood answered hewitt dont you guess mason is watched and he knows it he was acting his anger before unseen eyesand he knew they were on him god be merciful to us all ejaculated the clergyman poor manpoor sinner what is this unspeakable thing which has him in its clutches what had he done to give himself over to such a power we can tell nothing and guess nothing as yet hewitt answered let us see if he has sent you a message it seems likely if he has it may help us if notthen i think we must do something decisive at once but dont hurry so it is hard to restrain ones self i know but there may be eyes on us mr potswood and we must not seem to be persisting in our errand so they went through the quiet streets for the two or three furlongs that seemed so many miles to the good parson arrived at the rectory mr potswood pushed impatiently through the gate and was hurrying toward the house when he perceived a bent little old man standing among some shrubs with his own gardener who was digging theres masons gardener the rector exclaimed and went to meet him the old man touched his hat looked sharply towards hewitt who was waiting near the rectory door and then disappeared round a corner of the house the rector following in a few seconds mr potswood reappeared with a slip of paper in his hand here he said see this the old man was told to give it to nobody but me and in nobody elses presence hes been waiting since one oclock scrawled on the paper in trembling and straggling letters were these words you must not bring mr martin hewitt to my house this afternoon i am watched it is hopeless do not desert me bring him tonight after dark at eight i shall want his best skill and you shall know all after dark come to the back gate in the lane which will be ajar and through the conservatory at the side where my niece will be waiting at eight after dark burn this and do not let it out of your sight first send a line by this man to say you will do as i ask but do not say what it is for fear of accidents send at once do come at eight with mr hewitt we must do as he says remarked hewitt we know nothing of this matter and we must be guided till we do just write an unsigned noteall shall be as you request or words to that effect and be sure the man gives it to him let him out behind through the churchyard if possible and tell him not to go straight from one house to the other is he an intelligent man yesuncommonly shrewd i believe he says he cant have been followed he knows several gardeners hereabout and he seems to have called on each of them on his wayin at the front of the garden and out at the back each time after a few minutes conversation gipps is rather a cunning old fellow ah said hewitt admiringly thats the sort of messenger i often want ill give him half a crown for himself and the money to pay for a telegram on his way he knows nothing essential of course noonly that his master is in some sort of trouble and warned him that he might be followed that is good i shall telegraph to detectiveinspector plummer of scotland yard all righti quite understand that all i have heard is confidential i shall tell plummer nothing till i mayindeed as yet i have very little to tell that would help him but i think it will be well to have the police within callwe may want them at a moments notice i have no police powers you see and plummer has the denson case in hand i will ask him to be here at this house before a quarter to eight if you will allow me and so the telegram went to plummer and hewitt accepting the rectors invitation to an early dinner before starting on their visit resigned himself to wait he did not like the waste of time as he frankly told mr potswood he would have preferred to see mason at once at any risk and to take what means he thought necessary without delay but as it seemed that the risk was to be chiefly masons and as mason knew all of which both he and the rector were ignorant mason must be allowed to choose his own time the excellent mr potswood endured agonies of suspense though he also insisted that masons wishes must be observed exactly what is it allwhat can it be he ejaculated again and again what dreadful influence can thus compass a man about here in london in these times it was autumn and night fell early dinner was over at last and they had scarcely left the table when plummer arrived anxious and eager youll have to trust me a little plummer hewitt said when he had made him known to the rector i can tell you nothing nowknow nothing in fact or very little more than nothing the fact is im going to see a man who promises information to me alone in confidence as his client and i dont know how long i may have to keep you in the dark but this is where the trail lies hot and i know thats where you want to be more if youre wanted suddenly youll be at hand you have a man or two with you i suppose as i suggested three of the best of them they will follow us up is it far no close enough it is a house in a walled gardennot a high wall we go in at a gate from the lane behind and i think you should wait at that gate and put your men at hand we mustnt go in as a crowd the rector had better go first and you and i will follow on the opposite side of the road so the procession was formed and it was still some three minutes short of eight oclock when hewitt and plummer joined the clergyman at the door in the garden wall behind masons house the door was ajar as had been promised in masons note leaving plummer on guard without martin hewitt and the rector stepped as silently as possible through the little kitchen garden and across a strip of lawn toward where a dull light illuminated the conservatory at the righthand end of the house the door of the conservatory was ajar also and this the rector pushed open miss creswick the rector called in a loud whisper miss creswick and with that a girl appeared within oh mr potswood she said im so glad youve come i cant think whats wrong with poor uncle im afraid he must be going mad he is terrified at something and he has been getting worse till he could hardly speak or walk dr lawson has beenabout an hour ago and since then uncle has been much quieter in his study they were entering the dimlylighted drawingroom now dr lawson queried the rector rather an unusual visitor isnt he how long has he been gone miss creswick flushed slightly through all her paleness and grief i dont know she said he let himself out i fancy he said he could not stay long when he came but i didnt hear him go i have been upstairs and the servants are in the kitchenthey say uncles mad and im really afraid he is they left the drawingroom and walked along the corridor and the hall to the opposite side of the house where the study lay miss creswick tapped gently at the door but there was no answer she tapped again louder and then came the faint sound of a quick step on the carpet and then a slight scraping noise as when a door is closed over a carpet it will scarcely pass thats the window into the garden said miss creswick why is he going out uncle uncle jacob but now the silence was wholly unbroken hewitt snatched quickly at the doorhandle locked he said comethe quickest way into the garden they ran out at the front door and round toward the study window it was a french window exactly at the opposite end of the house to the conservatory and now the gaslight streamed out through one half of it which stood curtainless and ajar while the curtain was drawn across the other half hewitt was the least familiar with the place but he was quickest on his legs and more seriously alarmed than the others he reached the window firstand instantly turned and thrust the rector back against miss creswick quick take her away he said we are too late and in the same moment even as hewitt dashed over the threshold he snatched a whistle from his pocket and blew his hardest there on the floor lay mason his face dreadful and staring and black tight in his neck was the band of a tourniquet and fresh and wet on his forehead was the red triangle hewitt snatched at the screw of the tourniquet behind the neck and loosened it as quickly as hands could turn but it was too late too late the examining surgeon afterwards said by a quarter of an hour plummer was at the window with his men at his heels even before the tourniquet was half unscrewed round the wall of the garden shouted hewitt and whistle up the police hes only this moment out the house was alive with shouts and screams the rector came running back and hewitt busy with his useless attempt at restoration called now for a doctor people were scampering in the street and hewitt left the victim to the care of the rector and himself joined plummer all in fewer seconds than it may be told in but plummer and his men were beaten for nothingnot so much as a moving shadowwas seen in the garden or about the walls worse the general trampling would obliterate possible tracks plummer set a guard of police about the wall and came in for consultation with hewitt the body was carried into another room and hewitt and plummer began an examination of the study no signs of a struggle commented plummer and there was no noise they say thats very odd from what i have seen and heard today said hewitt it is as i should have expected i believe the man was almost killed by terror before he was strangleddazed stricken dumb paralysed deafened by iteverything but blinded poor wretch and to have been blinded would have been a mercy and then as they made their examination systematically calmly and without flurry hewitt told the whole tale of his days adventures together with all he had heard from the rector the mans dead he said and his confidence is at an end indeed i never had itthe case so far as i am concerned is over before i have even touched it i havent had a chance plummer and the thing is deep and dark deep and dark oh if only the man had let me come to him in the daylight spite of all this might all have been averted there has been a close search here too see how everything is turned over but stay a low fire smouldered in the grate and on it lay ashes of many burnt papers hewitt passed the shovel carefully under these ashes lifted them out and placed them gently on the table under the light of the gaspendant i must leave you said plummer therell be an inspector here from the station in a momenthe wont interfere with you and if anybody can get information out of this room its you the next thing for me is plain i must make sure of dr lawson if he can be found that is quite right without a doubt hewitt responded i may find anything or nothing in this room and meanwhile he was the last person known to have been here and the only visitor and he was not heard to go out unless we heard him go when we were outside the study door more it was plainly some one familiar with the place who was able to get away so quickly by the window and the garden and his interest in getting rid of mason toothe girl of age in a few months and all obstacles to getting hold of her and her money removed andand the surgical tourniquet the chinese colour and everything quite right you must make sure of him as you say you will get his address from the rector meanwhile ill try to begin my little contribution to the caseto begin it as best i can after all the chances have made it useless iii it was after nine when plummer returned the rector had just rejoined hewitt in the study having left poor miss creswick utterly broken down in her room in charge of a scarcely less terrified servant plummer tapped and pushed the study door open thats done clean and sure enough he said with professional calmness and hes a cool hand is that dr lawson but have you found anything more we shall want all we can get we shall hewitt assented and we shall find more than weve got now or im grievously mistaken but tell me first what youve done he removed the blotting pad on which the paper ashes still lay and very carefully shut it away in a wide drawer where no draught could disturb it he also shut another drawer which stood open we had no difficulty in finding dr lawson plummer began we met him in fact leaving his surgery i went back with him into the gaslight and there put it to him plump well he was staggered badly any man would be of course but he pulled himself together wonderfully soon and the first thing he said was that he was just on his way to masons house i thought at first of course that he meant to deny that he had been there already and i gave him the usual warning about what he said being used in evidence but he went on and ive got it all safely noted he admitted that he had been here at about seven oclock or just before and he said he came because mr mason sent for him that doesnt seem likely does it on the facts as we know them why no said the rector the last time he was here he was ordered out and i know of no reason why he should have been asked to come today we must ask if anybody was sent i have asked replied plummer just now and none of the servants was sent but lawsons story is that he was sent for and came though he said he shouldnt say what mason wanted to see him about till he knew more of the case looks as though he hadnt quite got his story ready yet doesnt it he had thought over the point about not being seen to go away though he said he had let himself out at about halfpast seven being familiar with the ways of the house and he said that mason was rather unwellnervously upsetwhen he left him but that was all its terrible said the rector terrible it seems impossible to believe it of young lawson and yetand yet and then after a pausegood heavens he burst out again why i only realise it now there is the other crime too denson two murders twoand most certainly by the same hand mr plummer i cant believe it oh theres more behind more behind mr hewitt there is more said hewitt as you will see when i tell you the little i have been able to ascertain there is more behind though i see little of it yet first there was a sharp knock at the front door followed by a ring muffled in the distant kitchen hewitt started up who is this late visitor at this unvisited house he said if it is the police well enough but if anybody elseanybodyyou may call me doctor or anything you please except martin hewitt dont forget that there were hurried steps in the hall a question or two and the study door was pushed open two servantsthey would not venture from the kitchen singly this dreadful nightmade a confused announcement of mr myatt and were instantly pushed aside by mr myatt himself anxious and agitated the late mr masons closest scientific friend was a palish blackbearded man of above middle height with stooping shoulders and a very quick pair of eyes there was something about his face that somehow reminded hewitt of portraits he had seen of john knox and yet it was not such a face as his it seemed oddly unlike in its very likeness what is this dreadful news mr potswood he cried i heard people talking in the next street on my way home is it true but the servants have told me so they say our poor friendbut there has been an arrest hasnt there the rector nodded gravely and who tell me about it mr potswoodtell me i think i must see how miss creswick is doing said hewitt speaking across to plummer and making for the door certainly doctor certainly answered plummer with a nod hewitt closed the door behind him leaving the rector in the full tide of his account of the days events but hewitts way took him to the kitchen where the servants were cowering and whispering together frightened and bewildered is there any paint or varnish of any sort in the place he asked sharply give me anything there isblack if possibleand a brush quickly therestheres brunswick black sir for the stove said the cook that will do be quick oh theres gipps the gardener youre just the man i want gipps come and find me a board or a plank quick as you please and hewitt pushed the old gardener before him into the garden by the kitchen door a quarter of an hour later mr everard myatt having heard all that was to be told of his friends terrible death and the arrest of mr lawson turned to go meeting hewitt at the study door on his way and how is poor miss creswick by now doctor he asked anxiously hewitt shook his head no better than you could expect he said but on the whole no worse she mustnt be seen tonight of course but perhaps if you could call round in the morning with the rector of courseof course poor girland dr lawson suspected toowhat a terrible blow for her anything i can do doctor of course as i said to mr potswoodanything i can do i will do as gladly as such sad circumstances permit the rector had been coming to the door with mr myatt but plummer catching a sign from hewitt restrained him unseen and hewitt and the visitor walked into the hall together they have put out the light it seems hewitt said i wonder whyunless people from the crowd have been coming into the garden and staring in through the glass panels i wonder if we can find the doorhandle yes here it is dark outside too goodnightmind how you go on the steps mr myatt checked and stumbled in the dark porch and reached quickly downward theres a board standing across the porch he said a board replied hewitt so there is let me move it or itll upset somebody goodnight mr myatt strode off into the dark night and hewitt noiselessly lifting the board he had himself placed in position hastened back to the study he swung up the board all sticky and shiny with brunswick black and laid it across a spread newspaper on the table there on the top in the midst of the black varnish were the prints of all five fingertips of a hand where mr myatt had felt for the obstruction in the porch hewitt opened the drawer he had shut a little while back and took therefrom a sheet of writingpaper and when with the lens from his pocket he began to examine that paper in comparison with the fingermarks on the board plummer and the rector could see that there were also two distinct fingermarks on the paper and one faint oneall red plummer came to look whats this he said was this what you were going to tell us about hewitt did not reply for a few moments but continued his examination then he rose and turned to plummer youve still got that piece of paper in your pocket i suppose he said with the little red smudges of colour put there by the police surgeon yeshere it is and the detective took it from his waistcoat pocket thanks said hewitt now see here that is a little of the red stuff taken from the mark on densons forehead a week ago and found to consist of vermilion oil and wax you have seen the second impression of that awful mark on the forehead of your poor friend mason mr potswood tonight this room has been searched for papers before we began and papers have been burnt in the search this drawer was openedcontaining as you see nothing but a supply of new headed notepaper the notepaper was hastily lifted to see if anything else lay beneath and here on the bottom sheet these fingermarks were left in that same adhesive freely marking reda sort of stuff that sticks to and marks whatever it touches the hand that lifted that paper was the hand that impressed that ghastly mark and the hand that left its print on this black varnish was mr everard myatts now compare the two plummer had snatched the lens and was narrowly comparing the marks ere hewitt had well finished speaking they are he cried as the rector bent excitedly over him they are the same seeforefinger and middle fingerthe same every line i neednt tell you pursued hewitt certainly i neednt tell plummer that that is the most certain and scientific method of identification known the police know thatand use it but now there is some more you saw me take that charred paper from the fire sometimes words may be read on charred paperit depends on the paper and the ink most of the cinders were too much broken to yield any information though we may try again by daylight but one was suggestive see it hewitt very carefully pulled out the flat drawer that held the cinders you see he went on that onethisis different from the rest it has retained its original form better and has been less broken because of being of thicker paper it is a crumpled envelope look at the flapit has never been closed down moreover on that same flap you may read in embossed letters still visible part of the name of this house plain inferencethis was an envelope intended for a letter never sent and so crumpled up and dropped into the wastepaper basket but why should such an apparently unimportant thing as that be carefully brought from the wastepaper basket and burnt somebody was anxious that the smallest scrap of paper evidencing a certain correspondence should be destroyed but look closely at the front of the envelopethe ink shows a rather lighter grey than the paper the address is incompleteat any rate no more than some of the first line and a little of the second is at all visible now but it is plain that the first line begins with an e the letters immediately following are not distinct but next there is a capital m beginning a name which is clearly myatt or myall now that is why when myatt came here i took the first steps to hand to get an impression of his fingertips in order to compare them with the marks on that paper but why asked the astonished rector why did he come back nothing but a bold measure to see how things were goinghe came as his own spy thats all hes a keen and dangerous man dont you remember telling me how he called on you yesterday though you hardly knew him by sight merely to ask you to persuade mason to take a holiday it struck me as a little odd at the time he was pumping you mr potswoodhe wanted to find what mason had been saying and he is not aloneplainly he is not alone for poor mason knew they were watching everywhere but comethis is no time for speculation plummeryou must hold him safelywell pick up evidence enough when youve got him i wouldnt leave it plummerid take him tonight youre rightright as usual mr hewitt plummer agreed more especially as the rector waswell a little incautious in talking to him just now i what did i say mr potswood asked astonished i had no suspicionshow could i have no mr potswood the detective replied you had no suspicions and for that very reason in the excitement of the narrative you called mr martin hewitt by his right name at least twice and after i had called him doctor too he added regretfully is that so asked hewitt the poor rector was sadly abashed but i really wasnt aware of it mr hewitt he protested i hardly think i couldbut there perhaps i did of course if inspector plummer remembers it hell be off exclaimed hewitt with that hint and finding the black stuff on his hands hell smell a rat instantly come mr potswoodyou can show us the nearest way to his house at any rate comewe may get him yet but the good rectors slip of the tongue was fatal and myatt was not yet to meet the fate that fitted him the house was not farless than a mile away it was a detached house but quite a small onesmaller than masons plummer blocked every exit with a man but his caution was wasted myatt was gone there was the house and the furniture and two servants just as it might have been any day in the year when myatt was out for an hour but now he was out for good the police watched and waited all night and all the next day they waited and watched for a week and the house was under observation after that but myatt never returned he had made his plans it was plain for just such a flight whenever the necessity might arise and when he was assured that danger threatened he simply vanished in the dark of a london night search brought no informationnot a scrap of telltale paper lay in calton lodgenot a letter not a line though indeed the police were to see more of myatts work yetand so was hewitt dr lawsons detention did not last the night out the unhappy mason had indeed sent to him by a chance messenger having grown desperate in long waiting for the return of gipps from the rectory mason was ready to call in any aid to recall any of the friendships he had sacrificed in the past but lawson was long in coming having received the note after a long professional round and when at last he arrived mason was a little reassured by the promise of hewitts visit therefore he did not tell the doctor so much as he might have done nevertheless he talked wildly and vaguely so that dr lawson feared some disturbance of his reason the doctor quieted and soothed him however and when he left he promised to return after his consultation hour at the surgery was over he must have been watched away from the house and then the blow fell that sealed for ever the lips of jacob mason poor miss creswick was taken from the old house in which she could no longer remain and for a few months she stayed at the rectory tended lovingly by the rectors excellent wifestayed there in fact till her weddingday which took place early the next year so that for her and dr lawson the tragedy ended in happiness after all god forgive me cried the rector in the grey of the morning when it became clear that myatt had escapedgod forgive me through my stupidity a horrible creature has been set loose in the world to work his diabolical will afresh never mind said hewitt it was not stupidity mr potswoodnothing but your openness of character you were not trained to the cunning that we must use in my profession and there will be more than myatt to takehe was not alone it is plain that mason was found to be wavering in whatever horrible allegiance he had bound himself and he was watched no myatt was not alone no i fear not replied the clergyman i fear not there is horrible mystery still the watching and besetting that terrified him so much the fact that he seems to have yielded up his life without a struggleand that with help so near and the connectionwhat could it have beenbetween mason and the other victimdenson that is a deep mystery indeed and that horrible sign mr hewitt you have done muchbut not all no replied martin hewitt not nearly all it is even doubtful whether or not it will be my lot to come across the thing again but it will be in the hands of the police and after all we have achieved something for we know that if myatt can be captured we shall be at the heart of the mystery the case of the lever key i in some of the cases which we now know to have been connected with the red triangle there was nothing in the first place to show any such association in some of these cases the connection has become apparent only since the final clearing up of the whole mystery and with these cases we have no present concern but in others it revealed itself during the investigation of the case it was to this second category that the next case belongedthe next at all connectible that is after that of the mysterious death of mr jacob mason and the flight of everard myatt the case was remarkable in other respects also first because in one of its features it had a resemblance to the case of samuels diamonds which first brought the red triangle to hewitts notice next because in its course hewitt encountered what he declared to be the most ingenious and baffling cryptogram that he had ever seen in the length of his strange experience and thirdly because i was the means of placing that cryptogram in his hands owing to one of those odd chances that arise again and again in real lifeare indeed so common as to pass almost unregardedand yet might be thought improbable if offered in the guise of a mere story hewitt has often alluded to the curious persistence of such chances in his experience i think i have elsewhere mentioned a certain police officers prolonged search after a criminal for whose arrest he held a warrant ending in the discoverybecause of a misdirected callthat the man had been living all the time next door to himself and i have also told of the other detective inspector who being sent in search of a criminal of whom he had but the meagrest and most unsatisfactory particulars and whom he scarcely hoped ever to run down actually fell over the man as he was leaving the office where he had received his information in the doorway of which the fellow had stooped to tie his shoelace but as hewitt would say nothing but the exceptional nature of the surrounding circumstances makes these things seem extraordinary what more ordinary experience for example than to meet a friend in some london streetperhaps one friend of the only dozen or so you have among the four millions of people about you the odds against you two of all the millions choosing the one street of the thousands in london to walk down at the same minute of time would seem incalculable and yet the chance comes off so often as to be a matter of the most ordinary experience on this occasion i was expecting orders from my editor to produce certain articles on the subject of the london hospitals it will be remembered that the matter was very much in the air a few years ago and as nothing is professionally more uncomfortable than to be called on suddenly for an accurate and reasonable leading article on a subject one knows nothing about i wrote to my friend barton mccarthy who is housesurgeon at st augustines and he replied by an offer to tell me anything i cared to ask if i would call at the hospital i set out accordingly some little time after a breakfast even later than ordinary and called in at hewitts office on my way downstairs to say that i should not be lunching at our usual place that day no hewitt answered nor shall i i expect im off to the city at once i have an urgent message to go immediately to kingsley bell and daltons in broad street where a big bond robbery has just been discovered perhaps i can give you a lift in my cab we hurried off together accordingly hewitt knew nothing of the case he had to examine and so could tell me nothing beyond the short urgent request that he would come at once and that the matter involved the loss of bonds to a very large amount and he dropped me at a convenient spot whence my walk to the hospital was but a short one i saw my friend mccarthy and bothered him very successfully for nearly an hour getting all the information i had expected and more during a very interesting walk through the great hospital you get some idea in a place like this said mccarthy as we came at last into the receiving room for accident cases you get some idea brett of the size of this great london machine working about us you might walk about the streets for a week and never see a serious accident or even an accident at all and yet you see here they come all day longa stream of people damaged or killed in the machine a decent workman was having a gashed hand dressed and strapped and a navvy with bandages about his head was being led away by a friend nurses and dressers were waiting ready to take their orderly turns at the incoming casualties and as we looked a more serious case was brought in on an ambulance by two policemen the patient was a ragged disreputablelooking fellow of middle age in grimy and tattered clothes whose head had been roughly bandaged by the policemen who brought him he had been knocked down and kicked on the head by a butchers carthorse it seemed in moorgate street and he was quite insensible a very short examination showed that the case was nothing trivial and mccarthy sent me to sit in his private room to wait lunch while he gave the matter his personal attention when he returned he brought a small crumpled envelope in his hand that case is put to bed he said still insensible is it very bad i asked slight fracture of the occipital and of course concussion of the brainprobably contusion too i expect we shall find presently not so over serious for a healthy man but im afraid hes an old soakerthe sort that crumple up at a touch nobody knows him and theres nothing to identify him in the pocketsa few coppers an old knife and so on so we cant send to tell his friendsunless we bring in your friend martin hewitt to trace em out which would come too expensive besides mccarthy added dropping into a seat before his desk if hes got any friends theyll come sooner or later when they miss him this is the only thing hed got beside whats in the pocketshed been sent on a message probably my friend held up the crumpled envelope and took from it a small key hed got this envelope gripped tightly in his hand he said but there was no address on it so we tore it open in the hope of finding one inside but there was nothing there but the key if you were a very promising pupil of your friend hewitt i should expect you to take a glance at it and tell us the mans address at once together with his age birthplace when vaccinated and the residence of his maternal grandmother but youre not so ill let you off mccarthy turned the key idly about in his hand and tried it on a lock in his desk stopped up he remarked withdrawing it and peeping into the barrel not dirt eitherstopped up with paper whats that for he took a pin to clear the barrel and the paper came away quite readily it was a tight little roll which the surgeon pulled out into a small strip rather less than three inches long and about halfaninch broad hullo he exclaimed look here heres a job for martin hewitt after all figures what does that mean and what an amazing place to put them in a key barrel by jove brett this looks like one of your favourite adventures somebody sends a key in an envelope and a row of incomprehensible figures rolled up inside the key look at it i took the key and the paper the key was of a good sort small inscribed tripps patent on the bow and it evidently belonged to a superior lever lock the paper which had come from the barrel was very thin and tougha kind i have seen used in typewriters it had been very carefully and closely rolled and then pushed into the key so that its natural tendency to open out held it tightly within written upon it with a fine pen appeared a series of very minute figures thus well inquired mccarthy what do you make of it not much as yet i admitted but its pretty certain it must be a cryptogram or codewriting of some sort and if thats the case i think i might back myself to read itwith a little time for i well remembered the case of the flitterbat lancers and the lesson in cypherreading which hewitt then gave me come my friend replied much interested lets see how you do it meantime well get on with our lunch i took a pencil and a spare sheet of paper and i studied those figures all through lunch and for some little time after it soon became plain that the problem was much more difficult than it looked and i said so at the first glance i said it looked a fairly easy cypher but as a matter of fact i dont think its easy at all one assumes of course that the figures stand for letters and on that assumption two or three peculiarities are noticeable first the highest number written here is so that all the letters indicated in whatever order they may come are within the compass of the twentysix letters of the alphabet next the numbers most frequently repeated if we except the noughts are and which occur seven times each now the vowel most frequently occurring in average english writing is e and you will at once perceive that e is number five in the alphabet counting from the beginning more if we go on counting so we shall find that is t which is one of the most frequently occurring consonants this would seem to hint that the cypher is of the very simplest description consisting of the mere substitution of figures for letters in the exact order of the alphabet but what then of the noughts what can they mean more especially when we consider that in three places there are actually four noughts in succession for of course no letter is repeated four times successively in any english word nor in any foreign word that i can imagine but let us put down the letters in substitution for the figures on the supposition that the figures stand for letters in their alphabetical order leaving the noughts as they are then we get this i rapidly pencilled the letters on the spare paper thusi h n d t r e i o s t c i h e c w e m n s s t f a e t c v a o r e a h t k r i e t l e w n n a a t see there i said now i can make nothing of that when i come to examine the comparative frequency of the different letters i find them much as they might be expected to be in a sentence of normal english and any change would destroy the proportion e and t are the most frequent and then come a n i r s and c but as they stand they all mean nothing it is possible that this may be one of the difficult variable letter cyphers which hewitt might read but i cant but even then if the values of the letters change as they would do they would get out of their normal proportions of frequency so that a variable letter cypher seems unlikely and there is another oddity look and you will see that counting the noughts in the letters go in groups of eight with a semicolon at the end of each group now it is impossible that the message can be a sentence in which every word has exactly eight lettersor at least i should think so it can scarcely be that the semicolon itself means a letterit would be singular for one letter to occur with such curious regularity as that there is no other visible division between the words nor any single one of the usual aids by which the reader of secret cypher is able to take a hold of his work no im afraid i must give it up for the present at any rate but i really think it is a thing that would vastly interest hewitt if i might show it to him i suppose i mustnt well mccarthy answered perhaps it isnt strictly according to rule but i think i might venture to lend it to you till tomorrow if that will do indeed i think on second thoughts that i may consider myself quite justified since it may lead to the mans identification and it will be a sufficient answer to any inquiry to say that i have shown it to mr martin hewitt for that purpose but youll be careful of it wont you do you want the key too i think if i may i will take the key and the envelope all together you can never tell what may or what may not help him and the three things may hang together and perhaps explain each other in some mysterious way very goodheres the whole bag of tricks its a queer business altogether and i must say i feel inquisitive certainly if hewitt can get anything out of those figures i shall be mighty curious to know how he does it youll come in again tomorrow then i promised i would and walked off with the crumpled envelope the little key and the puzzling strip of figures since the lesson from hewitt which i have alluded to i had often amused myself with cryptogram reading and i had never found a cypher message in a newspaper agonycolumn the meaning of which i could not get at with a little trouble but this was something altogether beyond me and if i have any reader who prides himself on his ability to read secret cypher i recommend him to try his skill on this one before he reads further the circumstances too seemed as puzzling as the writing itself why if any person wished to send a note and a key in a closed envelope should he take the trouble to pack the note inside the key why especially when the note was already written in so baffling a cypher whither had this ragged messenger been going with the mysterious package and who had sent him and why guessing and musing i reached home and found that hewitt had returned before me i made my way into his office and came on him sitting at his desk with a large lens attentively examining a broken brass padlock am i bothering you i asked are you on the bond robbery now martin hewitt nodded with a jerk of the hand toward the padlock its a tough job he said and i shall shut myself up presently and think hard over it just now i cant see my way into it at all but what have you got there never mind i said youre too busy now i came across something very odd at the hospital which i thought would interest youthats all very well let me see it i havent begun my bout of cogitation yet show me i put the envelope the key and the paper on the table before him hewitt with a glance of surprise picked up the key and examined it thats curious he said and straightway began fitting the key to the broken padlock on the desk why man alive he cried with a sudden burst of excitement where did you get this thisthis is the articlethe keythe very thing i want he sprang to his feet and stared in my face in sheer amazement heavens brett the things almost supernatural ive a broken lever padlock here and of all things in the world i wanted to find the one key that fitted it and you calmly walk in and clap down the very thing under my nose where did you get it i told him the tale of the man who had been knocked down in moorgate street and i explained exactly how the paper the key and the envelope were found in relation to each other and why i had brought them and when was the man knocked over hewitt asked some time between one and two oclock i should say i replied they brought him in well before two at any rate hewitt stared into vacancy for a moment thinking hard then he said brett i believe youve saved my reputationnot that it could have suffered much perhaps in such a desperate case but as a fact i had already advised the calling in of the police and should perhaps even have given up the part of the case still left me but this ought to put me on the proper track you see every one of these patent lever locks differs in some slight degree from all the rest and only its own key will fit it and here by this amazing piece of good luck is the one key for this very lock and the man who had it is detained in hospital come im off to see him insensible you say when you left yes i answered and likely to be so for some time mccarthy thinks so you probably wont get much information out of him just yet but the cypher ill examine the cypher as i go along i think but i should like to take a look at the man at any rate even if he cant tell me anything will you give me a note to your friend mccarthy of course i answered readily and sat down to scribble the few lines necessary to introduce hewitt when i had finished hewitt who had been examining the cryptogram meanwhile remarked this cypher is something out of the common brett i certainly dont expect to be able to read it in the cabjourneyperhaps not in a week of study the man who devised this is a man of abilities altogether beyond the average i have had my best try at it i said but it beats me wholly i brought it purely as a matter of curiosity to show you it was the merest chance that i brought the key as well and if you hadnt i should probably have put the cypher aside until the case was over and so have missed the whole thing another lesson never to despise what seem like trifles if you have studied the cypher you have no doubt observedbut there well talk that over afterwards and the whole case if you like ill go now and ill tell you all about the business when time permits ii here is the case of the bond robbery as it had been presented to martin hewitt that morning while i was at st augustines hospital and as i learned it from him later i had been a little puzzled to hear hewitt say that the case had seemed so desperately hopeless that he advised the calling in of the police because my experience had rather been that it was hewitt who was commonly called inoften too latewhen the police were beaten and i had never before heard of a case in which this order of things was reversed it turned out however as will be seen that in the state of the matter as it first presented itself the only measures that seemed possible were such as it was in the power of the police alone to adopt messrs kingsley bell and dalton were an oldestablished firm of brokers whose operations were not enormous nor much in the eye of the public but who carried on a steady and reputable business in a set of offices high up in a great building in broad streeta building so large that the notice offices to let was a permanent fixture in the front porch the firms clients were chiefly steadygoing investors of the oldfashioned sort who wished to avoid all speculative fireworks and to deal through a firm whose habits were conformable to their own the last kingsley had left the firm and soon afterward died some few years back and now the head of the firm was mr robert stanstead bell a gentleman of some sixty years of age there were a couple of sleeping partnersrelationsbut the one other active partner was mr clarence dalton a young man but recently advanced to partnership and it was said likely to become mr bells soninlaw whenever the old gentlemans daughter lilian should be married the steady even round of business to which kingsley bell and dalton and their clerks were accustomed was suddenly interrupted by an appalling loss it was discovered that bonds were missing from the safe bonds to the amount of some l and whence how or when they were taken was an utter mystery it was this loss which had occasioned the urgent message to hewitt when hewitt reached the spot he was shown at once into an inner office where mr bell sat waiting the old gentleman was in a sad state of agitation and it was with some difficulty that hewitt got from him a reasonably connected account of the trouble the loss comes at such a time mr hewitt the senior partner explained that i dont know but it may ruin us utterly unless my clients property can be recovered we have had to pay out heavy sums of late to the representatives of dead or retiring partners and other circumstances combine with these to make the matter in this way even more terribly serious than the very large amount of the loss would seem to suggest so i beg you will do what you can that of course responded hewitt but please tell me as clearly as you can the precise circumstances of the case where were the bonds taken from this safe mr bell answered turning toward a very large and heavy one which might almost have been called a small strong room they were kept together with others in this box one of several as you see the box was fastened like the rest with a tripps patent lever padlock the only key of which i kept together with the key of the safe the box indicated was one of ordinary thin sheet iron japanned blacksomething like what is called a deed box the padlock has been broken open i see hewitt observed yes but i did that myself this morning it had been blocked up in some way so that the key wouldnt turndoubtless in order to cause delay when next the box should come to be opened as it was i might have desisted and put off opening it till later but i had a reason for wishing to refer at once to a list which was in the box and so i decided to break the padlock it was more difficult than one might expect with such a small padlock and then you discovered your loss then i discovered the loss mr hewitt though it was a mere chance even then for see all the bonds have not been taken and those left are placed on the top while the space below is filled with dummies i hardly know why i turned them overfor the list was at the topbut i did and then mr bell finished with a despairing gesture and this was some time this morning at about halfpast eleven and when did you last open the box before that ten days ago at least i should thinkand even then the bonds may have been gone for i only opened it to refer to the same list and i examined nothing else you say that some bonds are left and others are gone i presume those taken are such as would be easy to negotiate and those left are such as would be difficult is that the fact precisely then the thief evidently knows the ropes and altogether the matter would seem awkward for anything short of ten days you see and quite possibly for even a longer time than that these bonds have been in the undisturbed possession of some person who could easily dispose of them and would certainly do so without a moments delay mr bell nodded sadly quite true he said but now tell me a little more you say you yourself keep the only key of the padlock as well as the key of the safe so that you open the safe every morning yourself and close it at night just so and do you never entrust the keys to anybody else the key of the safe is on a separate bunch from the key of the box this second bunch with the key of the box is always in my pocket and not a soul else ever touches it the other bunch with the outer key of the safe i sometimes hand to my partner or to the head clerk mr foster if something is wanted from the safe when i am busy though as a rule the safe door is open so long as i am about the place nothing but the books can be taken out without the use of other keys for the drawers and boxes which i keep on the private bunch and would it be possible for anybodyanybody at all mindto get at that private bunch of keys in such a way for instance as to be able to take a wax impression of the key of that bondbox no certainly not mr bell answered with decision certainly not at any rate not in this office he added ah not in this office anywhere else no nor anywhere else i should think the other replied though this time a little more thoughtfully theres only my own family at home and the servants and anybody who has access to this room of the office hewitt asked keenly mr bell seemed a little startled why no he said nobody at home comes to the officenot even a visitor except of course my junior partner who visits the room pretty frequently very well you dont remember ever mislaying the keys temporarily i suppose either here or at home noo mr bell replied slowly i cant say that i do remember anything of the sort noand i believe i should be sure to remember if i had ah and when you realised your loss what did you do told your partner first i suppose nohe doesnt know of the discovery he went out just before i made it and i dont expect him in again today but as mr bell spoke there grew plain in his face the pallor of a new fear martin hewitt observed it but kept his thoughts to himself well he said you didnt tell your partner nor the police no mr hewitt you see of course the first thing the police attempt is to catch and punish the thief and they make the recovery of the property a subsidiary object but for me mr hewitt the recovery of the property as i have explained is the one great consideration punish the thief by all means but first save me from ruin mr hewitt that is why i sent for you for that and because i thought it might be advisable to keep the matter quiet till you had taken some steps there is something in that consideration certainly so you have told nobody of the loss except me nobody but foster my head clerkan old and faithful servant it was he in fact who suggested sending for you as he put it very forcibly you can act for me and my interests while the police act for themselves andvery properly of course as policein the interest of the community very well i see you have several clerks in the outer office do they ever come into this room never unless they are sent for if you and your partner were out and one of the clerks came in without being sent for the rest would know it of course certainly i observe three private rooms opening out of this what are they this is a sort of extra inner room where i have private interviews with clientsi was in there with a client for half an hour this morning before i discovered the loss the next is a mere little box of a room where the correspondence clerk sits and works the other is a larger placeit is shared between my partner mr clarence dalton and the head clerk mr foster now let me have your broken padlockand the key i see you have forced up the front plate with a screwdriver i will borrow that screwdriver if you please and force it off completely hewitts client produced a screwdriver from a drawer and in a very few moments the interior of the little padlock lay uncovered hewitt examined the lock attentively for some few minutes trying the key several times against the levers then he stood up and said mr bell you have made a mistake this is not your lock at all not my lock exclaimed the broker what do you mean i tell you it is the lock of that box and i broke it open myself yes answered hewitt calmly it was on that box and you broke it open yourself but all the same it is not your lock let me explain these are very good little padlocks with an excellent lever action dogged against detent as the technical phrase goes so that only the key properly made for each lock will open it they are so good indeed as locks that it would be a waste of time to try picking them when because of their small size it is so very easy to break them apart just as you have done yourself and just as i could probably have done in half the time having had rather more experience now that is what has been done with your lock by the person who has your bonds but of course a broken lock has one disadvantage as compared with a skilfully picked lockit shows at the first glance what has happened in this case mr bell your lock has been broken and taken away and the thief having first provided himself with another padlock of precisely the same make and size has substituted that locked it with its proper key and so left it what then that was why that of course was why you supposed it to be out of order when you attempted to open it with your key as a matter of fact it is even now in perfectly good order except for the damage we have jointly committed with the screwdriver and now observe that lock was shut by another key if the man that did that is as sharp as i suppose he is he will have got rid of that key at once but perhaps he hasnt and if not then the man who has that key is the thief at any rate the key is the clue we must hunt for let us have your clerks in one by one and look at their keys some are out at lunch by this time probably noi said they might be wanted so kept them i thought you might prefer to see them before they went out very well thought of but perhaps scarcely judicious on the whole because if there is a guilty person among them it may give him a hint and the odds are rather against its being very useful considering the possibilityeven probabilitythat the bonds and the collateral evidence left here days ago but well look at their keys by all means and then they may go to lunch as soon as you please let me do the talking or perhaps youll start a scare send for the nearest clerks first then the others as each comes in mention his name so that i can hear it say oh mr brownor jones or what nothave you some keys about you dont mention my name and i will do the rest push to the door of the safe and lock this drawer in the table mr bell did as hewitt directed and then called the head clerk mr foster from his room with the prescribed inquiry about keys yes mr foster hewitt added pleasantly im not sure that the lock is quite in order but i promised to open it for mr bell so well try mr foster a slim active old gentleman grown grey in the firms service pulled a bunch of keys from his pocket and hewitt scrutinised each narrowly no he said im afraid none of these will do stay he added suddenly and turning his back carried the bunch to the window no he concluded as he came back to the table and tried one of the keys fruitlessly no im afraid none of those will do thank you mr foster you dont happen to have any more do you no mr foster hadnt any more and he retired to his room then mr bell called the correspondence clerk mr henning mr henning was a much younger man than the head clerktwentysix or sopale and blueeyed with weak whiskers and a straggling moustache his keys were just as readily produced as mr fosters but again hewitts examination was unsuccessful the only other key he had belonged to the typewriter and that did not fit then came mr potter the bookkeeper round and tubby and puffy and his keys went under inspection in the same way taking a little longer this time with two separate dashes to the light of the window then there was mr robson young and spruce mr clancy older and less tidy and four or five more all the keys were examined all with the same lack of success and all the clerks were sent away to take their turns at lunch no hewitt reported as soon as he and mr bell were alone again it was certainly none of those keys though indeed my little attempt was desperate at best a man would be a fool to keep that key longer than he needed it and especially to string it with his others still of course it is by just such blunders as that that nine criminals out of ten are discovered and now let me take a good look at that box and its contents he lifted the box from the safe to the table and narrowly scrutinised its exterior especially about the hasp where the padlock had been either the thief was an experienced hand he said or he took some steady practice with a few such padlocks as this before setting to work there are no signs of banging about or slipping of tools anywhere but of course banging or anything violent would have been noticed in a place like this mr bell remarked in office hours yes responded hewitt but we mustnt forget that office hours are only seven or eight out of the twentyfour but you dont suspect burglary do you im afraid as yet ive precious little ground for suspecting anything definite hewitt answered but we must keep awake to every possibility now let us see the dummies he turned them over and loosened them wherever they were tied yes he remarked quite neatly done filled in with ordinary blank foolscap such as no doubt you have in your officebut then it is in every other office too every stationer has it by the ream no marks anywhereno old newspapers nothing that could give the shadow of a clue he dropped the last of the papers and turned to his client mr bell he said this thing has been thought out to the last inch there is something like genius in this robberyif genius is the capacity for taking pains my advice to you is to call in the scotland yard people at once do you mean you can do nothing asked mr bell despairingly dont tell me that mr hewitt no i dont mean that hewitt answered i mean that until i have had time to think the thing over very thoroughly i cant tell what i can or ought to do meantime i think the police should know not because i think they can see farther into the thing than i canfor indeed i dont think they can but simply because the thief is getting a longer start every moment and the police are armed with powers that are not at my disposal they can get search warrants stop people at ports and railway stations arrest suspectsdo a score of things that will be necessary send to scotland yard and get detective inspector plummer if hes availablehes as good a man as they have tell him that youve engaged me or better still write a note to the scotland yard authorities and let me have it to send or not as i think best after i have turned the thing over in my mind i shall take one good look round this office and then run back to my rooms for an hour or twos hard consideration of whatever i may see one or two small things i have seen alreadythough id rather not mention them till ive made up my mind how they bear matters seem likely to have gone so far that perhaps the regular police course of catching the thief first will be the best plan if it can be done meantime it will be my business to keep my eye first on the recovery of the bonds but i think we must have the police mr bell now ill take my general look round iii after martin hewitt had rushed off to st augustines hospital with the key the envelope and the cypher i had brought him i heard nothing of him till dusk fellabout six then i received this telegram cypher read most interesting case if you can spare an hour be outside broad street at six thirtyschewittsc i had to be at my office between eight and nine and to keep hewitts appointment i should probably have to sacrifice my dinner but i was particularly curious to know the meaning of that cypher and just as curious to know how it could be read and moreover i knew that any case that hewitt called interesting would probably be interesting above the common so i took my hat and sought a cab i was first at the meetingplaceindeed a little before my time no broad street was a great new building of offices most if not all closed at this timea fact indicated by the shutting of one of the halves of the big front door where a charwoman was sweeping the steps under the board which announced that offices were to be let i waited nearly a quarter of an hour and then at last a hansom stopped and deposited hewitt and another older gentleman before me hope we havent kept you waiting brett hewitt said this is mr bell of kingsley bell and dalton it took me a little longer than i expected to reach him his offices are shut and the clerks all gone but we are going to turn up the lights for a bit the lift man is gone too i expect so we shall have a good long stairclimb as to the lift man hewitt was right and during our long climb i received briefly an account of the loss mr bells firm had suffered i have told mr bell hewitt said that it was you who happened across the key in such an odd fashion and when i wired i was sure he would be glad to let you see the upshot of your strange bit of luck i was also pretty sure that you would like to see it too for i really believe that this casewhich i confess seemed pretty near hopeless a few hours agois coming to an issue now and here did you get any information out of the man in the hospital i asked not a scrap hewitt replied he was still insensible and though i saw his clothes and they told me a good deal about the gentlemans personal habitswhich are not dazzlingly noble to put it mildlythey told me nothing else whatever except that he had recently been knocked down in the mud which i knew already but the cypher has told me something as i will explain presently by this time we had reached the high floor in which the offices stood and mr bell all wonder and pale agitation unlocked the outer door and turned on the electric light now cried hewitt show me your ventilators there were some it seemed in the top panes of the windows but these were not what hewitt wanted there were others in the form of upright chambers or flues made of metal and painted the same colour as the walls about them they rose from the floor in corners and wall angles and could be shut or opened by means of lids over their upper ends these were more to hewitts mind and he went about from one to another groping under the lids and poking down into the flues with a walkingstick there was a wiregrating or diaphragm it seemed in each of them two or three feet down and we could hear the end of the stick raking on this at each investigation one after another of these ventilators hewitt examined till he had examined them all in outer and inner rooms without result and i could see that he was disappointed there must be another somewhere he said and hunted afresh but plainly he had tried them all and now he could do no more than try them all again with as little result it is a ventilator he said positively unless he broke off thoughtfully and stood silent for a few moments ah of course he resumed presently well send for the housekeeper and a candle which is the nearest empty officethe nearest office to let is there one on this floor i think not mr bell answered but theres one on the floor below just opposite the lifti see the bill on the door every day as i come up well try that then ill rake out every ventilator in this palatial edifice before ill call myself beaten come call the housekeeper is there a speaking tube tell him to bring a light the housekeeper came wonderingly with a watchmans oillantern and we all went to the floor below opposite the lift was a glass door from which a bill had recently been torn why its let said mr bell yes sir assented the housekeeper let a day or two ago to a mr catherton hunt or at least a deposit was paid but seethe doors not locked hewitt observed pushing it open i think well trespass on mr catherton hunts new offices since they seem quite empty and he hasnt taken possession comeventilators it was a small officean outer room of moderate size and one smaller inner room hewitt at once attacked the ventilators in the larger apartmentthere were two of thembut retired disappointed from each there was one ventilator only in the small room hewitt tilted the lid which was at about the level of his eyes thrust in his hand and drew forth a bundle of folded papers thrust in his hand again and drew forth another bundle did it again and drew forth more mr bell fell upon the first bundle almost as a dog falls upon a bone and now he snatched eagerly at each successive paper or bundle till hewitt raked the grating with his stick and declared that there were no more is that all he asked mr bell went tremblingly from paper to paper and at last said that he believed it really was i can verify it by the list upstairs he added if you are sure there are no more no more repeated hewitt rattling his stick in the ventilator again let us go and verify by all means we sent the puzzled housekeeper away and returned to the office above and presently mr bell now beginning so far to recover from his amazement as to express incoherent gratitude reported that the bonds were correct and complete to the last and least very well said hewitt then my part of the business is done though i must say ive had luck or rather brett has had it for me but the police must come on now i think mr bell well go along to scotland yard when we leave here theyll be wanting to see mr catherton hunt i expect whoever he isand somebody in your office too if im not sadly mistaken who gasped mr bell that perhaps you can help to point out see heredo you know whose figures they are and hewitt produced the small slip of paper containing the cypher theyre very small remarked mr bell putting on his glasses very small indeed but i thinkwhy theyre hennings i do believe ah one or two other little things seemed to point that way henning is your correspondence clerk i believe and i expect this thin little slip is a specimen of your typewriter paper have you any of his written figures for comparison well noi hardly thinkyou see he typewrites his letters and although i know his writing very well i cant at the moment put my hand on any figures of his never mindits mere matter of curiosity the police will ask him questions in the morning what i believe has happened is this our friend henningif hes the manhas a friend outside a great deal cleverer than himselfthough he would seem to have his share of cunning too between them they resolved to rob you in the way they have donetemporarily henning was to take advantage of his position in that little inner room to get at the safe some day when it was open and when you were engaged in your own private inner room with a client so leaving the safe unwatched he was provided with a spare patent padlock and key of the sort you used on that black box and his confederate had drilled him in the trick of breaking that particular sort of padlock open with other spare specimens he got his opportunity this morning only this morning this morning i think else we should never have got these bonds back nor even have heard of them again i think you said you were engaged with a client for half an hour yes from about halfpast ten to eleven that was his chance and he took it he broke the padlock took out the bonds substituted the dummies he had already prepared in his own desk and locked the box again with the new padlock meantime hunt had paid a deposit pending references on the office belowthe nearest empty room of course he wouldnt get the key until the tenancy was finally acceptedwhich he never intended it should be but he easily arranged to have the door left unlocked for a day or two on some convenient excusearranging decorations or what not and the bill was taken down so that prospective and prospecting tenants were kept away the bonds being stolen henning took the first opportunity of carrying them to the empty officeprobably piecemeala thing he could easily manage almost under your nose before you were aware of your loss there he was to conceal them either in the chimney under the boards or in the ventilator as he might find convenientand he found the ventilator most convenient then he was to apprise his confederate of the fact that the robbery had been effected in order that hunt might come and quietly fetch the plunder away the message was to take an ingenious form hunt was to have a fellow waiting about in the street and as soon as henning could get outsay to lunchhe was just to send the key by this messengerthe key with which he had locked the new padlock on the black box you see the advantages of that simple arrangement first the key which is evidence is got rid of in a safe and effectual waya thing that couldnt be done as well by merely flinging it away on or near the premises where it might be found next the message is perfectly secretthe messenger could never guess what the key meant nor could any other person not in the confederates confidence and at the same time the key tells all that is necessary the robbery has been effectedcome and remove the plunder but something unforeseen happens no sooner are the bonds stolen and safely hidden than you go to the box find something wrong with the lock break it open and discover the loss this was a thing that they trusted would not happen till after the bonds were safely got away more i am sent for the clerks are kept in from lunch and so on henning gets into a funk and resolves to send a message of special urgency to his confederate for that purpose he uses a cypher which the two have agreed uponthe most ingenious cypher i have ever seen used for the purpose he doesnt wish to make his message any more conspicuous than he need so he writes his cypher on this scrap of paper and rolls it inside the keyprobably another expedient agreed upon in case of necessity then the key goes into an envelope for greater security of the cypher message and the messenger gets it when henning is at last released for lunch what happened to the message we know and here it is now i will not weary you with a detailed account of the different ways in which i attacked this cypher but i will take the shortest possible cut to the true interpretation a very short examination of the cryptogram shows that while no number is included above the numbers in their relative frequency roughly agree with the relative frequency of the corresponding letters of the alphabet a for b for and so on here i handed hewitt the pencilled note i had made at the hospital with letters substituted for the figures thusi h n d t r e i o s t c i h e c w e m n s s t f a e t c v a o r e a h t k r i e t l e w n n a a t hewitt took the paper and went on if that were all the thing would be childishly simple but you will see that we seem as far from the solution as ever for the letters as they stand mean nothing though in fact they are in normal relative frequency so that if they mean other letters all the rules are upset and we are at a standstill i admit that for a long time the thing bothered me but a peculiarity struck me not only were the figures or letters disposed in groups of eight but there were also eight such groupssixtyfour altogether what did that suggest what but a chessboard a chessboard i queried just soa chessboard eight squares each waysixtyfour altogether so i drew a rough representation of a chessboard and set out the letters on it in their order like this i h n d t r e i o s t o c i h e c w e m n s s t o o f a e t o o c v a o o o r e a h t k r i e t l e w n n a a t now there was my chessboard with my letters on it i tried reading them downward across upward and diagonally in the direction of the moves of different chess piecesking queen rook and bishop nothing came of that whatever i did the thing was as unreadable as ever but there remained one chessmove to trythe eccentric move of the knight the move of one square forward backward or sideways and then one square diagonally or as it has sometimes been more concisely expressed the move to the next square but one of a different colour from that on which it rests i tried the knights move and i read the cypher i began at the top lefthand corner just as one does in reading a book i read the moves downwardi to w e and h and found that led to nothing so i took the one alternative move and with a little consideration skipped along from i to t in the second line of squares t in the top line h in the second line e in the third r in the top and e in the second that gave me an idea there were the letters i t t followed by the word here i tried back from the i again and taking in the reverse order the w e and h which i had first given up i read my own name as you can see it from the h on the bottom line but one moving upward so i had the words hewitt here i need not carry you through all the steps which will now be plain enough to you but i found that the message actually began in the righthand corner and read thus the noughts counting for nothing invent loss disc take at once martin hewitt here fear watch the noughts were plainly merely inserted to fill in unneeded squares and keep the rest of the figures in their proper relative places when the cypher was written in line at first i was a little puzzled to understand what seemed to be the first word invent but it was quite clear that loss disc meant loss discovered so i concluded that here in the beginning was a contraction also and that in was a separate word in that case vent could be a contraction for no other word but ventilator in accordance with the sense of the words so i concluded that the meaning of the whole sentence was simply this the plunder is in the ventilator the loss is discovered take away the booty at once martin hewitt is here and i fear i may be watched there is the reading and our little adventure this evening is what it has led to of course the confederate wouldnt go groping about the squares so painfully as i have had to do to him the reading would be simple enough for the order of the moves would be preconcerted each of the conspirators would have as a guide both to reading and writing the cypher a drawn set of squares numbered in the order of the moves where we have the i where we have the n where we have the v and so on with that before him either reading or writing in this extraordinary cryptogram would be easy and quick enough and now for scotland yard iv we learned late on the following day that henning had not appeared at the office from that we assumed that he must have met his confederate in the evening and finding that he had not received the message sent conceived that something was wrong and made himself safe the confederate hunt however made his appearance early next morning but escaped what happened is best told in plummers words when he called on hewitt in the afternoon i went round this morning he said as i said i would last night i took a good man with me and we got the dummy bonds that had been put in bells box and popped em in the ventilator where the real ones had been hidden you see wed got nothing legal against catherton hunt as yet but if we could only grab him with those dummy bonds on him it might help with the other evidence we could scrape up and especially if we could take henning to sustain a charge of conspiracy to steal well he came so quick he was on us before we were quite ready wed got the dummies in their place and i was in front of the door telling my man the likeliest corner to wait in when suddenly up pops the lift right in front of me with a gentleman in itcleanshaven i looked at him and he looked at me i had a sort of distant notion that i might have seen him before and its pretty certain he had something more than a distant notion about me down again he says to the lift man before the gate was swung ive forgotten something and down the lift went youll understand i had no idea he was the man we wanted but as the lift went down and my eyes were on the mans face i saw who he was when he stood straight before me i had no more than a vague notion that id seen him somewhere before but down the lift went and in the flash of time when hed nearly disappeared and the bottom part of his face was hidden by the sill of the lift openingthe part of his face where his beard had been when we met him lasti saw it was myatt myatt good heavens everard myatt mr hewitt the man that murdered mr jacob mason everard myatt for a thousand with his beard shaved and weve lost him again what could we do we shouted and ran downstairs and that was all hed gone of course and when we asked the hall porter he told us that mr catherton hunt had just come down the lift and hurried out the case of the burnt barn i everard myattor catherton huntwas lost again martin hewitt had been wholly successful for he had recovered mr bells missing bonds but the police caught neither of the conspirators investigation at hennings lodgings showed that careful preparations must have been made for an immediate flight if it should become necessary and the flight had taken place the man in the hospital who had been knocked down in carrying from one to the other the extraordinary message that hewitt deciphered remained insensible for a few days and could not be questioned till some time later still then he professed to have forgotten all about the message on which he was going when he met his accident and the medical men in attendance informed the police that it was quite possible that the fellows statement was true he said that he did carry messages sometimes when he could get a job but he could remember nothing of the message of the key nor of who had sent him nor where he was to go nevertheless the police although they professed to accept his statement kept a wary eye on him after his discharge from the hospital for they had a very great suspicion that he knew more than he chose to tell but nothing more was heard of the accomplices till another case of martin hewitts brought the news and that in a manner strange enough the matter began as so many matters of hewitts did with the receipt of a telegram followed immediately by another for the first having been handed in at a country office not very long before eight the previous evening it was not delivered at hewitts office till the morning in accordance with the ancient manners and customs observed in the telegraphic system of this country it had been despatched from throckham in middlesex and it was simply a very urgently worded request to hewitt to come at once signed claire peytral the second telegram which came even as hewitt was reading the first on his arrival at his office ran thus did you receive telegram see newspapers matter life or death would come personally but cannot leave mother pray answerscpeytralsc the answer went instantly that hewitt would come by the next train for he had seen the morning paper and from that knew the urgency of the case but a consultation of the railway guide showed that trains to throckham were fewer than one might suppose considering the proximity of the village to london and that the next would leave in about an hour and a quarter so that i saw hewitt before he started he came up to my rooms in fact as i was beginning to breakfast see here he said i am sent for in the throckham case have you seen the report as a leader writer i had little business with the news side of my paper and indeed i had no more than a vague recollection of some such heading as tragedy in a barn in one evening paper of the day before and murder at throckham in another so i could claim no very exact knowledge of the affair here you have a paper i see hewitt said reaching for it perhaps their report is fuller than that in mine he gave me his own newspaper and began searching in the other no he said presently much the same news agency report to both papers no doubt the report which i read ran as follows scsingular tragedyscan extraordinary occurrence is reported from throckham a small village within fifteen miles of london involving a tragic fatality that has led to a charge of murder on thursday evening an old barn for some time disused was discovered to be on fire and it was only by extraordinary exertions on the part of the villagers that the fire was extinguished upon an examination of the place yesterday morning the body of mr victor peytral a gentleman who had lived in the neighbourhood for some time and who had been missing since shortly before the discovery of the fire was found in the ruins the body was burnt almost beyond recognition but not so much as to conceal the fact that the unfortunate gentleman had not perished in the fire but had been the victim of foul play the throat was very deeply cut and there can be no doubt that the murderer must have fired the barn with the object of destroying all traces of the crime the police have arrested mr percy bowmore a frequent visitor at the house of the deceased my telegram said hewitt is plainly from a relative of this mr peytral who is deadperhaps a daughter since she speaks of being unable to leave her mother in that case probably an only child since there is no other to leave unless the others are too young i suggested just so hewitt replied well brett he added today is saturday saturday was of course my off day and i understood hewitt to hint that if i pleased i might accompany him to throckham saturday it is i said and i have no engagements would you care for me to come as you please of course i can guess very little of the case as yet naturally beyond what i have read in the paper but the subtle sense of my experience tells me that there is all the chance of an interesting case in this thats your temptation as for myself i dont mind admitting thatespecially in these country cases where the resources of civilisation are not always close at handim never loth to have a friend with me who isnt too proud to be made use of thats my temptation no persuasion was needed and in due time we set out together ii it is my experience that places are to be found within twenty miles of london far more rural far sleepier far less influenced by the great city that lies so near than places thrice and four times as far away they are just too far out to be disturbed by suburban traffic and too near to feel the influence of the great railway lines these main lines go by carrying their goods and their passengers to places far beyond and it is only by awkward little branch lines with slow and rare trains that any part of this midlying belt is reached and even then it is odds but that one must drive a good way to his destination throckham was just such a place as i speak of and that was the reason why we had such ample time to catch the first of the halfdozen leisurely trains by which one might reach the neighbourhood during the day the station was redfield and throckham was three miles beyond it at redfield a coachman with a dogcart awaited hewittonly one gentleman having been expected as the man explained in offering to give either of us the reins but hewitt wished to talk to the coachman and i willingly took the back seat understanding very well that my friend would get better to work if he first had as many of the facts as possible from a calm informant before discussing them with the dead mans relations probably confused and distracted with their natural emotions the coachman was a civil and intelligent fellow and he gave hewitt all he knew of the case with perfect clearness as i could very well hear it isnt much i can tell you sir he said beyond what i expect you know i suppose you didnt know mr peytral my master thats dead no but he was a foreigner i supposefrench from the name well no sir the coachman replied thoughtfully not french exactly i think though sometimes he talked french to the mistress they came from somewhere in the west indies i believe and theres a trifle ofwell of dark blood in em sir i should think though of course it aint for me to say yesthere are many such families in the french west indies did you ever hear of alexandre dumas no sir cant say i did well he was a very great frenchman indeed but he had as much dark blood as your master hadprobably more and it came from the west indies too but go on mr peytral you must understand sir has lived here a year or twoive only been with him nine months he talked english alwaysas good as you or me and he was always called mr peytralnot monsieur or signor or any o them foreign titles i think he was naturalised mrs peytral shes an invalidcame here an invalid im told she never comes out of her bedroom cept on an invalid couch which is carried miss claire shes the daughter an the only one and she was hoping youd ha been down last night sir by the last train shes in an awful state as you may expect sir naturally to lose her father in such a terrible way yes sir but its wuss than that even for her you see this mr bowmore that theyve took up hes been sort of keepin company with miss claire for some time an theres no doubt she was very fond of him that makes it pretty bad for her takin it both ways you see of courseterrible but tell me how the thing happened and why they took this mr bowmore well sir it aint exactly for me to say and of course i dont know the rights of it bein only a servant but they say there was a sudden quarrel last night between mr peytral and mr bowmore i think myself that mr peytral was getting a bit excitable lately whatever it was on thursday night just after dinner he went strolling off in the dusk alone and presently mr bowmorehe came down in the afternoonwent strolling off after him it seems they went down toward the penns meadow barn mr peytral first and mr bowmore catching him up from behind a man saw thema gamekeeper he was lyin quiet in a little wood just the other side of penns meadow an they didnt see him as they came along together they were quarrelling it seems though grantthats the gamekeepercouldnt hear exactly what about but he heard mr peytral tell mr bowmore to go away he preferred to be alone and hed had enough of mr bowmore from what grant could make out get out o my sight sir i tell you the old gentleman said at last stamping his foot and shaking his fist in the young gentlemans face and then bowmore turned and walked away one moment hewitt interposed you are telling me what grant saw and heard how did it come to your knowledge told me hisself sirtold me every word yesterday told me twice in fact first thing in the morning when they found the body and then again after hed been to redfield and had it took down by the police it was because of that they arrested mr bowmore of course just so and is this gamekeeper grant in the same employ as yourself oh no sir mr peytrals is only just an acre or two of garden and a paddock grants master is colonel white up at the hall very good you were saying that mr peytral told mr bowmore to get out of his sight and that mr bowmore walked away what then well grant saw mr bowmore walk away but it was only a feinta dodge you see sir he walked away to the corner of the little wood where grant was and then he took a turn into the wood and began following mr peytral up watching him from among the trees came close by where grant was sitting following up mr peytral and watching him and so grant lost sight of em did grant say what he was doing in the wood he said hed found marks of rabbitsnares there and he was watching to see if anybody came to set any more yesquite an ordinary part of his duty of course what next well grant didnt see any more he waited a bit and then moved off to another part of the wood and he didnt notice anything else particular till the barn was on fire it was dark then of course yesyou must tell me about the fire who discovered it oh a man going home along the lane he ran and called some people and they fetched the fireengine from the village and pumped out of the horsepond just close by it was pretty much of a wreck by the time they got the fire out but it wasnt all gone as you might have expected you see it had been out of use for some time sir and there was mostly nothing but old broken ploughs and lumber there and whats more there was a deal of rain early in the week as you may remember sir so the thatch was pretty sodden being out o repair and alland so was the timber for the matter o that for theres no telling when it was last painted so the fire didnt go quite so fierce as it might you see else i should expect it had been all over before they got to work on it not at all a likely sort of place to catch fire it would seem either hewitt commented old ploughs and such lumber are not very combustible quite so sir thats what makes em think it so odd i suppose but there was a bundle or two of old peastraw there shied in last summer they say being over bundles from the last load and there left and when was mr bowmore seen next he came strolling back sir and told the young lady hed left her father outside or something of that sort i think said nothing of the quarrel i believe but he said the barn was on firewhich he must have known pretty early sir for tis a mile from the house off that way and the coachman pointed with his whip nothing was suspected of the murder it seems till yesterday morning no sir miss claire got frightful worried when her father didnt come home as you would expect and specially at him not coming home all night but when the fire was quite put out o course the people went away home to bed and it wasnt till the morning that anybody went in to turn the place over then they found the body badly burnt i believe horrid burnt sir if it wasnt for mr peytrals being missing i doubt if theyd have known it was him at all it took a doctors examination to see clear that the throat had been cut but cut it had been and deep so the doctor said and now the bodys gone over to redfield mortuary hewitt asked a few questions more and got equally direct answers except where the coachman had to confess ignorance but presently we were at the house to which hewitt had been summoned it was a pleasant house enough standing alone apart from the village a little way back from a loop of road that skirted a patch of open green as we came in at the front gate i caught an instants glimpse of a pale face at an upper window and before we could reach the drawingroom door miss claire peytral had met us she was a young lady of singular beauty which the plain signs of violent grief and anxiety very little obscured her complexion of a very delicate ivory tinge was scarcely marred by the traces of sleeplessness and tears that were nevertheless clear to see her eyes were large and black and her jetty hair had a slight waviness that was the only distinct sign about her of the remote blend of blood from an inferior race oh mr hewitt she cried i am so glad you have come at last i have been waitingwaiting so long and my poor mother is beginning to suspect you have not told her then no it will kill her when she knows im surekill her on the spot i have only said that father is ill atat redfield oh what shall i do the poor girl seemed on the point of breakdown and hewitt spoke sharply and distinctly what you must do is this he said you must attend to me and tell me all i want to know as accurately and as tersely as you can in that case i will do whatever i can but if you give way you will cripple me it all depends on you remember this is my intimate friend mr brett who is good enough to offer to help us now first i think i know the heads of the case from the newspapers and more especially from your coachman but when you sent for me no doubt you had some definite idea or intention in your mind what was it oh he is innocent mr hewitthe is really the only friend i have in the worldthe only friend we all have steadysteady hewitt said pressing her kindly and firmly into a seat you must keep steady you know if i am to do anything i expected that would be your belief now tell me why you are so sure mr hewitt if you knew him you wouldnt ask he would never injure my poor fatherhe went out after him purely out of kindness because i was uneasy he would never hurt him mr hewitt never never i cant say it strongly enoughhe never would oh my poor father and now steady again cried hewitt more sharply still i could see that he feared the hysterical breakdown that might come at any moment after the lengthened suspense miss peytral had suffered listen nowyou mustnt frighten yourself too much if mr bowmore is innocentand you say you are so certain of itthen ive no doubt of finding a way to prove it if only youll make your best effort to help me and keep your wits about you as far as i can see at present theres nothing against him that we need be afraid of if we tackle it properly and of course the police make arrests of this sort by way of precaution in a case like this on the merest hint come now you say you were uneasy when your father went out after dinner on thursday night why i dont know quite mr hewitt it was my mother that was uneasy really about something she never explained to me my father had taken to going out in the evening after dinner just in the way he did on thursday night i dont know why but i think it had something to do with my mothers anxiety did he dress for dinner no not lately he used to dress always but he has dropped it of late hewitt paused for a moment thoughtfully then he said mrs peytral is an invalid i know and no doubt none the better for her anxiety but if it could be managed i should like to ask her a few questions what do you think but this miss peytral was altogether against her mother was suffering from spinal complaint it appeared with very serious nervous complications and there was no answering for the result of the smallest excitement she never saw strangers and if it could possibly be avoided it must be avoided now very well miss peytral i will first go and look at some things i must see and i will do without your mothers help as long as i possibly can but now you must answer a few more questions yourself please hewitts questions produced little more substantial information it seemed to me than he had already received mr peytral had taken the house in which we were sittingit was called the lodge simplytwo years ago before that the family had lived in surrey but they had not moved direct from there there was a journey to america between on some business of mr peytrals and it was on the return voyage that they had met mr percy bowmore mr bowmore had no friends nearer than canada and he was reading for the barin a very desultory way as i gathered miss peytrals childhood had been passed in the west indies at the town of san domingo in fact where her father had been a merchant her mother had been a helpless invalid ever since miss peytral could remember as to the engagement with bowmore it would seem to have had the full approval of both parents all along but a rather curious change had come over her father she thought a few months ago what it was that had caused it she could not say but he grew nervous and moody often absentminded and sometimes even shorttempered and snappish a thing she had never known before also he read the daily papers with much care and eagerness it was plain that miss peytral had no idea of any cause which might have led to a quarrel between bowmore and her father and hewitts most cunning questions failed to elicit the smallest suggestion of reason for such an occurrence ten days or so ago mr peytral had returned from a short walk after dinner very much agitated and from that day he had made a practice of going out immediately after dinner every evening regularly walking off across the paddock and so away in the direction of penns meadow the first visit of percy bowmore after this practice had begun was on thursday but the presence of the visitor made no difference as miss peytral had expected it would her father rose abruptly after dinner and went off as before and this time mrs peytral who had been brought down to dinner displayed a singular uneasiness about him she had experienced the same feeling curiously enough on other occasions miss peytral remarked when her husband had been unwell or in difficulties even at some considerable distance this time the feeling was so strong that she begged bowmore to hurry after mr peytral and accompany him in his walk this the young man had done but he returned alone after a while saying simply that he had lost sight of mr peytral whom he had supposed might have come home by some other way and mentioning also that he had been told that penns meadow barn was on fire when it grew late and mr peytral failed to return bowmore went out again and made inquiry in all directions it grew necessary to concoct a story to appease mrs peytral who had been taken back to her bedroom bowmore spent the whole night in fruitless search and inquiry and then with the morning came the terrible news of the discovery in the burnt barn and late in the afternoon bowmore was arrested the poor girl had a great struggle to restrain her feelings during the conversation and at its close hewitt had to use all his tact to keep her going physical exhaustion as well as mental trouble were against her and stimulus was needed so hewitt said now you must try your best and if you will keep up as well as you have done a little longer perhaps i may have good news for you soon i must go at once and examine things first i should like to have brought to me every single pair of boots or shoes belonging to your father send them and then go and look after your mother remember you are helping all the time iii hewitt examined the boots and shoes with great rapidity but with a singularly quick eye for peculiarities he liked a light shoe he said and he preferred to wear shoes rather than boots there are few boots and those not much worn although he was living in the country trod square on the right foot inward on the left and wore the left heel more than the right its plain he hated nails for these are all handsewn with scarcely as much as a peg visible in the lot and they are all laced boots and shoes alike come this is the bestworn pair it is also a pair of the same sort the maid tells me he must have been wearing since they are missing low shoes laced well take them with us we left the house and sought our friend the coachman he pointed out quite clearly the path by which his master had gone on his last walk showed us the gate still fastened over which he had climbed to gain the adjoining meadow and put us in the way of finding the small wood and the barn both within and without the gate there was a small patch bare of grass worn by feet and here martin hewitt picked up his trail at once the ground has hardened since thursday night he said and so much the betterit keeps the marks for us do you see what is here there were footmarks certainly but so beaten and confused that i could make nothing of them hewitts practised eye however read them as i might have read a rather illegibly written letter here is the right foot plain enough he said carefully fitting the shoe he had brought in the mark he alighted on that as he came over the gate half over it is another footmarkbowmores i expect for i can see signs of others in both directionsgoing and coming but we shall know better presently he rose and we followed the irregular track across the meadow like most such fieldtracks its direction was plainly indicated by the thin and beaten grass with a bare spot here and there hewitt troubled to take no more than a glance at each of these spots as we passed but that was all he needed the meadow was bounded by a hedge with a stile and at the farther side of this stile my friend knelt again with every sign of attention a little piece of luck he reported the left shoe has picked up a tiny piece of broken thorntwig just here see the mark the shoe was a little soddened in the sole by this time and the thorn stuck i hope it stuck altogether if it did it may help us wonderfully when we get to the barn for the trouble there will be the trampling all round of the people at the fire so we went on till we reached the edge of the little wood the fieldpath skirted this and here hewitt dropped on his knees and set to work with great minuteness keep away from the track brett he warned me or you may make it worse the police have been here i see and quite recently coming from the direction of redfield here are two pairs of unmistakable police boots and another heavy pair with them no doubt they brought the gamekeeper along with them to have things fully explained from the corner of the wood to a point forty yards along the path back to the corner again and then into the wood hewitt went carefully examining every inch of the ground as he did so then at last he rejoined me i think the gamekeeper has told the truth he said its pretty plain thanks to the soft ground hereabout notwithstanding the policemens boots here they came togetherthe thorntwig sticks to the shoe still you seeand here they stopped the marks face about and bowmores steps are retraced to the corner of the wood peytrals turn again and go on and bowmores turn into the edge of the wood and come along among the trees you dont see them in the grassy parts quite as well as i do i expect but there they are well keep after peytrals prints bowmores come back in the same track i see the next stile led to penns meadow this meadowa large onestretched over a rather steep hump of land at the other side of which the barn stood from the stile two paths could be discernedone rising straight over the meadow in the direction of the barn and the other skirting it to the left parallel with the hedge here the footprints part hewitt observed musingly and what does that mean manoeuvringor what he thought a moment and then went on well leave the tracks for the present and see the barn that is straight ahead i take it when we reached the top of the rise the barn came in view a blackened and sinister wreck the greater part of the main structure was still standing and even part of the thatched roof still held its place scorched and broken off to the right from where we stood the village roofs were visible giving indication of the position of the road to redfield a single human figure was in sightthat of a policeman on guard before the barn now we must get rid of that excellent fellow said hewitt or hell be offering objections to the examination i want to make i wonder if he knows my name we walked down to the barn and hewitt assuming the largest possible air addressed the policeman constable he said i am here officiallyhere is my card of course you will know the name if you have had any wide experiencelondon experience especially i am looking into this case on behalf of miss peytralcooperating with the police of course where is your inspector he was a rather stupid countryman this policeman but he was visibly impressedeven flurriedby hewitts elaborate bumptiousness he saluted tried to look unnaturally sagacious and confessed that he couldnt exactly say where the inspector was things being put about so just now he might be in throckham village but more likely he was at redfield ah hewitt replied with condescension now if he is in the village you will oblige me constable by telling him that i am here if he is not there you will return at once i will be responsible here till you come back dont be very long now the man was taken by surprise and possibly a trifle doubtful but hewitt was so extremely lofty and so very peremptory and official that the inferior intelligence capitulated feebly and presently after another uneasy salute the village policeman had vanished in the direction of the road the moment he had disappeared hewitt turned to the ruined barn the door was gone and the scorched and charred lumber that littered the place had a look of absolute ghostlinessperhaps chiefly the effect of my imagination in the knowledge of the ghastly tragedy that the place had witnessed well in from the doorway was a great scatter of light ashesplainly the peastraw that the coachman had spoken of and by these ashes and partly among them marked in some odd manner on the floor was a horrible black shape that i shuddered to see as hewitt pointed it out with a moving forefinger which he made to trace the figure of a prostrate human form did you never see that before in a burnt house hewitt asked in a hushed voice i have more than once that sort of thing always leaves a strange stain under it like a shadow but business claimed martin hewitt and he stepped carefully within scarcely had he done so when he stood suddenly still with a low whistle pointing toward something lying among the dirt and ashes by the foot of that terrible shape see he said dont disturb anything but look i crept in with all the care i could command and stooped the place was filled with such a vast confusion of lumber and cinder and ash that at first i failed to see at all what had so startled hewitts attention and even when i understood his direction all i saw was about a dozen little wire loops each a quarter of an inch long or less lying among a little grey ash that clung about the ends of some of the loops in clots even as i looked another thing caught hewitts eye among the strawashes there lay some cinders of paper and card and near them another cinder smaller and plainly of some other substance hewitt took my walkingstick and turned this cinder over it broke apart as he did so and from within it two or three little charred sticks escaped hewitt snatched one up and scrutinised it closely do you see the tin ferrule he said it has been a brush and that was a box of colours he pointed to the cinder at his feet that being so he went on that paper and card was probably a sketchbook brett come outside a bit theres something amazing here we went outside and hewitt faced me with a curious expression that for the life of me i could not understand suppose he said that mr victor peytral is not dead after all not dead i gasped butbut he is we know it seems to me hewitt pursued with his eyes still fixed on mine that we know very little indeed of this affair as yet the body was unrecognisable or very near it you remember what the coachman said if it wasnt for mr peytrals being missing he said i doubt if theyd have known it was him at all i think those were his exact words more you must remember that the body has not been seen by either of peytrals relatives but then i protested if it isnt his body whose is it ah indeed hewitt responded whose is it dont you see the possibilities of the thing theres a colourbox and a sketchbook burned who carried a colourbox and a sketchbook not peytral or we should have heard of it from his daughter she made a particular point of her fathers evening strolls being quite aimless so far as her knowledge or conjecture went she knew nothing of any sketching and another thingdont you see what those things mean he pointed toward the place of the little wire loops not at all man dont you see theyve been bootbuttons when the boots shrivelled the threads were burnt and the buttons dropped off bootbuttons are made of a sort of composition that burns to a grey ash once the fire really gets hold of themas you may try yourself any time you please you can see the ash still clinging to some of the shanks and there the shanks are lying in two groups six and six as they fell now peytral came out in laced shoes but if peytral isnt dead where is he precisely rejoined hewitt with the curious expression still in his eyes as you say where is he and as you said before who is the dead man who is the dead man and where is peytral and why has he gone dont you see the possibilities of the case now light broke upon me suddenly i saw what hewitt meant here was a possible explanation of the whole thingpeytrals recent change of temper his evening prowlings his driving away of bowmore and lastly of his disappearancehis flight as it now seemed probable it was the case had taken a strange turn and we looked at one another with meaning eyes it might be that hewitt begged by the unhappy girl we had but just left to prove the innocence of her lover would by that very act bring her father to the gallows poor girl hewitt murmured as we stood staring at one another better she continued to believe him dead as she does brett theres many a good man would be disposed to fling these proofs away for the girls sake and her mothers seeing how little there can be to hurt bowmore but justice must be done though the blow fallas it commonly doeson innocent and guilty together see now ive another idea stay on guard while i try he hurried out toward the farther side of the broad band of trampled ground which surrounded the burnt barn and began questing to and fro this way and that receding farther from me as he went and nearing the horsepond and the road at last he vanished altogether and left me alone with the burnt barn my thoughts andthat dim shape on the barn floor it was broad day but i felt none too happy and i should not have been at all anxious to keep the police watch at night perhaps hewitt had been gone a quarter of an hour perhaps a little more when i saw him again hurrying back and beckoning to me i went to meet him its right enough he cried ive come on his trail again there it is thornmark and all by the roadside and at a stilegoing to redfieldprobably to the station come well follow it up wheres that fool of a policeman oh the muddle they can make when they really try need we wait for him i asked yes better now with those proofs lying there and we must tell him not to be bounced off again as i bounced him off there he comes the heavy figure of the local policeman was visible in the distance and we shouted and beckoned to hurry him agility was no part of that policemans nature however and beyond a sudden agitation of his head and his shoulders which we guessed to be caused by a dignified spasm of leisurely haste we saw no apparent acceleration of his pace as we stood and waited we were aware of a sound of wheels from the direction of redfield and as the policeman neared us from the right so the sound of wheels approached us from the left presently a fly hove in sightthe sort of dusty vehicle that plies at every rural railway station in this country and as he caught sight of us in the road the driver began waving his whip in a very singular and excited manner as he drew nearer still he shouted though at first we could not distinguish his words by this time the policeman trotting ponderously was within a few yards the passenger in the fly a thin dark elderly man leaned over the side to look ahead at us and with that the policeman pulled up with a great gasp and staggered into the ditch ere e is cried the flydriver regardless of the angry remonstrances of his fare ere e is es all right it aint im ere he is shut your mouth you fool cried the angry fare will you stop making a show of me not me cried the eccentric cabman i dont want no fare sir im drivin you ome for honour an glory an honour an glory ill make it ere e is hewitt took in the case in a flashthe flabbergasted policeman the excited cabman and the angry passenger he sprang into the road and cried to the cabman who pulled up suddenly before us mr victor peytral i believe said martin hewitt yes sir answered the dark gentleman snappishly but i dont know you there has been a deal of trouble here mr peytral over your absence from home as no doubt you have become aware and i was telegraphed for by your daughter my name is hewittmartin hewitt peytrals face changed instantly i know your name well mr hewitt he said theres a matterbut who is this my friend mr brett who is good enough to help me today if i may detain you a moment i should like a word with you aside certainly mr peytral alighted and the two walked a little apart i saw hewitt talking and pointing toward the burnt barn and i well guessed what he was saying he was giving peytral warning of what he had discovered in the barn explaining that he must give the information to the police and asking if in those circumstances peytral wished to go home or to make other arrangements often hewitts duty to his clients and his duty as a lawupholding citizen between them put him in some such delicate position but there was no hesitation in mr victor peytral plainly he feared nothing and he was going home very well then i heard hewitt say as they turned towards us perhaps we had better go on slowly and let my friend cut across the fields first to break the news bretti knew you would be useful sooner or later and so i hurried off with the happy though delicate mission to restore both father and lover to miss claire peytral iv miss peytral had to be put to bed under care of a nurse for the revulsion was very great and so was her physical prostration bowmore now set free and in himself a very pleasant young fellow came with hurried inquiries and congratulations and then rushed off to london to cable to his friends in canada for fear of the effect of newspaper telegrams when at last hewitt and i sat with mr peytral in his study mr hewitt said peytral i am not sure how far explanations may go between us there is more in that death in the barn than the police will ever guess peytral was haggard and drawn for as he had let slip already he had scarce slept an hour since leaving home on thursday i am tired he said and worn out but that is not a novelty with me and im not sure but we may be of use to each other did my daughter tell you why she sent mr bowmore after me on thursday night hewitt explained the thing as briefly as possible just as he had heard it from miss peytral ah said peytral thoughtfully so she thought my manner became moody a few months back it did no doubt for i had memories and more i had apprehensions mr hewitt i think i read in the papers that you were in some way engaged in the extraordinary case of the murder of mr jacob mason that is quite correct i was there was another case a little while before which possibly you may not have heard of a man was found strangled near the york column by pall mall with just such a mark on his forehead as was found on mr masons i know that case too as well as the other do you know the name of the murderer i think i do we speak in confidence of course as client and professional man of course what was his name i have heard twoeverard myatt and catherton hunt neither is his real name and i doubt if anybody but himself knows it twenty years ago and more i knew him as mayes he was a jamaican mr hewitt that mans foul life has been justly forfeit a thousand times but if it belongs to anybody it belongs to me it was terrible to see the sudden fiery change in the old man his lassitude was gone in a flash his eyes blazed and his nostrils dilated for a little while he sat so his mouth awork with passion then he sank back in his chair with a sigh i am getting old he said more quietly and perhaps i am not strong enough to lose my temper well as i said mayes was a jamaican a renegade white do you remember that in the black rebellion of there was a traitorous white man among the negroes eyre hanged a few rebels and rightly but the worst creature on all that island escapedprobably escaped by the aid of that very white skin that should have ensured him a greater punishment than the rest he escaped to hayti now you have probably heard something of hayti and of the common state of affairs there we both had heard and indeed the matter had been particularly brought to hewitts notice by the case which i have told elsewhere as the affair of the tortoise as for me i had read sir spenser st johns book on the black republic and i had been greatly impressed by the graphic picture it gives of the horrible bloodstained travesty of regular government there prevailing nothing in the worst of the south american republics is to be remotely compared to it in the worst periods there was not a crime imaginable that could not be and was not committed openly and with impunity by anybody on the right side of the socalled government and the government was nothing but an organised crime in itself well peytral pursued then i need not expatiate on it and you will understand the sort of place that mayes fled to and how it suited him he was a man of far greater ability than any of the coarse scoundrels in power and he was worse than all of them he was not such a fool as to aim at ostensible political powerthat way generally led to assassination he was the jackal the contriver the power behind the throne the instigator of half the devilry set going in that unhappy place and he profited by it with little risk he was the confidential adviser of that horrible creature domingue if you know anything of hayti you will know what that means at this time i was comparatively a young man and a merchant at portauprince it was a bad place of course and business was risky enough but for that very reason profits were large and that was an attraction to a sanguine young man like myself i did very well and i had thoughts of getting out of it with what i had made but it was a fatal thing to be supposed wealthy in portauprince unless you were a villain in power or partner with one i was neither and i was judged a suitable victim by mayes not i alone eitherno nor even only i and my fortune gentlemen gentlemen my poor wife who now lies peytrals utterance failed him he rose as if choking and hewitt rose to quiet him never mind he said sit quiet now we understand rest a moment the old man sank back in his chair and for a little while buried his face in his hands then he went on i neednt go into details he said huskily it is enough to say that every devilish engine of force and cunning was put in operation against me so it came that at last on a hint from a hangeron of the policeoffice who had enough humanity in him to remember a kindness he had experienced at my hands that we took flight in the middle of the nightmy poor wife myself and our three children with nothing in the world but our bare lives and the clothes we wore i might have tried to get aboard a foreign ship in the harbour but i knew that would be useless i should have been given up on whatever criminal charge mayes chose to present and my wife and children with me i had hope of somehow getting to san cristobel where i had a friendover the border in the other government of the island the dominican republic that was eighty miles away and more across swamps and forests and mountains well we did itwe did it we did it mr hewitt and i dream of it still they hunted us sirhunted us with dogs we hid from them a whole day among the rank weedsup to our shoulders in the water of a pestilential feverswamp claire the baby on her mothers back and both the boys on mine they diedthey died next day my two beautiful boys gentlemen died in my arms and i was too weak even to bury them there was another long pause and the mans head was bowed in his hands once more presently he went on again but at first without lifting his head we did it gentlemen he saidwe did it we crawled into san cristobel at the end of five days and from that moment my dear wife has never once stood upright on her feet so we came out of it and the baby claire was the one that suffered least she was too young to understand and her motherher mother saved her when i could not save the boys he paused again and presently sat up pale but in full command of himself you will excuse me gentlemen i am sure and make allowances for my feelings he said there is not a great deal more to tell mayes did not last long in hayti domingue was overthrown and mayes left the island i was told and made for another part of the world years afterward i heard of his being in china though what truth there may have been in the rumour i cannot say my friend in san cristobelhe was a cousin in factput me on my legs again and after a while he helped me to begin business at san domingo under my present name peytral which in fact was my mothers maiden name there came a sudden push in trade with the united states about this time and i went into my affairs with the more energy to distract my thoughts in fifteen yearsto cut a long story shorti had made the small competency which i have brought to england with me with the idea of a peaceful end to my life and my wifes though i doubt if i am to have that now i doubt it and i will tell you why mr hewitt when i went away without warning on thursday night i was dogging mayes hewitt nodded with no sign of surprise and the man killed in the barn that is one more of his thousand crimes without a doubt though it differs do you know what drew my attention to the murders of the men denson and mason and so set me thinking in each case the murder was by strangulation and the medical evidence at the inquests showed that it was effected by means of a tourniquet in fact in the second case the tourniquet itself was left behind yes hewitt replied i loosened it myselfbut unfortunately i was too late well now peytral went on in hayti in my time mayess enemies had a habit of dying suddenly in the night by strangulation and a tourniquet was always the instrument and just as murder was quite a popular procedure in that accursed place so strangulation by tourniquet became for a while the most common form of the crime it was rapid effective and silent you see so that a murder by tourniquet quite an unknown thing in this country took my attention at once and when another followed it so soon i felt something like certainty and the triangle was suggestive too were mayess victims marked in that way in hayti no there was no mark buthere mr peytrals features assumed a curious expressionthere are things which are not believed in this countrywhich are laughed at in fact and called superstition you know something of hayti and therefore you must have heard of voodoothe witchcraft and devilworship of the west indies well mayes was as deep in that as he was in every other species of wickedness it sounds foolish perhaps here in civilised england and you may laugh but i tell you that mayes could make men do as he wished with their consent or against it and he used a thingit was generally known that he used a thing marked with a trianglea red triangleby the use of which he could bend men to his will hewitt was listening intently with no sign of laughter at all notwithstanding his clients apprehension and i remembered the case of mr jacob mason and how that victim had so fervently expressed his wish to the excellent clergyman mr potswood that he had never dabbled in the strange devilries of myattor mayes as we were now learning to call him at any rate peytral resumed you will understand that the conjunction of the tourniquet with the red triangle in the two cases you know of caused me some excitement my daughter as you have said noticed a change in my habits from that time my wife did moreshe knew the reason mr hewitt i am an older man but there is hotter blood in my veins than in yours my father was englishthough you might scarcely suppose itbut my mother to whose name i have reverted was a french creole so perhaps my natural instincts come nearer to those of our savage ancestry than do yours whether or not you will understand me i do not know but i can tell you that even now in cold bloodfor my paroxysm has exhausted itself and meit seems to me that it would be my duty not to say my sacred duty to tear that man to pieces with my hands whenever and wherever i could put them on him my old passions may have slept i find but they are alive still and i found them waking when i realised that mayes was alive and in england the words sane and insane are elastic in their application but i doubt if you would have called me strictly sane of late i evolved mad schemes for the destruction of this wretch and i was ready to devote myself and everything i possessed to the purpose more than once i contemplated coming to youseeing that you had met the man in one of his villainieswith the idea of enlisting your aid but i reflected that you would probably make yourself no party to a plan of private revenge and i hesitated and thenthen a little more than a week ago i saw the man himself changed without doubt but not half as much changed as i am myself nevertheless sure as i am of him now i hesitated then for it was here in the meadow that you know near the barn and the thing seemed so likely to be illusion that i almost suspected my senses it was dusk and he was walking and talking with another man a good deal younger and presently while i was still confounded with surprise and as they passed behind a clump of trees mayes was gone and i saw his companion alone he was a young manan artist it would seem with sketchbook and colours i started and hewitt and i glanced at each other peytral saw it and paused never mind said hewitt please go on after that i came out every night in the hope of seeing my enemy again on several evenings i saw the young artist waiting by the barn expectantly but nobody joined him i found that this young man was lodging at a cottage in the village and i resolved not to lose sight of him at last on thursday night i saw mayes again mr bowmore was here and when i left the house he troubled me much by coming after me i was obliged to tell him that i wished to be alone and i was in a nervously explosive state when i did it he seemed reluctant to go my anger blazed out and i violently ordered him off from what he has told me it seems that he followed me still but lost sight of me near penns meadow well be that as it may i saw mayes and the young artist again i watched from a rather awkward spot and dusk was falling so that i could not see all that passed but presently i was aware that mayes was making off by the road alone and i followed him from that moment i think i really was mad though my madness did not drive me to attack him at once i had a feeling of curiosity to see where he would go and a curious cruel idea of letting him run for a little firstas a cat feels i suppose with a mouse you may judge that i was not in my normal state of mind from the fact that all through yesterday and part of today i never as much as thought of telegraphing home to say that i had gone to london for it was to london i followed him i took no ticket at the stationi got on the platform by stealth and entered the train unobserved for he and one boy were the only passengers and i feared attracting attention it was easy enough in such a station as redfield and i paid my fare at london and after all i lost him lost him in london how like a fool i saw him enter a house and waited followed him again and waited at another i might have flung him into the river from the embankment and i refrained and thenwhether it began at a dark corner or in a group of people i cannot tell but i suddenly discovered that i was following a strangera stranger of about mayess form and stature it was what i should have expected and provided for in london streets at night if i have been mad it was then i was worst i suppose by that time it must have been too late to get back home but i never thought of that i ran the streets the whole night like a fool hunting for mayes i kept on all day yesterday i waited and watched hours at the two houses he had visited and it was not till early this morning that i flung myself on a bed in a private hotel in euston road i slept a little and my paroxysm was over perhaps i am more fortunate than i am disposed to think since i am as yet in no danger of trial for murder this passionate wayward stricken man was plainly the object of fascinated interest to hewitt my friend waited a moment and then saidthe houses he called ati should like to know them and where you lost sight of him peytral sat back and gazed thoughtfully for fully half a minute in hewitts face do you know he said at length i dont think ill answer that question now id like to leave it for a day or two yesterday i wouldnt have told you even on the rackno not a word i should have said take your own chances and get him if you can as for me i consider him my prey and what scent i have picked up i shall use myself a mad fancy you will think perhaps for me the question is was i sanest then or now i will take a day or two to think v in less than a day or two the identity of the victim of the burnt barn was established for hewitt had his idea and he communicated with plummer of scotland yard the man with the buttoned boots and the sketchbook was the artist who had been staying at the cottage in the village but who singularly enough had never been seen to draw and had left no drawings behind him he had warned the people of the cottage that he might be away for a night or two and he had stayed away for two nights before so that his disappearance did not disturb them and when they heard that mr peytrals body had been found in the barn they accepted the news as fact they recognised at once a photograph produced by plummer as that of their late lodger and the photograph had been procured from messrs kingsley bell and dalton the intended victims in the bond case and it was one of henning their vanished correspondence clerk that his death would be convenient to mayes the greater scoundrel was plain enough the bond robbery had been brought to naught thanks to martin hewitt and henning was now useless worse he might be caught or give himself up and was thus a perpetual danger and probably he wanted money this being so it was a singular fact that at the inquest the surgeon who had examined the wound gave it as his most positive opinion that it had been selfinflicted and it was inflicted with a razor hennings own as was very clearly proved after inquiry for the razor was found in the barn by the police entangled with the blackened frame of an old lantern here was still another puzzle one to which the final revelation of the mystery of the red triangle gave an answer as will be seen in due place the case of the admiralty code i quick on the heels of the case of the burnt barn followed the next of the red triangle affairs indeed the interval was barely two days mr victor peytral it will be remembered had declined to reveal to hewitt the addresses of the two houses in london which he had seen mayes visit desiring to think the matter over for a few days first but before any more could be heard from him news of another sort was brought by inspector plummer it may give some clue to the period whereabout the whole mystery of the red triangle began to be cleared up if i say that at the time of plummers visit this country was on the very verge of war with a great european state it is a state with which the present relations of england are of the friendliest description and since the dreaded collision was happily averted there is no need to particularise in the matter now especially as the name of the country with which we were at variance matters nothing as regards the course of events i am to relate though most readers will recognise it at once when i say that the war had it come to that would have been a naval war of great magnitude and that during the time of tension swift but quiet preparations were going forward at all naval depots and movements and dispositions of our fleet were arranged that extended to the remotest parts of the ocean it was at the height of the excitement and as i have said two days after the return of hewitt and myself from throckham when the case of the burnt barn had been disposed of that detectiveinspector plummer called i was in hewitts office at the time having in fact called in on my way to learn if he had heard more from mr victor peytral for as may be imagined i was as eager to penetrate the mystery of the triangle as hewitt himselfperhaps more so since hewitt was a man inured to mysteries i had hardly had time to learn that peytral had not yet made up his mind so far as to write when plummer pushed hurriedly into the room excuse my rushing in like this he said but your lad told me that it was mr brett who was with you and the matter needs hurry youve heard no more of that fellowmyatt hunt mayes whatever his name is lastsince the barn murder of course has peytral given you the tip he half promised hewitt shook his head again brett has this moment come to ask the same question he said i have heard nothing i must have it said plummer emphatically do you think he will tell me hewitt shook his head again scarcely likely he said hes an odd fellow this mr peytrala foreigner with revenge in his blood i have done him and his daughter some little service and he told me all his private history but he seemed even then disposed to keep mayes to himself and let nobody interfere with his own vengeance but i will wire if you like what is it ill tell you said plummer pushing the door close behind him ill tell youin confidence of coursebecause youve seen more of this mysterious rascal than i have andequally in confidence of coursemr brett may hear too since hes been in several of the cases already well of course we all know well enough that we want this creaturemayes we may as well call him i suppose nowfor three murders at least to say nothing of other things thats all very well and we might have got him with time but now we want him for something else and its such a thing that we must have him at once or elseand plummer pursed his lips and snapped his fingers significantly we cant wait over this mr hewitt weve got to have that man today if it can be done and theres more than ordinary depending on it its the country this time the admiralty telegraphic code has been stolen by mayes plummer shrugged his shoulders thats to be proved he said but he was seen leaving the office at about the time the loss occurred and thats enough to set me after him and theres not another clue of any sort mr hewitt i wish you were in the official service hewitt smiled you flatter me he said as you have done before but why in this case particularly its a case altogether out of the ordinary and one of a string of such all of which you have at your fingers ends and i dont mind confessing that this man mayes is a little too big a handful for onefor me at any rate i wish you could work with me over this in fact in the special circumstances ive a good mind to ask to have you retained as an exceptional measure but the things urgent and theres redtape hewitt had taken a glance at his desk tablet which he now flung down ill do it for love he said if necessary my appointment list is uncommonly slack just now and even if it werent id make a considerable sacrifice rather than be out of this this fellow mayes is a dangerous man and i feel it a point of honour that he shall not continue to escape moreover i have begun to form a certain theory as to the red triangle and all there is at the back of ita theory i would rather keep to myself till i see a little more since as it stands it may only strike you as fantastic and if it is wrong it may lead some of us off the track but it is a theory i wish to test to the end so im with you plummer if youll allow it and you can make your official application for a special retainer or not just as you please plummer was plainly delighted most certainly i will he said shall i give you the heads of the case or will you come to the admiralty and see for yourself both i think said hewitt but first i will send a telegram to peytral then you can give me the heads of the case as we go along and i will look at the place for myself i am in this case heart and soul pay or no payand i expect my friend brett would like to be in it too is there any objection well plummer answered a little doubtfully were glad of outside help of course but im not sure officially of course you are always glad of outside help hewitt interrupted and in this case we may possibly find brett more useful than you think consider now he has seen a good deal of these casesquite as much as you in factbut he is the only one of the three of us whom mayes does not know by sight remember mayes saw us both in the affair of mr jacob mason and he saw you again in the case of the lever keyescaped in fact because he instantly recognised you ill answer for bretts discretion and im sure hell be glad to help even if for official reasons you may not find it possible to admit him wholly into your counsels of course i willingly assented and the conditions understood plummer offered no further objection hewitt despatched his telegram and in a very few minutes we were in a cab on the way to the admiralty this is the way of it plummer said you will remember that when we lost mayes at the end of the lever key case i was waiting for him in that city office with an assistant and that we only saw him for an instant in the lift well that assistant was a very intelligent man of mine named cordera fellow with a wonderful memory for a face now corder is on another case just now and wed put him on dressed like a loafer to hang about whitehall and the neighbourhood watching for some one we want well this morning there came an urgent message to the yard from the admiralty to ask for a responsible official at once and i was sent as i came along i saw corder lounging about and of course i took no noticeit would not do for us people from the yard to recognise each other too readily in the street but corder came up and made pretence to ask me for a match to light his pipe and under cover of that he told me that he had seen mayes not an hour before coming out of the admiralty at this of course i pricked up my ears i didnt know what they wanted me for but if there was mischief and that fellow had been there it was likely at least that he might have been in it corder was quite positive that it was the man although he had only seen him for a moment in the lift he hadnt seen him go into the admiralty office but he was passing as he came out and noted the time exactly so that he might report to me at the first opportunity the time was and mayes jumped into a hansom and drove off he walked right out into the middle of the road to stop the hansomyou know how wide the road is thereso that corder couldnt hear his direction to the cabman but he took the number as the cab went off corder ought to have collared him then and there i think but he was in a difficult position it would have endangered the case he was on which is very important and besides he didnt realise how much we wanted him for having only been brought in as an assistant at the tail of our bond case still less did he guessany more than myselfwhat i was going to hear at the admiralty office at any rate interrupted hewitt youve got the number of the cab here it is plummer answered and ive already set a man to get hold of the cabman youd better note the number hewitt duly noted the number and advised me to do the same in case i should chance to meet the cab during the afternoon and as we neared our destination plummer gave us the rest of the case in outline in the office he said i found them in a great state a copy of the code or cypher in which confidential orders and other messages are sent to the fleet all over the world and in which reports and messages are sent back had disappeared during the morning it was in charge of a mr robert telfer a clerk of responsibility and undoubted integrity he kept it in a small iron safe which is let into the wall of his private room it was safe when he arrived in the morning and he immediately used it in order to code a telegram and locked it in the safe again at two hours later at he went to the safe for it again in order to decode a message just received and it was gone and the lock of the safe is one that would take hours to pick i should judge there isnt a shade of a clue so far as i can see except this circumstance of mayes being seen leaving by corderjust between telfers two visits to the safe you perceive and of course there may be nothing in that except for the character of the man and thats all there is to go on as far as i can see i neednt tell you how important the thing is at a time like this and how much would be paid for that secret code by a certain foreign government we have made hurried arrangements to have certain places watched and as soon as i have taken you to the office i must rush off and make a few more arrangements still but here we are mr robert telfers room was at the side of a long and gloomy corridor on the upper floor and the door was distinguished merely by a number and the word private painted thereon we found mr telfer sitting alone and plainly in a state of great nervous tension he was a man of forty or thereabout thin alert and using a single eyeglass plummer introduced us by name and rapidly explained our business i told you the name of the party i am after mr telfer plummer said and i went straight to mr martin hewitt as being most likely to have information of him mr hewitt whose name you know already of course is kind enough seeing were in a bad pinch and pushed for time to come in and give us all the help he can both he and his friend mr brett know a good deal of the doings of the person were after and their assistance is likely to be of the very greatest value do you mind giving mr hewitt any information he may ask i must rush over to the yard to put some other inquiries on foot and to set an observation or two but ill be back presently certainly mr telfer answered im only too anxious to give any information whateverso long as it is nothing departmentally forbiddenwhich will help to put this horrible matter right please ask me anything and be patient if my answers are not very clear i have been much overworked lately as you may imagine and have had very little sleep and now this terrible misfortune has upset me completely for of course i am held responsible for that copy of the code and if it isnt recovered and quickly i am ruinedto say nothing of course of the far more serious consequences in other directions that is the safe in which it was kept i presume hewitt said indicating a small one let into the wall may i examine it certainly mr telfer turned and produced the keys from his pocket the code was here lying on this shelf when i needed it this morning at ten i took it out used it returned it to the same place exactly and locked the safe door then i took the draft of the telegram together with the copy in cypher into the controllers room gave it into safe hands and returned here hewitt narrowly examined the lock of the safe with his pocket lens there are no signs of the lock having been picked he said even if that were possible as a matter of fact this is a lock that would take half a day to pick even with a heavy bag of tools no i dont think that was the way of it you have no doubt about locking the safe door at i suppose before you went to the controllers room no possible doubt whatever you see i left the whole bunch of keys hanging in the lock while i coded the telegram it was a short one and was soon done then i returned the code to its place locked the safe and then used another key on the bunch to lock a drawer in this desk i had no occasion to go to the safe again till about when the controllers secretary came here with a telegram to be decoded the safe was still locked then but when it was opened the code was gone you had had no occasion to go to the safe in the meantime none at all i locked it at and i unlocked it two hours later and that was all you were not in the room the whole of the time of course oh no i have told you that at i went to the controllers room and after that i went out two or three times on one occasion or another but each time i locked the door of the room oh you did that is important and you took all your keys with you i presume yes all the keys on the bunch i took in my pocket of course and the room door key i also took there are one or two rather important papers on my desk you see and anybody from the corridor might come in if the door were left unlocked the lock of the door would be a good deal easier to pick than that of the safe hewitt observed after examining it but that would be of no great use with the safe locked shortly then the facts are these you locked the code safely away at you left the room two or three times but each time the door as well as the safe was locked and the keys in your pocket and then at or two hours exactly after the code had been put safely away you opened the safe again in presence of the controllers secretary and the code had vanished that is the whole matter in brief i take it precisely mr telfer was pallid and bewildered it seems a total impossibility he said a total absolute physical impossibility but there it is but as no such thing as a physical impossibility ever happens hewitt replied calmly we must look further now are there any other ways into this room than by that door into the corridor i see another door here what is that that door has been locked for ages the room on the other side is one like this with a door in the corridor it is used chiefly to store old documents of no great importance and i believe that whole stacks of them in bundles are piled against the other side of that same door we will send for the key and see if you like the key was sent for and the door from the corridor opened as telfer had led us to expect the place was full of old papers in bundles and parcels thick with ancient dust and these things were piled high against the door next his room and plainly had not been disturbed for months or even years there remains the skylight said hewitt for i perceive mr telfer that your room is lighted from above and has no window while the grate is a register there seems to be no opening in that skylight but the revolving ventilator am i right quite so there is no getting in by the skylight without breaking it and as you see it has not been broken certainly there are men on the roof repairing the leads but it is plain enough that nobody has come that way the thing is wholly inexplicable at present yes hewitt said musingly he stood for a few moments in deep thought plummer is longer away than i expected he said presently by the way what was the external appearance of the missing code it was nothing but a sort of thin manuscript book made of a few sheets of foolscap size sewn in a cover of thickish grey paper i left it in the safe doubled lengthwise and tied with tape in the middle its loss is a very serious thing of course oh terribly terribly serious mr hewitt telfer replied despairingly i am responsible and it will put an end to my career of course but the consequences to the country are more important and they may be disastrousenormously so a great sum would be paid for that code on the continent i need hardly say but now that you know it is taken surely the code can be changed its not so easy as it seems mr hewitt telfer answered shaking his head it means time and i neednt tell you that with affairs in their present state we cant afford one moment of time some expedients are being attempted of course but you will understand that any new code would have to be arranged with scattered items of the fleet in all parts of the world and that probably with the present code in the hands of the enemy moreover all our messages already sent will be accessible with very little trouble and they contain all our strategical coaling and storing dispositions for a great war mr hewitt and they cant they cant be altered at a moments notice oh it is terrible but here is inspector plummer no news i suppose mr plummer well no plummer answered deliberately i cant say ive any news for you mr telfer just yet but i want to talk about a few things to mr hewitt hadnt we better go and see if your telegram is answered mr hewitt unless youve heard no i havent hewitt replied well go on at once goodday for the present mr telfer i hope to bring good news when next i see you i hope so too mr hewitt most fervently telfer answered and his looks confirmed his words we walked in silence through the corridor down the stairs and out by the gates into the street then plummer turned on his heel and faced hewitt that mans a wrong un he said abruptly jerking his thumb in the direction of the office we had just left ill tell you about it in the cab as soon as our cab was started on its way back to hewitts office plummer explained himself hes been watched he said has mr telfer when he didnt know it and hell be watched again for the rest of today as ive arranged whats more he wont be allowed to leave the office this evening till i have seen him again or sent a message no need to frighten him too soonit mightnt suit us but hes in it alone or in company how do you know ill tell you it seems the lead roofs are being repaired at the admiralty and the plumbers are walking about where they like now i neednt tell you ive had a man or two fishing about among the doorkeepers and so on at the admiralty and one of them found a plumber he knew slightly working on the roof that plumber happens to be no foola bit smarter than the detectiveconstable it seems to me in fact anyhow he seems to have got more out of my man than my man got out of him and soon after i reached the yard he turned up asking to see me he said hed heard that a valuable paper was missing he didnt know what from the room with the skylight in the top floor where the gentleman with the single eyeglass was and where the safe was let in the wall and he wanted to know what would be the reward for anybody giving information about it of course i couldnt make any promise and i gave him to understand that he would have to leave the amount of the reward to the authorities if his information was worth anything also that we were getting to work fast and that if he wished to be first to give information hed better be quick about it but i promised to make a special report of his name and what he had to say if it were useful and it will be or im vastly mistaken for just you see here our friend mr telfer says he put that code safely away at in the safe and that he never went to the safe again till when the controllers secretary was with him never went to it for anything whatever observe well the plumber happened to be near the skylight at halfpast eleven and he is prepared to swear that he saw mr telferthe gent with the eyeglass as he calls himgo to the safe unlock it take out a grey paper folded lengthwise with red tape round it relock the safe and carry that paper out into the corridor the plumber was kneeling by a brazier it seems which was close by the skylight and he is so certain of the time because he was regulating his watch by westminster hall clock and compared it when the halfhour struck which was just while telfer was absent in the corridor with the paper he was only gone a second or two and you will remember that corder saw mayes leaving the premises within two minutes of that time yes well telfer was back in a second or two without the paper and went on with his affairs as before thats pretty striking eh yes hewitt answered thoughtfully it is it was a sort of shot in the dark on the part of the plumber for he knew nothing elsenothing about telfer legitimately having the keys of the safe nor any of the particulars we have been told he merely knew that a paper was missing and having seen a paper taken out of the safe he got it into his head that he had possibly witnessed the theft and he kept his knowledge to himself till he could see somebody in authority mighty keen too about a reward and now you are having telfer supervised i am not that were likely to get the code from him thats passed out sure enough in mayess handsor else his pockets to this confident expression of opinion hewitt offered no reply and presently we alighted at his office eager to learn if peytral had given the information hewitt so much desired sure enough a telegram was there and it ran thus on the night you know of mayes went first to raven street blackfriars then to norbury row barbican message follows now were at work hewitt said briskly and for a while we part i shall make a few changes of dress and go to take a look at raven street blackfriars will you two go on to norbury row youll have to be careful plummer and not show yourself that is where brett will be useful since he isnt known if anybody is to be seen let it be him i shall be very careful myselfthough i shall have some little disguise and i fancy i shall not be so likely to be seen as you what are we to do i asked well of course if you see mayes in the open grab him instantly i neednt tell plummer that i think plummer would naturally seize him on the spot rush him off to the nearest station and go back with enough men to clear out no norbury row if you dont see him youll keep an observation according to plummers discretion but unless some exceptional chance occurs i hope you wont go rushing in till we communicate with each otherwe must work together and i may have news my instinct seems to tell me that yours is the right end of the stick at barbican but we must neglect nothing and that is why i want you to hold on there while i make the necessary examination at the other end do you know this norbury row plummer i think i know every street and alley in the city plummer answered there is a very good publican at the corner of norbury row whos been useful to the police a score of times he keeps his eyes open and i shall be surprised if he cant give us some information about no anyhow moons his name and the house is the compasses i shall go there first and if youve any message to send send it through him ill tell him on the stairs plummer and i encountered another of his assistants ive got the cab sir he reported waiting outside now took up a fare in whitehall opposite the admiralty and drove him to charterhouse street got down just by the meat market thats all the man seems to know plummer questioned the cabman and found that as a matter of fact that was all he did know so telling him to wait to take us our little journey we returned and reported his information to hewitt just as i expected he said quietly he stopped the cab a bit short of his destination of coursejust as you will no doubt theres not a great deal in the evidence but it confirms my idea ii we followed mayess example by stopping the cab in charterhouse street and walking the short remaining distance to barbican norbury row was an obscure street behind it at the corner of which stood the compasses the publichouse which plummer had mentioned we did not venture to show ourselves in norbury row but hastened into the nearest door of the compasses which chanced to be that of the private bar a stout redfaced slowmoving man with one eye and a black patch stood behind the bar plummer lifted his finger and pointed quickly toward the barparlour and at the signal the oneeyed man turned with great deliberation and pulled a catch which released the door of that apartment close at our elbows we stepped quickly within and presently the oneeyed man came rolling in by the other door well good artnoon mr plummer sir he said with a long intonation and a wheeze good artnoon sir youve bin a stranger lately good afternoon mr moon plummer answered briskly weve come for a little information my friend and i which im sure youll give us if you can all the years ive been knowed to the police answered mr moon slower and wheezier as he went on ive allus give em all the information i could an thats a fact aint it mr plummer yes of course and we dont forget it what we want now allus tell em whatever i knows rumbled mr moon turning to me allus an glad to do it too cause why aint they the police very well then i tells em allus tells em plummer waited patiently while mr moon stared solemnly at me after this speech then when the patch slowly turned in my direction and the eye in his he resumed we want to know if you know anything about no norbury row number eight mr moon mused gazing abstractedly out of the window number eight groundfloor stevens packingcase maker firstfloor hutt agent in fancygoods secondfloor dunno name o richardson bookbinder on the door but thats bin there five or six year now and it aint the same tenant richardsons dead an this one dont bind no books as i can see i dont even remember seein him very often tallish darkish sort o gent he is and dont seem to have many visitors well then theres the topfloorbut i spose its the same tenant richardson used to have it for his workshop thats all have you got a window we can watch it from mr moon turned ponderously round and without a word led the way to the first floor puffing enormously on the stairs you can see it from the clubroom he said at length but this ere little place is better he pushed open a door and we entered a small sittingroom thats the place he said pointing theres a new packingcase astanding outside now norbury row presented an appearance common enough in parts of the city a little way removed from the centre a street of houses that once had sheltered welltodo residents had gradually sunk in the world to the condition of tenementhouses and now was on the upward grade again being let in floors to the smaller sort of manufacturers and to such agents and small commercial men as required cheap offices no was much like the rest a packingcase maker had the groundfloor as moon had said and a token of his trade in the shape of a new packingcase stood on the pavement the rest of the building showed nothing distinctive there yare gents said mr moon if you want to watch youre welcome bein the plice which i allus does my best for allus but youll have to excuse me now cos o the bar mr moon stumped off downstairs leaving plummer and myself watching at the window your friend the publican seems very proud of helping the police i remarked plummer laughed yes he said or at any rate he is anxious we shant forget it you see its in some way a matter of mutual accommodation we make things as easy as possible for him on licensing days and as he has a pretty extensive acquaintance among the sort of people we often want to get hold of he has been able to show his gratitude very handsomely once or twice the house on which our eyes were fixed was a little too far up the street for us to see perfectly through the window of the secondfloor though we could see enough to indicate that it was furnished as an office we agreed that the unknown secondfloor tenant was more likely to be our customer or connected with him than either of the others still we much desired a nearer view and presently since the coast seemed clear plummer announced his intention of taking one he left me at the post of observation and presently i saw him lounging along on the other side of the way keeping close to the houses so as to escape observation from the upper windows he took a good look at the names on the doorpost of no and presently stepped within i waited five or six minutes and then saw him returning as he had come its the top floors we want he said when he rejoined me in mr moons sittingroom the packingcase maker is genuine enough and very busy so is the fancygoods agent i went in seeing the door wide open and found the agent a little shopwalkery sort of chap hard at work with his clerk among piles of cardboard boxes i wouldnt go further in case i were spotted do you think youd be cool enough to do it without arousing suspicion mayes doesnt know you you see what do you think we dont want to precipitate matters till we hear from hewitt but on the other hand i dont want to sit still as long as anything can be ascertained you might ask a question about bookbinding of course i said if you will let me ill go at onceglad of the chance to get a peep ill bespeak a quotation for binding and lettering a thousand octavos in paste grain on behalf of some convenient firm of publishers that would be technical enough i think i took my hat and walked out as plummer had done though of course i approached the door of no with less caution the packingcase makers men were hammering away merrily and as i mounted the stairs i saw the little fancygoods agent among his cardboard boxes just as plummer had said the upper part of the house was a silent contrast to the busy lower floors and as i arrived at the next landing i was surprised to see the door ajar i pushed boldly in and found myself alone in a goodsized room plainly fitted as an office there were two windows looking on the street and one at the back more than half concealed behind a ground glass partition or screen i stepped across and looked out of this window it looked on a narrow space or well of plain brick wall containing nothing but a ladder standing in one corner and the only other window giving on this narrow square space was in the opposite wall but much lower on the ground level i saw these things in a single glance and then i turnedto find myself face to face with a tallish thin active man with a pale shaven ascetic face dark hair and astonishingly quick glittering black eyes he stood just within the office door to which he must have come without a sound looking at me with a mechanical smile of inquiry while his eyes searched me with a portentous keenness oh i said with the best assumption of carelessness i could command i was looking for you mr richardson do you care to give a quotation for binding at per thousand crown octavo volumes in paste grain plain with lettering on back no answered the man with the eyes i dont im afraid my carelessness has led you into a mistake i am not richardson the bookbinder he was my predecessor in this office and i have neglected to paint out his name on the doorpost i hastened to apologise i am sorry to have intruded i said i found the door ajar and so came in you see the publishing season is beginning and our regular binders are full of work so that we have to look elsewhere goodday goodday the keen man responded turning to allow me to pass through the door im sorry i cannot be of service to youon this occasion from first to last his eyes had never ceased to search me and now as i descended the stairs i could feel that they were fixed on me still i took a turn about the houses in order not to be observed going direct to the compasses and entered that house by way of the private bar as before that is mayes and no other said plummer when i had made my report and described the man with the eyes ive seen him twice once with his beard and once without the question now is whether we hadnt best sail in straight away and collar him but theres the window at the back and a ladder i think you said can he reach it i think he mighteasily and perhaps theres the roof since hes got the top floor too not good enough without some men to surround the house we must go gingerly over this one thing to find out is what is the building behind ah how i wish mr hewitt were here now if we dont hear from him soon we must send a message but we mustnt lose sight of no for a moment there was a thump at the sittingroom door and mr moon came puffing in and shouldered himself confidentially against plummer bloke downstairs wants to see you he said in a hoarse grunt that was meant for a low whisper twigged you outside i think an says hes got somethink partickler to tell yer i believe es a nark i see him with one o your chaps the other day ill go plummer said to me hurriedly plainly somebodys spotted me in the street and i may as well hear him i knew very well of course what moon meant by a nark a nark is an informer a spy among criminals who sells the police whatever information he can scrape up could it be possible that this man had anything to tell about mayes it was scarcely likely and i made up my mind that plummer was merely being detained by some tale of a petty local crime but in a few minutes he returned with news of import this fellow is most valuable he said he knows a lot about mayes whom of course he calls by another name but the identitys certain he saw me looking in at no he says and guessed i must be after him he seems to have wondered at mayess mysterious movements for a long time and so kept his eye on him and made inquiries it seems that mayes sometimes uses a back way through the window you saw on the opposite side of the little area by way of that ladder you mentioned its quite plain this fellow knows something from the particulars about that ladder he wants half a sovereign to show me the way through a stable passage behind and point out where our man can be trapped to a certainty itll be a cheap ten shillingsworth and we mustnt waste time if hewitt comes tell him not to move till i come back or send a message which i can easily do by this chap im going with and be sure to keep your eye on the front door of no while im gone the thing had begun to grow exciting and the fascination of the pursuit took full possession of my imagination i saw plummer pass across the end of the street in company with a shuffling outatelbowslooking man with dirty brown whiskers and i set myself to watch the door of the staircase by the packingcase makers with redoubled attention hoping fervently that mayes might emerge and so give me the opportunity of capping the extraordinary series of occurrences connected with the red triangle by myself seizing and handing him over to the police so i waited and watched for something near another quarter of an hour then there came another thump at the door and once more i beheld mr moon man askin for you in the bar sir he said asking for me i asked a little astonished by name mr brett e said sir hes the same chap you know hes got a message from inspector plummer e says may he come up here i asked mindful of maintaining my watch certainly sir if you like ill bring him presently the shuffling man with the dirty whiskers presented himself he was a shifty villainouslooking fellow of middle height looking a nark all over he pulled off his cap and delivered his message in a rumscented whisper inspector plummer says the front way dont matter now he said e can cop im fair the other way if youll go round to him at once if mr martin hewitts here ed rather ave im but ony ones to come now naturally i thought plummer would prefer hewitt but in this case i should for once be ahead of my friend and have the pleasure of relating the circumstances of the capture to him instead of listening as usual to his own quiet explanations of the manner in which the case had been brought to a successful issue so i took my hat and went best let me go in front whispered the nark you bein a toff might be noticed it was a reasonable precaution and i followed him accordingly we went a little way down barbican and presently taking a very narrow turning plunged into a cluster of alleys through which however i could plainly perceive that our way lay in the direction of the back of the house in norbury row at length my guide stopped at what seemed a stable yard pushed open a wicket gate and went in keeping the gate open for me to follow it was indeed a stable yard littered with much straw which the nark carefully picked to walk on as noiselessly as possible motioning me to do the same it was a small enough yard and dark and when my guide very carefully opened the door of a stable i saw that that was darker still he pushed the door wide so as to let a little light fall on another door which i now perceived in the brick wall which formed the side of the stable after listening intently for a moment at this door the guide stepped back and favoured me with another puff of rum and a whisper theres no light in that there passage he said an wed better not strike one ill catch hold of your hand he pulled the stable door to and took me by the hand i heard the inner door open quietly and we stepped cautiously forward we had gone some five or six yards in the darkness when i felt something cold touch the wrist of the hand by which i was being led there was a loud click my hand was dropped and i felt my wrist held fast while i could hear my late guide shuffling away in the darkness i could not guess whether to cry out or remain quiet i called after the man in a loud whisper but got no answer i used my other hand to feel at my right wrist and found that it was clipped in one of a pair of handcuffs the other being locked in a staple in the wall i tugged my hardest to loosen this staple but it held firm the thing had been so sudden and stealthy that i scarce had time to realise that i was in serious danger and that doubtless plummer had preceded me when a light appeared at an angle ahead it turned the corner and i perceived coming toward me carrying a lamp the pale man of the eyes whom i had encountered not an hour beforein a word mayes his eyes searched me still but he approached me with a curiously polite smile no mr brett he said my name is not richardson and i am not a bookbinder not that i am particular about such a thing as a name for you have heard of me under more than one already and you are quite at liberty to call me richardson if you like i am sorry to have to talk to you in this uncomfortable place but the circumstances are exceptional but at least i should give you a chair he stepped back a little way and pressed a bellbutton presently the fellow who had decoyed me there appeared and mayes ordered him to bring me a chair at once which he did with stolid obedience i sat in it so that my wrist rested at somewhere near the level of my shoulder mr brett mayes pursued when his man was gone i am not so implacable a person as you perhaps believe me in fact i can assure you that my disposition is most friendly then unfasten this handcuff i said i am sorry that that is a little precaution i find it necessary to take till we understand each other better i am glad to see you mr brett though i am sure you will not think me rude if i say that i should have preferred mr martin hewitt in your place but perhaps his turn will come later i have a proposition to make mr brett i should like you to join me to join you exactly he nodded pleasantly you neednt shrink i shant ask you to do anything vulgar or even anything that with your present prejudices you might consider actively criminal you can help me you see in your own profession as a journalist and in other ways and my enterprise is greater than you may imagine join me and you shall be a great man in an entirely new sphere a small matter of initiation is necessary and that is all you have only to consent to that i said nothing you seem reluctant well perhaps it is natural in your present ignorance this is no vulgar criminal organisation that i have understand i have taken certain measures to provide myself with the necessary tools in the shape of money and so forth but my aims are larger than you suspectperhaps larger than you can understand and i work with a means more wonderful than you have experience of for instance here is todays work you know about the lost naval code of courseit is what you came about that document is now lying in the desk you stood by in the room where we spoke of paste grain book covers and the like it was there then at your elbow it will be sold for many thousands of pounds by tomorrow and all the puny watchings and dodgings that have been devised cannot prevent it the money will go to aid me in the attainment of the power of which you may have a part if you wish the means of attaining this i scruple no more about than you did today about the story of the bookbindings he bowed with a slight smile and went on come now mr brett put aside your bourgeois prejudices and join me your friend plummer is coming gladly i feel sure and he will be useful too and from what i have seen from mr martin hewitt i have no doubt i can make it right with him if i cant it will be very bad for him i can assure you you have heard and seen something of my powers and i need say no more but hewitt is a man of sense and will come in of course and you had better come with your friends i want one or two superior men masonyou know about jacob mason of coursemason was a fool and he was lostinevitably the othershe made a gesture of contemptthey are mere vulgar tools they will have their rewards if they are faithful of course if notwell you remember denson in the samuel diamond business he was not faithful and there was an end of him i may tell you that denson was made an example for one was needed i assigned him a certain operation and having brought it to success he endeavoured to embezzledid embezzlethe proceeds he was made a conspicuous example in a most conspicuous public place to impress the others they didnt know him but they knew well enough what the red triangle meant ah my excellent recruitfor so i count you alreadythere is more in that little sign than you can imagine it is more than a signit is an implement of very potent power and you shall learn its whole secret in that little form of initiation i spoke of see now a present example telfer the admiralty clerk gave up that document at my mere spoken word he will deny it to his dying day and he will be ruined for the act but he gave me the paper himself at my mere order if he were one of my ownif he had passed through the initiation i offer you i would have protected him as it is he must take his punishment and though it is only i who will benefit he will still deny the fact ha mr brett do you begin to perceive that i do not boast when i tell of powers beyond your understanding truly i was amazed though i could not half understand the circumstances of the loss of the admiralty code had been so inexplicable and now these incredible suggestions of the prime actor in the matter were more mysterious still ha you are amazed he went on but if you will come further into my counsels i will amaze you more what are you now a drudge of a journalist and if ever you make a thousand a year to feed yourself with you will be lucky come to me and you shall be a man of power there is a place beyond the sea where i may be king and you a viceroy dont think i am raving it is true enough that i am an enthusiast but i have power power to do anything i please i tell you what are the greatest powers among men on this earth some will say the pen or the sword or love or what not men of the world will say money and lies and they will be very nearly right money and lies will move continents but i have one greater power stillthe very apex of the triangle that power i revealed to jacob mason he thought to betray it and it killed him that power i will reveal to you if you will accept the alternative i offer the alternative yes the alternative for an alternative it is of course if you will go through the form of initiation i shall keep you here a little till i can trust youwhich will be very soon but if notwell mr brett i wish to be as friendly as you please but having been at the trouble of catching you and having got you here safely you who know so much now you who could be so dangerous if you ever got awayeh well you know my methods and you have seen them exemplified and you will understand there was no anger in his voice as he uttered this threat nor even i thought in his eyes but what there was was worse but im sure you will not make things unpleasant he concluded you will go through the little form i have arranged if only for curiosity just think over it for a moment while i go to close my little office he took the lamp and turned away but as he reached the angle of the passage there came a sound that checked his steps i could hear a noise of feet and hurried voices and then suddenly arose a shout in a voice which seemed to be plummers here it cried help this way hewitt brett i shouted back at the top of my voice wondering where plummer was and what it might all mean and with that mayes turned and i saw that he was about to make for the door i had entered by i resolved he should not pass me if i could prevent it and i sprang up and seized my chair in my left hand shouting aloud for help as i did so mayes came with a bound and flung his lighted lamp full at my head it struck the chair and smashed to a thousand pieces and in that instant of time mayes was on me plainly he had no weapon or he would have used it but i was at disadvantage enough with my right wrist chained to the wall i clung with all my might and endeavoured to swing my enemy round against the wall in order that i might clasp my hands about him and i shouted my loudest as i did it but the chair and the broken glass hampered me and mayes was desperate the agony in my right wrist was unbearable and just as i was conscious of a rush of approaching feet a heavy blow took me full in the face and i felt mayes rush over me while i fell and hung from the wrist i had a stunned sense of lights and voices and general confusion and then i remembered nothing iii i came to myself on the floor of a lighted room with hewitts face over mine my wrist seemed broken though it was free there was oil and blood on my clothes and in my left hand i still gripped a piece of mayess coat stop him i cried hes gone by the stable have they got him no good brett hewitt answered soberly you did your best but hes gone and peytral after him peytral yes he brought his own message to town but see if you can stand up i was well enough able to do that and indeed i had only fainted from the pain of the strain on my wrist several policemen were in the room beside hewitt and plummer mayess stronghold was in the hands of his enemies then i suddenly remembered the admiralty code i cried it was in the office desk have you got it no hewitt answered come plummer up the ladder little time was lost in forcing mayess desk and there the document was found grey cover red tape and all intact the police were left to make a vigorous search for any possible copy and the original was handed to plummer as chief representative of the law present he had been trapped precisely as i had been except that he had been led further and shut in a cellar as well as fastened by the wrist mayes it seemed had wasted very little time in attempting to pervert him and i have no doubt that whatever fate might have been reserved for me plummer would never have left the place alive had it not been for the timely irruption of hewitt with peytral and the police in half an hour peytral returned he had dashed out in chase of the fugitive but failed even to see himlost him wholly in the courts in fact for some little while he persevered but found it useless the dirtywhiskered man made no attempt to escape though there was talk of another man having got away in the confusion by way of the stable roof the police were left in charge of the place and we deferred a complete exploration till the next day hewitts tale was simple enough he had endued himself in somewhat seedy clothes and had visited raven street blackfriars which he found to be merely a tenement house it took some time to make inquiries there with the necessary caution because of the number of lodgers and then the inquiries led to nothing it was an experience common enough in his practice but none the less an annoying delay and when he returned to his office he found mr peytral already awaiting him peytral described his following of mayes at much greater length and detail than before and he and hewitt had come on to norbury row at once and asked news of mr moon mr moons description of the successive disappearances of plummer and myself and of our continued absence so aroused hewitts suspicions that he instantly procured help from the nearest station and approached the door of mayess office a knock being unanswered the door was instantly broken in the room was found to be unoccupied but the ladder was still standing at the open window by which mayes had descended to the back premises down this ladder hewitt went with the police after him the rest i had seen myself but what i said what is this mystery why did telfer give up the code and what is the power that mayes talks of it is a power replied hewitt that i have suspected for some time and now i am quite sure of it a secret dangerous and terrible power which i have encountered before though never before have i known its possibilities carried so far it is hypnotism hypnotism i exclaimed but can a person be hypnotised against his will in a sense in most cases he cannot that is the explanation of mayess proposals to you to go through a form of initiation if you had consented the form would have been a process of hypnotism once or twice repeated and you would have been wholly under his control so that if he willed it and forbade you you could tell nothing of what he wished kept secret and you would have committed any crime he might suggest consider poor jacob mason remember how he struggled to tell what he knew oppressed by the horror of it and how it all ended and remember henning the clerk mayess tool in that case of bond robbery what has happened to him he committed suicide as you know immediately after mayes had left him at the barn brett this power of hypnotism a power for healing in the hands of a good man may become a terrible power for evil in the hands of a villain but telfer today he seems to have known nothing of mayes and he was not one of his regular creaturesmayes himself told me so about that i dont know but i expect we shall find that he has been willingly hypnotised at some time or another perhaps more than once by this same scoundrel mayes possibly in one of mayess appearances in respectable society at an evening party or the like in a case of that sort the hypnotist may impress a certain formulaa word a name or a numberon the subjects mind by the repetition of which at any future time that same subject may be instantly hypnotised so that once having become hypnotised on any innocent occasion the subject is in the power of the hypnotist more or less ever after the hypnotist says when i repeat such and such a sentence or number to you in future you will be hypnotised and hypnotised the subject duly is instantly supposing such a case in this matter of mr telfer it would only be necessary for mayes to meet him in the corridor repeat his formula and command the victim to bring out the paper he specified this done he could similarly order him to forget the whole transaction and this the victim would do infallibly it is only necessary to say here parenthetically that later inquiry proved the truth of hewitts supposition twice or three times mr telfer had been hypnotised in a friends chambers by a plausible tall man whose acquaintance his host had made at some public scientific gathering and in the end it became possible to identify this man with mayes mr moon of the compasses was of great comfort to me that evening my cuts and bruises were washed in his house and my inner man revived with his food and drink allus glad to oblige the plice said mr moon allus cos why aint they the plice very well then the adventure of channel marsh i mayess stronghold was taken but mayes had escaped us once again the cage was in our hands but the bird had flown martin hewitt however had his plans as he was soon to show the recovery of the admiralty code was a good stroke and was a satisfactory ending to an important case but that and even the capture of the curious premises behind the barbican made but a haltingplace in his pursuit of mayes and as soon as i was in some degree recovered from my struggle and the captured place had been hastily searched the chase was resumed without a moments delay and that adventure was entered upon which saw the end of the red triangle and its unholy doingswhich came terribly near to seeing the end of hewitt himself in fact i have not described the den near the barbican with any great particularity but i have said that the office accessible from the open street was only connected with the hidden premises behindpremises as was afterwards discovered held under a separate tenancyby an easilyshifted ladder it was in these hidden premises approached by the maze of courts and the stableyard that the main evidences of mayess way of life were observable the passage where my wrist had been locked to the wall and the room or cellar in which plummer had been confined were the only parts of the lower premises fitted for the detention of prisoners with the exception of one very low and wholly unlighted cellar entered by a trapdoor and a very steep flight of brick steps this place smelt horribly faint and stagnant but it produced on my mind both then and when i examined it later an effect of horror and repulsion more than could be accounted for by the smell alone of its history nothing was discovered and perhaps the feeling though others experienced it as well as myself was the effect of mere fancy but i have never got rid of a conviction that that black cellar or rather pitfor it was very narrowhad been the instrument of crimes never to be told there were one or two rooms sparely furnishedone as a bedroom a larger room with a long table a sofa and several chairs and in one of the smaller rooms was found a stove ladles and crucibles for the melting down of metalsgold or silver it was in this same room also that the table stood in the drawers of which were found papers letters and formulaethings giving more than a hint of the use to which mayes had put his friendship with mr jacob mason for of every possible manner and detail in which sciencemore particularly the science of chemistrycould aid in the commission of crime there were notes in these same drawers but most of these things were observed in detail later the thing that set us once more on the trail of mayes that very night and that very hour was found in the isolated office facing the street it was a chequebook quite full of unused cheques this chequebook said hewitt to inspector plummer and myself was in the drawer below that in which we discovered the admiralty code the eastern consolidated is the bank as you seeupper holloway branch now we must follow this at once before waiting to search any further there may be something more important as a clue or there may not but at any rate while we are looking for it we are losing time this may bring us to him at once you mean that he may have some address in holloway suggested plummer and we may get it from the bank theres that possibility and another hewitt answered he has had to bolt without warning or preparation with nothing but the clothes he ran inprobably very little money money he will want at once and he would rather not wait till the morning to get it if he can get it at once it will mean thirteen or fourteen hours start at least more he will know very well that this place will be searched that this chequebook will be discovered soon enough and that consequently the bank will be watched this is what he will dowhat he is doing now very likely he will knock up the resident manager of that bank and try to get a cheque cashed tonight i dont think that can be done in which case he will probably try to make some arrangement to have money sent him either way we must be at the upper holloway branch of the eastern consolidated bank as soon as a hansom can get us there thus it was settled and hewitt and plummer went off at once leaving plummers men with the city police in charge of the raided premises leaving some of them also to make inquiries in the neighbourhood mr victor peytral had shown himself anxious to accompany hewitt and plummer but had been dissuaded by hewitt i guessed that hewitt feared that some hasty indiscretion on the part of this terribly wronged man might endanger his plans peytral however seemed tractable enough and left immediately after them he had business he said which he expected would occupy him for a day or two and when it was completed he would see us again as for myself i only remained long enough to ascertain that the police could find no trace of the direction of mayess flight in the immediate neighbourhood they had little to aid them he had gone without a hat and his dress was in some degree disordered by his struggle with me but the latter defect he might easily have remedied in the courts as he ran and they could gather no tidings of a hatless man so i took my way to my office my wrist growing stiffer and more painful as i went so that i was not sorry to arrange for another member of the staff to take my duty for the night and to get to bed a few hours earlier than usual after the days fatigue and excitement ii going to bed uncommonly soon i woke correspondingly early in the morning but i was no earlier than hewitt who was at my door in fact ere my breakfast was well begun well i asked eagerly almost before my friend had entered have you got him at last not yet hewitt answered but he did exactly as i had expected plummer and i knocked up the bank manager who lives over the premises at the upper holloway branch he was a very decent fellowrather young for the postbut he was naturally a bit surprised possibly irritated at being bothered by one and another after office hours i showed him the chequebook and asked him if it belonged to any customer of his why yes he said examining the numbers i remember this because it is the first of a new series and we issued it the day before yesterday to a new customer where did you get it we are very anxious to see that customer i said has he been here this evening the manager seemed a trifle surprised but answered readily enough yes he said he was here not an hour ago wanting to draw money i asked but that the manager wouldnt tell me of course so that it was necessary for plummer to step in and reveal the facts that this was a police matter and that he was a detectiveinspector that made some difference the manager told us that our man had opened an account at the bank only two days before and id like you to guess what name he had opened it under not myatt i said after the chase no not myatt catherton hunt no nor catherton hunt he had opened it in the name of mayes what his actual name his actual original name according to peytral the account was transferred it would seem from another bank and i have an idea we may find that he has been shifting his money about from one bank to another as safety suggested using his real name with it you remember we could find no trace of a banking account when the police raided and ransacked calton lodge after mason was killed quite probably he has had small current accounts in other names at various times to aid in his schemes but his main account has always stood in his real name and by that you see we get some confirmation of peytrals story well as i say the account was opened in the name of mayes and the chequebook was issued which we discovered last night the upper holloway branch saw no more of its customer till yesterday evening long after hours when he drove up in a hansom oh i said in a hansom was it the men left behind could get no news of him yes we ascertained that last night we called back of course the last thing i expect he got the first cab visible and drove off to a hatters a fair distance away and then on to the bank at any rate he knocked up the manager and told him that he had a sudden need for money that very night could he have some the manager told him it would be impossible even if he had been willing to do it against all regulations it would still be impossible for the strongroom and every cash receptacle in it was locked with two separate locks with different keys and though he had one of these keys himself it was useless without the other which was in the possession of his second in command who lived some distance out of london this course is the usual precaution adopted in branch banks of this sort opening and closing morning and evening have to be done by chief and assistant together and i tell you brett i believe that it was only the being informed of this fact that prevented mayes from trying some of his hypnotic tricks on the bank manager in which case there would have been a big bank robberyperhaps something worse in addition murder murder with a tourniquet perhapsperhaps with some other weapon but at any rate probably with the red triangle you know of courseindeed i told you i thinkthat in most casesnot allit is necessary to get the subjects consent to the first exercise of hypnotism on him i told you also it is possible for the practised hypnotist while the subject is under the influence of the first experiment to suggest to him a certain word or formula or even a silent sign which shall bring him under the influence at any other time whenever the hypnotist chooses to repeat itjust as must have been done with mr telfer in the case of the admiralty code the first suggestion would not be the difficult thing it might seemit would only require a little time and persuasion nothing would be said about hypnotism of course perhaps something about a little physical experiment or the like and then in a moment or two the subject would be in this creatures power for ever remember the little ceremony of initiation that the scoundrel attempted to persuade you to submit to that meant hypnotismperhaps death but this is mere speculation mayes found that the keys on the premises were not enough to release his money even if the strict rules of the bank had permitted the cashing of a cheque out of hours but the manager suggested that perhaps some neighbouring tradesman would exchange cash for a cheque and with the view of obliging the new customer went with him as far as the shop of mr isaac trenaman a grocer and cheesemonger with a rather large shop at the corner of the road mr trenaman introduced and assured by the manager was willing to give as much cash as he could find in the till against mr mayess cheque and did so to the extent of twentyseven pounds a cheque for which sum was duly drawn on one of the tradesmans own cheque forms and left with him this done the banks new customer took himself off with thanks and apologies carrying with him however two blank cheque forms from mr trenamans book the pennies for which he punctiliously paid over the counter having no cheque forms with him he explained he might find them useful if he could come across some friend who could provide the cash he wished to use that night and having completed this business so far this charming new customer of the bank made off into the night and is that all you know of his movements yes as yet he seems to have made no very definite excuse to the manager for wanting the money in such a hurryjust said something had occurred which made cash necessary and was very polite and apologetic generally the manager formed a notion that it must be for some gambling purposehe fancied that mayes said something distantly alluding to that but wasnt sure did you ask about the address given to the bank of course but there we gained nothing the manager couldnt remember it exactly and the books of course were locked up but we know it alreadyfor what the manager could remember was that it was an office address and somewhere near barbican so that we are back at the barbican den again where i am going now with plummer to give a day to a minute investigation of the whole place meanwhile a watch is being set at the bank in holloway do you expect him back there then hardly you see he knows that by this time we must have found his chequebook and will be on the watch but there is just a chancea very remote onethat he may send a message perhaps send somebody to cash a cheque though i dont expect it for he is no foolhe is indeed a sort of geniusand that would be a mistake i think still he is bold and that is where his money is and he may make a dash at it so a couple of plummers men are to be waiting there this morning in the managers office and if anybody comes from mayes he will be detained perhaps you would like to be with them you cant be of much use with me and the job will be dull but there you may have a chance of excitement and you will be useful to come and report if anything does happen why you may even bag mayes himself of courseill go anywhere you please they told you last night i suppose that peytral had business and had gone off yes and im not sorry he is too dangerous a man to have about us with his hot blood and the terrible injuries he keeps in memory as likely as not if we get mayes we should next have to collar peytral for shooting him or something so im not sorry he is out of it for a bit but can you start now plummer is in my office and the two men are in a cab outside the bank opens at nine and that is in upper holloway i seized my hat and made ready you should keep your eyes open hewitt hinted before you get to the bank and when you leave as well as while youre there do you remember how poor mason was watched well there is probably some watching going on now last night on our way to the bank and back i believe plummer and i were watched pretty closely iii plummers two plainclothes men and i reached the neighbourhood of the bank with a quarter of an hour to spare or rather more we dismissed the cab at some little distance from the spot and approached singly so that it was not difficult for us to slip in separately among the dozen or fifteen clerks as they arrived we passed directly into the managers room the door of which opened into the space left for the public before the counter from this room the whole of the outer office was visible through the glass of the partition the manager mr blockley a quick intelligent man of thirtysix or so gave us chairs and pointed out how best we could watch the counter without ourselves being observed if a letter is sent he said it will be brought here to me of course and i will bring the messenger in if a cheque is presented from mayes i have told the cashier to slide that big ledger off his desk accidentally with his elbow that will be your signal and then you can do whatever you think proper i dont think i can do any more than that we took our positions and waited i felt pretty sure that if mayes sent at all it would be early for obvious reasons and i was right for the very first customer was our man he stepped in briskly scarcely a minute after the manager had ceased speaking and i remembered having seen him waiting at the street corner as i came along he was a welldressed smart enough looking man in frock coat and tall hat he took a lettercase from his pocket picked out a cheque from the rest of the papers in it and passed it under the wire grille of the counter the cashier took it turned it over and shifted mechanically to post the amount in the book on his desk as he did so his elbow touched the heavy ledger which the manager had pointed out to us and it fell with a crash the cashier calmly put his pen behind his ear and stooped to pick up the book but even as he did it the two scotland yard men were out before the counter and had sidled up to the stranger one on each side may we see that cheque if you please asked one and the cashier turned its face toward him ah just so a hundred poundsmayes we must just trouble you to come with us if you please there is some explanation wanted about that cheque i had followed the two men from the managers room and now i saw that while one had laid his hand on the strangers shoulder the other had taken him by the opposite arm why said the former looking into his face its broady sims all right the man growled resignedly its a cop ill go quiet but as he spoke i saw the free hand steal out behind him and pitch away a crumpled fragment of paper one of the policemen saw it too followed it with his eyes and saw me snatch it up thats right sir he said take care of that and well have a cab in case anything else drops accidentally its just a turning over broady thats what it is i spread out the piece of paper and was astonished to find inscribed on it just such another series of figures in groups of eight as was found in the cypher message in the case of the lever key here was a great finda secret message as clear to me as to mayes himself and as likely as not the scrap of paper that would hang him i took one of the plainclothes men aside while the other kept his hold of broady sims this is very important i said it is a cypher message which mr hewitt can reador i myself in fact with a little time must you take it with you if so ill make a copy now well sir were responsible you see the man said so i think we must take it so perhaps youd better make a copy as you suggest very well i said that is done in a few seconds you can take your man off and i will go direct to mr hewitt and inspector plummer with the copy and with that i made the copy which read thus it struck me to ask the manager if the cheque just presented were one of those procured from mr trenaman the night before and i found that it was then i left the policemen with their prisoner and made for the nearest cabrank this cypher message no doubt conveying mayess instructions to the man just captured was probably of the utmost importance and hewitt must see it at once and as the cab ambled along towards barbican i busied myself in deciphering the figures according to the plan of the knights move in chess as hewitt had explained to me i could only see two noughts among the numbers so plainly it was a longer message than the one then decipheredone of sixtytwo letters in fact i turned the figures into the letters corresponding in the alphabet a for b for and so on as hewitt had done and i arranged these letters in the squares of a roughly drawn chessboard so that they stood thus w s o a i n i b t h a t n n t h n e l d i g e n c h r w n a h v i f a r c e a s n o u i t l r l u a f w t l i r o e r m l t the letters thus set out to read off the message was a simple task enough in view of the key hewitt had given me i began as in the case of the lever key message at the righthand top corner and taking the knights move from b to e in the last square but one of the third line thence to a at the end of the fifth line and so to t in the seventh line and from that to r fifth square in bottom line u in seventh line and so on in the order shown by the lever key message a copy of which i kept as a curiosity in my pocketbook so i read the message through and i set it down thus be at ruin channel marsh tonight twelve wait in hall for instruc word final the general meaning of this seemed clear enough the man whom the policeman had recognised as broady sims was to be at some spota ruined building it would seemin a place called channel marsh at midnight there to wait in the hall for instructions no doubt for instructions where to take the hundred pounds he was to have got from the bank word final was not so clear though i judgedand i think rightlythat it meant that the word final was to be used as a password by which the two messengers should know each other i was almost at my destination and was cogitating the message and its meaning when the cab checked at some traffic in barbican just by the compasses publichouse and mr victor peytral hailed me and climbed on the step of the cab i was just going to see if mr hewitt was at the place he said and if so to ask him for news but i am rather in a hurry and perhaps you can tell me we are on the track i think i answered and i have just come across this which i am taking to hewitt and with that i showed him my translation of the cypher and gave him its history in half a dozen sentences thats good peytral answered i dont know channel marsh do you but probably mr hewitt does i wont keep you any longeri see youre hurrying but i hope to see you again before long he dropped off the step and disappeared and the cab went on round the corner by the compasses i found hewitt and plummer in the office where on pretence of bookbindery i had first seen mayes face to face the day before they were near the completion of their examination of this office and all its contents and soon would begin as systematically on the premises behind i gave hewitt my copy of the cypher message and my translation with an exact account of how it had come into my possession martin hewitt studied the message for a minute or two and then relapsed into grave thought so he sat for some little time while plummer left the room by the window and descended the ladder to speak with his men on guard below presently hewitt looked up and said brett this message is most importantprobably as important as you suppose it to be but at the same time i believe you have made a great mistake about it but i havent misread it have i is there any other way no you havent misread it youve read every word as it was intended to be read but it is a very different thing from what you suppose it to be what is it then martin hewitt put the paper on the table and looked keenly in my face it is a trap he said it is a trap to catch meunless i flatter myself unduly i could not understand a trap i repeated but how why should mayes need to send his confederate instructions by written note we know the nature of his hold over his subordinates and we know that it means personal communication also the cheque was in mayess own hands last night more mayes knows very well that i have read that cypherhas known it for some time otherwise how could we have discovered the bonds in the case of the lever key also mayes knows that we have his chequebook and know his bank didnt i assure you we were watched last night i believe he knows all we have done in such circumstances he might risk his jackals liberty by sending him on the desperate chance of cashing a cheque but knowing the risk he would never have let him come with information on him and least of all would he have let him come carrying a vital secret written in that very cypher which he knows i read many weeks ago and then see how that message instead of being concealed was positively brought to your notice that man broady sims is a cunning rascal and the police know him of old as a skilful swindler and billforger a man like that doesnt get rid of a compromising scrap of paper by trundling it out under your nose just at the moment he is arrested when the attention of everybody is directed to him no he would wait his opportunity and then he would probably slip it into his mouth and swallow it as it is he would seem to have succeeded in dropping this paper full in your sight with an elaborate pretence of secrecy now this is what has been done brett that man has been sent to cash a cheque with very little hope of success or none because the first move that mayes would anticipate on our part would be the watching for him and his cheques at the bank in upper holloway if by any chance the cheques had been cashed well and good no harm would have been done and then mayes could have gone on to arrange for drawing the rest of his balancecould probably have quite safely come himself to draw it but if on the other hand as he fully anticipated sims was arrested what then nothing was lost but a penny chequeform and even simsthough mayes would care nothing about thatcould only be searched and then released for the cheque was perfectly genuine and there was no charge against him but since he would certainly be searched that cypher note was given him with instructions to make a conspicuous show of attempting to get rid of it now that note was written in a cypher which mayes knew was as plain as printto whom to me i am on his trail and this note is deliberately flung in my way open as the day but with every appearance of secrecy i am his dangerous enemy and he knows itas he told you in fact yesterday if he can clear me away he can take breath and make himself safe the purpose of this note is to induce me to go alone to this place on channel marsh tonight at twelve in the hope of learning where to find mayes there i am to be got rid ofmurdered in some way for which preparation will be made mayes judges my character pretty well he knows that in such circumstances as he represents sims being kept away from his appointment i should certainly go and take his place and use his password to learn what i could and brett that is precisely what i shall do what you will go i exclaimed but you mustntthe danger wed better both go together hewitt smiled why not forty of us he said no here is a chance of bagging our man for however i am to be arranged forwhether by shot steel or the tourniquet i make no doubt it is mayes himself who is to do it you shall come however you and plummer at least but we will not go in a bunchyou shall follow me and watch ready to help when needful this channel marsh is an empty dark space between two channels of the lea it is among the hackney marshes lying between stratford and homerton and i fancy there is a deserted house there though i cant remember ever having seen it do you know it no not in the least well i must reconnoitre today and that with a lot of care i think i told you i was convinced of being watched and that is a thing you cant prevent in a place like london if it is skilfully done now brett you have done very well this morning if you want to be on the scene of action tonight at twelve you must get leave from your editor mustnt you hows your wrist it was still extremely stiff and i told hewitt that i doubted my ability to hold a pen for two or three days very well then get off and convey your excuses as soon as you please i shall have a talk with plummer and then i shall take a few hours to myself by myself in somebody elses clothes be in your rooms all the evening for you may expect a message iv it was at a little past nine in the evening that i next saw hewitt he came into my rooms in an incongruous getup he wore corduroy trousers a very dirty striped jersey a particularly greasy old jacket and a twisted neckcloth but over all was an excellent overcoat and on his head a tall hat of high polish brought to me by kerrett he said in explanation of the hat and overcoat hes been waiting with them for a long time in a court by milford lane a good hat and overcoat will cover anything and i preferred to enter this building in my own character ive been wearing that this afternoon and he pulled out of his pocket an old peaked cap with earpieces tied over the top you mustnt bring your best clothes he went on or youll spoil them scrambling about boats and groping in ditches i have done my ditchgroping for the day and im going to change you had best be putting on older things while i get into newer what sort of place is this channel marsh i asked well i should think there must be a great many better places to spend a night in it must be the dreariest wettest flat within many miles of london and i should like to see the portrait of the man who had the idea of building a house there for a house there is or rather the ruins of itdeserted for years and half carried away by rats and people who wanted slates and firewood and water pipes is that the place where you intend waiting tonight it is i havent examined it nearly so closely as i should like for fear of raising a scare channel marsh is almost an island with a narrow neck of an entrance at each end a foottrack runs the whole length and a person in the ruined house can easily see anybody entering the marsh from either end for that reason i reconnoitred from a boatthe boat you will go in tonight i think it is the very dirtiest old tub i ever saw so that it suited my rig out i discovered it at a wharf some little way down the river and i paid a shilling for the hire of it channel marsh is banked a bit on one side and i crept up under cover of the bank i learned very little beyond the general lie of the land because i was so mighty cautious i judged it better to be content with half an examination rather than drive away the game and even as it is ive an idea i have been seen i lay up among some reeds till dark but after that i am sure there was somebody on the marshand skulking too like me so after waiting and scouting for a little i gave it up and paddled quietly back but look here hewitt i said this seems a bit mad why go and risk yourself as you talk of doing you believe mayes will be there at the ruin or will come there at twelve very well then why cant the police send enough men to surround the place and capture him for certain hewitt smiled and shook his head my dear brett he said you havent seen the place and i have it will be hard enough job for you and plummer to get near the spot unobserved guided by a man who knows every inch a trampling crowd of policemen would have as much chance as a herd of elephants and on such light nights as we are having now they would be seen a mile off and who knows what scouts he may have out no as i say it will be a great piece of luck if you get through unobserved as it is and even now im not perfectly certain that i couldnt do best alone however arrangements are made now and you are coming three of you then what are the arrangements i asked just these you are to leave here first make the best of your way to mile end gate where an old inn stands in the middle of the road go to the corner of the turning opposite this at the south side of the road at eleven oclock a fourwheeler will drive up with plummer and one of his men in it the man is one who knows all the geography of channel marsh and he also knows exactly where to find the boat i used today you will drive to a little way beyond bow bridge and then plummers man will lead you to the boat you had better scull and leave the others to look out they will know what to do you will pull along to a place where you can watch till you see me coming on to the marsh by the path as soon as you see me you will slip quietly along to a place the policeman will show you close to the ruin and watch again thats all i dont know whether or not you think it worth while to take a pistol i certainly shall but then im most likely to want it plummer will have one i thought it well worth while and i took my regulation webleya relic of my old volunteer captaincy then by way of the underground railway i gained the neighbourhood of mile end and interested myself about its back streets till the time approached to look for plummers cab plummer was more than punctualindeed he was two or three minutes before his time the cab drew near the kerb and scarcely stopped so quickly did i scramble in good said plummer were well ahead of time mr hewitt quite right yes i said i left him so an hour and a half ago at his office and we sat silent while the cab rattled and rumbled over the stony road to bow bridge and the shopkeepers on the way put up their shutters and extinguished their lights bow bridge was reached and passed and presently we stopped the cab and alighted here styles plummers man took the lead and a little way farther along the road we turned into a dark and muddy lane on the left we floundered through this for some hundred and fifty yards or so and then suddenly drew in at an opening on the right here we stood for a few moments while our guide groped his way down toward the muddy water we could smell rather than see a little way before us there were a few broken steps and a broad black thing which was the boat we got into it as silently as we could manage and cast off it was a clumsy broadbeamed leaky old conveyance and that it was as dirty as hewitt had described it i could feel as i groped for the sculls and got them out the night was light and dark by turnschanging with the clouds we shipped the rudder and styles steered or i should probably have run ashore more than once for the banks were not always distinct and the channel was narrow and dark we passed the black forms of several factories with tall chimneys and then drew out among the marshes flat and grey with wisps of mist lying here and there so we went in silence for a while till at last we drew in against the bank on the left and laid hold by a post at a landingplace this is the channel marsh whispered styles as we climbed cautiously ashore we cant see the house very well from here but theres where mr hewitt will come through looking over the top of the low bank we could discern a path which traversed the length of the marsh entering it by a broken gate at a neck of land which we must have passed on our way here we crouched and waited we had heard the halfhour struck on some distant clock soon after entering the boat and now we waited anxiously for the threequarters so long did the time seem to my excited perceptions that i had quite decided that the clock must have stopped or at any rate did not chime quarters when at last the strokes came distant and plaintive over the misty flats a quarter of an hour plummer remarked he wont be a minute late nor a minute too early from what i know of him how long will it take him from that gate to the ruin eight or nine minutes good styles answered then we shall see him in seven minutes or six minutes as the case may be plummer rejoined in the same low tones slowly the minutes dragged with not a sound about us save the sucking and lapping of the muddy river and the occasional flop of a waterrat the dark clouds were now fewer and the moon was high and only partially obscured by the thinner clouds that traversed its face more than once i fancied a sound from the direction of the ruin and then i doubted my fancy when at last there was a sound indeed but from the opposite direction and in a moment we saw hewitt muffled close about the neck walking briskly up the path we regained the boat with all possible speed and silence and i pulled my best regardless of my stiff wrist during our watch i had had time to perceive the wisdom of the arrangements which had been made we had been watching from a place fairly out of sight from the ruin yet sufficiently near it to be able to reach its neighbourhood before hewitt and certainly it was better to approach the actual spot at the same time as hewitt himself for then if he were being watched for the attention of the watcher would be diverted from us presently we reached the reedbed that hewitt had spoken of and i could see a sort of little creek or inlet here i ceased to pull and styles cautiously punted us into the creek with one of the sculls the boat grounded noiselessly in the mud and we crept ashore one at a time through mud and sedge the creek was edged with a bank of rough broken ground grown with coarse grass and bramble and as we peeped over this bank the ruined house stood before usso near as to startle me by its proximity it must have been a large house originallyif indeed it was ever completed now it stood roofless dismantled and windowless and in many places whole rods of brickwork had fallen and now littered the ground about the black gap of the front door stood plain to see with a short flight of broken steps before it and by the side of these a thick timber shore supported the front wall it struck me then that the ruin was perhaps largely due to a failure of the marshy foundation the place seemed silent and empty hewitts footsteps were now plain to hear and presently he appeared walking briskly as before he could not see us and did not look for us but made directly for the broken steps he mounted these paused on the topmost and struck a match it seemed a rather large hall and i caught a momentary glimpse of bare rafters and plasterless wall then the match went out and hewitt stepped within almost on the instant there came a loud jar and a noise of falling bricks and then in the same instant of time i heard a terrific crash and saw hewitt leap out at the front doorleap out as it seemed from a cloud of dust and splinters i sprang to my feet but plummer pulled me down again steady he said lie low he isnt hurt wait and see before we show ourselves it seemed that the floor above had fallen on the spot where hewitt had been standing he had alighted from his leap on hands and knees but now stood facing the house revolver in hand watching there was a moments pause a sound of movement from the upper part of the ruin another quiet moment and then a bang and a flash from high on the wall to the right hewitt sprang to shelter behind the heavy shore and another shot followed him scoring a white line across the thick timber plummer was up and styles and i were after him there he is cried plummer up on the coping i pulled out my own pistol dont shoot cried hewitt well take him alive far to the right on the topmost coping of the front wall i could see a crouching figure i saw it rise to its knees and once more raise an arm to take aim at hewitt and then with a sudden cry another human figure appeared from behind the coping and sprang upon the first there was a moment of struggle and then the rotten coping crumbled and down down came bricks and men together i sickened i can only explain my feeling by saying that never before had i seen anything that seemed so long in falling as those two men and then with a horrid crash they struck the broken ground and the pistol fired again with the shock we reached them in a dozen strides and turned them over limp oozing and lifeless and then we saw that one was mayes and the othervictor peytral we kept no silence now but plummer blew his whistle loud and long and i fired my revolver into the air chamber after chamber styles started off at a run along the path towards the town lights to fetch what aid he might but even then we had doubt if any aid would avail mayes he was the under man in the fall and he had dropped across a little heap of bricks he now lay unconscious breathing heavily with a terrible wound at the back of the head and hewitt foretoldand rightlythat when the doctor did come he would find a broken spine peytral on the other hand though unconscious showed no sign of injury and just before the doctor came sighed heavily and turned on his side first there came policemen and then in a little time a hastily dressed surgeon and after him an ambulance mayes was carried off to hospital but with a good deal of rubbing and a little brandy peytral came round well enough to be helped over the marshes to a cab the trap which had been laid for hewitt was simple but terribly effective the floor above the hallloose and broken everywherewas supported on rafters and the rafters were crossed underneath and supported at the centre by a stout beam the rafters had been sawn through at both ends and the rotten floor had been piled high with broken brick and stone to a weight of a ton or more the end of a loose beam had been wedged obliquely under the end of the one timber now supporting the whole weight so that a pull on the opposite end of this long lever would force away the bricks on which the beam rested and let the whole weight fall it was the jar of the beam and the fall of the first few loose bricks that had so far warned hewitt as to enable him to leap from under the floor almost as it fell peytrals sudden appearance when we had time to reflect on it gave us a suspicion as to some at least of the espionage to which hewitt had been subjecteda suspicion confirmed later by peytral himself after his recovery from the shock of the fall for fresh news of his enemy had reawakened all his passion and since he alone could not find him he was willing enough to let hewitt do the tracking down if only he himself might clutch mayess throat in the end this explained the business that had called him away after the barbican stronghold had been captured finding both hewitt and plummer somewhat uncommunicative and himself somewhat out of it he had drawn off and had followed hewitts every movement confident that he would be led to his old enemy at last what i had told him of the cypher message had led him to hunt out channel marsh in the afternoon and to return at midnight he of course regarded the message as i did myself at the time as a perfectly genuine instruction from mayes to sims and he came to the rendezvous wholly in ignorance as to what hewitt was doing and with no better hope than that he might hear something that would lead him in the direction of mayes he had entered the marsh after dark from the upper end and had lain concealed by the other channel till near midnight then he had crept to the rear of the ruin and climbed to where an opening seemed to offer a good chance of hearing what might pass in the hall he had heard hewitt approach from the front and the crash that followed the rest we had seen v mayes never recovered consciousness and was dead when we visited the hospital the day after both skull and spine were badly fractured and the very last we saw of the red triangle was the implement with which it had been impressed which was found in his pocket it was a small triangular prism of what i believe is called soapstone it was perhaps four inches long and the face at the end corresponded with the mark that hewitt had seen on the forehead of mr jacob mason it fitted closely in a leather case in the end of which was a small square metal box full of the red greasy pigment with which the mark had been impressed it was from broady sims that we learnt the exact use and meaning of this implement though he would not say a word till he had seen with his own eyes mayes lying dead in the mortuary then he gasped his relief and said thats the end of something worse than slavery for me ill turn straight after this simss story was long and it went over ground that concerns none of hewitts adventures but what we learned from it was briefly this it had been mayess way to meet clever criminals as they left gaol after a term of imprisonment in this manner he had met sims he had made great promises had spoken of great ideas which they could put into execution together had lent him money and then at last had initiated him as he called it he had put him to lie back in a chair and had directed his gaze on the red triangle held in the air before him and then the triangle had descended gently and he felt sleepy till at the cold touch of the thing on his forehead his senses had gone this was done more than once and in the end the victim found that mayes had only to raise the triangle before him to send him to sleep instantly then he found that he must do certain things whether he wanted or not and it ended in complete subservience so that mayes could set him to perpetrate a robbery and then appropriate the proceeds for himself for by posthypnotic suggestion he could force him to bring and hand over every penny more the poor wretch was held in constant terror for he knew that his very life depended on the lift of his masters hand he could be sent into lethargy by a gesture and killed in that state that very thing was done in fact as we have seen in two cases sims was but one of a gang of such criminals brought to heel and made victims their minds and souls such as they were had passed into the miscreants keeping and terror reinforced the power of hypnotism they committed crimes and when they failed they took the punishment when they succeeded mayes took the gains or at any rate the greater part of them he went also among people who were not yet criminals and by degrees made them so to his own profit the case of henning the correspondence clerk was one that had come under hewitts eyes he used his faculty also with great cunning in other waysas we had seen in the matter of the admiralty code and it was even said among the gang that a man he had once hypnotised he could force by suggestion to commit suicide when he became useless or inconvenient sims and the ragged fellow who had decoyed me into mayess den were the only members of the gang whom we could identify after his death but many others must have shared their relief and i sincerely hopethough i hardly expectthat they all availed themselves of their liberty to abandon their evil courses as in fact the two i speak of did and took to honest work all that had remained mysterious in the earlier cases now became clear in the first the case of samuels diamonds denson had been put into the office where samuel had found him by mayes with the express design of effecting a diamond robbery the robbery was effected and the unhappy denson formed a plan of making a bolt of it himself with the diamonds he was perhaps what is called a difficult subject in hypnotismamenable enough to direct influence but not sufficiently retentive of posthypnotic suggestion he hid the jewels and adopted a disguise but mayes was watching him better than he supposed the diamonds were lost but denson was found and done to deathprobably not in that retreat near barbican but at night in some empty street the diamonds were not found on him and the body with the mark of the triangle still on it was taken by night to a central spot in london and there left mayes probably thought that a notable example like this so boldly displayed and so conspicuously reported in the press would impress his auxiliaries throughout london with the terror that was one of his weapons for they would well understand the meaning of the red triangle and they would receive a striking illustration of the consequences of rebellion or bad faith the money and the watch were left in the pockets because they were trifles after the loss of fifteen thousand pounds worth of diamonds and their presence in the pockets made the murder the less easy to understandwhich was a point gained and as to the keysmayes knew nothing of where the diamonds were hidden and so had no use for them for where could he use them denson had left his lodgings and as to the office that he would guess would be in the hands of the police on samuels complaint the immediate result of this affair on the only honest member of mayess circle i have told in the case of mr jacob mason he was not yet thoroughly in mayess hands but he had dabbled as he remorsefully confessed and mayes had already found him useful he was dangerous and his end came quickly another victim who had probably begun innocently enough was henning the clerk to kingsley bell and dalton and his death in the penns meadow barn leaves a mystery that never can be positively cleared up was it murder or was it suicide by posthypnotic suggestion it will be remembered that the fire burst out in the barn after mayes had left it the case of mr telfer was explained clearly enough by hewitt at the time but it is an example of the snares that lie open for the most innocent person who allows himself to be made the subject of hypnotic experiments at the hands of persons with whom and with whose objects he is not thoroughly acquainted and it must be remembered that at this time there are persons advertising to teach the practice of hypnotism to anybody who will pay to anybody who may use the terrible power as he pleases more the danger is so great that it has led two eminent men of science to issue a public protest and warning with an urgent plea that the practice of hypnotism be restricted by law at least as closely as that of vivisection as to what would have happened if plummer and i had yielded to mayess threats so far as to undergo the initiation he proposed at the time we were helpless in his handsof that i have little doubt i cannot suppose that he would have wasted much time over me once i had fallen lethargic when hewitt burst in he would have found me lying dead with the red triangle on my forehead it would have saved mayes a lot of noise and struggle at least but i often wonder whether or not there was anything in his reference to the place beyond the sea where he would make me a great man if i did as he wished was it his design having accumulated sufficient wealth to return and take his natural place among the enlightened rulers of hayti he would not have been so much worse than some of the others

morrison author of a child of the jago etc etc copyright edition leipzig bernhard tauchnitz to lady dorothy nevill note i designed this story and indeed began to write it between the publication of tales of mean streets and that of a child of the jago to be read together with those books not that i pretend to figure in all threemuch less in any one of thema complete picture of life in the eastern parts of london but because they are complementary each to the two others a m to london town i the afternoon had slumbered in the sun but now the august air freshened with an awakening breath and epping thicks stirred and whispered through a myriad leaves far away beyond the heaving greenwoods distant clouds floated flat on the upper air and a richer gold grew over the hills as the day went westward this way and that between and about trees and undergrowth an indistinct path went straggling by easy grades to the lower ground by wormleyton pits an errant path whose every bend gave choice of green passes toward banks of heather and bracken it was by this way that an old man and a crippled child had reached the pits he was a small old man whitehaired and a trifle bent but he went his way with a sturdy tread satchel at side and butterflynet in hand as for the child she too went sturdily enough but she hung from a crutch by the right shoulder and she moved with a jog and a swing the hand that gripped the crutch gripped also a little bunch of meadowsweet and the other clasped tight against her pinafore a tattered old book that would else have fallen to pieces once on the heathery slade the old man lifted the strap over his head and put the satchel down by a tree clump at the woods edge nother rest for you bess he said as he knelt to open his bag im goin over the pits pretty close today he packed his pockets with pillboxes a poison bottle and a battered flat tin case while the child with a quick rejection of the crutch sat and watched the old man stood slapped one pocket after another and then with a playful sweep of the netgauze across the childs face tramped off among the heather good luck grandad she cried after him and settled on her elbow to read the book needed a careful separation being open at back as at front likewise great heed lest the leaves fell into confusion for since they were worn into a shape more oval than rectangular the page numbers had gone and in places corners of text had gone too but the main body of the matter thumbed and rubbed stood good for many a score more readings and the story was the sicilian romance round about the pits and across the farther ground of genesis slade the old man pushed his chase now letting himself cautiously down the side of a pit now stealing softly among bracken with outstretched net and again running his best through the wiry heather always working toward sun and wind and often standing watchfully still his eye alert for a fluttering spot amid the flood of colour about him meantime the little cripple conned again the familiar periods of the old romance few indeed of its ragged leaves but might have been replaced if lost from pure memory few indeed for that matter of the pilgrims progress or of susan hopley or of the scottish chiefs worn volumes all in her grandfathers little shelf of a dozen or fifteen books so that now because of old acquaintance the tale was best enjoyed with many pauses pauses filled with the smell of the meadowsweet and with the fantasy that abode in the woods for the jangle of a herdbell was the clank of a knights armour the distant boom of a great gun at waltham abbey told of the downfall of enchanted castles and in the sudden plaint of an errant cow she heard the growling of an ogre in the forest the western hillsides grew more glorious and the sunlight peeping under heavy boughs flung along the sward gilt the treeboles whose shadows veined it and lit nooks under bushes where the wakerobin raised its scarlet mace of berries the old man had dropped his net and for awhile had been searching the herbage it was late in the day for butterflies but foxmoth caterpillars were plenty among the heather as well as others thus bessy read and dreamed and her grandfather rummaged the bushes till the sunlight was gathered up from the turf under the trees and lifted from the tallest spire among the agrimony as the sun went beyond the hilltops then at last the old man returned to his satchel the flies aint much he observed as bessy looked up but for trade its best not to miss anything its always what youre shortest of as sells and the blues was out late today but ive got luck with caterpillars if they go all right i ought to have a boxfull o rosy marbled out o these rosy marbled its a late brood then and so long since you had any two year and this is the only place for em the old man packed his bag and slung it across his back well see about tea now he added as the child rose on her crutch but well keep open eyes as we go over the slade they took their way where the purple carpet was patterned with round hollows black with heatherash and green with starmoss by the edges of the old gravelpits overhung with bramble and bush and so into more woods a jay flew up before them scolding angrily now and again a gap among the trees let through red light from beyond woodredon again and again the old man checked his walk sometimes but to drop once more into his even tramp sometimes to stop and sometimes to beat the undergrowth and to shake branches to any who saw there was always a vaguely familiar quality in old mays walk ever a patient plod and burdened or not ever an odd suggestion of something carried over shoulder matters made plain when it was learned that the old man had been forty years a postman presently as they walked they heard shrieks guffaws and a discordant singing that halfsmothered the whine of a concertina the noise was the louder as they went and when they came where the white of a dusty road backed the treestems they heard it at its fullest across the way was an inn and by its side a space of open ground whereon some threescore beanfeasters sported at large many were busy at kissinthering some waved branches torn from trees others stood up empty bottles and flung more bottles at them they stood sat ran lay and rolled but each made noise of some sort and most drank plainly donkeyriding had palled for a man and a boy had gathered their halfdozen donkeys together and were driving them off the people were londoners as bessy knew for she had often seen others she had forgotten london herselfall of it but a large drab room with a row of little beds like her own each bed with a board on it for toys and this too she would have forgotten for she was very little indeed then but that a large and terrible gentleman had come every day and hurt her bad leg it was the shadwell hospital but these were londoners and bessy was a little afraid of them and conceived london to be a very merry and noisy place very badly broken everywhere by reason of the londoners other people also came in waggonettes and were a little quieter and less gloriously bedecked she had seen such a party earlier in the day probably they were not real londoners but folk from parts adjoining but thesethese were londoners proper wearing each others hats with paper wreaths on them wayo old un bawled one as the old man net in hand crossed toward the wood opposite bin ketchin tiddlers and he turned to his companions with a burst of laughter and a jerk of the thumb dyear bill eres yer ole granfather ketchin tiddlers why doncher keep im out o mischief and every flushed face doubly reddened by the setting sun turned and opened its mouth in a guffaw youll cop it for gittin yer trouseys wet screamed a woman and somebody flung a lump of crust bessy jogged the faster into the wood and in its shadow her grandfather smiling doubtfully said they like their joke some of em dont they but its always tiddlers it grew dusk under the trees and the sky was pale above they came to where the ground fell away in a glen that was almost a trench and a brook ran in the ultimate furrow on the opposing hill a broad green ride stood like a wall before them a deep moss of trees clinging at each side here they turned and where the glen widened a cottage was to be seen on sloping ground with a narrow roadway a little beyond it a whitewashed cottage so small that there seemed scarce a score of tiles on its roof one of the few scattered habitations holding its place in the forest by right of ancient settlement a little tumult of garden tumbled about the cottagea jostle of cabbages lavender onions wallflowers and hollyhock confined as with difficulty by a precarious fence patched with wood in every form of manufacture and in every stage of decay i expect mother and johnny finished tea long ago bessy remarked her eyes fixed on the cottage why theres a light the path they went by grew barer of grass as it neared the cottage and as they trod it mens voices could be heard from within and a womans laughter sounds like visitors the old man exclaimed thats odd i wonder who there you are then father came a female voice from the door heres uncle isaac an a gentleman come to see us it was bessys mother who spokea pleasant fresh active woman in a print dress who stood in the doorway as the old man set back the gate the door opened into the livingroom where sat two men while a boy of fourteen squeezed abashed and a trifle sulky in a corner there was a smell of bad cigar which had almost but not quite banished the wonted smell of the room a smell in some degree due to camphor though perhaps more to caterpillar for the walls were hidden behind boxes and drawers of divers shapes and sizes and before the window and in unexpected places on the floor stood other boxes covered with muslin nurseries for larvae pupae and doomed butterflies and so many were these things that the room itself a mere box gave scant space to the three people and the little round table that were in it wherefore bessys mother remained in the doorway and uncle isaac when he rose took a very tall hat from the floor and clapped it on his head for lack of other safe place for the little table sustained a load of cups and saucers uncle isaac was a small man though with a large face a face fringed about with grey wisps of whisker and characterised by wide and glassy eyes and a great tract of shaven upper lip good evenin mr may good evenin said uncle isaac shaking hands with the air of a man faithful to a friend in defiance of the world this is my friend mr butson mr butson was a tall rather handsome man of forty or thereabout with curly hair and whiskers and he greeted the old man with grum condescension mr butson uncle isaac continued with a wave of the hand is a gentleman at present in connection with the steamboat profession though above it by famly and inclination mr butson an me as bin takin a days olludy with a seleck party by name of beanfeast in brakes o yes responded old may divesting himself of his bag we passed some of em by the dun cow an very merry they was too with concertinas an kissinthering an what notvery gay o damn no growled the distinguished butson not that low lot he means that coster crowd in vans he added for uncle isaacs enlightenment i aint fell as low as that lor no he sucked savagely at the butt of his cigar found it extinct looked vainly for somewhere to fling it and at last dropped it into a teacup no mr may no not them lot uncle isaac said with a touch of grave reproof as a man of some little property meself an in company of mr butson by nature genteeldisposed i should be far from mixin with such we come down with the shipwrights an engineers from lawsonses that was probly mr mays little joke mr butson mr may is a man of property hisself besides a man of science as i think i told you this ere land an residence bein in pint if any man was to come an say to mr may git out o that property mr may what would the lawr say to that man nullavoid thats what the lawr ud say it ud say git out yerself your claims nullavoid uncle isaac checking a solemn thump at the table just in time to save the teacups took his hat off instead and put it on again mr butson grunted ah and mrs may taking the net squeezed in with bessy behind her ill put a few o these boxes on the stairs an make more room she said the kettles still boiling in the backhouse an ill make some more tea bessy had a habit of shyness in presence of strangers and uncle isaac ranked as one for it was two years at least since he had been there before indeed what she remembered of him then made her the shyer for he had harangued her very loudly on the gratitude she owed her grandfather calling her a cripple very often in course of his argument and sometimes a burden she knew that she was a cripple and a burden but to be held tightly by the arm and told so by a gentleman with such a loud voice and such large eyes as uncle isaac somehow inclined her to cry so now as soon as might be she joined her brother and the two retreated into the shadowy corner between the stairfoot and the backhouse door the old butterflyhunter too was shy in his more elderly way beyond his widowed daughterinlaw and her two children he had scarce an acquaintance or at least none more familiar than the naturalists in london to whom he sold his specimens so that now in presence of this very genteel mr butson who he feared was already disgusted at the humble character of the establishment he made but a hollow meal a halfforgotten notion afflicted him that it was proper to drink tea in only one of two possible ways but whether from the cup or from the saucer he could not resolve himself mr butson had finished his tea so that his example was lacking though indeed the lees in his saucer seemed to offer a hinta hint soon triumphantly confirmed by uncle isaac who was nothing averse from a supplementary cup and who emptied it straightway into his saucer and gulped ardently glaring fearfully over the edge whereat his host drank from the saucer also and took heed to remember for the future still he was uncomfortable and a little later he almost blushed at detecting himself inhospitably grateful for signs that mr butson began to tire of the visit meanwhile he modestly contributed little to the conversation no said mr butson gloomily after a long pause and in reply to nothing in particular i aint a man of property i wish i was if people got what they was brought up tobut there he stuck his hands lower in his pockets and savagely regarded vacancy mr butsons uncle said uncle isaac is a mayor a mayor an is other relations is of almost equal aristocracy but e wont ave nothin to say to em not a word its jist bloodpride o breedin but what i say is it may be proper selfrespeck but it aint proper selfjustice it aint selfjustice in my way o puttin it why e wont even name em wont name em mr may wont he the old man answered rather tamely dear dear mr butson laid his head back jerked his chin and snorted scorn at the ceiling nowont as much as name em such is is lawfty contemp otherwise what ud be my path of dooty my path of dooty on behalf of selfjustice to mr butson would be to see em an put a pint o argument ere i puts it is im an ere is me ere is mr enery butson your very dootiful relation of fashnable instinks an a engineer than which none better though much above it an unsuitably enchained by worldly circumstances in the engineroom of a penny steamer here mr butson snorted again likewise ere is me a elderly man of some small property an a shipwright of practical experience them circumstances bein the case conskently what more nachral an proper than a partnershipwith capital thats ow id put the pint a partnership with capital jus so said old may and seeing that the other still paused he added of course but es proudproud said uncle isaac shaking his head plaintively praps i am proud mr butson admitted candidly i spose i got my faults but i wouldnt take a penny from emnot if they was to beg me on their knees why id sooner be beolding to strangers ah that e would sighed uncle isaac but it aint selfjustice no it aint selfjustice its selfrespect anyow said mr butson sullenly if they like to treat me unnatural let em ah observed uncle isaac some famlies is unnachral an some is nachral an theres a deal o difference between em look at mr may now e aint altogether in my family though my nieces fatherinlaw by marriage but what nachralness his son was a engineer in yer own trade mr butsonfitter at maidments e left my niece a widder conskence of a coattail in a cog wheel what does mr may do why e shows is nachralness e brings er an er children down ere on is own freeold residence an conskentlyere they are look at that it was a principle with uncle isaac to neglect no opportunity of reciting at large the excellences of any person of the smallest importance with whom he might be acquainted or the excellences which that person might be supposed to desire credit for if in his actual presence so much the better nothing could be cheaper and on the whole it paid very well at worst it advertised an amiable character and there remained offchances of personal benefit moreover the practice solidified uncle isaacs reputation among his acquaintances for here quoth each in his turn was plainly a man of sagacious discernment the old postman however was merely uneasy to his mind it was nothing but a matter of course that when his son died the widow and children should come under his own roof and it was as a matter of course that he had brought them there but bessys mother said simplyyes grandads been a good one to us always she as well as the children called him grandad yes proceeded uncle isaac an im with as much to think about as a man of edication toowonderful why theres nothink as e dont know in astronomy ananan insectonomy nothink no not astronomy interjected old may a little startled by both counts of the imputation not astronomy mr mundy i say yes answered uncle isaac with an emphatic slap on the knee modesty under a bushels all very well mr may all very well but i knowi know astronomy an medicamedica an all the other classics i know ah id give best part o my small property sich as it is for alf your edication mr may it was generally agreed in the family that uncle isaac was very close as to this small property of his nothing could induce him to speak of it with any particularity of detail and opinions varied as to its character still whatever it was it sufficed to gain uncle isaac much deference and considerationthe more probably because of its mysterious character a deference and a consideration which uncle isaac could stimulate from time to time by cloudy allusions to altering his will well observed mr butson rising from his chair education never done me much good no unforchnately commented uncle isaac an id prefer property meself mr butson made toward the door and uncle isaac prepared to follow at this moment a harsh female voice suddenly screamed from the darkness without lor i almost fell over a blessed ouse it said and there was a shrill laugh well ask em the way back old may stepped over the threshold at the sound but the magnificence was stricken from the face of mr butson his cheeks paled his mouth and eyes opened together and he shrank back even toward the stairfoot nobody marked him however but the children for attention was directed without djear which way to the dun cow see the lane answered the old postman follow that to the right an youll come to it its a bit farther than through the wood but ye cant go wrong right there were two women and a man the screaming woman said something to the others in a quieter tone in which however the word tiddlers was plain to hear and there was a laugh goodnight ole chap she bawled back put em in a jampot with a bit o watercreese full o their games remarked the old man with a tolerant smile as he turned toward the door that was the person as said id catch it for gettin my clothes wet as we came past the dun cow the voices of the beanfeasters abated and ceased and now mr butson left no doubt of his readiness to depart come he said with chapfallen briskness well ave to git back to the others theyll be goin he took leave with so much less dignity and so much more haste than accorded with his earlier manner that mr may was a trifle puzzled though he soon forgot it goodnight mr may i wish you goodnight said uncle isaac shaking hands impressively ive greatly enjoyed your flow of conversation mr may he made after the impatient butson stopped halfway to the gate and called gentlynan yes uncle mrs may replied stepping out to him what is it uncle isaac whispered gravely in her ear and she returned and whispered to the old man of coursecertainly he said looking mightily concerned as he reentered the cottage mrs may reached a cracked cup from a shelf and turning over a few coppers elicited a halfcrown with this she returned to uncle isaac ill make a note of it said uncle isaac as he pocketed the money and send a postalorder o dont trouble about that uncle isaac for uncle isaac with the small property must not be offended in a matter of a halfcrown what trouble he ejaculated deeply pained to pay my erecome on growled mr butson savagely from the outer gloom come on and they went together taking the lane in the direction opposite to that lately used by the noisy woman well old may observed we dont often have visitors an i was glad to see your uncle isaac nan an mr butson too he added impartially yes returned bessys mother innocently such a gentleman isnt he theres one thing i forgot the old man said suddenly i might ha asked em to take a drop o beer fore they went they had some while they was waitin for tea anan i dont think theres much left she dragged a large tapped jar from under the breedingbox at the window and it was empty ah was all the old mans comment as he surveyed the jar thoughtfully presently he turned into the backhouse and emerged with a tin pot and a brush im a goin treaclin a bit he said come johnny the boy pulled his cap from his pocket fetched a lantern and was straightway ready while bessy sat to her belated tea the last pale light lay in the west and the evening offered up an oblation of sweet smells all things that feed by night were out and nests were silent save for once and again a sleepy twitter every moment another star peeped and then one more the boy and the old man walked up the slope among the trees pausing now at one now at another to daub the bark with the mixture of rum and treacle that was in the pot its always best to be careful where you treacle when theres holiday folk about said johnnys grandfather they dont understand it often ive treacled a log or a stump and found a couple sittin on it when i came backwith new dresses and sich its no good explaininthey think its all done for practical jokin its best to go on an take no notice ive heard em saydont the country smell lovelymeanin the smell o the rum an treacle they was asittin on but when they find itlor the language i have heard awful the boy was quiet almost all the round presently he said grandad do you really like that likeness i made of mother like it my boy why o course its a nobby picture uncle isaac said it was bad o there was a thoughtful pause while they tramped toward the next tree thats only uncle isaacs little game johnny you mustnt mind that its a nobby picture i dont believe uncle isaac knows anything about it said the boy vehemently i think hes ignorant here johnny johnny cried his grandfather that wont do you know not at all you mustnt say things like that well thats what i think grandad an i know he says things wrong when he came before he said that ship i drew was badan ii very near cried he did cry but that was in secret and not to be confessed but now johnny went on im fourteen an i know better i dont believe uncle isaac knows a bit about things they had come again to the tree first treacled and leaving the pot and brush at its foot the old man by help of the lantern took certain of the moths that had been attracted from this he carried the lantern to the next tree in the round and then to the next filling the intervals between his mothcaptures with successive chapters of a mild and rather vague lecture on respect for elders it was dark night now and the sky all adust with stars the old man and the boy took their way more by use than by sight amid the spectral presences of the trees whose infinite whispering filled the sharpening air they emerged on high ground whence could be seen here the lights of loughton and there the lights of woodford and others more distant in the flatter country here the night wind swept up lustily from all essex and away from far on the robin hood road came a rumble and a murmur and presently the glare of handlights red and green the sign and token of homing beanfeasters ii for some while a problem had confronted the inmates of the cottage and now it was ever with them the choice of a trade for johnny the situation of the cottage itself made the main difficulty there was a walk of two miles to the nearest railway station and then london was twelve miles off it was in london that trades were learnt but to get there here the family must stay for here was the cottage which cost no rent for the old man had bought it with his little savings moreover here also were the butterflies and the moths which meant butter to the dry bread of the little pension and here was the garden to part with johnny altogether was more than his mother could face and indeed what was to pay for his lodging and keep the moths and butterflies could be no living for johnny to begin with though he was always ready to help in the hatching killing setting and what not he was no born insecthunter like his grandfather and then the old man had long realised that the forest was growing a poorer and poorer huntingground each year and must some day after he was dead he hoped be no longer worth working people were hard on the hawks so that insecteating birds multiplied apace and butterflies were fewer and there was something else or so it seemedsome subtle influence from the great smoky province that lay to the southwest for london grew and grew and washed nearer and still nearer its scummy edge of barren brickbats and clinkers it had passed stratford long since and had nearly reached leyton and though leyton was eight miles off still the advancing town sent something before itan odour a subtle principlethat drove off the butterflies the old man had once taken the emperor moth at stratford in a place long covered with a row of grimy little houses now the emperor was none too easy to find in the thickest of the woodland and indeed when the wind came from the southwest the air seemed less clear in the old mans eyes than was its wont a dozen years back true many amateurs came with netsboys from boardingschools thereabout chieflyand did not complain but he who by trade had noted day by day for many years the forests produce in egg larva pupa and imago saw and knew the change so that butterflies being beyond possibility as johnnys trade his grandfather naturally bethought him of the one other he himself was familiar with and spoke of the postoffice he knew the postmaster at loughton and the postmasters at other of the villages about the forest by making a little interest johnny might take the next vacancy as messenger but the prospect did not tempt the boy he protested and it was almost his sole contribution to the daily discussion that he wanted to make something and there was little doubt if one might judge from the unpleasing ships and figures in coloured chalks wherewith he defaced whatever offered a fair surface that he would most like to make pictures he never urged the choice in plain terms for that were hopeless but both his mother and his grandfather condemned it in all respects as though he did theres a deal more caterpillar than butterfly in this life for the likes of us my boy the old man would say as he laboured at his setting makin pictures an such is all very well but we cant always choose our own line ive bin a lucky man in my time thank god the insects was my hobby long fore i made any money of em your poor granmother that you never saw a lot o good them moths an grubsll be to you she used to say why not bees as you can make somethin out of an haskins that took the next round to mine he kep bees but i began sellin a few specimens to gentlemen here an there an then more an after that i took em to london reglar same as now it aint as good as it was an its goin to be worse but im in hopes itll last my time out it was because i was carryin letters here that i had the chance o doin it at all if you was to carry em yourself youd be able to do something else toobees praps a good few mends boots but were a bit off the villages here heres the houseyours an your mothers when im gone an im sixtynine an its healthier an cleaner than london you could put up a little bit o glass in the garden an grow tomatoes an cucumbers theman fowlsyou could keep fowlswould sell very well to the gentlefolk an they all know the postman wages aint high but you live cheap here with no rent and theres a pension praps thats your line depend on it johnny but i should like a trade where i could make something the boy would answer wistfully i really should grandad ahwith a shake of the headmake what i doubt but youre meanin pictures you must get that notion out of your head johnny some of them as make em may do well but mosts awful i see em in london often drorin on the pavement reglar clever ones too doin mackerel an bits o salmon splendid and likenesses o the queen an sunsets with the sky shaded beautiful beggin reglar beggin with a cap out for coppers an help gifted poverty wrote in chalk that wont do ye know johnny the boys mother felt for him an indefinite ambition not to be realised by a life of lettercarrying though picturemaking she favoured as little as did the old man but there was the situation of the cottagea hindrance they could see no way to overcome this being so they left it for the time and betook themselves to smaller difficulties putting the lettercarrying aside for the moment and forgetting distance as an obstacle what trades were there to choose from truly a good many and that none should be missed johnnys grandfather took paper and a pencil and walked to woodford where he begged use of a london directory and read through all the trades from absorbent cotton wool manufacturers to zincographic printers making a laborious list as he went omitting with some reluctance such items as bankers brokersstock and sharemerchants patentees and physicians and hesitating a little over such as aeronauts and shive turners the task filled a large part of three days of uncommonly hard work and old david may finished his list in mental bedevilment what was a shive turner indeed for that matter what was an ammeter the list did but multiply confusion and divide counsel nan may sang less at her housework now thinking of what she could remember of the trades that began with absorbent cotton wool manufacture and ended with zincographic printing little bess neglected the bookshelf and pored over the crabbed catalogue with earnest incomprehension it afflicted johnny himself with a feeling akin to terror for which he found it hard to account the arena of the struggle for bread was so vast and he so small a combatant to choose a way into the scrimmage more it seemed all so unattractive there could be little to envy in the daily life of a seed crusher or a court plaster maker but the old man would pin a sheet of the list to the wall and study it while he worked within doors full of patience and simple courage bakin powder maker he would call aloud to whomsoever it might reach hows that thats makin something sometimes bob smallpiece the forest keeper would look in on his way by the cottage and be consulted bob was an immense being in much leather and velveteen with a face like a longkept pippin when he first came to the forest years back his amiable peeps into the house may have been prompted by professional considerations for it was his habit to keep an eye on solitary cottages in his walk cottages wherein it had once or twice been his luck to spy by surprise some furry little heap that a poke of his ash stick had separated into dead rabbits indeed had old mays tastes lain that way nothing would have been easier for him than to set a snare or two at night as he hunted his moths but soon the keeper found that this one at least of the cottagers thereabouts was no poacher and then his greetings were as friendly as they seemed as to johnnys trade he had few ideas beyond one that butchers did very well in london his sister having married one and what a shive turner or an ammeter might be he knew no more than his stick but he knew well enough what a poacher was as also perhaps did the stick if contact could teach it and he counselled that the boy be kept away from certain lotsas the blandy lot the honeywell lot and the hayes lotwho would do him no good the old butterflyhunter knew these lots very well on his own account and his perpetual gropings about banks and undergrowth made him no friends among them they would scarce believe even after long experience that grubs alone accounted for his activity and truly a man with a government pension who affected scientific tastes who lived a clean life who was called mr may by keepers and who moreover had such uncommon opportunities of witnessing what passed in the woods might well be an object of suspicion in simple truth the village loafers had small conception of the old mans knowledge of their behaviour among the rabbit burrows he knew the woods as they knew the inwards of a quart pot and his eyes aged as they might be were trained by years of search for things wellnigh invisible amid grass leaves and undergrowths he could have found their wires blindfold and he knew joe blandys wires from amos honeywells better than joe and amos themselves but of all this he said nothing holding himself a strict neutral and judging it best never to seem too knowing still it was the fact that when the lots were periodically weeded of members caught with disjoinable guns wire nooses or dead things furred or feathered those left behind were apt to link circumstances together and to regard the old man with doubt and illfavour once indeed he hung in doubt for days much tempted to carry a hint to bob smallpiece of a peculiarly foul and barbarous manner of deerstealing wherein figured a tied fawn an anxious doe a heavy stone a broken leg and a cut throat but it chanced that the keeper was otherwise aware and old mays doubt was determined by news that the thief waled and gory for he had made a fight for it had been brought to the policecells with a dripping doe on a truck behind him even now as bob smallpiece grinned in at the cottage door one saw the gap where two teeth had gone in that upanddowner no said the keeper it wont do the boy no good to let him knock about with nothing to do bout here specially boys that knocks about this part mostly gets in wi them lots as we bin speakin of or something about as bad aint there no gentleman hereabout ud give him a job id like him to learn a trade the old man said anxiously but i dont see how its always somethin to stand by is a trade an its what he wants wants to make somethinthats the way he puts it else id say postoffice same as me his father was in the engineerin remarked mrs may who had arrived at the door with certain sticks of rhubarb from the garden id like him to go to that i think but he cant from here bob smallpiece knew nothing of engineering and little more of any other of the several trades read out from the list pinned to the windowframe near which the old man worked at a settingstick and presently he departed on his walk bessy at the casement above saw him swing away toward the glen lifting his stick in recognition of johnny who bore a bundle of dead sticks homeward johnnys mother peeled and cut the rhubarb revolving impossible expedients for bridging the space between them and london the space that looked so small on the map but was so great an obstacle to their purposes and so wide a division between the two modes of life she knew johnnys grandfather pinned and strapped deftly deep in thought presently looking up it beats me he said fearful of ignoring some good thing in trades to guess what a shive turner is iii so life went at the cottage for a little while they looked for another visit from uncle isaac since as he sent no postal order it was felt that he must defer the return of the halfcrown merely because he contemplated an early payment in person but weeks passed and nothing was heard of him nor seen meantime the problem of johnnys trade met no solution he had left school nearly three months now and the thing seeming desperate he had wellnigh resolved to give in to the postoffice at the thought london seemed a far and wondrous place whereto he could never attain and awe of the terrible list his grandfather had compiled from the london directory became longing for the least inviting trade in the collection he had his memories of london too and they were more numerous and more pleasant than bessys there he could see from his bedroom window the masts of many ships quite close in the strong winds and in his remembered london the weather was ever cold brisk dry and windy the masts bent and rocked gravely the ropes bellied and the blocks whistled aloud at nights he lay and heard the yards groan and the cordage creak and rattle just by the corner ships sometimes thrust prying jibbooms clean over the dock wall as if to see what a town was like and often he had stood in the street to watch men climbing the rigging and hanging bent over spars like earwigs he had gone shopping too gripping tight at his mothers skirts in flaring marketstreets where everybody shouted at once and there were mountains of bullseyes and peppermint on barrows there was a street with shops on one side and a blank wall on the other and over and behind this wall lifted high in the air was the monstrous skeleton of a great ship men swarmed like ants about the skeleton and all day hammers went with a mighty clangour and great lights flared at night there were big blank walls at all the places where they made ships and he could remember a little door in one such wall a door beyond which he greatly desired to see but it was rarely opened and then but a little way by an illnatured old man who squeezed through and closed it very quickly so that johnny believed he must issue thus to prevent the escape of some small and active animal imprisoned within all that johnny remembered of his father was that he wiped his oily hands on cotton waste a curious stufflike a great deal of soft sewingthread in a hopeless tanglethat he had never seen since that and the funeral when he rode in a carriage with a crape bow pinned to his new jacket and his mother held his hand very tight at the graveside most of his memories were of the streets and some revived after long oblivion as when the smell of roasted chestnuts brought a vision of a glowing coke fire by the corner of the shipyard wall with a pockmarked man behind it whom he would know anywhere now and he was not to return to this place of wistful memory after all nor to learn to make a ship nor an enginelet alone a picture the weeks went and berries hung where flowers had been johnny and bessy made their yearly harvest of blackberries some for puddings and jam at home some to sell at such kitchen doors as might receive them until an afternoon in early october when with an order from a lady at theydon they betook themselves in search of sloes warm colours touched the woods to a new harmony and seen from high ground they lay like flowerbeds in green and red yellow and brown the honeysuckle bloomed its second time and toadstools stood in crimson companies in the shade of the trees sloes were rare this year near home so the children searched their way through the wake valley to honey lane quarters and there they found their sloes though few it was a long and scratchy task and when it was finished they were well up in st thomass quarters and the sun was setting they made the best of their way back as far as the road near the dun cow and there parted for bessy was tired and hungry and though johnny was little better he resolved to carry his sloes fresh to theydon and get the money since he was already a little on the way so bessy turned up the lane that led to the cottage and johnny took to the woods again for theydon by way to right of wormleyton pits dusk was growing to dark but the boy stepped fearlessly well knowing his path the last throstle sang his last evensong for the year and was still the shadowy trees so living and so silent about him the wrestling trunks of beeches the reaching arms of oak and hornbeam all struck at gaze as though pausing in their everlasting struggle to watch and whisper as he passed and the black depths between them might well have oppressed the imagination of such a boy from other parts but johnny tramped along among them little heeding thinking of the great shiphaunted london he longed for and forecasting nothing of the blow that should fall but in that hour and send him the journey sorrowing presently he was aware of a light ahead it moved a foot or two from the ground and johnny knew its swing then it stopped resting by a tree root you grandad called johnny and hullo came the old mans voice in answer the old man had cut a leaf with a caterpillar on it from a shrub and was packing it in a pillbox out for a few nightfeeders he explained as the boy stopped beside him but you aint been home to tea he added takin home the sloes might ha left em till the morning john easynow youve got em oh i come up from over therejohnny made a vague toss of the arman i thought i might as well cut across to theydon first bess went up the lane ill be home fore ye now grandad nless you re goin back straight i wont be long behind ye im just goin to the pits i cant make nothin o them i took last night under the brambles an heathernever saw the like before quite so im goin to see if theres more an get all i can they walked together a few yards till the trees thinned youll go cross the slade said the old man step it or youll be beat ill step it the boy answered i want my tea he was trotting home by the lane from theydon with his empty basket on his arm and his hands and the sixpence in his trousers pockets when he checked at a sound as of a cry from the wood but he heard no more and trotted on probably the deer were fighting somewhere rare fighters were the bucks in october iv johnny had finished his tea and was lying at his ease in the old easychair whistling rattling his heels on the hearth and studying a crack in the ceiling that suggested an angry face mrs may had put the sixpence the sloes had brought into the cracked teacup that still awaited the return of uncle isaacs halfcrown had washed the teathings and was now mending the worn collar of grandads greatcoat in readiness for the winter bessy had fallen asleep over her book had been wakened had fallen asleep again and in the end had drowsily climbed the stairs to early bed but still the old man did not return i wonder grandad aint back yet johnnys mother said for the third time he said hed be quick sos to finish that case tonight this was a glasstopped mahogany box in course of setting with specimens of all the sphinges a special private order spect he cant find them caterpillars he went for johnny conjectured thats what it is hes forgot all about racin me home mrs may finished the collar lifted the coat by the loop and turned it about in search of rents finding none she put it down and stood at the door listening think youre too tired to go an look for him johnny she asked presently johnny thought he was its them caterpillars safe enough he said he never saw any before an it was just a chance last night tonight he cant find em and hes keepin on searchin all over the pits and the slade thats about it there was another pause till mrs may remembered something the bit o candle he had in the lantern wouldnt last an hour she said hed ha had to come back for more johnny im gettin nervous why what for asked johnny though the circumstance of the short candle startled his confidence he might get a light from somewhere else stead o comin all the way back but where asked mrs may theres only the dun cow an he might almost as well come homebesides he wouldnt ask em johnny left the chair and joined his mother at the door as they listened a more regular sound made itself plain amid the low hum of the trees footsteps here he comes said johnny but the sound neared and the steps were long and the tread was heavy in a few moments bob smallpieces voice came from the gloom wishing them goodnight mrs may called to him have you seen grandad anywhere mr smallpiece the keeper checked his strides and came to the garden gate piebald with the light from the cottage door no he said i aint run across him nor seen his light anywheres know which way he went he was just going to wormleyton pits an back thats all well ive just come straight across the pits an as straight here as ever i could go past the dun cow an aint seen neer a sign of him want him particular im gettin nervous about him mr smallpiecesomehow im frightened tonight he went out about six an now it dont want much to nine an he only had a bit o candle that wouldnt burn an hour and he never meant stopping long i know cause of a case hes got to set i thought praps you might ha seen no i see nothin of him but ill go back to the pits now if you like an welcome id be sorry to bother you but i would like someone to go here johnny go along theres a good boy all right all right the keeper exclaimed cheerfully well go together i expect hes invented some new speeches o moth an hes forgot all about his light thinkin out the improvements it aint the first time hes been out o night about here anyhow not likely to lose himself is mr may johnny had his cap and was at the gate and in a moment the keeper and he were mounting the slope mothers worryin herself over nothing tonight johnny grumbled grandads been later n this manys a time an she never said a word why when he gets after caterpillars an things he forgets everything they walked on among the trees presently how long is it since your father died bob smallpiece asked abruptly nine years now and more mother might ha married agen i spose i dunno very likely never heard her say nothing bob smallpiece walked on with no more reply than a grunt soon a light from the dun cow twinkled through the bordering coppice and in a few paces they were up at the woods edge no light along the road the keeper said glancing to left and right and making across the hard gravel theres somebody johnny exclaimed pointing up the pale road drunk objected the other and truly the indistinct figure staggered and floundered an goin the wrong way chap just out o the dun cow come on but johnnys gaze did not shift its grandad he cried suddenly and started running bob smallpiece sprang after him and in twenty paces they were running abreast as they neared the old man they could hear him talking rapidly in a monotonous highpitched voice he was hatless and though they called he took no heed but stumbled on as one seeing and hearing nothing till as the keeper reached to seize his arm he trod in a gulley and fell forward the shock interrupted his talk and he breathed heavily staring still before him as he regained his uncertain foothold and reeled a step farther then bob smallpiece grasped him above the elbow and shouted his name whats the matter grandad johnny demanded ill the old man glared fixedly and made as though to resume his course why whats this said bob smallpiece retaining the arm and lifting a hand gently to the old mans hair it was blood dotted and trickling lord hes had a bad wipe over the head said bob and with that lifted old may in his arms as a nurse lifts a child theydons nearest run johnny boyrun like blazes an fetch the doctor tantivy take him into the dun cow nohomes best an save shiftin him twice run it purple emperors an small coppers began the old man again in his shrill chatter small coppers an marsh ringlets everywhere and my bag full o letters at the beginning of the round but i finished my round and now theyre all gone all gone because o london comin an i give in my empty bag and so he tailed off into indistinguishable gabble while bob smallpiece carried him into the wood to johnny scudding madly toward theydon it imparted a grotesque horror as of some absurd nightmare this babybabble of his whitehaired grandfather carried babyfashion he blinked as he ran and felt his head for his cap half believing that he ran in a dream in very truth v mrs may still stood at the cottage door and the keeper warned by the light called from a little distance here we are mrs may he said as cheerfully as might be hes all rightjust had a little accident thats all so im carryin him dont be frightened get a little wateri think hes got a bit of a cut on the head but its nothing to fluster about and so assuring and protesting bob brought the old man in the woman saw the staring grey face and the blood ooomy god she quavered stricken sick and pale heshes no no no no keep steady and help shift the table an ill put him down on the rug she mastered herself and said no more the old man whose babble had sunk to an indistinct mutter was no sooner laid on the floor than he made a vague effort to rise as though to continue on his way but he was feebler than before and bob smallpiece pressed him gently back upon the newmended coat doubled to make a pillow nan may tense and white curbed her agitation ministering and suffering in silence years before a man had been carried home to her thus but then all was over and after the first numbness grief could take its vent once she asked bob smallpiece in a whisper how it had happened he told how little he knew and save for passing the words to bessy wakened by unwonted sounds mrs may said nothing bessy in her nightgown sat on the stairs hugging her crutch and sobbing with what quietness she could compel of herself there was a little brandy in a quartern bottle and the keeper thought it well to force the spirit between the old mans teeth while mrs may bathed the head and washed away the clotted blood as they did so the wheels of the doctors dogcart were heard in the lane and soon the doctor came in at the door pulling off his gloves johnny stood pale helpless and still almost breathless behind the group while the doctor knelt at his grandfathers side there was a contused wound at the top of the head the doctor could see a little back not serious but blood still dripped from the ears and the doctor shook his head fracture of the base he said as to himself reviving a little because of the brandy and the bathing the old man once more made a motion as if to rise his eyes grew brighter though fixed still and his voice rose distinctly as ever took the bag in yes londons comin fast londons comin an afrightenin out the butterflies londons adrivin the butterflies out o my round out o my round an butterflies cant live near it londons out o my round an ive done my round an now ill give in the empty bag take the bag an look for the pension thats the vantage o the posoffice john some gets pensions but some don but the butterfliesll last my time i hope an haskins he kep bees but im hopin to finish my roun and so on and so on till the voice fell again and the muttering was fainter than before bob smallpiece stood awkwardly by unwilling to remain a useless intruder but just as reluctant to desert friends in trouble presently he bethought himself that work was still to do in inquiry how the old mans hurt had befallen whether by accident or attack perhaps indeed to inform the police and that in good time so he asked turning his hat about in his hands if there was anything else he could do nothing more smallpiece thanks the doctor said with an unmistakable lift of the brows and a glance at the door god bless you for helpin us mr smallpiece mrs may said as she let him out ill let you know how he is in the mornin if you cant call and when the door was shut go to bed johnny my boy and take a rest but johnny went no farther than the stairs and sat there with his sister the old mans muttering ceased wholly and he breathed heavily stertorously the doctor rose to his feet and turned to mrs may wont you tell me sir she said is itis it it is very serious the doctor said gravely and added with impressive slowness very serious indeed the woman took a grip of the table and caught three quick breaths you must keep yourself calm and you must bear up you must prepare yourselfin case of something very bad indeed twice she tried to speak but was mute and then no hope she said more to sight than to hearing he put his hand kindly on her shoulder it would be wrong of me to encourage it he said as for what i can do it is all over but you must bear up he went on firmly as guided to a chair she bent forward and covered her face drink this he took a small bottle from his bag poured something into a cup and added water drink itdrink it up all of it i must go youve your children to think of remember come to your mother my boy he was gone and the children stood with their arms about their mother the old mans breathing which had grown heavier and louder still presently eased again and his eyes closed drowsily at this the woman looked up with an impossible hope in her heart truly the breath was soft and natural and the drawn lines had gone from the face he must be sleeping why had she not thought to ask bob smallpiece to carry him up to bed and why had the doctor not ordered it softly she turned the wet cloth that lay over the wound the breath grew lighter and still lighter and more peaceful the face till one might almost trace a smile quieter and quieter and still more peaceful till all was peace indeed vi bob smallpiece and a policeinspector busied themselves that night at wormleyton pits the pits were none of them deepsix feet at most at the bottom of the deepest they found old mays lantern with the glass broken and the candle overrun and extinguished and the gravel was spotted with marks which in the clearer light of the morning were seen to be marks of blood it was useless to look for footprints the ground was dry and except in the pits themselves it was covered with heather whereon no such traces were possible and this was all the police had to say at the inquest whereat the jury gave a verdict of accidental death for the old man had died as was medically certified after postmortem examination of brainlaceration produced by fracture of the base of the skull and the fracture was caused by percussion from a blow on the upper part of the heada blow probably suffered by falling backward into the pit and striking the head against a large stone embedded at the bottom everything suggested such an explanation above the steepest wall of the pit over which the fall must have chanced a narrow ledge of ground ran between the brink and a close clump of bramble and bush and this ledge was grown thick with tough heather as apt almost as a tangle of wire to catch the foot and cause a stumble it was plain that stooping to his occupation on this ledge and perhaps forgetting his situation in the interest of his search he had fallen backward into the pit with the lantern he had probably lain there insensible for some while and then developing a crazed halfconsciousness he had crawled out by the easy slope at the farther end and staggered off whithersoever his disjointed faculties might carry him nobody had seen him but his grandson and the keeper so that the verdict was a matter of course and the dismal inquiry was soon done with and indeed the jury knew all there was to know unless it were a trivial matter of some professional interest to bob smallpiece about which the police preferred to have nothing said since it could not help the jury though it might chance later to be of some use to themselves it was simply the fact that several very fresh pegholes were observed about the pits hinting a tearing away of rabbitsnares with no care to hide the marks the days were bad dreams to johnny he found himself continually repeating in his mind that grandad was dead grandad was dead as though he were forcing himself to learn a lesson that persistently slipped his memory well enough he knew it and it puzzled him that he should find it so hard to believe and mostly so easy a grief as he woke in the morning the thought struck down his spirits and then with an instant revulsion he doubted it was but the aftertaste of a dream but there lay the empty half of the bed they were wont to share and the lesson began again he went about the house here was a sheet of grandads list of trades pinned to the wall there the unfinished case of moths for which the customer was waiting these and the shelves and the breedingboxesall were as parts of the old man impossible to consider apart from his active whiteheaded figure in some odd hopeless way they seemed to suggest that it was all right and that grandad was simply in the garden or upstairs or in the backhouse and presently would come in as usual and put them all to their daily uses and it was only by dint of stern concentration of thought that johnny forced on himself the assurance that the old man would come among his cases no more nor ever again discuss with him the list of london trades then the full conviction struck him sorely like a blow behind the neck the heavy stroke of bereavement and the sick fear of the world for his mother and sister together but therehe was merely torturing himself he took refuge in a curious callousness that he could call back very easily when he would so the days went but with each new day the intermissions of full realisation grew longer till plain grief persisted in a leaden ache rarely broken by a spell of apathy his mother and his sister went about household duties silently not often apart they were comforted in companionship it seemed but solitude brought tears and heartbreak nan mays london upbringing caused her some thought of what her acquaintances there would have called a proper funeral but here the machinery of such funerals must be brought from a distance thus becoming doubly expensive and this being the case cottagers made very little emulation at such times and a walking funeralperhaps at best a cab from the rank at loughton stationsatisfied most moreover the old man himself had many a time preached strong disapproval of money wasted on funerals had indeed prophesied that if any costliness were wasted on him he would rise from his coffin and kick a mute so now that the time had come a theydon carpenter made the coffin and a cab from loughton was the whole show the old mans relations were not and of nan mays most still alive were forgotten for in the forest cottage the little family had been secluded from such connections as by sundering seas at first they had seemed too near for correspondence and then they had been found too far for visiting uncle isaac came to the funeral however and though in the beginning he seemed prepared for solemn declamation something in the sober grief at the cottage made him unwontedly quiet it was a short coffin accommodated under the cabmans seat with no great protrusion at the ends what there was being covered decently with a black cloth and the cab held the mourners easily johnny and bessy in their sunday clothes their mother in hers they had always been black since she was first a widow and uncle isaac in a creasy suit of lustrous black oddly bunched and wrinkled at the seams the conventional sunday suit of his generation of artisans folded carefully and long preserved and designed to be available alike for church and for such funerals as might come to pass a brisk wind stirred the trees and flung showers of fallen leaves after the shabby old fourwheeler as it climbed the lanes that led up to the little churchyard where the sexton and his odd man waited with planks and ropes by the newdug grave it was a bright afternoon but a fresh chill in the wind hinted the coming of winter a belated red admiral seemed to chase the cab fluttering this way or that now by one window now by the other and again away over the hedgetop nothing was said now and again johnny took his eyes from the open window to look at his companions his mother opposite sat pale and worn with her hands in her lap and gazed blankly over his head at the front window of the cab she was commonly a woman of healthy skin and colour but now the skin seemed coarser and there was no colour but the pink about her red eyelids uncle isaac next her sat forward and rubbed his chin over and round the knob of his walking stick a bamboo topped with a turks head of tarred cord as for bessy sitting at the far end of his own seat johnny saw nothing of her face for her handkerchief and the crutchhandle but she was very quiet and he scarcely thought she was crying for himself he was sad enough in a heavy way but in no danger of tears and he turned again and looked out of the window at last the cab stopped at the lych gate here bob smallpiece unexpectedly appeared to lend a hand with the coffin so that with the sexton and the carpenter who was the undertaker uncle isaac and the keeper the cabmans help was not wanted the cabman lingered a moment to shift cloths and aprons and to throw a glance or two after the little company as it followed the clergyman and then he hastened to climb to his seat and drive after a young couple that he spied walking in the main road for they were strangers and looked a likely fare back to the station johnny found church much as it was on sunday except that today they sat near the front and that he was conscious of a faint sense of family importance by reason of the special service and the coffin so conspicuously displayed a few neighbourswomen mostlywere there too and when the coffin was carried out to the grave they grouped themselves a little way off in the background with bob smallpiece farther back still from the graves edge one looked down over the countryside green and hilly and marked out in meadows by rows of elms with hedges at foot the wind came up briskly and set the dead leaves going again and again chasing them among the tombs and casting them into the new red grave bessy was quiet no longer but sobbed aloud and nan may took no more care to dry her eyes johnny made an effort that brought him near to choking and then another and then he fixed his attention on the cows in a meadow below counted them with brimming eyes and named them for he knew them well as accurately as the distance would let him he would scarce trust himself to take a last look with the others at the coffin below and its bright tin plate but fell straightway to watching a man mending thatch on a barn and wondering that he wore neither coat nor waistcoat in such a fresh wind and so except for a stray tear or two which nobody saw overflow from the brimming eyes he faced it out and walked away with the others under the curious gaze of the neighbours who lined up by the path and smallpiece went off in the opposite direction with the carpenter who carried back the pall folded over his arm like a cloak the four mourners walked back by the lanes in silence uncle isaac bore the restraint with difficulty and glanced uneasily at nan mays face from time to time as though he were watching an opportunity to expound his sentiments at length but johnny saw nothing of this for affliction was upon him now that grandad was passed away indeedwas buried and the clods were rising quickly over himnow that even the coffin was gone from the cottage and would never be seen againit seemed that he had never understood before and he awoke to the full bitterness of things more his effort at restraint was spent and in the revulsion he found he could hold in no longer he peeped into the thickets by the laneside as he went questing for an excuse to drop behind seeing no other he stooped and feigned to tie his bootlace calling in a voice that quavered absurdly in trying to seem indifferent go on mother im comin presently he dashed among the bushes flung himself on the grass and burst into a blind fury of tears writhing as though under a shower of stinging blows he had meant to cry quietly but all was past control and any might hear that chanced by he scarce knew whether the fit had endured for seconds minutes or hours when he was aware of his mother sitting beside him and pressing his bursting head to her breast bessy was there too and his mothers arms were round both alike with that he grew quieter and quieter still we mustnt break down johnny boytheres hard struggles before us his mother said smoothing back his hair an you must be very good to me johnny youre the man now he kissed her and brushed the last of his tears away yes mother i will he said he rose calmer awake to new responsibilities and felt a man indeed nothing remained of his outbreak but a chancecoming shudder in the breath and as he helped bessy to her feet he saw five yards off among the bushes uncle isaac under his very tall hat gazing blankly at the group and gently rubbing the turks head on his stick among the loose grey whiskers that bordered his large face vii nan may rose another woman in the morning for there was work before her the children marvelled to see her so calm and so busy so full of thought for the business in hand so little occupied with sorrowful remembrance the old man prudent ever had arranged years since for what had now befallen there was a simple little will on a sheet of notepaper there was a great and complicated list on odd scraps of paper thickly beset with additions alterations and crossingsout of the specimens hoarded in the cottage with pencil notes of values each revised a dozen times as the market changed there was a postoffice savings bank deposit book with entries amounting to eight pounds ten and a nomination form whereby nan may might withdraw the money there was no lifeinsurance for the old man had surrendered it years ago to secure the few pounds he needed to make up the full price of the cottage the will gave nan may all there might be to take and left her to execute uncle isaac on the return to the cottage the day before had at length broken into speech and by devious approaches cunningly disguised and ostentatiously casual had reached the will but he got little by his motion for though his niece told him the wills purport she protested that till tomorrow she should do nothing with it nor did she even offer to produce it of course he had scarcely expected a legacy himself but still he was uncle isaac profound in experience learned in the law and an oracle in the family it seemed to say the least a little scandalous that he should not have had the handling of this property the selling the control the doling out with such consideration the exertion might earn and the accidents of arithmetic detach its an important thing is a will said uncle isaac sagely a thing as ought to be seen to by a experienced person you might jist look an see ow its wrote if anys wrote in pencil its nullavoid no replied mrs may without moving its all in ink then after a long pause lawyers comes very expensive with wills uncle isaac observed they come expensive alwis an mostly they rob the property accordin to form o lawr its best to get a man of experience as you can trust to go straight to somerset ouse in form o porpus its the cheapest way an safe e takes the will jist as it might be me an e goes to the thorities an e talks to em knowin an confidential ere i am ses e as it might be me on bealf o the last will an oly testament as it might be o mr may an ive come in form o porpus avin objections to lawyers in form o porpus uncle isaac repeated impressively tapping a forefinger on the table as was his way of blazoning an erudite phrase that else might pass unregarded poor grandad told me what to do about goin to somerset house an all that answered nan may in case anything happened but id take it very kind if youd come with me uncle isaac me not understandin such things but i cant think about it today and with so much of his finger in the pie uncle isaac was fain to be content and soon he left declining to stay for the nightto johnnys great reliefbecause his cheap returnticket was available for the day and no more and now johnny having brought sheets of foolscap paper from loughton was set to work to make a fair copy of the amazing list of specimens a work at great length accomplished in an unstable round hand but on the whole with not so many blots and nan mays series of visits to somerset house was begun saddening her with a cost of one and ninepence each visit for fares in train and omnibus the first indeed cost more for uncle isaacs fare from millwall was also to be paid but he came no more for in truth his failure as a man of business was instant and ignoble to begin with the shadow of the awful building fell on him as he neared it extinguishing his confidence and stopping his tongue in the quadrangle the very tall hat distinguished an uncle isaac of hushed speech and meek docility and along the corridors it followed nan may deferentially in unresting pursuit of room no the room was reached at last and here uncle isaac found himself constrained to open the business for nan may herself held back now and the young man in goldrimmed glasses fixed him with his eye so taking off his hat with both hands uncle isaac in a humble murmur beganwevegood mornin sirweve come as it might be in form o porpus what as regards to a will uncle isaac explained desperately dropping his technicality like a hot rivet as regards to a will an dyin testament which the late deceased diddid write out very well are you the executor well sir not as it might be executor no but as uncle to mr mays daughterinlaw by marriage are you the gentleman turned abruptly to nan may who gave him the will whereupon uncle isaac in a hopeful way of recovering nerve and eloquence was thrust out of the business and told that nan may alone would be dealt with and he retired once more into shadow with a little relief to leaven a great deal of injured dignity so that for the rest nan may relied on herself alone and hardened her face to the world when the specimens came to be sold a smart young man came from the london firm of naturalists to make an offer he examined the trays and cases as hastily and carelessly as was consistent with a privily sharp eye to all they held and with the air of contempt proper for a professional buyer for in such a matter of business the widow and the orphan needing money are the weak party humble and timid watching small signs with sinking hearts and easy to beat and a man of business worth the name of one takes advantage of the fact for every penny it will bring so the smart young man looking more contemptuous than ever and dusting his fingers with his pockethandkerchief flung nan may an offer of five pounds for the lot no thankyou sir the woman answered with simple decision im sorry youve had the trouble goodmorning which was not the reply the young man had looked for and indeed not a reply easy of rejoinder so he was constrained to some unbending of manner and a hint that his firm might increase the offer if she would name a sum and the whole thing ended with a letter carrying a cheque for forty pounds which was very handsome indeed for the young mans firm would scarce have paid more than eighty pounds for the collection in the ordinary way of trade and so the old mans little affairs were gathered up and the inland revenue took its bite out of the estate and there were no more journeys to somerset house but nobody would buy the cottage viii just such a day as johnnys london memories always brought cold and dry and brisk found him perched on the cart that was to take him to london again besides himself the cart held his mother and his sister and the household furniture from the cottage while banks the carrier sat on the shaft bessy was made comfortable in the armchair her mother sat on a bundle of bedding whence it was convenient to descend when steep hills were encountered and johnny sat on the tailboard and jumped off and on as the humour took him all through long loughton village there was something of a triumphal progress for people knew them and turned to look bessy alone remained in the cart for the long pull up buckhurst hill while johnny tramping beside and making many excursions into the thicket flung up into her lap sprigs of holly with berries already they had plenty packed close in a box but it is better to have too much than too little so any promising head was added to the store for it was december and christmas would come in three weeks or so and ere that nan may was to open shop in london it was to be a chandlers shop with aspirations toward grocery and butter chandlery grocery and butter being things of the buying and selling whereof nan may knew as little as anybody in the world beyond the usual retail prices at the forest villages but something must be done and everything has a beginning somewhere so nan may resolutely set face to the work to play the world with all the rigour of the game and her figure as she tramped sturdily up the hill beside the cart was visible symbol of her courage always a healthy clearskinned almost a handsome woman active and shapely she walked the hill with something of steadfast fierceness as one joying in trampling an obstacle her eyes fixed before her and taking no heed of the view that opened to bessys gaze as she looked back from under the tilt of the cart but busy with thought of the fight she was beginning a little fearful but by so much the gamer meanwhile it was a good piece of business to decorate a shop with holly at christmas and here johnny found holly ready for the work it would cost money in london the cart crowned the hilltop and still nan may regarded not the show that lay behind whereof bessy took her fill for the moments still left there loughton tumbled about its green hills beset with dusky trees like a spilt boxful of toys with the sadcoloured forest making the horizon line behind it away to the left seen between the boughs of the near pines high beach steeple lifted from the velvety edge and as far to the right on its own hill rose the square church tower that stood by grandads grave and where the bold curve of staples hill lost itself among the woods some tall brown trees uprose above the rest and gave goodbye for invisible beyond them lay the empty cottage in its patch of garden grown dank and waste then roadside trees shut all out and the cart stopped on the level to take up nan may and now the old mare jogged faster along to woodford wells and through the green fringed with a wonder of big houses and many broad miles of country seen between them then farther down the easy slope of rising sun road with thick woods at the ways edge on each side their winter austerity softened by the sunlight among the brown twigs and so on and on till they emerged in bushy leyton flats and turned off for leytonstone and now they were nearing london indeed once past the green man they were on a tramlined road and there were shops and houses with scarce a break where there was one bricklayers on scaffoldings were building shopfronts the new shops had a raw disagreeable look and some of these a little older were just old enough to be dirty without being a whit less disagreeable and raw some were prosperous brilliant with gilt and plateglass others which had started even with them stood confessed failures poor and mean with a pathetic airalmost an expressionof disappointment in every window older buildingssome very oldstood about harrow green but already the wreckers had begun to pull a cottage down to make room for something else and then the new shops began again and lined the road without a check till they were new no longer but of the uncertain age of commonplace london brick and mortar and maryland point railway station was passed and it was town indeed with clatter and smoke and mud stratford broadway lay wide and busy wth the church and the townhall imposing and large but soon the road narrowed and grew fouler and the mouths of unclean alleys dribbled slush and dirty children across the pavement then there were factories and the road passed over narrow canals of curiously iridescent sludge too thick to the casual eye for the passage of any craft but interesting to the casual nose and there was a great low misty waste of the dullest possible rubbish where grass would not grow a more hopelessly desolate and dispiriting wilderness than johnny had ever dreamed of or bessy ever read with a chemical manureworks in a far corner having a smell of great volume and range they topped bow bridge and turned sharply to the left now it was london itself london by act of parliament there was a narrow way with a few wharf gates and then an open space with houses centuries old fallen on leaner years but still grubbily picturesque hence the old mare trotted through a long and winding street that led by dirty entries by shops by big distilleries by clean dull houses where managers lived by wooden inns swinging ancient signs over canal bridges to a place of many streets lying regularly at right angles all of small houses all clean every one a counterpart of every other and thenthe docks and the ships at least the great dockgates with the giant pepperbox and the clock above them and the high walls with here and there a mast and at intervals as the houses permitted the high walls and the masts were visible again and again in the short way yet to go pass blackwall cross till at last the cart stopped before a little shutup shop badly in want of paint in a street where one gained the housedoors down areas maybe or up steps or on the level from a pavement a little more than two feet wide while the doors themselves and the wooden rails that guarded all the steps were painted in divers unaccustomed and original colours and had nothing in common but a subtle flavour of ships stores over the way was the wall of a shipyard and wheresoever there might be a view of houses from the back there were small flagstaffs rigged as masts with gaffs complete the door of the little shop opened after a short struggle with the rusty lock and nan may and her children were at home in london ix the shop in harbour lane had been a greengrocers a barbers a friedfishmongers and a tripesellers but chiefly it had been shut up as it was now nobody had ever come into it with much money it is true but all had gone out of it with less than they brought it was said indeed that the greengrocer had gone out with nothing but the clothes he wore but as he went no farther than the end of the street where he drowned himself from a swing bridge he needed no more nor even so much mr dunkin the landlord had bought the place at a low price as was his way in buying things but he got very little out of his investment which was not his way at all it was a novelty that surprised and irritated mr dunkin he was a substantial tradesman who had long relinquished counter work for there were a dozen assistants in the two departments of his chief shop eight for grocery and butter and four for oil and saucepans paint and mousetraps and there were half a dozen branches some in the one trade and some in the other scattered about in as many neighbouring parishes he was a large man of vast sympathy the tone of his voice the grasp of his wide pulpy hand told of infinite tenderness toward the sorrows and sins of the world even in the early days when he had but one shop a little one and no shopman he would weigh out a pound of treacle with so melting a benignity that the treacle seemed balm of gilead and a bounteous gift at the price he would drive a bargain in a voice of yearning beneficence that left the other party ashamed of his own selfseeking as well as something the poorer by the deal it was a voice wherein a purr had a large parta purr that was hoarse yet soothing and eloquent of compassion so that no man was so happy but a talk with mr dunkin would persuade him that the lot was hard indeed that entitled him to such a wealth of sympathy it was a wealth that mr dunkin squandered with no restraint but this that it carried no other sort of wealth with it on the whole nan may had counted herself fortunate in falling in with mr dunkin for when in his fatherly solicitude he discovered that she had a little money in hand he undertook to supply her with stock and to give her certain hints in the mystery of chandlery he also felt no cause for complaint for he had hoped for a tenant merely and here was tenant and customer in one more she was a widow knowing nothing of trade so that it might be possible to sell her what others would not buy at a little extra profit as to rent moreover he was doing well for on the day the deposit was paid mrs may had found little choice among vacant shops and this was in a situation to suit her plans as to johnny and his trade and as she was tired and nervous full of plain anxiety sympathetic mr dunkin saw his chance of trying for an extra shilling a week and got it and nan may was left to pay for what painting and cleaning the place might need it needed a good deal as mr dunkin had ruefully observed two days before in expectation of a decorators bill if ever a tenant came and now nan may addressed herself to the work first the house must be cleaned the paint could be considered after she had swept one room into a habitable state on her last day in town and here her little store of furniture was stacked then her sleeves and her skirt turned back and a duster over her head she assailed walls and ceilings with a broom and after these the floors so far johnny helped but when scrubbing began he hindered so it was that for a day or so until it was time for him to help with the windows he had leisure wherein to make himself acquainted with the neighbourhood it was a neighbourhood with a flavour distinct from that of the districts about it there the flat rows of sixroomed cottages characterless all stretched everywhere rank behind rank in masses unbroken except by the busier thoroughfares of shops here each little house asserted its individuality by diversity of paint as much as by diversity of shape it was indeed the last stronghold of the shipwrights and mastmakers fallen from their high estate since the invasion of iron ships and northern competition in fact shipwrights row was the name of a short rank of cottages close by with gardens in front each with its mast and flag complete in other places where the backyards were very small the flagstaff and stays were apt to take to their use the whole space the pole rising from the exact centre and a stay taking its purchase from each extreme corner so that anybody essaying a circuit must perform it with many sudden obeisances the little streets had an air of cleanliness all their own largely due to the fresh paint that embellished whatsoever there was an excuse for painting many frontdoors were reached by two stone steps always well whitened and whether there were steps or not the flagstones before each threshold were distinguished by a whited semicircle five feet in diameter noting this curious fact as he tramped along one such street johnny was startled by an angry voice close at his elbow a voice so very sudden and irate that he jumped aside ere he looked for the source a redfaced woman knelt within a door idle young faggit she said stompin yer muddy boots all over my clean step and she made so vigorous a grasp at a broom that johnny went five yards at a gallop now truly there was no step of any sort to the house and johnny had but crossed the semicircle because he conceived the footpath to be public property and because it was narrow but he learnt afterwards that the semicircle was a sacred institution of the place in as high regard among the women as its fellowfetish the flagstaff was among the men also that none but grown peopleand those of low habits or in drinkdared trespass on it and that it was always called the step he learnt much too in the matter of paint every male inhabitant of harbour lane shipwrights row and the neighbouring streets carried in his leisure moments a pipe a pot of paint and a brush he puffed comfortably at the pipe and stumped about his back or front garden with the paintpot in one hand and the brush in the other touchingup whatever paint would stick to rails posts waterbutts dustbins clothesposts all were treated not because they needed it for they were scarce dry from the last coat but because there was the paint and there was the brush and there was the leisure and this was the only way to use all three so that most things about the gardens took an interesting variety of tints in the run of the year since it was rarely the case that the same colour was used twice in succession when all wooden surfaces were covered it was customary to take a turn at windowsills rainwater pipes and the stones or oystershells that bordered the little flowerbeds and when nothing else was left then the paintpot and the brush and the pipe were conveyed to the front and the frontdoor which had been green became royal blue or flaming salmon as did the railings if there were any and the windowframes two things alone were not subject to such changes of complexion the flagstaff and the brick pavings for it was a law immutable that the flagstaffs should be speckless white and the bricks a cheerful vermilion this last a colour frequently renewed because of nailed boots but done in good oil paint because of wet weather everything else took the range of the rainbow and something beyond so that it was possible in those houses where two families lived to tell at a glance whether the upstairs family were on terms of intimacy or merely of distant civility with the downstairs by the colours uniform or diverse of the sills and the model fences that guarded the flowerpots on them for the token and sign of friendship in harbour lane was the loan or the exchange of paint it was the proper method of breaking the ice between new acquaintances and was recognised as such by general sanction the greeting bit o blue paint any use to ye and the offer of the pot across the back fence were the harbour lane equivalents of a call and cards and the newcomer made early haste with an offer of yellow or green paint in return indeed it was in this way that the paint arrived which afterwards made nan mays little shop a bedazzlement to the wayfarer and furnished johnny with the first painting job he ever grew tired of but newcomers were rare in the neighbourhood for it was a colony apart with independent manners and habits of thought true it had its own divisions and differences as for instance on the question whether or not the association of the paintpot and brush with the sunday paper were sinful but these divisions were purely internal and nothing was heard of them beyond the boundaries but paint was something more than a recreation and an instrument of social amenity it furnished the colony with an equivalent of high finance wherein all the operations proper to money and credit as spelt with capital initials were reflected in paint for it was a permanent condition of life in harbour lane and thereabouts that everybody owed everybody else some amount of paint and was owed paint in his turn by others so that a complicated system of exchange prevailed in which verbal bills and cheques were drawn as thus to make a simple case ullo bill what about that pot o paint well i was goin to bring it round tonight all right but dont bring it to metake it to george ye see i owe jim a bit o paint an e owes joe a bit an joe owes george a bit so thatll make it right all round dont forget with many such arrangements synchronising crossing and mixing with each other and made intricate by differing degrees and manners of debit and credit between bill and george and jim and joe the unlikely subject of paint became involved in a mathematical web of exceeding interest a small image of the money market a sort of chaos by double entry wherein few operators were able to strike a balance at a moment and most were vaguely uncertain whether their accounts inclined toward an affluence of paint or toward sheer bankruptcy an exciting result attained without the aid of capital and with no serious hurt to anybody but these were things that johnny learned in the succeeding weeks in his walks while his mother scrubbed floors at home he observed one or two matters as to costume he perceived that the men wore blue dungaree jackets with large bone buttons and outside these now that it was winter short pilot coats of dark blue stuff thick and stiff like a board the trousers were moleskins perhaps once white all stained with very shiny black patches and all of one cut which placed the seat very baggy a few inches above the bend of the knee and there was a peaked cap of the same shiny black all over that distinguished parts of the trousers he also saw that whereas yesterday the backyards were brisk with fluttering linen today they held scarce any for yesterday was monday and it was matter of pride among the energetic housewives of the place to get washing done at the beginning of the week for a woman fell in her neighbours respect the later in the week her washing day came so johnny explored the streets with wide eyes and a full heart for here was london where they made great thingsships and engines there were places he fancied he recognisedgreat blank walls with masts behind them but now the masts seemed fewer and shorter than in the old days as in truth they were for now more of the ships were steamships filling greater space for half the show of mast then in other places he came on basins filled with none but sailingships and here the masts were as tall and fine as ever stayed with much cordage and had their yards slung at a gallant slope like the sword on sir walter raleighs hip and at blackwall stairs looking across the river stood an old old house that johnny stared at for minutes together a month or two later he heard the tradition that sir walter raleigh himself had lived there it was first of a row of old waterside buildings the newest of which had looked across and almost fallen into the river when king georges ships had anchored off blackwalland king charless for that matter there too stood the artichoke tavern clean and white and wooden a heap of gables and windows all out of perpendicular a house widest and biggest everywhere at the top and smallest at the ground floor a house that seemed ready to topple into the river at a push so far did its walls and galleries overhang the water and so slender were the piles that supported them here in the square space on the quay brown men in blue jerseys sold bloaters by the score stringing them through the gills with tarry yarn and half the brown men wore earrings below on the foreshore lay many boats and children ran among them or raked for rivermussels among the stones in another place he came on just such marketstreets as he remembered to have trotted along at his mothers side in the old london life though now indeed they seemed something dirtier and meaner and the people seemed less cheerful but this was a place away from harbour lanea neighbourhood of dull and dingy rows of little houses range on range and still farther he found another street of shops or rather half a street for one side was a blank wall but no great skeleton ship lifted its ribs above the bricks and no hammers clanged behind them for it was a shipyard abandoned and a painted board thick with grime offered the place for sale or hire some of the shops opposite were abandoned too and the others were poor and dull johnny walked a few steps backward looking at the shops and when he turned about at a corner he almost scorched himself at a coke fire where chestnuts were roasting and there behind the fire stood the pockmarked man himself not a whit altered there he stood with his hands deep in his pockets and tapped the kerb with his clogged boots just as he had stood when the great ship was making and the lights flared round it and the shops were all open and busy perhaps the pitted face was a trifle paler but that was all but harbour lane and thereabout were the most interesting parts and the pleasantest for johnny just beyond the stairs and the old houses and the artichoke tavern was a dockinlet with an extraordinary bridge that halved in the middle and swung back to each of two quays to let ships through men worked it quite easily with a winch and johnny could have watched for an hour but just here he caught sight of an acquaintance for down on the quay below the bridgeend sitting on a mooringpost was mr butson a trifle seedy and fallen in condition johnny fancied and grumly illused as ever as johnny looked mr butson took a pipe from his pocket and a screw of paper the paper yielded nothing mr butson raked through both jacketpockets and scowled at his empty hands in the end after a gloomy inspection of the pipe he put it away and returned to savage meditation and johnny went home x it was at maidment and hursts engineers that johnnys father had met his death and it was to maidment and hurst that nan had resolved to take the boy and beg an apprenticeship for him true the firm had at the time done more than might have been expected of it for the accident had been largely a matter of heedlessness on the victims part and the victim was no old hand but had taken his job only a few months before it had seen that nothing was lacking for the widows immediate needs nor for a decent funeral and it had offered to find places in an orphanage for the children but nan may could not bring herself to part with them bessie indeed was barely out of the hospital at the time and then the lonely old butterflyhunter had cut matters short by carrying them off all three so that now if johnny were to learn a trade maidment and hursts was his best chance for it was just possible that the firm would take him apprentice without premium when it was reminded of his father in this thing nan may wasted no time the house once clean within and something done toward stocking the shop johnny was made ready in the best of his clothes for inspection it was a muddy morning and mrs may had fears for the polish on johnnys boots gladly would she have carried him across the miry streets as she had done in the london of years ago though she knew better than to hint at such an outrage on his dignity so they walked warily dodging puddles with mutual warnings and fleeing the splashes of passing vans truly london was changed even more in nan mays eyes than in johnnys the people seemed greyer more anxious worse fed than when she lived among them before a young wife in a smiling world with the best part of thirtyeight shillings to spend every week the shops were worse stocked and many that she remembered well were shut true some flourished signs of prosperity but to her it seemed prosperity of a different and a paltrier sortvulgar and trumpery once out of the harbour lane district the little houses lacked the snug geraniumdecked wireblinded repcurtained comfort of aspect she remembered so wellthe air that suggested a red fire within a shining copper kettle a high fender and muffins on a trivet things were cheap and cold and grubby above all the silent shipyards oppressed her fancies truly this looked an ill place for new trade in her hunt for the vacant shop she had encountered no old friends and now though she walked through familiar streets she had little but fancied recognition now and again of some face at a shop door presently they turned a corner and came upon a joyful crowd of boys they ran they yelled they flung and in their midst cursed and floundered a rusty rag of a woman drunk and infuriate harried battered and bedeviled her clothes were of decent black but dusty and neglected and one side of her skirt dripped with fresh mud her hair was draggled about her shoulders and her bonnet hung in it a bunch of mangled crape while she staggered hither and thither making futile swipes at the nimble rascals about her she struck out feebly with a little parcel of baconrashers rolled in a paper and already a rasher had escaped to be flung at her head and flung again by the hand that could first snatch it from the gutter yah old mother borndrunk shouted the young savages and two swooped again with the stretched skippingrope that had already tripped their victim twice but she clasped a post with both arms and cursed at large hoarse and impotent nan may started and stood and then hurried on for she had recognised a face at last grimed and bloated though it had grown law she said its emma pacey to thinkto think of it indeed the shock was great and the change amazing it was a change that would have baffled recognition by an eye that had less closely noted the emma pacey of seventeen years ago but emma pacey was a smart girl then though fast and forward nan may had always said and had caused some little disturbance in a course of true love which led nevertheless to nans wedding after all in such circumstances a woman views her rivals face as she views her clothes with a searching eye and remembers well and to come to that mused nan may perplexed at a shade of emotion that seemed illturned to the occasion wherein the simple soul saw nothing of womanish triumph but the changes seemed not all for the worse there were busy factories and some that had been small were now large coffeestalls too were set up in two or three places where no such accommodation was in the old time always a sign of increasing trade but on the whole the walk did nothing to raise nans spirits johnny saw little the excursion was to decide whether he should learn to make steamengines or not though what manner of adventure he was to encounter he figured but vaguely he was to come into presence of some gentlemen presumablygentlemen who would settle his whole destiny offhand on a cursory examination of his appearance and manner he must be alert to show his best behaviour though what things the gentlemen might do or say and what unforeseen problems of conduct might present themselves were past guessing though he guessed and guessed oblivious of present circumstance only once before had he felt quite that quality of trepidation and that was three years back when he trudged along the road to woodford to get a tooth drawn but he came off very well though the preliminaries were solemnrather more portentous he thought than anything in the dentists waitingroom there was a sort of counter with bright brass rails and a groundglass box with an officeboy inside it the unprecedented and unbusinesslike apparition of mrs may with a timid request to see mr maidment or mr hurst one was dead and the other never came near the place wholly demoralised the officeboy who retired upon his supports in the depths of the office thence there presently emerged a junior clerk who after certain questions undertook to see if the acting partner were in then came a time of stealthy and distrustful inspection on the part of the officeboy who having regained his box and gathered up his wits began to suspect johnny of designs on his situation but at last johnny and his mother were shown into an inner room furnished with expensive austerity where a gentleman of thirty or thirtyfive himself expensively austere of mien sat at a writingtable the gentleman asked mrs may one or two rather abrupt questions about her dead husbanddates and so forthand referred to certain notes on his table after each answer then nan offered him one of three papers which she had been fiddling in her hand since first she passed the street doorher marriage lines o ah yesyesof course said the gentleman with some change of manner of course quite right best to make surecant remember everybody sit down mrs may come here my boy so you want to be an engineer eh yes sir if you please he never thought it would be quite so hard to get it out ah plenty of hard work you know not afraid of that are you no sir how old are you fifteen next month sir get on all right at school what standard passed seventh sir mrs may handed over her other two papers a character from the schoolmaster and another from the rector when the gentleman had read them yes yes very goodvery good indeed he said but youve not finished learning yet you know my boy if youre to be an engineer fond of drawing yes sir and nan may chimed in o yes sir very fond well if you stick well at your drawing in the evenings and learn the theory youll be a foreman some dayperhaps a manager it all depends on yourself you shall have a chance to show us what youre made of thats all we can dothe rest is for yourself as ive said yes sir thankyou sirill try and mrs may was audibly thankful too and confident of johnny very well its settled the gentleman rang a bell and bade the junior clerk just send for cottam i have sent for the foreman he went on whose shop you will be in hell look after you as long as you behave well and keep up to your work you wont see me very often but i shall know all about you remember and he turned to his table and wrote presently there was a sudden thump at the door which opened slowly and admitted the foremost partit was the abdomenof cottam the foreman he was of middle height though he seemed short by reason of his corpulence deliberate in all his movements yet hard muscular and active he turned as it were on his own axis at the edge of the door shut it with one hand while he dangled a marine peaked cap in the other and looked with serene composure from over his scrub of grey beard first at mrs may then at johnny and last at his employer oh cottam the gentleman said writing one more word and letting drop his pen this lads name is john may i expect youll remember his father bad accident i believe in the heavy turning shop died in fact this with a slight glance at nan may the foreman turnedturned his whole person for his head was set on his vast shoulders with no visible neck betweenbent a trifle and inspected johnny as he would have inspected some wholly novel and revolutionary piece of machinery yuuus he said with a slowly rising inflection expressive of cautious toleration as of one reserving a definite opinion yuuus well hes to come on as apprentice and id like him to come into your shop therell be no difficulty about that will there nooo with the same deliberate inflection similarly expressive then youd better take him down and tell the timekeeper he may as well begin on monday i suppose yuuus tuned once more in an ascending scale and with that the acting partner bade mrs may goodmorning turned to his writing and the business was over cottam the foreman put his cap on his head and led the way through the outer office along a corridor down the stairs and across the yard with no indecent haste it was a good distance to go and johnny was vaguely reminded of a circus procession that had once passed through loughton and that he had followed up for nearly three miles behind the elephant halfway across the yard the foreman stopped and made a half turn so as to face nan may as she came up he raised an immense leathery fist and jerked a commensurate thumb over his shoulder thats the young guvnor he said in a hoarse whisper with a confidential twitch of one cheek that was almost a wink thats the young guvnor that is smart young chap knowed im so igh he brought down his hand to the level of his lowest waistcoat button twitched his cheek again nodded and walked on the timekeeper inhabited a little wooden cabin just within the gates and looked out of a pigeonhole at all comers mr cottam put his head into this holea close fitand when he withdrew it the timekeeper a grey man came out of his side door and stared hard at johnny then he growled all right and went in again six oclock o monday mornin mr cottam pronounced conclusively addressing mrs may six oclock o monday mornin ere with a downward jerk of his thumb to make it plain that somewhere else would not do then without a glance at johnny whom he had disregarded since they left the office he turned and walked off johnny and his mother were opening the small door that was cut in the great gate when mr cottam stopped and turned mornin he roared and went on mother and boy went their way joyously here was one of nan mays troubles dissolved in air and as for johnny a world of wonders was before him now he would understand how steam made engines go and all day he would see them goinghe would make engines himself in fact and for this delightful pursuit he would be paid six shillings a week was what apprentices got in their first yeara shilling for every day of work next year he would get eight shillings and then ten and so on and at twentyone he would be a man indeed an engineer like his father before him more he was to draw the gentleman had told him to draw in his spare time the clang of hammers was as a merry peal from the works that lined their way and the hoots of steamships on the river made them a moving music nan may wondered to see such merry faces about the streets on the way home truly the place was changed but perhaps after all it was no such bad place even now the street was quiet where they had seen the drunken woman though two very small boys were still kicking a filthy slice of bacon about the gutter but three streets beyond they saw her for a moment for the blackguard boys had contrived to topple mother borndrunk into a handbarrow which they were now trundling along at such a pace that the bedraggled sufferer could do no more than lie and cling to the rails a gasping uncleanly heap truly emma paceys punishment was upon her bessy brightened wonderfully at the news of johnnys success for she was thoughtful and oldfashioned even among the prematurely sage girlchildren of her class and she had been fretting silently now she hopped about with something of her old activity she reported that the nextdoor neighbour on the left had been persistently peeping over the wall and that just before their arrival the peep had been accompanied by a very artificial cough meant to attract attention so mrs may went into the backyard mornin mum said the nextdoor neighbour a very redfaced man in a dungaree jacket weathers cleared up a bit ive bin avin alf a day auf touchin up things he sank with a bob behind the wall and rose again with a paintpot in his lifted hand bit o red paint any use to ye xi the red paintpot and a blue one from the same quarter together with a yellow one from the neighbours on the other side a white one from an old lighterman in the house behind and a suitable collection of brushes subscribed by all three were johnnys constant companions till the end of that weary week the shopshutters grew to be red with a blue border the windowframes were yellow the wall beneath was white so was the cornice above and the door and the doorposts were red altogether because the red paint went farthest and the red pot had been fullest to begin with not only did the length of the job work off johnnys first enthusiasm but its publicity embarrassed him perched conspicuously on a stepladder painting a shop in such stirring colours as these he was the cynosure of all wayfaring folk the target of whatever jibes their wits might compass three out of four warned him that the paint was laid on wrong side out some in unkindly allusion to certain chance splashes reminded him that he hadnt half painted the windowpanes and facetious boys in piteous pantomime affected to be reduced to instant blindness by sudden knowledge of johnnys brilliant performance but he was most discomforted by those who merely stood and stared invisible behind him if only he could have seen them it would not have been so bad the oppressive consciousness that some contemptuous grown man behind and belowpossibly a painter by tradewas narrowly observing every stroke of the brush shook his nerve and enfeebled his execution most of these earnest spectators seemed to have no pressing business of their own and their inspections were prolonged one critic found speech to remark as he turned to go his way well you are makin a bloomin mess up there but most as if at a loss for words by mere amazement sheered off with well blimy it was discouraging to find that all these people could have done it so much better and long before the job was finished johnny was sore depressed and very humble as well as tired only one of all his witnesses offered help and he was a surprising person very tall very thin and very sooty from work with splay feet sloping shoulders a long face of exceeding diffidence and long arms which seemed to swing and flap irresponsibly with the skirts of his long overcoat and to be a subject of mute apology he saw johnny tiptoeing at the very top of the steps making a bad shift to reach the cornice he stopped looked about him and then went on a step or two stopped again and came back with a timorous glance at the shop window and when johnny turned and looked he said in a voice scarce above a whisper cantcher reach it not very well lets come and when johnny descended the long man with one more glance about the street went up three steps at a time and laid the paint on rapidly many feet at a sweep he came down and shifted the steps very easily with one handand they were heavy stepswent up again and in three minutes carried the paint to the very end of the cornice then he came down with a sheepish smile at johnnys thanks and shambled as far as next door where he let himself in with a latchkey and on friday at dinnertime perceiving johnnys progress from his window on the upper floorhe was a lodger it seemedhe came stealthily down and gave the cornice another coat on saturday morning the shop was opened in form though johnnys painting was not finished till dusk very little happened a few children stopped on their way and stared in at the door the first customer was a boy from among these who came in to beg a piece of string and infested harbour lane for the rest of the day swinging a dead rat on the end of it hours passed and nan mays spirits fell steadily a few pounds a very fewthey could scarce be made to last three weekswas all her reserve and most of her scanty stock was perishable if it spoiled it could never be replaced and unless people bought it spoil it must what more could she do industry determination and all the rest were well enough but when all was said and done nothing could make people come and buy near noon the second customer camea little girl this time she wanted a bottle of ink for a halfpenny there were halfa dozen little bottles of ink in a row in the window but the price was a penny so the little girl went away it was a dull dinner that day bessy invented ingenious conjectures to account for the lack of trade and prophesied a change in the afternoon or the evening or perhaps next week or at latest the week after her mother could not understand customers came to other shops why not to this one she had seen nothing of uncle isaac since she had come to harbour lane though he knew where to find her she had hoped he would lend a hand with the painting or with the display of the stock but no doubt he had been too busy true johnny thought he had seen him once from the steps some way down the street but that must have been a mistake for uncle isaac would not have come so near them without calling nor would he have bolted instantly round the nearest corner at sight of the boy and his work as johnny had fancied he had the afternoon began no better than the morning nobody came but a child who asked for sixpennorth of coppers till about four then a hurried woman demanded a pennorth of mixed pickles in a saucer and grumbled at the quantity she wouldnt come into the shop again at anyrate a threat so discomposing for was not the woman the first paying customer that for hours nan may could not forgive herself for her illiberality though indeed she gained but a weak fraction of a farthing by the transaction half an hour more went and then there came a truly noble customer he looked like a bricklayer and he was far from sober so far indeed that johnny on the steps spying the mazy sinuosity of his approach got a step lower and made ready to jump in case of accidents but the bricklayer conscious of the presence of many ladders steered wide into the roadway and there stopped fascinated by the brilliancy before him some swaying moments of consideration resolved him that this was a shop and after many steps up the curb and as many back in the gutter he picked a labyrinthine path among the myriad ladders narrowly missing the real one as he went shouldered against the wet doorpost and stumbled toward the counter here he regarded a bladder of lard with thoughtful severity till nan may timorously asked what he wanted shumm for kidsh he replied sternly to the lard shummforkidsh for some moments his scowl deepened then he raised his hand and pointed wwhasha he demanded lard tharrll do he plunged his hand into his trousers pocket tharrll do ow mush sevenpence halfpenny a pound orrigh gis oldovit he reached an unsteady hand imperilling bottles but nan may was quicker and took the bladder of lard from its perch how much she asked ow much thash wha i wan know you give it ere go on his voice rose disputatively and he fell on the bladder of lard with both hands ow mush nan reflected that it weighed more than three pounds and that she had paid mr dunkin eighteenpence for it two shillings she said two shillin orrigh and instantly what remained of the new customers weeks wages was scattered about the counter mrs may took two shillings and returned the rest which with some difficulty was thrust back into the pocket and the new customer after looking narrowly about him in search of his purchase and at last discovering it under his arm sallied forth with a wipe against the other doorpost and continued his winding way a solemn and portentous bricklayer with red paint on his shoulders and whiskers and a bladder of lard that slipped sometimes forward and sometimes backward from his embrace and was a deal of trouble to pick up again here was a profit of sixpence at a stroke unlikely as the chance was to recur and it raised nans spirits unreasonably enough still the bricklayer brought luck of a sort for there were three more customers within the next hour two bringing a halfpenny and one a penny and in the evening five or six came one spending as much as fourpence this was better perhaps but poor enough at ten that night nan may reckoned her profit for the day at ninepence farthing including the bricklayers sixpence and she was sick with waiting and faint with fear at halfpast ten uncle isaac turned up ah hum he said bin paintin might a laid it on a bit evener theres right ways o layin on paint an theres wrong ways an one way aint the same as the other he raised his finger at johnny instructively far from it and contrairy theres a great difference uncle isaac paused and no further amplification of his proposition occurring to him he turned to mrs may ows trade he asked nan may shook her head sadly very bad uncle she said hardly any at all and she felt nearer crying than ever since the funeral ah said uncle isaac sitting on a packing caseempty but intended to look full ah what you wants enterprise enterprise thats what you want what is it as stimilates trade an encourages prosperity toto the latest improvements enterprise why is commercial opulentness tookat least waftedcommercial opulentness wafted round the ole world consekince o what consekince o enterprise uncle isaac tapped the counter with his forefinger and gazed solemnly in nan mays troubled face consekince o enterprise he repeated slowly with another tap then he added briskly with a glance at the inner door adjer supper no uncle nan answered i never thought of it but now youre here praps youll have a bit with us ahdont mind if i do uncle isaac responded cheerfully that looks a nice little bit o bacon now a rasher auf that an a hegggot a hegg o yus he saw a dozen in a basin a rasher auf that an a hegg or two ud be just the thing with a drop o beer wouldnt it johnny fetched the beer and uncle isaac had two rashers and four eggs and he finished with a good solid piece of bread and the first slicea large oneout of the dutch cheese from the counter nan may made no more than a pretence at eating a little bread and cheese when at last the jug was empty and uncle isaac was full he leaned back in his chair and for some minutes exercised his lips in strange workings and twistings with many incidental clicks and sucks and fizzes while he benignantly contemplated the angle of the ceiling when at last the display flagged he brought his gaze gradually lower till it rested on the diminished piece of bacon none so bad that bacon he observed putting his head aside with a critical regard though praps rayther more of a breakfast specie than a supper he laid his head to the other side as one anxious to be impartial yus he went on thoughtfully more of a breakfast specie as you might say then after a pause he added with the air of one announcing a brilliant notioni blieveyus i do blieve ill try a bit for breakfast tomorrer mornin if you like uncle nan answered a little faintly butbut timidlyi was thinking praps itll make it look rather small toto put on the counter so it wouldso it would uncle isaac admitted frankly and indeed the remaining piece was scarce of four rashers capacity pity to cut it as you say nan thanksill just wrop it up as it is itll come in for monday too an that large bit o streakyll look a deal more nobler on the counter uncle isaacs visit swept away the days profits and a trifle more but certainly uncle isaac must not be offended now that things looked so gloomy ahead bessy lay and strained her wits far into the night inventing comfortable theories and assurances and exchanging them with her mother for others as hopeful but in the morning each pillow had its wet spot xii but monday saw another beginning johnny must rise soon after five now to reach his work at six but on this the first morning he was awake and eager at halfpast four early as he was his mother was before him and as he pulled his new white ducks over his everyday clothes he could hear her moving below nan may was resolved that the boy should go out to begin the world fed and warm at least and as cheerful as might be for this one morning johnny felt nothing of the sleepy discomfort of any house in pitch dark a little before five two breakfasts were ready for him one for the present moment which he scarce touched for he was excited and another in a basin and a red handkerchief for use at the workshop with a new tin can full of coffee for the halfhour allowed for breakfast would scarce suffice for the mere hurrying home and hurrying back again and the full hour at midday would give him bare time for dinner with his mother bessy was infected with the excitement and stumped downstairs to honour johnnys setting out he left the shopdoor half an hour too soon with a boot flung after him the darkness of the street seemed more solid at this hour than ever at midnight and it almost smothered the faint gaslights now and again a touch of sleet came down the wind and a little dirty halfmelted snow of yesterday made the ways sloppy nobody was about to view the manly glory of johnnys white ducks and he was not sorry now that his overcoat largely hid them for the wind was cold and he reflected with satisfaction that the warming of his coffee on a furnace would smoke the inglorious newness off the tin can ere he carried it home in the open day the one or two policemen he met regarded him curiously for workmen were not yet moving but the coffeestall was open by the swing bridge and here the wind came over the river with an added chill the coffeestall keeper had no customers and on the bridge and in the straight street beyond it nobody was in sight till presently a small figure showed indistinctly ahead and crossed the road as though to avoid him it moved hurriedly keeping timidly to the wall and johnny saw it was a girl of something near his own age he tramped on and the girl once past seemed to gather courage turned and made a few steps after him at this he stopped and she spoke from a few yards off she was a decentlydressed and rather a pretty girl as he could see by the bad light of the nearest lamp but her face was drawn with alarm and her eyes were wet please have you seen a lady anywhere she asked tremulously ill johnny had seen no lady ill or well and when he said no the young girl with a weak thankyou hastened on her way it was very odd thought johnny as he stared into the dark where she vanished who should lose a ladyillin blackwall streets at this time of a pitch dark morning as he thought there rose in his mind the picture of grandad straying and bloody and sick to death that night that seemed so far away though it was but a month or two since maybe the lady had wandered from her bed in some such plight as that johnny was sorry for the girls trouble and would have liked to turn aside and join in her search but this was the hour of great business of his own and he went his way about it the policemen were knocking at doors now rousing workmen who answered with shouts from within an old nightwatchman too scurrying his hardest for he had farther to go than the policemen banged impatiently at the knockers of the more conservative and oldfashioned and as johnny neared maidment and hursts the streets grew busy with the earliest workmenthose who lived farthest from their labour maidment and hursts gate was shut fast he was far too soon he tried the little door that was cut in the great gate but that was locked he wondered if he ought to knock and did venture on a faint tap of the knuckles but he might as well have tapped the brick wall moreover a passing apprentice observed the act and guffawed aloud try down the airey mate was his advice so johnny stood and waited keeping the new tin can where the gaslight over the gate should not betray its unsmoked brightness and trying to look as much like an old hand as possible but the passing men grinned at each other jerking their heads toward him and johnny felt that somehow he was known for a greenhorn the apprentices immeasurable weeks ahead of him in experience flung ironic advice and congratulation hooray extry quarter for you mate two or three said one earnestly advising him to chalk it on the gaffers at sos e wont forget and still another shouted in tones of extravagant indignationwhat ony jes come they bin awaitin for ye ever since the pubs shut at length the timekeeper came sour and grey and tugged at a vertical iron bellhandle which johnny had not perceived the bell brought the nightwatchman with a lantern and a clank of keys and the timekeeper stepped through the little door with a growl in acknowledgment he left the door ajar and johnny after a moments hesitation stepped in after him mr cottam told me to come this morning sir he said before the timekeeper had quite disappeared into his box my names may the timekeeper turned and growled again that being his usual manner of conversation awright he continued you wait there till e comes in then and it was many months ere johnny next heard him say so much at once the timekeeper began hanging round metal tickets on a great board studded with hooks a ticket to each hook in numbered order presently a man came in at the door selected a ticket from the board and dropped it through a slot into what seemed to be a big moneybox then three came together and each did the same then there came a stream of men and boys and the board grew barer of tickets and barer in the midst came mr cottam suddenly appearing within the impossibly small wicket as by a conjuring trick he tramped heavily straight ahead apparently unconscious of johnny but as he came by he dropped his hand on the boys shoulder and gazing steadily ahead well me lad he roared much as though addressing somebody at a window of the factory across the yard goodmorning sir johnny answered walking at the foremans side by compulsion for the hand however friendly was the heaviest and strongest he had ever felt mr cottam went several yards in silence still gripping johnnys shoulder then he spoke again mother all right he asked fiercely still addressing the window yes sir thankyou they walked on and entered the factory this ere said mr cottam turning on johnny at last and glaring at him sternly this eres the big shop eavy work theres a big cylinder for the noo red star boat he led his prisoner through the big shop this way and that among the great lathes and planers lit by gas from the rafters and up a staircase to another workshop ere we are said mr cottam releasing johnnys shoulder at last yaint a fool are ye know what a lathe is doncher an beltin an shaftin awright neednt do nothin fore breakfast look about an see things an dont get in mischief i got me eye on ye the foreman left him and began to walk along the lines of machines and the nearest apprentice grinned at johnny and winked johnny looked about as the foreman had advised this place where he was to learn to make engines and where he was to work day by day till he was twentyone and a man was a vast room with skylights in the roof though this latter circumstance he did not notice till after breakfast when the gas was turned off and daylight penetrated from above a confusion of heavy raftering stretched below the roof carrying belted shafting everywhere and every man bent over his machine or his bench for cottam was a sharp gaffer johnny watched the leading hand scribing curves on metal along lines already set out by punctured dots lining off said the leading hand seeing the boys interest and then leaning over to speak because of the workshop din centredabs he added pointing to the dots that at least johnny resolved not to forget lining off and centredabs for some reasonperhaps the usual reason perhaps anotherthree or four of the men were losing a quarter that monday morning and some of them were men with whom young apprentices had been working consequently cottam in addition to his general supervision had to keep particular watch on these mentorless lads and johnny learned a little from the gaffers remarks well wotjer doin with that file he would ask of one you aint aplayin cats cradle now me lad look ere keep er level like this its a file it aint a rockinorse or he would come behind another who was chipping byemetal and using a hammer with more zeal than skill he would watch for a moment and then break out well you are fond o exercise i must say good job youre strong enough to stand it i aint my constitootion wont allow me to old a ammer like this ere this with a burlesque of the lads stiff grasp and wholearm action it ud knock me up bein a more delicate sort o person his arm was near as thick as the boys waist i old a ammer like thissee and he took the shaft end loosely in his fingers and hammered steadily and firmly from the wrist johnny saw that and remembered again half an hour later stopping at the elbow of another apprentice a little older than the last come said the foreman thats a noo idea that is takin auf the skin from cast iron with a bran noo file i ope youve patented it an i ope you wont come an want another file in about alf an hour cos if you do you wont git it whereat johnny astonished to learn that cast iron had a skin resolved not to forget that you shouldnt take it off with a new file and made a mental note to ask somebody why presently as he came by the long fittingbench johnny grew aware of a fitter immensely tall and very thin who grinned and nodded in furtive recognition it was indeed the next door lodger who had painted the cornice he was very large johnny thought to be so shy he positively blushed as he grinned you come to this shop he asked in his odd whisper as he stooped to judge the fit of his work im beddin down a junk ring praps the gafferll put you to elp me after breakfast bedding down a junk ring sounded advanced and technical and johnny felt taller at the prospect he would learn what a junk ring was probably when he had to help bed it down meanwhile he watched the tall man as he brought the metal to an exact face stop in to breakfast the man asked as he stooped again yes some o the boys ll try a game with ye praps dont mind a little game do ye no ah i couldnt stand it when i was a lad made me misrable when ye go in the smiths shop to git yer breakfast look about ye if theyre special kind findin y a seat up above fr instance johnny left the long man and presently observed that the foreman was not in the shop there was an instant slackness perceivable among the younger and less steady men for the leading hand had no such authority as cottam one man at a lathe throwing out his gear examined his work and turning to johnny said look ere me lad i want to true this ere bit jes you go an ask sam wilkinsthat man up at the end there in the serge jacketjes you go an ask im for the round square johnny knew the tool called a square used for testing the truth of finished work though he had never seen a round one howbeit he went off with alacrity but it seemed that sam wilkins hadnt the round square it was joe mills over in the far corner so he tried joe mills but he it seemed had just lent it to bob white at the biggest shapingmachine near the other end bob white understood perfectly but thought he had last seen the round square in the possession of george walker whereas george walker was perfectly certain that it had gone downstairs to bill cook in the big shop doubting nothing from the uncommonly solemn faces of sam and joe and bob and george johnny set off down the stone stairs where he met the ascending gaffer on his way back from the patternmakers shop ullo boy he said where you goin downstairs sir for the round square mr cottams eyes grew more prominent and there were certain sounds as of an imprisoned bullfrog from somewhere deep in his throat but his expression relaxed not a shade presently he said know what a round is yes sir know what a square is yes sir spose somebody wanted a round square drored on paper what ud ye do there was another internal croak and somehow johnny felt emboldened i think he said with some sly hesitation i think id tell em to do it themselves mr cottam croaked again louder and this time with a heave of the chest awright he said thats good enough better say somethink like that to them as sent ye thats a very old ave that is he resumed his heavy progress up the stairs turning johnny round by the shoulder and sending him in front there were furtive grins in the shop and one lad asked got it in a voice cautiously subdued but just then the bell rang for breakfast most of the men and several of the boys made their best pace for the gate these either lived near or got their breakfasts at coffeeshops and their halfhour began and ended in haste the few others more leisurely stayed to gather their cans and handkerchiefssome to wipe their hands on cotton waste that curious tangled stuff by which alone johnny remembered his father as for him he waited to do what the rest did for he saw that his friend the long man had gone out with the patrons of coffeeshops the boys took their cans and clattered down to the smiths shop johnny well in the rear for he was desirous of judging from a safe distance what form the little game might take that the long man had warned him of in case it came soon but a wayward fate preserved him from boobytraps that morning in the first place he had come in a cap and so forfended one ordeal for it was the etiquette of the shop among apprentices that any bowler hat brought in on the head of a new lad must be pinned to the wall with the tangs of many files since a bowler hat ere a lad had four years at least of service was a pretension a vainglory and an outrage next his lagging saved his new ducks the first lads down had prepared the customary trap which consisted of a seat of honour in the best place near the fire a seat doctored with a pool of oil and situated exactly beneath a rafter on which stood a can of water taken from a lathe a string depending from the can with its lower end fastened behind the seat so that the victim accepting the accommodation would receive a large oily embellishment on his new white ducks and by the impact of his back against the string induce a copious christening of himself and his entire outfit but it chanced that an elderly journeyman from the big shopold ben cuttsappeared on the scene early wiping his spectacles on his jacket lining as he came he knew nothing of a fresh prentice saw nothing but a convenient and warm seat and hastened to seize it the lads were taken by surprise nonot there shouted one a few yards away fust come fust served me lad chuckled old ben cutts as he dropped on the fatal spot ere i am an ere i with that the can fell and johnny at the door was astonished to observe a greyheaded workman with a pair of spectacles in his hand and a vast oily patch on his white overalls dripping and dancing and swearing and smacking wildly at the heads of the boys about him without hitting any there were no more tricks that breakfasttime for when at length old ben subsided to his meal he put a little pile of wedges by his side to fling at the first boy of whose behaviour he might disapprove and as his spectacles were now on his nose and his aim thus aided was known to be no bad one and as the wedges furthermore were both hard and heavy breakfasts were eaten with all the decorum possible in a smiths shop johnnys new can was satisfactorily blackened and his breakfast was well disposed of such youths as tried him with verbal chaff he answered as well as he might though he had as yet little of the cockney boys readiness and at last the bell rang again and the breakfasters went back to work mr cottam casting his glance about the shop in search of the simplest possible job for johnny to begin on with a steady man at hand to watch him stopped as his gaze reached long hicks and sent johnny to help him with his bolts and so johnny found the tall mans surmise verified and the tall man himself received him with another grin a little less shy he set him to running down bolts and nuts showing him how to fix the bolt in a vice and work the nut on it with a spanner johnny fell to the task enthusiastically and so the morning went xiii when nan may opened shop she saw that men were pulling down as much of the shipyard wall opposite as stood between two chalk lines she thought no more of the thing at the time not guessing how nearly it concerned her for this was to be a new workmens gate to the shipyard and passing workmen might change the fortunes of a shop for that day however there was no sign but the demand of a bricklayers labourer for a pennorth of cheese it was as bad a day as saturday in the matter of tradeindeed there was no drunken man to buy lardand the womans heart grew heavier as the empty hours went bessy stood at the backparlour door pale and anxious but striving to lift a brave face before one oclock there was dinner to be prepared not that either bessy or her mother could eat but for johnny and at a quarter past one both met him at the door as cheerfully as they could and indeed they were eager to hear of his fortunes they wondered to see him coming with the long man who lived next door and the long man for his part was awkward and nervous when he saw them at first he hung back as though to let johnny go on alone but he changed his mind and came striding ahead hastily looking neither to right nor to left and plunged in at his door johnny was hungry and in high spirits he and long hicks it seemed had been bedding down a junk ring for a piston johnny easing the bolts and nuts and long hicks doing the other work he said nothing of the round square but talked greatly of slidevalves and cranks till bessy judged him a full engineer already between his mouthfuls he illustrated the proper handling of hammer and file and reprehended the sinful waste of spoiling the surface of a new file on the outer skin of a fresh iron casting it cheered nan may to see the boy taking so heartily to his work through all her secret dread that she might lack the means to keep him at it johnny glanced anxiously at the clock from time to time and at last declared that he must knock for long hicks who was plainly forgetting how late it was and in the end he rushed away to disturb the tall man ten minutes too soon and hurried off to maidment and hursts there to take his own new metal ticket from the great board and drop it duly into the box the afternoon went busily at the factory and busy days followed johnny acquired his first tool a steel footrule and carried it in public places with a full quarter of its length visible at the top of its appointed pocket it was the way of all young apprentices to do this the rule they would say thus being carried convenient for the hand but it was an exact science among the observant to judge a lads experience inversely by scale of the inches exposed going at the rate of half an inch a year a lad through two years of his time would show no more of his rule than two inches by the end of four years one of these inches would have vanished as his twentyfirst birthday approached the last inch shrank to a mere hint of bright metal and nobody ever saw the footrule of a full journeyman except he were using it johnnys christening postponed by the accident of old ben cutts came when he was first put to a small lathe to try his hand at turning bolts for when returning from breakfast he belted his lathe he did not perceive that the watercan had been tied to the belt realising it however the next instant when it flew over the shafting and discharged the water on his head then he was free of the shop suffering no more than the rest from the workshop pranks habitual among the younger lads and joining in them gammoning newer lads than himself with demands for the round square and oppressing them with urgent messages to testy gaffersthat a cockroach had got in the foofoo valve that the donkeyman wanted an order for a new nosebag and the like grew able moreover in workshop policy making good interest with the storekeeper who might sometimes oblige with the loan of a hammer for a lost hammer meant a fine of threeandsixpence and when yours was stoleneverybody stole everybody elses hammera borrowed one would tide you over till you could steal another making friends too with the toolsmith at a slight expense in drinks though able to punish him also if necessary by the secret bedevilment of his fire with iron borings learned to manufacture an apparent watercrack by way of excuse for a broken filea watercrack made with a touch of grease well squeezed between the broken ends in short became an initiated prentice engineer in the trade itself moreover he was not slow and mr cottam had once mentioned him though johnny did not know it as none so bad a boy one as can work is own ead until his first enthusiasm had worn off he never ceased from questioning long hicks in his hours of leisure on matters concerning steamengines so that the retiring hicks grew almost out of touch with the accordion that had been the solace of his solitude the tall man had never met quite so inquisitive an apprentice engineering was in the blood he supposed he had guessed the boys mother an engineers wife when first johnny came to his bench because of the extra button nan may had been careful to sew on his jacket cuff a button used to tighten the sleeve that it might not catch the driver on a lathe it was early in johnnys experienceindeed he had been scarce a fortnight at the engineshopwhen a man coming in from an outdoor job just before dinner told cottam the foreman that an old friend was awaiting him at the gate looking for a job an oos the ol friend asked cottam severely distrustful mr enery butson esquire the man answered with a grin what butson the gaffer ejaculated and his eyes grew rounder butson agen iddamme id as soon ave a brass monkey and mr cottam stumped indignantly up the shop singlar that observed a labourer who was helping an erector with a little yacht engine near johnnys bench singlar like what i eard the gaffer say at lumleys when butson wanted a job there what sez e butson why id rayther ave a chaney dawg auf my granmothers mantelpiece e sez e wouldnt spile castins e sez there were grins between the men who heard for it would seem that mr butson was not unknown among them but when johnny told his mother at dinner she thought the men rude and ignorant and she was especially surprised at mr cottam for some little while johnny wondered at the girl who was hunting for a sick lady in the street on that dark monday morning he looked out for her on his way to and from his work resolved if he met her to ask how the search had fared and how the lady was but he saw nothing of her and the thing began to drop from his mind till a saturday afternoon when he went to see a new ram launched for halfway to the shipyard he saw a pretty girland surely it was the same in no tears nor trouble now indeed but most disconcertingly composed and dignifiedyet surely the same johnny hesitated and stopped and then most precipitately resumed his walk for truly this was a very awful young person icily unconscious of him her casual glance flung serenely through his head and over it perhaps it wasnt the same after all and if notwell it was lucky he had said nothing nevertheless his inner feeling was that he had made no mistake more that the girl remembered him but was proud and would not own it it didnt matter he said to himself but the afternoon went a little flat the launch was less interesting than one might have expected there was a great iron hull tricked out with flags and when men knocked away the dogshores with sledgehammers the ship slid away cradle and all into the water there wasnt much in that of course if you knocked away the dogshores the ship was bound to slide plainly enough that wasnt very interesting johnny felt vaguely resentful of the proceedings but still he wondered afresh at the lost lady who was ill out of doors so early in the morning xiv but this launch was when johnnys prentice teeth were cut when the running down of bolts and pins was beneath his notice and he could be trusted with work at a small nibbling machine when he had turned stopvalve spindles more than once and felt secretly confident of his ability to cut a screw meantime history was making at the shop very slowly at first it is true the holly had been made the most of but it seemed to attract not at all pennorths and haporths were most of the sales and even they were few nan may grew haggard and desperate uncle isaac had called once soon after the opening saturday but since had been a stranger he had said that he was about to change his lodgings he was a widower but nan knew nothing of his new address in truth such was uncle isaacs tenderness of heart that he disliked the sight or complaint of distress and in the manner of many other people of similar tenderness he betook himself as far as possible from the scene thereof and kept there it was within a few days of christmas when things seemed hopeless johnny indeed had never ceased to hope till now he had talked of the certainty of struggling on somehow till his wages were enough for all indeed even the six shillings a week seemed something considerable now though he knew that the rent alone came to ten but even johnnys cheerfulness fell in face of the intenser dejection the more open tears of his mother and sister as the days wore on long hicks found him a quieter less inquisitive boy and a duller help than at first and dinner at home was a sad makebelieve each knew that the other two were contrasting the coming christmas with the last then grandad was with them hale and merry to look out of window was to look through a world of frosty twigs to woody deeps where the deer waited timid and shadowy for the crusts flung out afar for them from the garden now but there but it was just at this desperate time that a change came as by magic the men who pulled down the wall at the opposite side of the street gave place to others who built a mighty brick pier at each side of the opening a pier designed to carry its half of the new gate but ere the work was near complete men and boys from the yard found it a convenient place to slip out and in at on breakfasttime or dinnertime errands now it chanced at the time that one of these men was in a domestic difficulty a difficulty that a large part of the eight or nine hundred men of the shipyard encountered in turn at more or less regular intervals his wife inhabited the bedroom in company with a monthly nurse while he roosted sleeplessly at night on a slippery horsehair couch in the parlour or wallowed in a jumble of spare blankets and old coats on the floor spending his home hours by day in desolate muddling in the kitchen lost and incapable and abject before the tyranny of the nurse on dark mornings he made forlorn attempts at raking together a breakfast to carry with him to work but as he had taken no thought to put anything into the cupboard over night he found it no easy matter to extract a breakfast from it in the morning so it came to pass that on the second day of his affliction this bedevilled husband his hunger merely aggravated by the stale lumps of bread he had thought to make shift on issued forth at the new gate in quest of breakfast there was little time and most of the shops were a distance off but just opposite was a flaming little chandlers shop newly opened it was thinly stocked enough but it would be hard luck indeed if it did not hold something eatable and so nan mays first customer that day was the starved husband got anythink t eat he asked his ravening gaze piercing the bare corners of the shop got any bacon yes sir nan may answered reaching for the insignificant bit of streaky that was all she had nocooked i mean aincher got any cold boiled ock no sir y ought t ave some cooked ock lots ud ave it in the yard i cant eat thatthe smiths shop s the other end o the yard an i got nothing to toast it with aincher got nothing else nan may grasped the situation and conceived an instant notion for indeed she had inborn talent as a shopkeeper though till now it had had no chance to show itself will you wait five minutes she asked yes he would wait five minutes but no more and he sat on the empty case from which uncle isaac had delivered his recommendation of enterprise nan may cut two rashers and retired to the shop parlour in three minutes the hungry customer was hammering on the counter declaring that he could wait no longer pacified by assurances from within he resigned himself to a minute and a half more of patience when mrs may returned with a massive sandwich wherein the two rashers fresh frizzled lay between two thick slices of bread lifting the top slice for a moment as guarantee of good faith nan may exchanged the whole ration for threepence if youd like any cold boiled bacon sir she said i shall have some at one oclock he heard but he was off at a trot with his sandwich in five minutes nan mays bonnet was on and in five more bessy was minding shop alone while her mother hastened to mr dunkins for a hock of bacon here was a possible change of fortune and nan may was not a woman to waste a chance boiled and cooledor cooled enough for the taste of hungry rivetersthe hock stood in a dish on the counter at one oclock flanked by carvingknife and fork a card bearing the best that bessy could draw advertised the price and the first quarterpound of slices was duly cut for the desolate husband who came back a little later for two ounces more for he had been illfed for two or three days and the new baby made an event wherewith some extra expense was natural boys came for two other quarterpounds so that it was plain that the first customer had told others and a loaf was cut up to go with the bacon mrs may announced the new branch of trade to johnny when he came to dinner and though as yet the returns were small enough there was a new chance and his mother was hopeful of it so he went back to the lathe with a lighter heart that night the riveters worked overtime and the bacon was in better demand still more at night two or three men took home a snack in paper for supper and from that day things grew better daily the hock was finished by the afternoon of the next day and the establishment was out of pickles for men and boys who brought their own cold meat with them came now for pickles trade was better as the days went on and christmas though it found them poor enough was none so sad a festival after all and in a month when the gate had been formally opened for some time and the men streamed by in hundreds three large hocks would rarely last two days and there was an average profit of three shillings a hock more the bread came in daily in batches at trade price and cheese and pickles went merrily but what went best and what increased in sale even beyond this point was the bacon some customers called it ham which pleased nan may for indeed her cooking hit the popular taste and she began to feel a pride in it men who went home to dinner would buy bacon to take home for tea and as many of these lived in harbour lane and thereabout custom soon came from their wives in soap and candles treacle and pepper and blacking nan mays trade instinct grew with exercise she found the particular sort of bacon that best suited her purpose and her customers tastes she had regular boilings throughout the week she quickly found the trick of judging the quality of whatever she bought and she bought to the best use of her money but here it must be said that nan may in her new prosperity behaved toward one benefactor with an undutiful forgetfulness that was near ingratitude for she bought almost nothing of mr dunkin he was reasonably grieved true she had begun by getting her first stock of him but even then her critical examination of what was sent showed an unworthily suspicious attitude of mind she even sent back many things and demanded better wilfully blind to the fact that mr dunkin could turn her out of the shop at a weeks notice if he pleased though indeed in his own mind he was not vindictive for another new tenant would be hard to find he even submitted to outrage ending in actual loss and humiliation for a large tin of mustard was mrs mays first supply and it was a tin from among those kept for sale to small shopkeepers and not on any account to be sold from retail across mr dunkins own counter but something in the feel and taste of this mustard did not please nan may though indeed she was not asked to eat it and it went back now it chanced that mr dunkin had taken on a new shopman that week and this bungling incapable straightway began selling mustard from the returned tin he had served three customers before his blunder was perceived and then the matter came to light purely because the third customer chanced to be a food and drug inspector this functionary gravely announced himself as soon as he had good hold of the parcel and handsomely offered the return of a third part of the mustard in a sealed packet and the upshot was a fine of five pounds and costs for mr dunkin on the opinionative evidence of an analyst who talked of starch and turmeric and gingerall very excellent substances as anybody knows truly it was a vexatious blow for mr dunkin and an unjust for certainly the fault was not his and to sell such an article retail was wholly against his principles but he never complained such was his forbearance never spoke of his hardship to a soul in fact except when he sacked the new assistant it was even said that he had offered a reporter money to keep it out of the papers and though it did get into the papers and at good length too yet the effort was kindly meant for truly it could but give mrs may pain to learn that she had been the cause of mr dunkins misfortune if she were a woman of any feeling at all but as time went he began to doubt if she were for her custom dropped away to nothing the rate at which bacon was handed in from the cart of a firm somewhere in the borough was scandalous to behold before his very eyes too when he called for the rent he employed a collector but presently took to coming for the rent himself that by his presence and his manner he might shame so thankless a tenant into some sense of decency some order for bacon or mustard he coughed gently and stared very hard at the incoming goods but nan may was in no wise abashed and gave the carman his directions with shameless composure with his sympathetic stop full out mr dunkin asked how trade was and nan may answered in proper shopkeeper terms that she mustnt grumble with hums and purrs he led back through casual questions and answers to the stock he had at first supplied and asked her how she had done with this and how that had gone off but her answers were so artlessly direct so inconsiderately truthful that good mr dunkin was clean baffled and reduced at last to a desperate hint that if anything were wanted he could take the order back with him but he got no order so he purred and hummed his way into harbour lane and so away and after a time the collector came in his stead mr dunkin resolved to wait he had some doubts of the permanence of this new prosperity in the shop the place had never brought anybody a living yet and he should not feel convinced till he had seen steady trade there for some time nan mays activities could always be kept from flagging by judicious increases of rent and if the thing grew well established by her exertions and was certain to continue a paying concern why here would be a new branch of mr dunkins business ready made it needed but a weeks notice given unexpectedly at a properly chosen time when no neighbouring shop was to let and a good stroke of business was happily completed mrs may would vanish a man would go in to manage at a pound or twentyfive shillings a week and his quarters there would be no interruption to trade for the outgoing tenant would naturally keep at work till the last minute to get what little she could and mr dunkin would have a new branch paying very excellently with no trouble to himself mr dunkin had established other branches in the same way and found it a very simple and cheap arrangement there was no risk of his own capital no trouble in workingup the trade no cost of goodwill and rent was coming regularly while the tenant laboured with the zeal of a man who imagines he is working for his own benefit and his childrens the important thing was to give nothing but a weekly tenancy else the tenant might find time to get going somewhere near at hand and so perhaps deprive mr dunkin of the just reward of his sagacity foresight and patience but there was little difficulty in that matter beginners were timid and glad of a weekly tenancy fearing the responsibility of anything longer at first and afterwardswell things were in a groove and mr dunkin was so very kind and sympathetic that it wasnt worth while to bother about a change and by this method mr dunkin judiciously selecting his purchases in shop property had acquired two or three of his halfdozen branches and flourished exceedingly which all kindly souls rejoiced to see in the beginning he had no thought of this plan for the harbour lane shop being mainly concerned to get a tenant no matter in what trade and indeed in his eye the place was as little suited for chandlery as for anything even now he must wait for he doubted the lasting quality of the new prosperity better a few years of forbearance than a too hurried seizure of a weakening concern to find little more than the same tenantless shop on his hands after all and if it seemed that the trade owed anything to the personal qualities and connexions of mrs may well it would be a simple thing to keep her on to manage instead of a man it would be an act of benevolence moreover to an unfortunate widow and come cheaper but that was a matter for the future meanwhile nan may active and confident filled her shop by purchase from whatsoever factor sold best and cheapest and travellers called for her orders the hungry husband who first came for cooked bacon she always treated with particular consideration finding him good cuts he ceased his regular visits in three weeks or less and nan may taught by experience in her earlier london life well guessed the cause of his coming in the spring three months or so later great crowds thronged about the shipyard to see the launch of the battleship that overtime had so long been worked on and when the launch was over this man and his wife the man carrying the baby came into the shop for something to celebrate the occasion at tea the parents did not altogether comprehend nan mays enthusiasm over the baby which she took from its fathers arms and danced merrily about the shop while customers waited but they set it down to admiration of its personal beauty though truly it was an ordinary slobbery baby enough but it went away down the street in great state triumphantly stabbing at its mouth with the sugarstick gripped by one hand and at its fathers whiskers with that brandished in the other xv on a saturday afternoon about this time uncle isaac in his best black suit and very tall hat and with the turkshead walkingstick in his hand started out to see a foreman work was rather slack just now shipwrights work was slack everywhere and the three holidays a week that once were the glory and boast of a free and independent shipwright were now apt to be a woeful compulsion uncle isaac had been of late poorer because idler than he liked and in such case it was his way to seek the chance of meeting his foreman out of hours in order to a display of rhetoric oblique flattery and dexterous suggestion that might influence a distribution of short time that would be more favourable to the orator he had wondered much as to the fortunes of nan and her children but as it has been said his tenderness of heart kept him as far as possible from what he believed must now be a scene of sheer failure and destitution if indeed the shop were not abandoned and he was by no means anxious that his poor relations should discover his new lodgings so now he picked his way with circumspection and with careful cogitation of a mental map of the streets because a thoughtless straightforward journey would take him much too near to harbour lane he crossed a swing bridge that gave access to a hundred and fifty yards of roadway ending in another swing bridge but there was a crook in the road and when he passed it he found that the second bridge was open now in blackwall an open bridge did not mean one that the passenger could cross that was a shut bridge the open bridge was one swung aside to let a ship through as a pair of gates is opened for a carriage so uncle isaac resigned himself to wait with an increasingly impatient group till the bridge should swing into place again and give passage he stood behind the chain that hung across the road to check traffic and meditatively rubbed his nose with the turkshead presently he grew conscious of a rusty figure on his left edging unsteadily a little nearer ow do mr mundy came a hoarse whisper and mother borndrunk a trifle less drunk than usual but careful to grasp a post leered a grimy leer and waved her disengaged hand in his face as one saluting a friend at a great distance uncle isaac emitted a noncommittal gruntone that might be taken for an accidental cough by the bystandersand sidled a foot or two away for he too had known emma pacey in her more decent days and with other acquaintances of that time was sometimes put to shifts to avoid her mother borndrunk left the post and followed her victim don run way she ejaculated unsteadily im ole pal mish mundy she thrust out a foul paw and dropped her voice coaxingly lensh twopence uncle isaac gazed uneasily in another direction and took more ground to the right the waiting passengers glad of a little amusement grinned one at another jyear mr mundy this in a loud voice with an imperious gesture jyear cantche answer when a lady speaks tye go on guvnor said a boy encouragingly sitting on a post wheres yer manners take auf yer at to the laidy and there was a snigger uncle isaac shifted farther still and put a group of men between himself and his persecutor but she was not to be so easily shaken off drawing herself up with a scornful majesty that was marred by an occasional lurch and the bobbing of the tangled bonnet hanging over one ear she came after uncle isaac through the passage readily made by the knot of men ho so its this is it she declaimed with a stately backward sweep of the arm if a lady asks a triflin favour you insult er ye low common scoundrel this very slowly with a deep tragedy hiss and a long pause then with a piercing note of appeal mr mundy i demand an answer once more will you lend me twopence the people a small crowd by this time forgot the troublesome bridge and turned to the new diversion give the laidy twopence roared the boy on the post in a deep bass arf a pint ud save er life uncle isaac looked desperately about him but he saw no sympathy dockmen workmen boysall were agog to see as much fun as possible in the time at disposal the pursuing harpy came a step nearer and bawled again will you lend me twopence no cried uncle isaac driven to bay at last no i wont go away go away youyou infamious creacher you wont no not by no means go away yought to be ashamed of yerself youyouyou opstroperous faggit calls isself a genleman she said lifting her gaze to the clouds calls isself a genleman an uses such language to a lady shockin said one in the hilarious crowd what a wicked ole bloke uncle isaac gave another unquiet glance about him and moved another yard the woman brought her eyes to earth again and wont gimme twopence she proclaimed an im a orficers widow never mind len me a penny ony a penny mr mundy do theresh a dear o you are a ole duck and mother borndrunk stumbled toward uncle isaac with affectionately extended arms the crowd shrieked with joy but uncle isaac turned and ran one hand clapped to the crown of his very tall hat he would wait for no bridge now but get away as best he could the boys yelled and whistled and kept up at an easy trot with the quick scuttle of his short legs behind them came mother borndrunk tripping and floundering spurred to infuriate chase by sight and sound of her unchanging enemies the boys and growing at every step more desirous of clawing at one of them than of catching uncle isaac as for him he dropped his hat once and nearly fell on it in looking behind so he thrust it under his arm as he scurried past the bend in the road and there despair seized him for now the other bridge was open too which escape might he make first at the end from which he had turned back a great liner was being towed through at a snails pace funnels and masts scarce seeming to move across the street but at this end a small coaster went out briskly and her mizzen was more than half over now the woman was less than twenty yards off but though she still staggered nearer she was engaged with boys uncle isaac put panic aside and resolved on dignity he took his hat from under his arm and began to brush it on his sleeve mother borndrunk was in the hands of her enemies though there were fewer than usual she swore and swiped at them and they flung and yelled and danced but they drew nearer uncle isaac for it was a new variation in the sport to involve an old gentleman with his sunday clothes on then shouted the woman breathlessly plice plice mish mundy ill give y in charge for annoyin me jear she came very near and made a catch at him which he dodged without regard to dignity mish mundy stand a dropjust a little drop for ole times if ye dont stand a drop ill give y in charge the coaster was through and soon the bridge would shut uncle isaac moved up toward the chain amid shouts and jibes yought to be ashamed o yerself bawled the woman a ole man like you annoyin a lady but the men were at the winch and the bridge swung first of all the impatient passengers uncle isaac sprang on the moving iron and got across at peril of life and limb ere the sections were still he heard a louder shout of laughter from behind where mother borndrunk forgetting the chain as she made for the bridge had sprawled over it where it hung low in the middle and he quickened his pace now it chanced that johnny may had been taken that week to his first outdoor job on a large steamer and full of the wonders of the ship he had made interest with the shippy who was officially called the shipkeeper to bring bessy on board on saturday afternoon the visit was a pure delight for both with more than a spice of danger for bessy in climbing gangways companions and greasy engineroom steps indeed the shippy carried her down the lower flights of these last johnny explained the prodigious engines with all the extreme technicality of a new hand and with much pride pointed out the part whereon he with the help of three or four journeymen had been at work bessy stared and marvelled and her admiration for her brother waxed into reverence for was he not an engineer master of these massy shining immensities so amazingly greater than any engines she had dreamed of so awful in their monstrous stillness bessy peeped along the tunnel of the great shaft and then a minute after up into the towering complexities above and she was almost afraidwould have been afraid to stay there alone they walked home gay and talkative and bessys face had a light and a colour that it had lacked since johnny and grandad had seen it together for she had seen great things and had walked in passenger saloons more wonderful than all her palaces of romance it struck johnny for the first time in his life that bessy was rather pretty and as to her lameness though some would call it a blemish as it certainly was a misfortune yet she carried it trimly and he almost thought it suited her and so they went till at a corner a hurried little man with a moonface ran into them hat firstfor he was brushing it again now both johnny and bessy wore their best clothes and both looked happy and well so at a glance uncle isaac guessed that things had gone aright at harbour lane after all just as distress troubled and repelled him so good fortune pleased his amiable genius and attracted his regards so though he was still a little flushed and uneasy he was glad of the encounter he had been unwell it seemed andand busy and all that but how was trade at the shop johnny and bessy told the tale of the new shipyard gate and of the cold bacon and the pickles and the new prosperity uncle isaac was greatly pleased he was sorry very sorry he said that he had not been able to call lately but he would delay no longerhe would be round that very evening and indeed he came and immensely approved of the bacon and he came again and approved immensely of the cheese and the pickles and whatever else there was for supper and again after that and usually carried something home for trial in the calmer mood of the morning and thus family ties were made whole and avuncular love continued jest to think uncle isaac would say with a wave of his fork what a quantity o blessins you owe to my advice nan what was my words o counsel to you prefarrotory enterprise sez i enterprise is what you want i sez theres alwis money in enterprise an whats the result enterprise representin biled ock o bacon is done the trick wonderful but in regards to enterprise why not call it am xvi with the spring the steady application of paint in harbour lane burst into a fury everywhere the houses and the flagstaffs and the fences took new coats of many colours changing as the season went and the paintpot traffic fell into a vaster confusion as tops were in among the boys the smell of paint grew day by day and when the marble season began little else could be smelt with july came fairlop friday and bessy wondered at the passing of a great model of a rigged ship on wheels drawn by horses and filled with jubilant shipwrights on their way to epping forest in accord with yearly custom she had grown to consider the forest as a place so far off though indeed she knew the distance in mere miles that it came almost as a surprise to see people starting out to drive there in a few hours with so slow a vehicle and to return the same night bob smallpiece had written once or twice he kept an eye on the empty cottage and looked out for a tenant but he had never made a visit as nan may had asked him the last news was that his bedridden old mother was worse and not expected to live the trade went wellbetter than ever indeed and scarce a month passed but nan may put a sovereign or two in the postoffice savings bank and uncle isaac began secretly to look upon the shop in harbour lane as a convenient retreat for his later years already he took as many meals there as possible for as he said he could get no proper attention in his new lodgings of his old friend mr butson he had seen nothing for months for butson he knew had lost his berth on the steamboat and had fallen on evil timesand uncle isaac never intruded on private griefs of this description but late in the year when the anniversary of johnnys apprenticeship was nearing and when johnny himself was near a head tallerfor he grew quickly nowuncle isaac saw butson from afar as he crossed the docks and butson saw him there was no escape but uncle isaac with a grin and a wave of the hand tried to pass on hurriedly as though urgent business claimed his time but mr butson rose from his bollardbollards had been his most familiar furniture for months nowand intercepted him youve ad about a year now to git that urry over he said with something not unlike a sneer if youre goin that way ill come along too got any bacca uncle isaac with a bounteous air that scarce covered his reluctance pulled out a screw of paper and mr butson filled his pipe for some little way he smoked in silence for tobacco was an uncommon luxury with him just now and he enjoyed a succession of puffs with no interruption then he said workin at turtons now no uncle isaac replied with a slight cough ino i aint workin there thought not looked out for y often an you moved too butson smoked again for a space and then went on ive ad a pretty awful year he said why i was very near goin stokin once or twice he had not quite gone because the chief engineer always sent him ashore nice thing that for a man o my bringinup they walked on truly the bad year had left its marks on mr butson the soles were threequarters gone from his boots and the uppers were cracked he wore a mixture of ordinary and working clothes frayed and greasy and torn and he shivered under a flimsy dungaree jacket buttoned so close to the neck as to hint an absence of shirt his bowler hat was weatherbeaten and cracked and the brim behind was beginning to leave the crown because of rainrot presently uncle isaac impelled to say something asked bin out all the time very near got a job on a draulic but the chap began jawin me about somethin i wasnt goin to stand that so i just walked out nothin else not much one or two things i got on to but they didnt last know the laundry over the cut well they took me on there to run the engine an sacked me in a week said i was asleep measly swine much the same at other places seemed to want to treat me likelike any common feller but i showed em different to that ah commented uncle isaac absently he was wondering which way to lead the walk and how to take leave of his companion but his invention was at a stand and presently the other went on well he said you aint got so much to say as you used know any job you can put me on to no i dont replied uncle isaac with gloomy simplicity trades badvery bad i bin workin short time meself an standin auf day after day stood auf today well then lend us a bob uncle isaac started and made the space between them a foot wider reely mr butson i all right make it two bob then if youd rather youve ad more n that out o me one time an another butbut i tell you im unfortnet meself i bin standin auf day after day seems to me youre tryin to stand auf as much as ye can now look ere mr butson stood and faced uncle isaac im broke clean broke an worse im ungry itsits very bad said uncle isaac but why not go t yer rich relations butson frowned never mind them he said id rather try an tap your small property what am i to do im at the end of me tether an ive tried everything ahenterprise is what you want uncle isaac said being at a loss what else to recommend enterprise ive recommended enterprise before with wonderful resultswonderful anan ow about marryin theres the lanlady at the mariners arms she was alwis very friendly an thats a life as ought to suit ye grrr mr butson turned his head with a growl and took to walking again uncle isaac by his side shed want to make a potman of me ananwell that aint much catch anyow if you wont lend me a bob stand me a feed o some sort aint ad yer tea ave ye plainly something must be sacrificed to butson and it struck uncle isaac that the cheapest article would be some of nan mays bacon so he said well i was thinkin o poppin round to my nieces to tea im sure shed make ye very welcome awright same niece as give us tea over in the forest that time yus shes round in arbour lane the lamplighter scuffled past into the thickening dusk leaving his sparse trail of lightspots along the dock wall the two men came through streets where little sittingrooms lighted as yet by fires alone cheered butson with promise of the meal to come and when at last he stood in nan mays shop now no place of empty boxes but ranged close with bacon cheese candles sausages brawn spiced beef many eggs and a multitude of sundries there was some shadow of the old strut and sulky swagger hanging oddly about the brokenup butson of these later days uncle isaac did it with an air for an air was an inexpensive embellishment that won him consideration goodevenin nan ive took the liberty which im sure youll call it a pleasure to introduce a of friend to tea which we well remember with appier circumstances mr butson is come to see you duller eyes than nan mays would have seen butsons fallen condition at a glance and it afflicted her to know that while fortune had favoured her it had stricken him so sorely she led them in offering butson a cordiality in some sort exaggerated by her anxiety not to seem to see his poor clothes nor to treat him a whit the worse for his illluck as for mr butson he found a good fire and a clean hearth with an armchair beside it in a better room than he had seen for long old mr mays photograph hung over the mantelpiece and below it was the sole remaining butterfly trophy a small glass case set when the old man was young the ragged books that were bessys solace stood on a sideboard top and bessy herself disturbed in reading was putting one of them carefully in its place the kettle sang on the hob and when johnny came from work he was astonished to find a teaparty of great animation johnny was a big lad now though he was scarce sixteen years of age and mr butson condescended to shake hands with him to condole with him on the choice of the wretched trade that had so ill supported himself and to exchange a remark or two on the engineering topics of the week but chiefly mr butson attended to the meal nan may had never seen two men together eat such a meal as his plainly he was famished she was full of pity for this unfortunate so well brought up thought the simple soul so cruelly neglected by his welltodo relations she cut more slices of bacon and more and still more of bread and butter quietly placing them to his hand till at last he was satisfied mr butson was refreshed filled his pipe again from uncle isaacs paper and gave some attention to the conversation but the conversation took to itself the property of rarely travelling far from mr butson and his troubles he had no false modesty about them he had parted with almost all his clothes and hadnt a shirt to his back his tools were in pawn and a man felt discouraged from looking for a job when his tools were put away and he had no money to redeem them but he would starve sooner than apply to his unnatural relations he would take the help of strangers first when at last mr butson took leave and went shivering into the gusty night uncle isaac was careful to let him go alone and to remain himself in the shop parlour till his friend was clear away but nan may ran down the street after her departed guest there were a few hurried words of entreaty in the womans voice here mr butson do you really mustand she scurried back breathless and a trifle shamefaced she reached across the counter and shut the till ere she came into the shop parlour uncle isaac iooked up sharply in her face as she entered but went on with his pipe xvii this visit was but the first of many from mr butson until after a very few months he came as regularly as uncle isaac himself he recovered his old appearance a little at a time one new article of clothing coming after another but he seemed to have no luck in his quest for a jobor very little what small success he found was ever brought to naught by the captiousnesseven the rudenessof those in direction or their unreasonable exactions in the way of work to simple nan may he seemed the most shamefully illused of exemplars johnny and bessy were less enthusiastic bessy said nothing but avoided mr butson as much as possible sitting in the shop when he was in the back parlour johnny went for walks in the evening and grumbled wondering why his mother encouraged this strangercadging suppers as he uncivilly put it nan may was hurt at the expression and feared that the workshop was spoiling johnnys manners news came from bob smallpiece that his poor old mother was dead at last and buried in the high churchyard where johnnys grandfather lay also that bob would come to london now for a visit at the first opportunity now it was a fact that bob smallpiece for a year or two had been inclined to marry though it was a thing he might never have thought of if he had seen less of mrs may but he was a man of practical temperament making up in his commonsense for a great lack of agility of mind there were certain obstacles he sawobstacles that must remove of themselves or not at all first his old mother it would not seem fair to bring a wife to nurse a bedridden old womanat anyrate it was scarce an attraction more the old woman herself had a dread of it she feared the chance of being thought a burden by a newcomer and would often beg bob not to marry till she were gone sometimes with the assurance that she would not be long now thento say nothing of old mr maythere had been the children who familiar as he was with them afflicted him in this particular matter alone with an odd shyness again when the old man died the may family must needs come to london if only that johnny might go to his trade while bob smallpiece must stay at the forest but he was ever patient and philosophical now that some difficulties were gone another arose nan may all unaware of his slow designs was settled in london with ties of business but perhaps after all the business was not flourishingmight be a burden better laid down and as to johnnyhe was earning wages of some sort now and at most his apprenticeship would be out when he was twentyone bob smallpiece had reserved one piece of news till he could deliver it in person this was that at last he had let the cottage at threeandsixpence a week to a decent woodman and his wife and so wearing a new neckcloth and with three weeks rent in his pocket bob smallpiece appeared in harbour lane one spring morning a vast astonishment of leather and velveteen such as had never before brought a blackwall housewife to attention in the midst of her dusting and sweeping no name was painted over the shop but no stranger could pass its red and blue and green without stopping to look least of all bob smallpiece in quest of the place itself nan may saw him and ran to the door and bessy with her crutch and her book met him halfway to the backparlour gay and laughing bob regarded the wellfilled shop the neat room with some mixture of feelings prosperity was excellent in its own way but it made the new obstacle more formidable further mrs may though she was pleased to hear that the cottage was let and grateful enough for his trouble in letting it was not so overjoyed as she might have been if the weekly threeandsixpence had come at a time of pinching more she handled the halfsovereign almost as disrespectfully as the sixpence and dropped it into a part of her purse where it fell among other gold poor bob saw the obstacle not only bigger but double not merely was nan may tied to london by her trade and by johnnys apprenticeship but she was a welltodo tradeswoman with whom a poor forestkeeper could expect no more than respectful acquaintance he half feared she might even offer to pay him for his trouble with the cottage and grew red and hot with the apprehension but this affliction was spared him though nan did venture to ask if his care of her property had involved outofpocket expenses a suggestion which bob repudiated desperately neither bessy nor her mother could understand why their visitors manner was so constrained and awkward nor why he announced that he must be going after sitting for twenty minutes but that of course was not to be allowed johnny would be home in half an hour and there would be some dinner so bob smallpiece who wanted to get away somewhere by himself and think things over remained and made his part of the conversation as well as he could johnny came smudgy and hungry surprised to find that his old friend big man as he was seemed to be scarcely so big as when he saw him last eighteen months ago for johnny himself was grown surprisingly and seemed like to stand as high as bob smallpieces shoulder by his seventeenth birthday bob found more to talk of now that johnny had come and he ate even better than johnny himself for nothing spoiled the keepers appetite when could they all come to the forest again for a day nan may shook her head she had no days free but sundaysshe might come some day perhaps some sunday in the vague future but johnny might get a day off at a slack time and he and bessy would come bessy brimmed over with delight at the prospect every day since she had left it the forest had seemed a more wonderful and a more distant dream every day some forgotten circumstance some moment of delight some longdead bunch of wildflowers trifles all and daily commonplaces once had come back to lend one more touch to the fairy picture her memory made ever more radiant as the simple facts fell farther into the past and johnny little burdened with pictures of fancy for he put his imagination away from him now as a childishness unworthy an engineer nevertheless thought that as soon as a certain large job was completed at maidment and hursts the gaffer would doubtless let him lose a day so it was settled and when johnny hurried off to his work bob smallpiece took the opportunity to leave too for he must go and see his sister he said he went and saw his sister and took tea with her and his sister found him even duller than nan may had done for in truth bob smallpiece was in a mire of doubt and hesitation in a frame of mind so foreign to his simple habit he grew fretful and left things to chance and impulse with no definite design in the world he wandered back to harbour lane after tea and there met for the first time uncle isaac and mr butson this company proved uncongenial and indeed the distinguished butson was indisposed to be cordial with an essex bumpkin in a velveteen uniform so though nan may was all kindness bob smallpiece soon took himself off to the train where his savage moodiness might not be seen the whole thing was past hope now though he might have found it hard to tell precisely what had occurred since midday to worsen the look of affairs xviii not for six weeks at least johnny judged could he beg the days holiday that was to take him and bessy back to the forest and it might be more that would be in julyor even augustand probably the weather would be more trustworthy then as for bessy she counted the days on the almanack and tapped the yellowfaced old barometer that had been grandads a dozen times a day johnny laughed at her impatience and invented endless weather prophecies just from america putting the weather for the whole of july at every possible shade of unpleasantness from blizzards to floods and thunderstorms the days went quietlythey were even dull mr butson did what he could to make himself agreeable and several times praised a set of callipers that johnny had madea set of callipers that johnny in fact thought very well of himself so that he seemed not such a bad fellow perhaps after all though a bit of a sponge there was nothing to cause it to all seeming but it was a fact that just now nan may grew thoughtful and absent of manner she would pause in the midst of needlework as though to think and more than once at such a time bessy looking up from her own work saw that her mothers troubled gaze was fixed on herself nan may put away the anxious look as well as she might and bent to her work again but bessy wondered johnny too fancied that his mother was scarce so cheerful as was her wont though he thought of it less than bessy but one sunday afternoon meeting her by her bedroom door he took her cheeks between his palms and looked hard in her face mother he said i believe youve been crying whats up she put a hand on each of his wrists and made a shift to smile thats nonsense she said and tried to pull his hands down youre gettin too strong for your poor old mother to keep you in order but she brightened always when mr butson came in the evening though mr butsons conversation scarce seemed of so inspiriting a character as to account wholly for the change still it interested her it was mostly about his grievances at the hands of the world and nan may was a ready sympathiser it was very near to the day at last fixed for the excursion when bessy woke in the night at the striking of a match her mother was lighting a candle her back toward the bed she took the candle and passed out into johnnys room at the back bessy listened but she heard no talk heard nothing indeed but johnnys heavy breathing so still was the night presently her mother returned and stood over her still with the candle gazing on her face it seemed to bessyas well as she could see through her halfclosed eyesmuch as she had gazed when she paused in her needlework though now her cheeks were wet with tears with that bessy opened wide her eyes and mother she said whats the matter are you ill nan may turned and blew out the light no bess no im all right she said and crept into bed its notnot much i woke up thats allwith a bad dream she kissed the girl and put her arm about her neck youve always been a good girl bessy she went on you wouldnt turn against me would you why no mother but not whatever happened noof course not she kissed her mother again but why its nothing only the dreamjust the dream bess go to sleep xix the longedfor holiday came with a fine monday morning and bessy in a muslin frock that her mother had helped to make for the occasion was impatient an hour too soon because johnny lingered in bed enjoying the luxury of losing a quarter without paying the penalty but johnny was ready for breakfast before eight and seeing the shopdoor open ran to take down the shutters a thing his mother commonly did herself because of his absence at work i always put em up and for once ill take em down he said prancing in with the first look out mother or ill bowl you over o no johnny she said leave em ill only have to and at that she stopped only have to what johnny asked going for another only have to serve the customers eh cause the shops open of course you willit aint your holiday you knowits ours look out again shoo bessy rattled at the old barometer still though for half an hour it had refused to move its hand a shade and she asked johnny for the fiftieth time if he were perfectly sure that the proper train wasnt earlier than they were supposing and when at last johnny admitted that it was time to start nan may kissed them and bade them goodbye with so wistful an earnestness that johnny was moved to pleasantry all right mother he said were coming back some day you know they were scarce halfway to the railwaystation when bessy said johnny i dont think mothers been very well lately therell be another train soon shall we go back anan just see if shes all right first johnny laughed thats a good idea he said an then i spose wed better miss the next an go back to see how shes getting on then an the one after that eh mothers all right shes been thinking a bit aboutyou know grandad an all that and because were goin to the forest it reminds her of it come ondont begin the day with dumps there was interest for both of them in the railway journey they changed trains at stepney and after a station or two more came in distant sight of a part of the road they had traversed on banks cart when they came to london two winters back there was the great low desolate wilderness treeless and void of any green thing seen now from nearer the midst with the road bounding it in the distance and here was the chemical manurefactory close at hand this time with its stink at shorthitting range so that every window in the train went up with a bang and everybody in the long thirdclass carriage coughed or grimaced or spat or swore according to sex and habit then out beyond stratford through leyton and leytonstone they saw that the town had grown much in twenty months and was still growing close regular streets of little houses all of one pattern stared in raw brick or rose with a forlorn air of crumbling sponginess amid sparse sticks of scaffolding bessy wondered how the butterflies were faring in the forest and how much farther they had been driven since she left it then the wide country began to spin past and pleasant single houses and patches of wood the hills about chigwell stood bright and green across the roding valley as the low ground ran away between and the high forest land came up at the other side of the line till the train stood in loughton station through the village bessy flushed and eager stumped and swung at a pace that kept johnny walking his best staple hill was the nearest corner of the forest and for staple hill they made direct once past the streetend it rose before them round and gay deep and green in the wood that clothed it boys were fishing in the pond at its foot and the stream ran merrily under the dusty road come johnny bessy cried straight over the hill nor did she check her pace till the wide boughs shaded them and her crutch went softly on the mossy earth among old leaves then she stood and laughed aloud and was near crying smell it johnny she cried smell it isnt it heavenly they went up the slope across tiny glades and between thick clumps of undergrowth gay with dogroses bessys eyes and ears alert for everything tree bird or flower now spying out some noisy jay that upbraided their intrusion now standing to hark for a distant woodpecker johnny enjoyed the walk too but with a soberer delight as became an engineer taking a days relaxation amid the scenes of childish play now half forgotten down the other side of the hill they went and over the winding stream at the bottom truly it seemed a tiny stream now and johnny wondered that he should ever have been proud of jumping it he found a bend where the water rushed through a narrow channel by the side of a bed of cleanwashed gravel and got bess across though she scrambled down and up with little help such was her enthusiasm then the trees grew sparser and over the deepgrown flat of debden slade bessy stopped again and again to recognise some wellremembered wildflower and little brown butterflies skimmed over the rushes and tall grass the sun mounted higher and everything was brisk and bright and sweetsmelling brother and sister climbed the hill before them slowly often staying to look back over the great prospect of rolling woodland ever widening as they rose till at last they stood at the point of the ridge in the gap through the earthwork made by ancient britons this beyond all others was the spot that bessy had loved best this ragged ring of crumbling rampart and ditch grown thick with fantastic hornbeams pollarded out of all common shape its inner space a crowded wonder of tall bracken with rare patches of heather its outer angles watching over the silent woods below and dominating the hills that ranked beyond this was the place where best an old book from the shelf would fill a sunny afternoon for the camp was a romance in itself a romance of closer presence than anything printed on paper here two thousand years ago the longhaired savages had stood in real fact with spears and axes brandishing defiance to foes on the hillside here they had entrenched themselves against the roman legionsthey and their chief fierce cassivellaunus more to her than a name in an old historybook for had not she seen the wild prince a hundred times in her daydreams stalking under the oakswith the sheeted druids till the wood grew alive with phantoms and she hid her face in her book and now she sat here again in the green shade and looked out over the thousand treetops merry with the sunlight how long had she left it all what was that fancy of a ride to london of shipyards and of a chandlersshop but johnny whistled to a robin on a twig and she turned and looked at him to see that here was the engineer indeed and the painter of the chandlersshop still which was the dream that or this left alone bessy would have sat here all the day but there were other places not to be forgotten as johnny reminded her over the heather they went then to monk wood where the trees were greater and the flowers were more abundant than anywhere else in the forest and they did not leave it till johnny insisted on dinner now this dinner was a great excitement for at setting out johnny had repelled every suggestion of sandwiches in a bag and now dauntlessly marched into an inn on the main road and ordered whatever was ready with two glasses of beer bessy overwhelmed by the audacity of the act nevertheless preserved her appetite and even drank a little of the beer and the adventure cost johnny four shillings mothers having her dinner alone said bessy in a flutter of timid delight she doesnt guess were having ours at the red deer hence it was not far by the lanes to the high churchyard for the flowers gathered in monk wood were for grandads grave and it was a duty of the day to mark the condition of the little headstone all was well with it and it surprised them to find the grass cut neatly and a little clump of pansies growing on the mound bessy suspected bob smallpiece and so went a perfect day their tea they took in bob smallpieces lodge the keeper admitted having gone over old mr mays grave with the grass shearsjust once or twice he avoided making any definite reply to johnnys and bessys invitations to come to harbour lane again perhaps hed come again he said some day meanwhile had they seen the cottage as they had not they set out all three together and looked at it the new tenancy had made little change down the glen the white walls first peeped from among the trunks and then the red tiles just as ever the woodman was at work mending the old fenceit was always being mended somewhere the turbulent little garden still tumbled and surged against it threatening to lay it flat at any moment very naturally the woodman and his wife though perfectly civil took less personal interest in johnny and bessy than johnny and bessy took in them and the cottage so that it was not long ere a last look was taken at the old fence and bob smallpiece went off another way on his walk of duty shadows grew long and thickets dark to revisit every remembered nook had been impossible but they had seen and lingered in all them that had most delighted bessy in old timesall but wormleyton pits johnny had turned that way once thoughtlessly but no bessy saidalmost whisperedwith her hand on his arm not that way johnny and now they turned their backs on the fast darkening forest and took a steep lane for the village below the sweet smells that go up at the first blink of the evening star met them on the breeze and when they turned for their last look toward the woods the trees on the hilltop tall sentinels of the host beyond barred the red west and nodded them and the sun goodbye out of the stony lane loughton was lighted and at the end of a dusty road was a small constellation of gaslamps and railway signals now it was plain that both were a little tiredbessy perhaps more than a little but the train gave a welcome rest and there were no passengers to see even if she slept for they were alone in their compartment they had passed two stations when johnny who had been standing to look out at the opposite window turned and saw that his sister was dozing with her head bent forward and her face hidden by the crutchhandle it was so wholly her figure as she sat in the cab at the old mans funeral that johnny started and sat where he stood though he had never once called the thing to mind since that day and he took the crutch gently away to look at her face but it was calm and untroubled and he put his hand at the farther side of it and pressed it to his shoulder for plainly she was tired out and there were no cushions in the carriage it was nearing ten oclock when at last they turned into harbour lane from a back street came the old watchmans cry paaast nine oclock as he went his round in search of orders to wake early risers and lights in bedroom windows told of early risers already seeking sleep nobody was in the shop but as they came in johnny thought he saw his mothers face vanish from beside the muslin curtain that obscured the glass in the backparlour door they passed through the shop and into the back parlour their mother and mr butson sat facing them side by side mr butson had a new suit of clothes and their mother wore her best and smiles and tears were in her face something had happened what was it bessy and johnny scarce within the door stood and stared johnnybessy nan faltered looking from one to the other have youenjoyed your holiday wont youkiss me johnny she rose and made a step toward them but something struck them still and they looked wondering from nan to butson and back to their mother again what was it johnny moved first and kissed his mother absently gazing at mr butson the while mr butson who was smoking said nothing but lay back in his chair and considered the ash of his cigar nans anxiety was plain to see she put a hand on johnnys shoulder and an arm on bessys neck iweyou wont be vexed because i didnt tell you will you she said pale but trying to smile iwemr butson johnny bessydont look so tears ran down her cheeks and she bent her head on johnnys other shoulder weve been married today xx the shock left johnny and bessy numb and though bessy was quicker the change took johnny two or three days to realiseeven to understand his first distinct impression was one of injury and resentment he had been trickedhoodwinked his mothereven his mother had deceived him and bessy why why not tell them first she would have told them he was sure she told them everything butson had persuaded her to keep them in ignorance till the thing was done lest they should rebel and perhaps bring her to a change of mood and johnnys guess was a good one forthwith his resentment became something more hate mere hate for this man who had come between him and his motherthis cadger of suppers thrusting himself into their intimate life and yetperhaps this was simple anger at the slight and the deception jealousy at finding a stranger as dear to his mother as himself was butson might turn out none so bad a fellow he was very decent over the callipers for instance curse the callipers johnnys anger was not to be reasoned down on sunday he had his own mother now there was nothing but butsons wife more the man was his fatherhis stepfather chief authority in the house with respect and obedience due to him that seemed intolerable for a moment johnny had mad notions of leaving home altogether and shifting for himselfgoing aboard ship abroad anywhere but that would be to leave bess aloneand his mother his mother might need him yet he told long hicks as they tramped to work over the locks and bridges in the bright morning early and still and it surprised him to see hickss tacit concern at the news the long man reddened and stuttered and checked himself suddenly at an imminent outburst of speech but that was all he offered no opinion and made no remark and as he was given to suppressed excitement on small occasion johnny presently forgot it as for bessy her distress quiet as it was was beyond telling her association with her mother had been so intimate that this change was stark bereavement and for butson and his coarse pretence her feeling was sheer repulsion neither boy nor girl had the habit of dissimulation and though they said little it needed small discernment to guess something of their sentiments poor nan was dismayed to perceive that they did not take to butson instant on the news of the novel relationship indeed it perplexed her for in her simple view he was a resplendent person of finer mould sore hit by a cruel world and entitled to the respectful sympathy at least and coldest of the merest stranger more nobody could be more completely devoted than he to the interests of johnny and bessy he had most vehemently assured her of it again and again but after all the thing was sudden they must realise his true worth soon though meantime she was distressed extremely butson saw plainly enough but for the present cared not at all he had won his game and for a little time unwonted plenty and comfort satisfied him though he was not insensible that this was a place wherein he must do something more to make himself absolute master uncle isaac got the news on tuesday evening when he came for supper for a week or ten days he had been little seen at harbour lane because of an urgent job involving overtime a thing not to be neglected in these lean years he had suspected nothing moreover supposing butson to be so often attracted to nans by the mere prospect of supper now when he was told he was near as astonished as johnny had been he sat at randomfortunately on a chairand opened mouth and eyes but ere his mouth closed he had resolved on his own course the thing was done and past undoing he sprang to his feet and seized one of butsons handsthe nearestin both his own mr butson he said butson me ole friend eneryme dearest opes an wishes is rewarded nan youre done most dootiful the confidentialest o my intentions for what was my confidential intentions ere i says confidential to meself ere is my niece a young woman as i wish every possible good fortun to though i sez it meself a very sootable young woman o some little property with two children an a business two children an a business was my reflection whats more eres my very respected friend butsonthan which none more sofashnable by abit an connexions with no

else is nessry yus ill do it sez i as is my dooty ill work it if its mortal possible whether grateful or not ill do it an i done it uncle isaac punched his left palm with his right fist and looked from husband to wife with the eye of the righteous defying censure nan flushed and smiled and indeed she was relieved no consideration of her unaccustomed secrecy had given her more doubt than that it must shut her off from uncle isaacs advice loss enough in itself and probably an offence to him this uncle isaac went on taking his chair once more and drawing it up to the table this is a great an appy occasion an as sich it should be kep up nan is there sich a thing as a drop o sperrits in the ouse there was most of a small jar of whiskythe first purchase mr butson had caused on his change of condition it was brought with tumblers and uncle isaac celebrated the occasion with full honours and much fragmentary declamation he drank the health of bride and bridegroom first separately and then together he drank the health of the family completed and adorned by the addition of butson he drank success to the shop long life to all the parties concerned happiness to each of them and a certain forgetfulness ensuing he began his toastlist afresh in conscientious precaution lest something had been omitted see there bess see there me gal he exclaimed with some thickness of utterance turning to bessy whose one desire was to remain unnoticed and making a semicircular swing of the arm in butsons direction yer father noo sstepfather local prentis as a cripple an a burden its your dooty to be

shillun don speck an bey whash good ccatechism eh uncle isaacs voice grew loud and fierce whash become ccatechishm i say nullavoid cachishms nullavoid here pausing to look round at mr and mrs butson he lost his argument altogether and stared owlishly at the wall owsomedever the casion bein the state an pediment o oly matrimony cordin to confidential tentions nothin remains but ashk you all join me n drinkinddrinkinererlil drop more uncle isaac subsided with his face on the table and his eyes closed so that it grew necessary for mr butson to shake him and bring him to a perpendicular whereupon being duly invested with his hat he was safely set in his way on the narrow pavement of harbour lane xxi twice or thrice more uncle isaac came to supper though he was dimly aware that his visits were in some way less successful than had been their wont insomuch that he took nothing home with him for breakfast nor even went so far as to hint his desire in butsons presence for butson welcomed him not at all and his manner grew shorter at each meeting and this with full intent because mr butson perceived that as first step toward being master in his own house he must get rid of uncle isaac mere curtness of mannereven gruffnesswould never drive uncle isaac from his prey it operated only to make him more voluble more strenuously blandiloquent till one evening after supper as he lay back in his chair sucking noisily at lips and teeth he resolved to venture a step in the matter of the lapsed grants in aid of breakfast johnny and bessy were out of the house they went out more often now nan was serving in the shop and mr butson sat with his back partly turned and smoked in uncivil silence ah quoth uncle isaac with a sideglance at his ungracious host thats a uncommon nice tin o spiced beef we just ad a cut auf uncommon mr butson made no answer its a great credit to your business instinks that tin o spiced beef i almost wish i ad took another slice or so now as a fact uncle isaac had not been offered a further helpingperhaps because he had already taken three i almost wish i ad never mind itll do another time come now ive alf a mind to get nan to wrop it up for my breakfast the suggestion was made as of a novel and striking idea but mr butson showed no flash of enthusiasm he swung his chair slowly round on one leg till he faced uncle isaac then he put his cigar carefully on the mantelpiece and saidlook ere mr mundy the sudden severity of the voice drew uncle isaacs eyes from the ceiling and his feet from under the table simultaneously look ere mr mundy youre bin so very kind as to celebrate this ere weddin o mine with four good eavy suppers an about a pint o whisky at my expense im very grateful for that an i wont trouble you no more see this is the end o the celebration im goin to eat my supper in future me an my wife without your assistance an breakfast too understand uncle isaacs feet retreated under his chair and his eyes advanced to an alarming protrusion see what i mean butson went on with growing offence in his voice jest you buy yer own suppers an eat em at ome or else go without speech was denied uncle isaac he blinked and choked what did it mean was it a dream was he uncle isaac respected and deferred to the man of judgment and influence and was he told thus outrageously to buy his own supper yus said butson as though in answer to his thoughts i mean it whereat uncle isaac with a gasp and a roll of the eyes found his tongue mr butson he said in a voice of dignified but grieved surprise mr butson ii think i must a eard wrong otherwise i might put it as you may be sorry for sich words praps remarked butson cynically laconic in which case replied uncle isaac the adroit it is freely took as auffered an nothin more need be said atween of friends after sich ansome apologies give an took and reconciliation resooms its armony accordin butson glared grrr he growled apologies what i say i mean youve done very well at cheap suppers an what not ere and tonight youve ad yer last im master ere now an you can git out as soon as ye like what git out yought to be ashamed o yourself cried the disinterested butson indignantly comin cadgin suppers git out me suppers why enery butson i brought you ere out o the gutter out o the gutter an fed ye aha lot you fed me and mighty anxious to do it wasnt ye you clear out o ere o ill go an ill see about countermandin a paper or two fore i go to bed too an my small property yer small property put in butson with slow scorn yer small property where is it what is it want to know my opinion o you youre a old umbug thats what you are a old umbug uncle isaac grew furious and purple umbug he said umbug them words to me as saved ye from starvation umbug yerself you an yer connexions an mayors an what not why ye dunno yer own trade i wouldnt trust ye to grind a cawfymill with that the shopdoor opened and nan stood between them she had heard high voices and at the first cessation of custom she came to see uncle henry what is it she asked with alarm in her face this is what it is said butson now near as purple as uncle isaac this ere uncle o yours mrs butson or whatever e is aint comin ere cadgin is grub any more not so long as i got a say in it e aint see so now you better say goodbye to im if ye want to cos es goin quick o yus said uncle isaac speaking to

whatevers the matter i know youve always been very good henry whats it all about about puttin a end to this ere bloodsuckin thats all bloodsuckin exclaimed uncle isaac yus you know somethin about that pity ye dont know yer trade alf as well then praps youd earn yer livin stead o spongin on people an deloodin a fool of a woman to keep ye lazy go on go on commanded butson with increasing wrath no uncle stop a minute entreated poor nan dont henry dont lets quarrel go on o yus ill go praps youd like to call the plice butson caught breath at the word and something crossed his face like a chance reflection from a white screen but he repeated go on with a gesture toward the door yus yus said uncle isaac with his hat on his head im goin an not sorry neither ho youre a bright sort for a local prentis you are uncle isaac may have been at odds with the phrase in loco parentis a uncommon neat pattern and he walked out into the dark street a small model of offended dignity o henry cried nan in tears what have you done ive done answered butson reaching for his cigar jist what i meant to do thats all cos it suited me see nan felt the coarse overbearance of his stare and dropped her gaze beneath it and with that misgiving fell upon her the shadow her punishment flung before it xxii mr henry butson had fallen on good fortune no more would he endure the humiliation of begging a job of an unsympathetic gaffer in future his life would be one of ease free from ignoble exertion and unshamed by dungaree overalls and he made it so for a little while his wife seemed to indulge in an absurd expectation that he would resume his search for occupation of one sort or another once she even hinted it but he soon demolished that fancy and in terms that prevented any more hints he had little patience with such foolishness indeed the matter was simple enough why did a man work merely to get shelter and food and clothes and comfort and hairoil whatever he wanted to drink and smoke and his necessary pocketmoney a man who could get these things without working would be a fool to work more he would behave inhumanly to his fellow man by excluding him from a job as for himself he got what he needed easily enough without the trouble of even taking down the shopshutters a vulgar act repellent to his nature so he rose at ten or eleven or twelve as the case might be and donned fine raiment the most fashionable suit procurable from the most fashionable shop in aldgate he began at aldgate but in time he grew more fastidious and went to a tailor in leadenhall street a tailor whose daily task was to satisfy the tastes of the most particular among the shipbrokers clerks of st mary axe his toilet complete his curls well oiled mr butson descended to a breakfast of solitary statenans had been hurried over hours ago the rest of the day was given as occasion prompted when the weather was fine nothing pleased him better nor more excellently agreed with his genteel propensities than to go for a stroll up west when harbour lane was quiet and empty he seemed to choose such times for going out he would slip round to the station and by train and omnibus gain the happy region he was careful to take with him enough money to secure some share of the polite gratifications proper to the quarter and minutely acquainted himself with the manners and customs of all the bars in the strand and about piccadilly circus and although he was a little astonished when first he was charged eighteenpence for an american drink he was careful not to show it and afterwards secretly congratulated himself on the refined instinct that had pitched on so princely a beverage in the dark so to speak he took air too in hyde park to the great honour of his whiskers and much improved his manner of leaning on a rail and of sitting in a green chair in the evening he tried perhaps a music hall but always some of the bars and arrived home at night rather late sometimes a trifle unsteady and usually in a bad temper bad temper was natural indeed in the circumstances after so many hours indulgence in the delights of fashionable society it revolted his elegant nature to have to return at last to a vulgar little chandlersshop in a riverside street where a wife in a print bodice and a white apron was sitting up for him sometimes even cryingfor nothing at allas if the circumstances were not depressing enough for him already these little excursions cost money of course but then what was the good of keeping an ignoble little shop if you couldnt get money out of it and the shop did very well mrs butson and the girlthe cripplewere boiling bacon the smell was disgusting all day long and they sold it as fast as it was cold and other things sold excellently too from the time when she took the shutters down in the morning to the time when the lad johnny put them up at night mrs butson was unceasingly at work servingunless she were boilingand scarce had five minutes for her meals and often the girl had to leave the bacon and help in the shop too very wellall that meant profit the woman couldnt make him believe that it didnt merely because the wretched details of trade failed to interest him that was the way of people in that class of lifethere was a touch of the miser about all of them no matter how the money came in they persisted in their narrow views as to spending it and there was other income in addition the lad johnnyhe was almost a man to look atbrought his mother eight shillings a week at the time of the wedding and then ten shillings and then twelve more it would increase two shillings a year but in truth his mother was unduly extravagant in buying him clothes still at anyrate there was something and there might be more if only mrs butson would turn the girl out to earn a little instead of letting her waste her time reading and confirming her in habits of idleness and there was the rent from the cottage this came every week by postal order from bob smallpiece and since it was fitting that a husband should open letters sent his wife by a single man mr butson cashed the orders without troubling her in the matter at all so that indeed he was not at all wasteful considering both his income and the society he moved infor he was not slow in making acquaintances among the affable gentility of the bars in fact he would have done it cheaper still but for the pestilent uncertainty of spring handicaps it would seem impossible for him to put half a sovereign on any horse without dooming it to something very near the last place the distinguished society of the bars was profoundly astonished indeed distressed at his illluck but gave him more excellent information for future events information however that brought even worse luck with it his wife showed no sympathy for his troublesand of course there are vexations and disappointments such as those of the spring handicaps which are inseparable from fashionable lifebut rather aggravated them with holeandcorner snivelling and ridiculous attempts at persuading him to a mean and inglorious way of life she even hinted vulgar suspicion of his westend friends and suggested that he should associate with a long fool called hicks living next doora common working man for a long timemany months in facthe bore it with what patience he might retaliating only in such terms as seemed necessary to close her mouth and to convince her of his contempt for her low habit of mind and indeed for herself and when at last it grew plain that personal punching was what was needed he was so considerate as not to punch her about the face where marks would advertise the state of his domestic affairs careful also to operate not other than quietly when they were alone on the same grounds of decency and he knew that she would tell nobody for at least she had selfrespect enough for that of these things johnny knew nothing and bessy only a little both were glad that their stepfather was so much from home and though johnnys sentiment toward him was a mere sullen contempt the lad made no parade of the factrather aimed indeed at keeping things quiet for his mothers sake but bessy fretted in secret xxiii johnnys months went uneventfully at maidment and hursts he applied himself zealously to his tradethe more because home was a dull place nowand he was as smart a lad as any in the shop of his age or perhaps of a few months older he could turn back an eyelid too and whip away an iron filing or a speck of emery grit with such address and certainty as might astonish a surgeon the operation was one that every engineers apprentice grew apt at and exceptional dexterity like johnnys was a matter of pride a distinction zealously striven for an accomplishment to exercise at every opportunity johnny felt that he had passed with honours on the memorable day when cottam the gaffer roared to him from the other end of the shop to come and attend to his eye afflicted with a sharp grain of brass nonot you quoth mr cottam in answer to instant offers of help from those hard by this erell stick like a nail in a barn door wheres young may dyear wheres young jack may much of his practical knowledge johnny owed to long hicks that recluse whose sole friend hitherto had been his accordion now declared for a second hobby which was to turn johnny into the best workman at maidment and hursts before his time was out youve got all the chances said long hicks youre servin yer time on small workalwis best for trainin a firstrate man im reckoned a good fitter but i served time mostly on big work or id a bin better he recommended johnny to qualify as a marine engineer when his apprenticeship was over even if he intended to live a shore life you get yer ctificates an then youre all right he would say an the better ctificates you get the better youll do afloat or ashore so as soon as your times out off you go an serve your year at sea as fourth or fifth of a good boat if you can get the job the restll be easy as winkin to a quick young chap like you you can draw nice an neati can put a thing down accrate enough but i cant draw it neatand what with one thing an another i blieve you could pass your second now i ought to a done it praps but i lose me ed at anythin like a xamination an i never ad overmuch schoolin them compound multiplications ud ave me over evry time i spose you dont think nothin of a compound multiplication johnny admitted that he had gone a long way beyond that rule of arithmetic yus hicks answered ive got beyond it too teachin meself i know ow to do em well enough but lord what a strain they are tons undredweights quarters pounds ounces an grains an multiply em by five undred an twentyseven thousan six undred an eightythree there aint no end to a job like that an yer brain on the stretch all the time cos a tick outll make it about a million tons wrong in the end it ud send me foamin mad at a xamination an all with a chap waitin for the sum phew and long hickss forehead went clammy at the fancy but there he proceeded youre all right youll knock auf your seconds examination easy as marbles an then youll do yer chiefs an extry chiefs all in one an then youll do the board o trade an be a guarantee chief or anythin ye like you will by george and the lank man gazed in johnnys face johnny was sitting on hickss bed with much respect and admiration being fully persuaded in the enthusiasm of the moment that the lad had already as good as achieved the triumphs he prophesied but there was work to do and johnny did it mechanical drawing when its novelty had worn off was less delightful than the fancyfree draughtsmanship he had practised as a schoolboy and it had an arid twang of decimals and vulgar fractions still for a time there was a charm in the gradual unfolding of the inner principles of his work and in the disclosure piece by piece of the cunning complication that stood ministrant on the main simplicity of a great steam engine till the beauty of the thing in its completeness came in sight with something of surprise in it though this too grew a commonplace as familiarity cheapened it and then his work was work merely and so it went till half the time of his apprenticeship was over and he was eighteen and a sinewy young fellow sometimes he drew at home and sometimes in hickss room hicks had a few bookseditions a little out of date some of them but all usefuland these were at johnnys service seatons manual reeds handbook donaldsons drawing and rough sketching and the like hickss room was inconvenient for drawing but nothing would tempt hicks next door and once or twice mr butson had come home when johnnys drawingboard and implements littered the table in the shopparlour and made objections my eye exclaimed hicks one evening in face of a crankshaft elevation and sections as johnny held it up on the board why thats a drawin good enough to put in a frame i tell ye what me lad with a bit more practice an a bit o the reglar professional touch youll be good enough for a draughtsmans job lord youll be a master some day an ill come an get a job of you look ere no more o this gropin about alone round you go to the institute an chip into the mechanical drawin class thats your game theyll put you up to the reglar drawinauffice capers thus urged johnny went to the institute this was an evening school founded by a shipbuilder twenty years earlier here a few lads earnest as johnny came to work and to learn and a great many more differently disposed came to dabble there was a gymnasium too and a cricketclub and plenty of boxing and girls came to learn cookery and dressmaking and there were sometimes superior visitors from other parts oozing with inexpensive patronage who spoke of johnny and his companions as the degraded classes who were to be raised from the depths and so in the institute johnny drew and learned the proper drawingoffice manner of projection learned also the musclegrinder and the longarm balance on the horizontal bar and more particularly learned to pop in a straight left to duck and counter and to give and take a furious pounding for three minutes on end without losing wind or goodhumour so that his attention was diverted from home and for long he saw nothing of the misery his mother suffered in secret nothing of the meek endurance of bessy and for the more reason because both studied to keep him ignorant and to show him cheerful faces but there came an evening when his eyes were openedin some degree at least perhaps something especially perverse had happened in a spring handicap spring handicaps were just beginning perhaps it was some other of the vexations that beset a gentlemanly career but certainly mr henry butson came into harbour lane in no amiable mood at the corner where a publichouse shed light across the street he ran into a stout barearmed girl in a faded ultramarine hat and made to push her roughly aside but the girl stood her ground and planted an untender elbow near the spot where his watchchain hung resplendent garn she cried bought the street ave yer and then as he sought to pass on dyear ye got yer collar an yer chain wheres yer muzzle nowise mollified by this outrage mr butson came scowling in at the shop door and taking no notice of nan who stood at the counter entered the back parlour and slammed the door behind him it was barely nine oclock and so early a return was uncommon bessy sat by the fireside sewing mr butson was angry with the world sorely needing someone to bully and bessy was providentially convenient he put a cigar into his mouth and strode across to the shelf in the corner shoving the girl and her chair and her crutch out of his way in a heap the shelf carried bessys tattered delight of old books and dragging a random handful of leaves from among them while a confused bunch fell on the floor he twisted up one leaf and thrust it into the gas flame bessy seized his arm o dont she pleaded please dont not out of the book theres a lot i made on the mantelpiece dont o dont indeed a glass vase stood full of pipelights but he jerked his elbow into her face knocking her backward and swore savagely he lit his pipe with the precious leaf and then because bessy wept he took another handful from the shelf and pitched it on the fire at this pleading the harder she limped forward to snatch them off but mr butson with a timely fling of the foot checked her sound leg and brought her headlong on the fender yus he roared furious at the contumacy you take em auf when i put em on go on an see what ill do to ye damn lazy skewshanked eifer he took her by the shoulder as she made to rise and pushed her forward go an earn yer livin yidle slut nan in the shop heard from the beginning and trembled her impulse to interfere she checked as she might for she well knew that would worsen bessys plight but it was choking hard in the midst johnny burst in from the street whistling why mother he said whats up ill you lookwhats that nonothing johnny dont go in ill go stay but there was a cry and a noise of falling johnny flung open the parlour door and stood aghast butson pushed the girl forward go an earn yer livin y idle slut get out o this for a second johnny stared then he reached butson at a spring and knocked him backward with a swing of his right fist the crutch lay behind the mans heels and tripped him so that he sat backward on the floor mightily astonished johnny snatched the poker and waved it close about butsons head dont you move he cried white with passion dont you try to get up or ill beat your head in mr butson raised his arm to save his skull but caught a blow across the bone that sent it numb to his side johnnydont cried nan snatching at his arm o henry pray dont get away mother said johnny or ill have to hit his head you blackguard coward youyoure a meaner hound even than i took you for youll touch my sistera lame girlwill you at the thought he struck but again nan caught at him and only mr butsons shoulder suffered dont johnny his mother entreated think o the neighbours they can hear next door so they could and for the sake of trade the proprieties of harbour lane must be respected to have a row in the house was a scandal unpardonable in harbour lane in the height of his anger johnny remembered and instinctively dropped his voice very well he said then call a plicemanill lock him up johnnys anger kept his reason half astray yet or he would have remembered that to have a member of the household taken off by a policeman would be more disgraceful than twenty rows but mr butsons consternation though momentary was plain johnny johnny pleaded poor nan think of the disgrace do lets make it upfor my sake johnny bessy was crying in a corner and nan was choking and sobbing johnny wavered and the poker stopped in midair butson took heart of grace and moved to get up though he kept his eye on the poker better take im away he growled to nan if ye dont want me to smash im straightway the poker waved again and mr butson changed his mind as to getting up smash me johnny asked smash me eh keep a civil tongue or you shall have it now see and he thrust the point against mr butsons nose leaving a black smear dont think i care for you if this was anywhere else id ha broken your head in twenty places now you sit there an listen to me mr butson what you are we know you came here starving with about half a suit o boiler clothes in the world and my mother fed youout o charity an worse luck she fed you and she put clothes on your lazy carcase and you cadged and begged as a mongrel dog wouldnt stop where you are or youll have it this with another flourish of the poker and another smear on the nose mr butson sat up again a figure of ignominy you talked my mother over and you married her and youve lived on her ever since like a gentlemanor like what you thinks a gentlemanyou not worth boys pay on a mudbarge now see here im not a boy nowor at anyrate im not a little one im within half a head as tall as you im not so strong as you now perhaps and i know im not as big but some day i shall be stronger because youre rotting yourself with idleness and booze and then ill give you a bigger hiding than you can carry for what i saw just now you look forward to that until then if you put your hand within a foot of my sister again ill brain you with this poker or ill stick something into youill go for you with whatever i can lay hold of now you remember that johnnys voice was loud again and once more nan appealed all right mother he answered more quietly but ill make him understand i shall keep a little more at home in the evenings now my fine fellow and i shall take all this table to draw on whether you like it or not unless my sister or my mother want to use it ive got more right here than you and if i go out ill ask about your behaviour when i come in ive kept quiet and knuckled under to you for the sake of peace and so as not to worry mother theres been enough o that if you want rows you shall have em ill make you as frightened of me as you are of the plice ah you know what i mean johnny had no idea of what he meant himself but he had been sharp enough to observe the effect of his earlier allusion to the police and he followed it up you know what i mean youd look a deal more at home in gaol than here in a white shirt eating other peoples victuals mr butson decided that bluster would not do just at present he wondered if johnny really did know anything and how much but surely not or he would go a good deal farther anyway best be cautious so mr butson growled oh all right damn lot o fuss to make over nothin i dont want no words and bessy still crying took hold of her brothers arm and said dont say any more johnny please iipraps i oughtnt to ha done what i did what you did johnny answered not so cheaply appeased you do what you like bessill see he dont interfere he says he dont want any wordshe shant have em hell have something harder if he touches you let go my arm a minute go on you can get up now this to butson with the black nose youd better go an wash yourself but none o your tricks if you try to lay hold o me from behind or anything like that youll get it with anything i can catch hold of so now you know and mr henry butson growling indistinctly went out to wash his face closely watched by johnny poker in hand next door on one side heads were thrust out at the backdoor to listen to the unwonted noise of quarrelling at the chandlers and on the other side other heads were thrust out at the front door because the law of irregularity in the building of harbour lane decreed a backgarden to the one house and a frontgarden to the other xxiv his home in harbour lane grew less sufferable than ever to mr butsons tastes his contempt remained for the sordid surroundings the vulgar trade the simple wifefor everything about the place in fact with the reasonable exceptions of the money he extracted from it and the food he ate there and now there was the new affliction of an unsubmissive stepson a stepson moreover who watched and who kept alert ears for any expedient assertion of authority whereat he might raise mutiny a most objectionable stepson in every way far too big and growing bigger every day who would not forget bygones and who had a nasty suggestive way of handling the pokera large poker an unnecessarily heavy poker for a sittingroom and he seemed to suspect things too and talked unpleasantly of the police a thing that turned one hot and cold together so mr butson went more up west and sought longer solace in the society of the bars as for johnny finding butson ceasing so far as he could see from active offence he gave thought to other things though watching still his drawing was among the other matters that claimed his care but chief of them all was a different thing altogether for at the institute he had found the girl he first saw on the dark morning when he set out to be an engineer he had seen her sinceonce as he was on his way to a shiplaunch and twice a little later then not at all for eighteen months at least till he began to forget but now that he saw her again and found her a womanor grown as much a woman as he was grown a manhe wondered that he could ever have forgotten for a moment more when he had seen her twice or thrice and knew the turn of her head and the nearing of her step he was desperately persuaded that nothing in the world nor time nor tide could make him forget again so that he resolved to learn to dance but the little society that danced at the institute saw nothing of her this radiant unforgettable she came twice a week to the dressmaking class wherein she acted as monitor or assistant to the teacher being as johnny later discoveredby vast exertionsa dressmaker herself in her daily work she made no friendships walked sedately apart and was in some sort a mystery being for these reasons regarded as stuckup by the girls of the class and so made a target for many small needlethrusts of spite johnny had a secret notion that she remembered him because she would pass him with so extreme an unconsciousness in her manner so very blank an unacquaintance in her eyes neat and grey in her dress she had ever a placid gravity of air almost odd by contrast with the unceasing smirk and giggle of the rest of the girls of the institute and her nameanother happy discovery attained at great expense of artless diplomacywas nora sansom and now for awhile the practice of orthographic projection suffered from neglect and abstraction of mind long hicks all ignorant of the cause was mightily concerned and expostulated with a face of perplexed surprise much poking of fingers through the hair and jerking at the locks thus separated but it was a great matter that tugged so secretly at johnnys mind and daily harder at his heartstrings till he blushed in solitude to find himself so weak a creature nora sansom did not come to the dancing she knew nobody that he knew she was unapproachable asas a chinese empress how to approach nora sansom and at the thought he gulped and tingled and was more than a little terrified he was not brought to a stand by contemplation of any distinct interposing labyrinth of conventional observance such as he who can see can pick his way through in strict form but by a difficulty palpable to instinct rather than figured in mind an intangible barrier that vexed johnny to madness so that he hammered the institute punchingball with blind fury and again because the world was now grown so many heavens wider he would sit and dream of things beyond its farthest margin yet and between plan and section crankshaft and piston he would wake to find himself designing monograms of the letters n s and j m altogether becoming a sad young fool such as none of us ever was in the like circumstances but an angeltwo angels to be exact both of them rather stoutcame one night to johnnys aid they came all unwitting in a cab being man and wife and their simple design was to see for themselves the upraising of the hopeless residuum they had been told though they scarce believed that at the institute far eastmuch farther east than whitechapel and therefore without doubt deeper sunk in dirt and iniquitythe young men and women danced together under regular ballroom conventions neither bawling choruses nor pounding one another with quart pots it was even said that partners were introduced in proper form before dancinga thing so ludicrous in its incongruity as to give no choice but laughter so the two doubters from the west end it was only bayswater really took a cab to see these things for themselves but having taken no pains to inform themselves of the order of things at the institute they arrived on an evening when there was no dancing this was very annoying and they said so with acerbity they were indeed so very indignant at the disconformity of the arrangements to their caprice and so extremely and so obviously important and the lady waggled her gilthandled lorgnon with such offended majesty that it was discussed among those in direction whether or not something might be done to appease them and in the end after a few hasty inquiries the classes were broken up for the evening and an offhand dance was declared to the music extracted from the institute piano and the fiddle of a blushing young amateur the girls came in gay and chattering from the dressmaking class and the lads rushed to exchange gymnasiumflannels for the clothes they had come inall unconscious that they were to be made a show of they who kept their dancingshoes on the premises triumphed in their foresight and johnny was among them as for him he had seen nora sansom coming in with the others alone and a little shy and he resolved to seize occasion with both hands and he did so very gallantly with less trepidation than at a calmer moment he would have judged possible first a quadrille was called and johnnys courage rosefor as yet he had no great confidence in his dancing in general but he did know the figures of a quadrille having learned them by rote as most boys learn euclid he laid hands on the mild young shopman who had unexpectedly found himself appointed master of ceremonies and in two minutes he was standing in a set with nora sansom at his side the sheer pride of it disorganised his memory so that it was lucky they were a side couple or there would have been a rout in the first figure johnnys partner knew very little or nothing of dancing but she was quick to learn and johnny a rank beginner himself had a proud advantage in his knowledge of the figuresunstable as it was so that the thing went very joyfully and the girls eyes grew brighter and her face gayer each moment to the end for her life had been starved of merriment and here was merriment in plenty of the sort a girl loves four or five dances were all there were for the place shut at ten to dance them all with nora sansom were impossible and scandalous for everybody was very particular at the institute but johnny went as far as two and a sit out and extracted a halfpromise that she would come and dance some other time more he walked two streets of the way home with her and the way was paved with clouds of glory why he might go no farther he could not guess but there he was dismissed quite unmistakably though pleasantly enough fair very fair were the poor little streets in the moonlight as johnny walked home and very sweet the air it was a good world a kind world a world as one may see it who has emptied a bottle of good champagne johnny would have shaken hands with anybody on the wayprobably even with butson if he had met him but nobody made the offer and even the bakedchestnut manhe was still there by the high wallgrowled merely when johnny gave him good night and so johnny went to dreams of gentle grey eyes in a dimpled face with brown hair about it for few of the songbook beauties were nora sansoms her hair was neither golden nor black but simple brown like the hair of most other people and her eyes were mere grey yet johnny dreamed as for the two angels from bayswater who caused all these things to come to pass they looked at the dancing from the gallery and said that it was really very creditable considering quite surprising indeed for people of that class and they hoped it didnt lead to immorality and they went home virtuously conscious of having done their duty toward the submerged but the lady left her gilthandled lorgnon in the cab whereof the gentleman hadnt thought to take the number and the lady said a great many times before they went to bed and after that it was just like a man xxv the weeks went and the time neared when dancing at the institute would end for the seasonwould end with a bang and a dazzle in a long night when dancing would be kept up shamelessly till something nearer one oclock than twelve johnny counted first the weeks then the days and last the hours not because of the dancing although that was amusing but because he was to take nora sansom with his double ticket for herself she may have counted days and hours or may not but true it was that she sat up late on several nights with nuns veiling and ribbons making a dress for the occasionthe first fine frock that had been hers and every night she hid it carefully each dressmakingclass night of late it had been johnnys privilege to guard her homegoing to the end of that second streetnever farther twice she had come to dancing and by that small practice was already johnnys superior at the exercise for a bigshouldered novice of eleven stone two is a slower pupil than any girl of eighteen in the world and they were very welcome one to the other and acquaintance bettered day by day once johnny ventured a question about the adventure of the morning now more than three years ago but learned little from miss sansoms answer the lady who was ill was her relation she said and she found her and then she talked of something else and so till the evening before the long night it was the rule at the institute to honour the long night with gloves and white ties by way of compromise with evening dress and johnny bought his gloves with discretion and selected his tie with care then he went to the institute took a turn or two at the bars climbed up the rope and gave another member a lesson with the gloves thus refreshed he dressed himself in his walking clothes making sure that the tie and the gloves were safe in his pocket and set out for home there was no dressmaking class that night so that he need not wait but outside and plainly waiting for him was nora sansom herself johnny thought she had been crying as in fact she had oh mr may she said im very sorry buti thought you might be here andandim afraid i shant be able to come tomorrow not come butbut why im sorryim very sorry mr may but i cant tell youreally there was a quiver of the lip and her voice was a little uneven as though there were danger of more tears but johnny was not disappointed merely he was also angry and it was hard to conceal the fact so he said nothing but turned and walked a few steps by her side ihope you wont mind she pursued uneasy at his silence im very much disappointedvery much indeed and it was plain that she was but therell be a good many there and youll have plenty of partners this last she found a hard thing to say i dont care how manyll be there johnny replied i shant go it was said curtly almost angrily but nora sansom heard it with an odd little tremor of pleasure though she merely said but why not theres no reason why you should be disappointed too anyhow im not going he said and after a pause added perhaps you might ha gone if i hadnt asked you oh i shouldnt she answered with tears in eyes and voice you know i shouldnt i never go anywhere johnny instantly felt himself a brute no he said i know you dont i didnt mean anything unkind but i wont go do you really mean it of course im not going without you he might have said something more but a little group of people came straggling past and the girl with her eyes on this group said the first thing that came to her tongue where will you go then oh anywhere i dont know walk about perhaps she looked shyly up in his face and down again i might go for a walk she said johnnys heart gave a great beat alone he asked i dont know perhaps but she would be questioned into nothing definite if she took a walk she might go in such and such a direction passing this or that place at seven oclock or halfpast that was all and now she must hurry away for she had already been too long what mattered the dance to johnny now a fig for the dance let them dance that liked and let them dance the floor through if it pleased them but how was it that nora sansom could take a walk tomorrow evening yet could not come to the institute that was difficult to understand still hang the dance for nora it would be harder to speak howbeit indeed the destruction of the lookedfor evenings gladness in her first fine frock had been a bitter thing but that day her hidingplace had been discovered and now the dress that had cost such thoughtful design and such hopeful labour was lying rolled and ticketed on a pawnbrokers shelf xxvi that they must come to blackwall pier was assured for there were no streets no crowds no rumbling waggons there were the wide sky and the unresting river the breeze the ships and the endless train of brownsailed barges no unseamanlike gardenseats dishonoured the quay then and strolling lovers sat on bollards or chains or sat not at all here came johnny and nora sansom when the shrinking arc of daylight was far and yellow in the west and the kentish hills away to the left grew dusk and mysterious the tide ran high and tugs were busy a nest of them with steam up lay under the wharf wall to the right of the pierbarge waiting for work some were already lighted and on the rest men were trimming the lamps or running them up while a cheerful glow came from each tiny cabin and engineroom rascal boys flitted about the quays and gangwaysthe boys that are always near boats and water ever failing to get drowned and ever dodging the pestered men who try to prevent it the first star of the evening steadied and brightened and soon was lost amid other stars below the river set its constellations as silently one after another trembling and blinking and meteor tugs shot across its firmament in white and green and red along shore the old artichoke tavern gables and piles darkened and melted away and then lit into a little orion a bright cluster in the bespangled riverside ever some new sail came like a ghost up reach out of the gloom rounded the point and faded away and by times some distant voice was heard in measured cry over water they said little for what need to talk they loitered awhile near the locks and saw the turning trinity light with its long solemn wink heard a great steamer hoot far down woolwich reach now the yellow in the sky was far and dull indeed and a myriad of stars trembled over the brimming river a tug puffed and sobbed and swung out from the group under the wharf beating a glistering tail of spray and steaming off at the head of a train of lighters out from the dark of woolwich reach came a sailingship under bare spars drawn by another tug in the middle of the river the ship dropped anchor and the tug fell back to wait keeping its place under gentle steam they walked on the wharf by the iron cranes and far to the end under the windows of the abandoned brunswick hotel here they were quite alone and here they sat together on a broad and flattopped old bollard presently said johnny are you sorry for the dance nownora and lost his breath at the name norahe called her nora was she afraid or was she glad what was this before her but with her eyes she saw only the twinkling river with the lights and the stars presently she answered i was very sorry she said slowly of course but nownora still she saw but the river and the lights but she was glad timid too but very glad johnnys hand stole to her side took hers and kept it no she said not sorrynow say johnny what was before her mattered nothing he sat by herheld her hand not sorry nowjohnny why came tears so readily to her eyes truly they had long worn their path but thisthis was joy he bent his head and kissed her the wise old trinity light winked very slowly and winked again so they sat and talked sometimes whispered vows promises nonsense allwhat mattered the words to so wonderful a tune and the eternal stars a million ages away were nearer all nearer than the world of common life about them what was for her she knew now and sawshe also a new heaven and a new earth over the water from the ship came swinging and slow a stave of the chanty im a flyingfish sailor straight home from hongkong aye aye blow the man down blow the man down bully blow the man down o give us some time to blow the man down yere a dirty blackballer just in from new york aye aye blow the man down blow the man down bully blow the man down o give us some time to blow the man down time went but time was not for them where the tugengineer thrusting up his head for a little fresh air saw but a prenticelad and his sweetheart on a bollard there sat man and woman enthroned and exultant in face of the worlds the ship swung round on the tide bringing her lights square and her stem for the opening lock the chanty went wailing to its end blow the man down bully blow the man down to my aye aye blow the man down singapore harbour to gay london town o give us some time to blow the man down the tug headed for the dock and the ship went in her wake with slow state a gallant shadow amid the blue soon the tide stood and stood and then began its ebb for a space there was a deeper stillness as the dim wharves hung in midmist and water and sky were one then the air stirred and chilled stars grew sharper and the thames turned its traffic seaward xxvii happiness never stayed long with nora sansom little indeed had been her portion and it was a poor sort at best but this new joy was so great that it must needs be short of life and in truth she saw good reason from the moment of parting with johnny doubts had troubled her and doubts grew to distresseven to misery she saw no endno end but sorrow she had been carried away she had forgotten and in measure as her sober senses awoke she saw that all this gladness could but end in heartbreak and bereavement better then end all quickly and have done with the pang but herein she misjudged her strength doubts and perplexities assailed johnny also though for a time they grew to nothing sharper he would have gone home straightway proud and joyful if a little sheepish to tell his mother the tale of that evening but nora had implored him to say nothing yet she wanted time to think things over she said and she left him at the familiar corner two streets beyond the institute begging him to come no farther for this time at anyrate next evening was the evening of the dressmaking class he saw her for a few minutes on her way through those two familiar streets and he thought she looked unwell a few nights later he saw her again plainly she had been crying when they came to a deserted street of shutup wharves he asked her why onlyonly ive been thinking she said what about about you johnnyabout you and me wei thinkwere very young arent we that had not struck him as a difficulty well he said i dont know about that i spose we are like others but i shall be out o my time in two years and a half or not much more and then yes then she said catching at the word praps then it will be differentandi mean we shall be older and know better johnny andnowwe can often see one another and talk like friendsand she looked up to read his eyes trembling something cold took johnny by the throat and checked his voice butwhatyou dont meanthat yes she said though it was bitter hard itll be bestim sure johnny johnny gulped and his voice hardened oh he said if you want to throw me over you might say so in straight english ohdont talk like that johnny she pleaded and laid her hand on his arm its unkind you know its unkind noits only plain an honest i dont understand this halfandhalf businessseeing each other like friends an all that one more effort she made to hold her positionbut her strength was near gone itll be better johnnytruly it will youyou might meet someone youd like better and thats my lookout time to talk about that when it comes the other night you let me kiss you and you kissed me backtold me you loved me now you dont maybe youve met someone you like better she held out no more her head fell on his shoulder and she broke into an agony of tears o johnny johnny that is cruel you dont know how cruel it is i shall never like anybody better than younever half so much dont be unkind ive not one friend in the world but you and i do love you more than anything with that johnny was ready to kick himself for a ruffian he looked about but nobody else was in the shadowy street he kissed nora he called himself hard names and he quieted her though she still sobbed and there was no more talk of mere friendship she had tried her compromise and had broken down but presently johnny ventured to ask if she foresaw any difficulty with her parents fathers dead she said simply hes been dead for years this was the first word of her family matters that johnny had heard should he come to see her mother the question struck her like a blow nono johnny she said not yetno you mustnt i cant tell you whyi cant really at anyrate not now then after a pause o johnny im in such trouble such trouble johnny and she wept again but tell her trouble she would not at anyrate not then and in the end she left johnny much mystified and near as miserable as herself because of his blind helplessness in this unrevealed affliction inexpert in mysteries he was all incomprehension what was this trouble that he must not be told of he did not even know where nora lived why shouldnt she tell him why did she never let him see her as far as home this much he knew that she had a mother but had lost her father by death and this he had but just learned from her under stress of tears he was not to see her motherat least not yet and nora was in sore trouble but refused to say what the trouble was that night he moped and brooded and at maidment and hursts next morningit was saturdaymr cottam the gaffer swore and made remarks about the expedience of being thoroughly awake before dinnertime more at one oclock johnny passed the paybox without taking his money and turned back for it when reminded amid the chaff of his shopmates many offers of portership and some suggestions to scramble the slighted cash not far from the yardgate he saw a small crowd of people about a publichouse and as he neared he perceived mother borndrunk in the midst of it the publican had refused to serve herindeed had turned her outand now she swayed about his door and proclaimed him at large shultin a lady she screamed hoarsely cant go in plashe thout bein shulted shulted by low common publicoush i wont ave it dont you stand it ducky sang out a boy you give em what for for a moment she seemed inclined to turn her wrath on her natural enemy the boy but her eye fell on a black bottle with a broken neck lying in the gutter gi em what for she hiccupped stooping for the bottle yesh ill gi em what for and with that flung the bottle at the largest window in sight there was a crash a black hole in the midst of the plate glass and a vast spider of cracks to its farthest corners mother borndrunk stood and stared perhaps a little sobered then a barman ran out tucking in his apron and took her by the arm there were yells and screams and struggles and cheers from blackguard boys and mother borndrunk was hauled off screaming and sliding and stumbling between a policeman and the publican johnny told his mother when he reached home that her old acquaintance emma pacey was like to endure a spell of gaol but what occupied his mind was noras trouble and he forgot mother borndrunk for three or four days then came the next evening of the dressmaking class at the institute and he went never doubting to meet nora as she came away at the door the housekeeper who was also hallporter beckoned and gave him a letter left earlier in the day it was addressed to him by name in a weak and straggling female hand and for a moment he stared at it not a little surprised when he tore open the envelope he found a blotchy tearstained rag of a letter and read this my dearest johnnyit is all over now and i do hope you will forgive me for not telling you before this is to say goodbye and god bless you and pray forget all about me it was wrong of me to let it go so far but i did love you so johnny and i could not help it and then i didnt know what to do i can never come to the classes again with all this disgrace and everything printed in the newspapers and i must get work somewhere where they dont know me i would rather die but i must look after her as well as i can johnny because she is my mother burn this at once and forget all about me and some day you will meet some nice girl belonging to a respectable family and nothing to be ashamed of dont try to find methat will only make us both miserable goodbye and please forgive me yours affectionately nora sansom what was this what did it all mean he stood in the gymnasium dressingroom to read it and when he looked up the gaslight danced and the lockers spun about him the one clear thing was that nora said goodbye and was gone presently his faculties assorted themselves and he read the letter again and then once more it was all over and she asked him to forgive her for not telling him before telling him what she told him nothing now she would never come to the institute again and he didnt know her address and he mustnt try to find her but then there was everything printed in the newspapers of course he must look at the newspapers why so long realising that he went to the readingroom and applied himself to the pile of papers and magazines that littered the table one paper after another he searched and searched again but saw nothing that he could connect with nora by any stretch of imagination till he found a stray sheet of the day before with rings of coffeestain on it the police intelligence lay uppermost and in the midst of the column the name emma sansom in italic letters caught his eye she was fortyone and was charged with drunkenness and wilful damage a sentence more and everything stood displayed as by a flash of lightning for he had witnessed the offence himself on saturday emma sansom was the married name of emma pacey whom the boys called mother borndrunk and the woman was noras mother now it was plainall from the very beginning when the child wandered in the night seeking her strayed and drunken mother and inquired for her with the shamed excuse that she was ill this was why he was not to call to see noras mother and it was for this that nora hindered him from seeing her home there was the shameful report all at length the publicans tale was simple and plain enough he had declined to serve the prisoner because she was drunk and as she refused to leave he had her turned out though he said she made no particular resistance shortly afterward he heard a crash and found a broken bottle and a great deal of broken glass in the bar he had gone outside and saw the prisoner being held by his barman his plateglass window was smashed and it was worth ten pounds there was little more evidence the police told his worship that the prisoner had been fined small sums for drunkenness before but she was usually inoffensive except for collecting crowds of boys this was the first charge against her involving damage she was the widow of a ships officer lost at sea and she had a small annuity but was chiefly supported of late by her daughtera dressmakera very respectable young woman the daughter was present the reporter called her a prepossessing young female in great distress and she wished to be allowed to pay the damage in small instalments but in the end her mother was sent to prison for a month in default of payment of fine and damage for indeed the daughter was a minor and her undertaking was worthless one thing johnny looked for eagerly but did not findthe prisoners address whether consideration for the daughter had prompted the reporter to that suppression or whether it was due to accident johnny could not guess in other reports in the same column some addresses were given and some not but straightway johnny went to beg the housekeeper that he might rummage the store of old papers for those of the day before for to desert nora now in her trouble was a thing wholly inconceivable and so far from burning the letter he put it envelope and all in his safest pocket and felt there more than once to be assured of its safety but the address was in none of the papers in fact the report was in no more than three and in one of those it was but five lines long what should he do he could not even write her one line of comfort and he had been going on with his work placidly all monday while nora had been standing up in a policecourt weeping and imploring mercy for her wretched mother if he had known he could scarce have done anything to aid her but helplessness was no consolationrather the cruellest of aggravations well there stood the matter and raving would not help it nor would beating the tablenor even the headwith the fist he must somehow devise a way to reach nora xxviii he resolved first to try the institute noras name and address must be on the class registers but what business had he with the girls class registers as diplomatist his failure was lamentable he could invent no reasonable excuses and ignoble defeat was his fate at the hands of the rigid lady who managed the girls department of the institute then he took to prowling about all the streets that lay beyond that second corner that had marked the end of their evening walks watching for her searching also desperately for some impossible sign about a house that might suggest that she lived in it thus he spent the daylight of two evenings watching a little muslinhung window because the muslin was tied with a ribbon of a sort he remembered her to have worn and because he chose to fancy a neatness and a daintiness about the tying that might well be hers but on the second evening as dusk fell the window opened and a hairy redbearded man in blue shirt sleeves put out his head and leaned on the sill to smoke his pipe and watch the red sky johnny swung away savagely and called himself a fool for his pains and indeed he could ill afford to waste time for maidment and hurst claimed him till five each day and a few hours in the evening were all that remained more nora would change her lodgingsperhaps had done so already after this he screwed his courage so high as to go to the policestation where the charge against noras mother must have been taken and to ask for her address but the castironfaced inspector in charge took his name and address instead as a beginning and then would tell him nothing and at last maddened and reckless he went to the publican and demanded the information of him now if johnny had had a little more worldly experience a little more cunning and a great deal more coolness he would have done this at first and beginning by ordering a drink he would have opened a casual conversation led it to the matter of the window and in the end would have gained his point quietly and easily but as it was he did none of these things he ordered no drink and he made a blunt request taking little thought of its manner none of the publicans point of view and perhaps forgetting that the man was in no way responsible for the rebuffs already endured the publican for his part was already in a bad temper because of the clumsy tapping of a barrel and ensuing cheek of the potman so he answered johnnys demand by asking if he had come to pay for the window and receiving the negative reply he had expected he urgently recommended the intruders departure outside in such terms as gave no choice but compliance so that now in extremity johnny resolved on a last expedient one that had been vaguely in his mind for a day or two though he had yet scarce had courage to consider it seriously this was to tell his mother the whole thing and to induce her if he might to ask the address at the instituteperhaps on some pretext of dressmaking business he was not hopeful for he well knew that any hint of traffic with the family of one such as noras mother would be a horror to her but he could see nothing else and to sit still were intolerable moreover he guessed that his mother must suspect something from his preoccupation and his neglect of his drawing though indeed poor nan was most at pains just then to conceal troubles of her own mr butson in fact began to chafe under the restraints of narrow circumstances not that he was poorer than had been his habitindeed he was much better offbut that his needs had expanded with his prosperity and with his successes in society and it was just now that his wife began to attempt retrenchment probably she was encouraged by the outrageous revolt of her son a revolt which had made advisable a certain degree of caution on the part of himself the head of the household she spoke of a rumour that the shipyard opposite might close as so many other thames shipyards had closed of late years that she said would mean ruin for the shop and she must try to save what little she might meantime an absurdity of course in mr butsons view he felt no interest in the rumours of old women about shipyards and petty measurement of the sordid chances of trade irritated him if his wife found one source of profit running dry she must look out and tap another that was all so long as he got what he wanted he troubled little about the manner of its getting but now he ran near having less than he wanted and his wife was growing even less accommodating she went so far as to hint of withholding the paltry sum the lad earned he should have it himself she thought to buy his clothes and to save toward the end of his apprenticeship more than this mr butson much suspected that johnny had actually had his own money for some while past and that mrs butson had descended to the mean subterfuge of representing as his earnings a sum which in reality she extracted each week from the till an act of pure embezzlement and then there was the cottage in epping forest she wouldnt sell it now though she wanted to sell when she first left it what good was there in keeping it true there was threeandsixpence a week of rent but that was nothing it would go in a round of drinks or in half a round in any distinguished bar and there were deductions even from the threeandsixpence sold the cottage might produce a respectable sumperhaps a hundred poundsat anyrate eighty the figures stirred his blood what a magnificent dash a man might cut with eighty pounds and a fortune might be made out of it too if it were used wisely and not buried away in a wretched threeandsixpenny cottage properly invested on judicious flatrace certainties it would double itself about twice a week so he made it very plain to nan that the sale of the cottage for what it would fetch and the handing over of the proceeds was a plan he insisted on but the stupid woman wouldnt see it it was plain that she was beginning to overestimate her importance in the establishment by reason that of late she had not been sufficiently sworn at shoved thumped and twisted and pinched on the arms that was the worst of kindness to a womanshe took advantage so that he was obliged to begin to thump again there was no need to do it so that johnny might know and so cause a low disturbance in fact johnny took little notice of things at home just now no longer made inquiries nor lifted the poker with so impudent a stare and he was scarce indoors at all wherefore mr butson punched and ruffianedbeing careful to leave no disreputable marks in visible spots such as black eyesand sometimes he kicked and he demanded more money and more but all the while insisted on the sale of the cottage the monstrous laws of conveyance made it impossible for him to lay hands on the deeds and sell the place himself or he would have done it of course and he made it advisable too for bessy to avoid himand that had a better effect than any direct attack on nan till at last the woman was so far reduced that she was near a very dangerous rebellion indeednearer than mr butson suspected for she began to think of attempting a separation by magistrates order shameful as it would be in the neighbourhood though she feared greatly so it was when johnny turned toward home on an evening a little before nine oclock sick of blind searching and ready to tell his mother the story of nora sansom first to last at harbour lane corner he saw butson walking off and wondered to see him about blackwall so early in the evening nobody was in the shop and johnny went through so quietly that he surprised his mother and bessy in the shopparlour crying bitterly nan sat on a chair and bessy bent over her and no concealment was possible johnny was seized by a dire surmise mother whats this he said whats he been doing nan bent lower but answered nothing johnny looked toward bessy almost sternly hehes beaten mother again bessy blurted between sobs beaten mother again johnnys face was white and his nostrils stood wide and round beaten mother again hes always doing it now bessy sobbed and wanting more money id a good mind to tell you before butbut beaten mother the room swam before johnnys eyes why nan rose to close the door no johnny she said meekly im a bit upset but dont let it upset you dont you whats the matter with your leg youre limping he kicked her i saw him kick at her ankle bessy burst out pouring forth the tale unrestrained i tried to stop him andand and then he hit you asked johnny not so white in the cheeks now but whiter than ever about the mouth yes but it was mother most and bessy wept afresh perhaps his evenings of disappointment had chastened johnnys impatience he knew that the man was out of reach now and he forced his fury down in ten minutes he knew the whole thing between bessys outpourings and nans tearful admissions when is he coming back they did not knowprobably he would be late as usual but dont go doing anything hasty johnny nan implored im so afraid of you doing something rash its not much reallyim a bit upset but ill have to think about this johnny said with such calmness that nan felt somewhat reassured though bessy was inwardly afraid im going out for an hour he strode away to the institute walking by instinct and seeing nothing till he was under the lettered lamp he went to the dressingroom and hurried into his flannels in the gymnasium the instructor a brawny sergeant of grenadiers was watching some lads on the horizontal bar johnny approached him with a hesitating request for a free spar free spar my lad said the sergeant whats up gettin cheeky want to give me a hidin no sergeant johnny answered not such a fool as that but i never had a free spar with a man much heavier than myself andand i just want to try thats all there was a comprehending twinkle about the sergeants eyes right he said youre givin me near two stonethats if youre a bit over eleven fetch the gloves at another time johnny would never have conceived the impudence of asking the sergeantonce champion of the armyfor a free spar even a light spar with the sergeant was something of an undertaking wherein one was apt to have both hands full and a bit over but the lad had his reasons now he dashed at the professor with a straight lead and soon the blows were going like hail on a windowpane the sergeant stood like a rock and johnnys every rush was beaten back as by hammerblows on the head but he came again fresh and eager and buzzed his master merrily about the head getting in a very respectable number of straight drives such as would knock an ordinary man down though the sergeant never winked and bringing off one on the mark that did knock out a grunt much as a punch in that region will knock one out of a squeaking doll steady the sergeant called after two long rounds had been sparred youll get stiff if you keep on at that rate my lad and thats not what you want i reckon this last with a grin you havent been boxin regular you know just lately but youre all right he added as they walked aside your work keeps you in good condition not quite so quick as you would ha been if youd been sparrin every evening ocourse but quick enough for your job i expect and again johnny saw the cunning twinkle it was about closing time and when johnny had changed his clothes he found the sergeant leaving also he thanked him and bade him goodnight goodnight may the sergeant called and turned into the street but he swung back along the footpath after johnny and asked is it tomorrow what sergeant oh i aint a sergeantim a stranger theres a sergeant goes to that moral establishment praps with a nod at the institute but he behaves strictly proper im just a chap out in the street that would like to see the fight thats all when is it i dont quite know that myself johnny answered ohlike that is it hum the sergeant was thoughtful for a momentperhaps incredulous then he said well cant be helped i suppose anyway keep your left goin strong but dont lead quite so reckless with your head up an no guard youre good enough an the bigger he is the more to hit xxix mr butson was perhaps a shade relieved when he returned home that night and found all quiet and johnny in bed he had half expected that his inopportune return might have caused trouble but the night after as he came from the railway station a little earlier than usual johnny stopped him in the street i want to speak to you he said just come round by the dock wall his manner was quiet and businesslike but mr butson wondered why he asked cant you tell me here no i cant there are too many people about its money in your pocket if you come mr butson went what it meant he could not imagine but johnny usually told the truth and he said it would be money in his pocketa desirable disposition of the article the dock wall was just round a corner a tall raking wall at one side of a sparsely lit road that was empty at night and a lower wall at the other the road reached by a flight of steps rising from the street and a gateway in the low wall well what is it now mr butson asked suspiciously as johnny stopped under a gaslamp and looked right and left along the deserted road only just this johnny replied with simple distinctness you wanted mother to give you my money every week though in fact shes been letting me keep it well heres my last weeks moneyhe shook it in his handand ill give it you if youll stand up here and fight me what fight you you mr butson laughed but he felt a secret uneasiness yes me youd rather fight a woman no doubt or a lame girl but im going to give you a change and make you fight mehere johnny flung his jacket on the ground and his hat on it dont be such a young fool quoth mr butson loftily put on your jacket an come home yespresently johnny replied grimly presently ill go home and take you with me come youre ready enough to punch my mother without being asked or my sister come and punch me and take pay for it mr butson was a little uncomfortable i suppose he sneered youve got a knife or a poker or somethin about you like what you threatened me with before i havent even brought a stick youre the sort o coward i expected though youre bigger than me and heavier come he struck the man a heavy smack on the mouth now fight butson snarled and cut at the lads head with the handle of his walking stick but johnnys arm straightened like a flash and butson rolled over what i thought youd do remarked johnny seizing his wrist and twisting the stick away now get up come on mr butson sat and gasped he fingered his nose gently and found it very tender and bleeding he seemed to have met a thunderbolt in the dark he turned slowly over on his knees and so got on his feet hit mecome hit me called johnny sparring at him fancy im only my mother you cur come im hitting yousee so he seized the man by the ear twisted it and rapped him about the face the treatment would have roused a sheep butson sprang at johnny grappled with him and for a moment bore him back johnny asked nothing better he broke ground checked the rush with halfarm hits and stopped it with a quick double left flush in the face it was mere slaughter johnny was too hard too scientific too full of cool hatred the wretched butson bigger and heavier as he might be was flaccid from soft living and science he had none but he fought like a rat in a cornerrecking nothing of rule but kicking biting striking wrestling madly though to small purpose for his enemy deadly calm and deadly quick saw every movement ere it was made and battered with savage precision whenever youve had enough said johnny as butson staggered and leaned against the wall you can stop it you know by calling the plice you like the plice theres always one of em in the next street an youve only to shout i shall hammer you till ye do and he hammered a blow on the ear drove butsons head against the wall and a swing from the other fist brought it away again he flung himself on the ground get up cried johnny get up what you wont all right you went down by yourself you knowsos to be let alone but im coming down too and with that he lay beside butson and struck once more and struck again chuck it groaned butson im done oh leave me alone leave you alone answered johnny rising and reaching for his jacket not i you didnt leave my mother alone a soon as she asked you did you ill never pass you again without clouting your head come home he hauled the bruised wretch up by the collar crammed his hat on his head and cut him across the calves with his own walking stick go on march cant you leave me alone now whined butson you done enough aint ye nonot near enough an youll have a lot more if you dont do as i tell you i said id take you home an i will go on two or three dark streets led to harbour lane but they were short it was past closing time and when they reached the shop the lights were turned down and the door shut nan opened to johnnys knock and he thrust butson in before him here he is said johnny not thrashed half enough dusty and bleeding his face nigh unrecognisable under cuts and bruises butson sat on a box a figure of shame nan screamed and ran to him i did it where the neighbours wouldnt hear johnny explained and if hed been a man hed have drowned himself rather than come here after the way ive treated him hes a poor cur an ill buy a whip for him theres the money i promised you he went on putting it on the box its the first youve earned for years and the last youll have here if i can manage it but nan was crying over that dishonourable head and wiping it with her handkerchief xxx why whats that said long hicks on the way to work in the morning got cuts all over yer hands yes johnny answered laconically fighting fightin long hicks looked mighty reproachful jest you be careful what company youre gettin into he said severely youre neglectin yer drawin and everything lately an nowfightin i aint ashamed of it johnny replied gloomily an ive got other things to think about now besides drawing hicks stared stuttered a little and rubbed his cap over his head he wondered whether or not he ought to ask questions they went a little way in silence and then johnny said its him butson no exclaimed hicks checking in his stride and staring at johnny again what bin fightin butson johnny poured out the whole story and as he told hickss eyes widened his face flushed and paled his hands opened and closed convulsively and again and again he blew and stuttered incomprehensibly job is to drive the brute away johnny concluded wearily hell stop as long as hes fed an mother thinks its a disgrace to get a separationgoin before a magistrate an all im only tellin you because i know you wont jaw about it among the neighbours that day long hicks got leave of absence for the rest of the week mightily astonishing mr cottam by the application for hicks had never been known to take a holiday before awright the gaffer growled seein as were slack theres one or two standin auf for a bit aready but whats up with you wantin time auf gittin frisky runnin arter the gals and indeed long hicks spent his holiday much like a man who is running after something or somebody he took a walking tour of intricate plan winding and turning among the small streets up street and down but tending northward through bromley bow and old ford and so toward homerton and the marshes meantime johnny walked to and from his work alone and brooded he could not altogether understand his mothers attitude toward butson she had been willing even anxious to get rid of him by any process that would involve no disgrace among the neighbours and no peril to the trade of the shop he had made her life miserable yet now she tended the brutes cuts and bumps as though he didnt deserve them and she cried more than ever as for johnny himself he spared butson nothing rather he drew a hideous solace from any torture wherewith he might afflict him when are you going to clear out he would say youd rather be kept than work but you dont like being thrashed do you thrashed by a boy eh youll enjoy work a deal better than the life ill lead you here i can tell you ill make you glad to drown yourself mean funk as you are before im done with you dont be too careful with that eye the sooner its well the sooner ill bung it up again bessy marvelled at this development of morose savagery on her brothers part with her though he spoke little he was kinder than ever but it was his pastime to bully butson who skulked miserably in the house being in no fit state for public exhibition as to his search for nora sansom johnny was vaguely surprised to find himself almost indifferent it would have been useless to worry his mother about it now and though he spent an hour or two in aimless tramping about the streets it was with the uppermost feeling that he should rather be at home bullying butson he had no notion why being little given to introspection and he was as it were unconscious of his inner conviction that after all nora could not be entirely lost while butsons punishment was the immediate concern and as the thing stood the creature seemed scarce to have been punished at all xxxi long hickss holiday had lasted three days and mr butsons minor bruises were turning green it was at the stroke of five in the afternoon and bessy was minding shop from the shipyard opposite a score or so of men came in dirty dungaree for it was friday vanguard of the tramping hundreds that issued each day regular as the clock before the timekeepers box bessy rose on her crutch and peeped between a cheese and a packet of candles out of window friday was not a day when many men came in on their way home because by that time the weeks money was run low and luxuries were barred bessy scarce expected a customer and it would seem that none was coming peeping so she grew aware of a stout redfaced woman approaching at a rapid scuttle and then almost as the woman reached the door she saw hicks at her heels his face a long figure of dismay the woman burst into the shop with a rasping shriek i want my usband she screamed wheres my usband come away called hicks deadly pale and nervously snatching at her shoulder come away you know what you promised take yer and auf me ye long fool wheres my usband is it you whats got im she turned on bessy and bawled the words in her face nono it aint cried hicks near beside himself come away anan well talk about it outside talk o yus ill give im talk the womans every syllable was a harsh yell racking to the brain and already it had drawn a group about the door ill give im talk an er too would anyone believe she went on turning toward the door and haranguing the crowd that grew at every word as ow a woman calling erself respectable an keepin a shop like any lady ud take away a respectable womans usbanda lazy goodfornothin scoundril as run away an left me thirteen year ago last whitsun boys sprang from everywhere and pelted in to swell the crowd drawn by the increasing screams many of the men who knew the shop so well stopped to learn what the trouble was and soon every window in harbour lane displayed a womans head or two my usband wheres my usband show me the woman as took my usband nan came and stood in the back parlour doorway frightened but uncomprehending the woman turned you you is it she shrieked oversetting a pile of tins and boxes and clawing the air above her gimme back my usband you shameless creechor where a ye got im wheres my usband hicks put his arm about the womans waist and swung her back he was angry now get out he said i didnt bring you to make a row like that you swore you wouldnt finding his arm too strong for her the woman turned on hicks and set to clawing at his face never ceasing to scream for her husband and then johnny came pushing in at the door having run from the far streetcorner at sight of the crowd hicks as well as he could for dodging and catching at the womans wrists made violent facial signals to johnny who stared understanding none of them but he heard the womans howls for her husband and he caught at her arm who is your husband he said whats his name whats is name why butsonenery butsons is name gimme my usband my usband let me go you villain it was like an unexpected blow on the head to johnny but save for a moment it stunned not at allrather roused him ill fetch him he cried and sprang into the house here was releasethe man had another wife he would drag the wretch down to her and then give him to the police no wonder he feared the police the load was lifted at lastbutsons punishment was come indeed fiercely glad and thinking of nothing but this johnny swung into each room in turn but there was no butson his pipe lay broken on the front bedroom fender and his coat hung behind the door but there was no other sign johnny dashed into the back yard that too was empty but in the yard behind the old lighterman paintpot in one hand and brush in the other just as he had broken off in the touching up of his mast stood and blinked and stared with his mouth open his housedoors back and front stood wide because of wet paint and one could see through to the next street it was by those doorways that mr butson had vanished a minute ago after scrambling over the wall hatless and in his shirt sleeves and the old lighterman thought it a great liberty and told johnny so with some dignity johnny rushed back to the shop gone he cried bolted out at the back he might have offered chase but his mother lay in a swoon and bessy hung over her hysterical shove that woman out he said and he and hicks between them thrust the bawling termagant into the street and closed the door without she raged still and grew hoarser till a policeman came to quiet her and in the end she marched off with him talking at a loud scream all the way and harbour lane flamed with the news of nans shameless bigamy xxxii long hicks raved and tore at his hair striding about the shop and cursing himself with whatever words he could find johnny was excited still but he grew thoughtful there was more in this business he saw now than the mere happy riddance of butson what of the future his mother was prostrated and lay moaning on her bed no one was there to tend her but bessy and there was no likelihood of help they had no intimacy with neighbours and indeed the stark morality of harbour lane womankind would have cut it off if they had for already poor nan was tried and condemned as was the expeditious manner of harbour lane in such a matter and no woman could dare so much as brush skirts with her its my faultall of it said the unhappy hicks i shouldnt a bin such a fool but how was i to know shed go on like that after what shed agreed to oh damme i shouldnt a meddled johnny calmed him as well as he might pulled him into a chair in the shop parlour and sought to know the meaning of his selfreproaches why not meddle johnny asked when you found her kicking up that row ah but i didnt i didnt protested hicks rolling his head despairingly and punching his thigh i brought her here its all my fault i thought i was doin somethin clever an i was silly fool o id like to shoot meself brought her here well tell us about itno good punching yourself when did you find out he was married knew it years ago didnt know the woman was alive though thought she must a bin dead when you told me hed married your mother some light broke on johnny and you took these days off to look for herwas that it thats it an i was a foolmade things wuss instead o better never mind about thatanythings better than having that brute here what changed your mind about her being dead oh i dunno ill tell you all there is to it long time ago when i was workin at bishops an lodgin in limeus my lanlady she

made oh i ought to be poleaxed well of course theres been a row johnny said gloomily an i expect itll knock trade to pieces here an half kill mother but you couldnt very well help a row in a thing like this i bin three days findin er my old lanladys dead an i ad to try an find er sister nobody knew where the sister was but after a lot o bother a old woman sends me to a cousinin the workus

newspapershop people there send me right back to poplar party o the name o bushell party o the name o bushell very friendly an sends me to old ford then i went to bow again an so i dodged about up an down till i run across mrs butson up on omerton marshes keepin a laundry that was today that was well she took it mighty cool at first when i told er i knew where er usband was she told me i might keep my knowledge to myself for she didnt want im very cool she was till i told er ed married again an at that she shut er jaw with a snap an glared at me so i just told er what i knew an ow it ud be

all quiet an peaceable an nobody the wiser all right she says jest you show me the place thats all so i brought er but when we got to the corner an i told er which ouse auf she went at a bolt anan set up all that row fore i could stop er whod a thought of er actin contradictory like that it was not altogether so dense a mystery to johnny as it was to the simpler hicks twice his age though more a boy than himself but he assured hicks that after all he had done a good turn and no price was too high for riddance of butson motherll be grateful to you too when shes a bit quieter an knows about it he said and presently he added thoughtfully i think i ought to have guessed something o the sort with his sneaking in an out so quiet an being afraid o the plice theres lots o things i see through now that i ought to have seen through before not wantin the new name over the door for one till the shutters were up that night and the door well bolted nan may was urgent that that horrible woman must be kept out and when at last she slept in mere exhaustion she awoke in a fit of trembling and choking beseeching somebody to take the woman away bessy like johnny had a sense of relief though she slept not at all and dreaded vaguely but withal she was conscious of some intangible remembrance of that redfaced woman with the harsh voice and it was longdaysere it returned to her that she had heard the voice high above the shouts of the beanfeasters in the forest on the day when uncle isaac had brought butson to the cottage xxxiii mr dunkins notice to quit arrived early the next morning the service of that notice was a duty he owed to society morality conscience virtue propriety religion and several other things which he enumerated without hesitation he could not have sat in his pew the next day with any comfort knowing that such a duty remained unperformed he would have felt a hypocrite the notice might have come before for the trade had been good and steady but mr dunkin also had heard the whispers that the shipyard might be shut and he had hesitated long now however there was no alternativeif mrs may were left to flaunt her infamy the trade must decline under the scandal and the place fall worthless again more her expulsion at this time would seem less a seizure of the new branch than a popular vindication of righteousness johnny was at home when the notice came he had sent a message to mr cottam pleading urgent family affairs might have expected it johnny said giving the paper to hicks whom he had called into counsel anyway mother swears she cant show her face in the shop again she seems almost afraid to come out of her bedroom talks wild about disgracing her children an wishes she was dead shes pretty bad an as to the shopthats done up question is what to do now then

while johnny glowered fiercely at every face he could see turned toward them to johnny the streets seemed unreasonably familiar as the cab jolted through themunreasonably like what they were a day ago before this blow fell and knocked the world out of shape they went out through blackwall cross by the high street and past the institute where the familiar housekeeperthe housekeeper who had given him noras farewell letterstood on the steps with a broom through the two streets and past that corner where they had partedit seemed years ago as to when they might meet again and howthat was not to be thought of now his head was too full already xxxiv oh give us some time to blow the man down roared mr bushell splashing and puffing amid much yellow soap and cold water in the washhouse whither he

scandalised restrained him desperately by the opposite arm it took some impatient moments to make it plain to the landlady that he intended no violent assault nor on consideration even the rudeness of dashing into a ladys rooms unannounced whereupon mrs bushell went to a door and knocked johnny close at her heels and presently the door opened nora oh johnny johnny i wish you hadnt we shall only but

they went in together xxxv at the end of a week long hicks stood astounded at his own performances at the end of a year he was still astonished and proud inordinately and till the end of his life he will never forget the smallest particular of that weeks exploits the policeman who came with a warrant for butson the young man from mr dunkin who came about the stock the other young man that came the next timehe polished them all off and half a dozen others in the most dashing and businesslike manner he found a new shopfound a score of shops in fact so that nan may was fain to rouse herself and choose lest some hopeless sepulchre of trade were rented without her knowledge and this was good for it gave her work to do and to think of and once set going she buckled to her task with all her old energy and a world of riper experience the shop was not so fortunately placed as that at harbour lane and trade was never quite so good as it had been there when at its best more its place was in a dingy street out of sight of the river and the ships but it was a fairly busy thoroughfare and things could be sold there which was the main consideration and it was hickss triumph to stock this shop with the stock from harbour laneconveyed secretly by night on a truck with many chucklings after cunning puttingoff of mr dunkin the tale whereof he would tell ever after with bashful glee together with the tale of the sad emptiness and disorganisation of mr dunkins new branch at its opening on monday morning and uncle isaac who found his nieces new shop ere long assured the listener by frequent proclamation that mr hicks was a gentleman of vast business ability and a genius at enterprise yus a genius thats what i say mr cottama genius of uncommon talent it was a wet afternoon when cottam and hicks had taken ten minutes shelter in the roundhouse by the quayside and presently were joined by uncle isaac on his way across from the docks mr cottam grunted he had met uncle isaac twice before lord uncle isaac went on gazing at the uneasy hicks with steadfast admiration lord if e was ony ambitious e might be anythink what a ornament e d be to a diplomatic corpse talk about enterprise why at enterprise an any sort o circumventions eseswhy there as i alwis say e might be ambashador to er majestys possessions the shower flagged and men came out on the quays mr cottam rose from the coil he had been sitting on took his gaze out of space and fixed it on the wall over uncle isaacs head mr mundy he trumpeted in the manner of a man beginning a speech to an expectant multitude raising his forefinger to his shoulder and lowering it till it rested on uncle isaacs chest mr mundy then he paused and uncle isaac said yus mr cottam the pause endured and grew impressive till at last the foremans face relaxed his gaze descended till it met uncle isaacs and he chuckled aloud stabbing him playfully with the forefinger whywhat a windy ol kidder you are said mr cottam and stamped off along the quay croaking and chuckling all over xxxvi so with the days and the months nans sorrows fell from her and their harder shapes were lost in her remembrance and the new days brought a new peaceperhaps even a new dullness for this was a dull place this street of flat walls and grime and anxious passengers but what mattered mere dullness of externals when she had hard work to do and a son to take pride in for noras sorrows who shall speak there was a hospital bed that she knew well a pillow whereon a slaty face wasted and grew blank of meaning and in the end there was a day of driving wet in a clayey cemetery a day of loneliness and wonder and dull calm but that day went with the others and that year went the streets grew sloppy with winter dusty with summer and smoky geraniums struggled into bloom on windowsills and died off miles away the forest gowned itself anew in green in brown and in white and in green the exiles saw it once a year but all its dresses were spread for bessy still in her dreams two years were gone and johnny was within five months of twentyone and the end of his apprenticeship when on a brave august day he walked in the forest alone there would be no forest excursion for him next year for then with good fortune he would be upon the seas for the firm had promised him the recommendation that would give him a years voyaging as fourth engineer bessy and nora were sharing the holiday but they were left to rest at bob smallpieces cottage bob vast brown and leathery was much as ever he had seen johnny and bessy once each year but not their mother sincewell since he had gone to london to see his sister he was not sure whether he should go up to london again soon or not meantime he made tea for his visitors they had climbed the hill to grandads grave and they had found it green and neat they had seen another freshclosed beside it and wondered who was buried there they had gathered flowers in monk wood and they had stayed long in loughton camp they had come again to the cottage on the glenside and johnny had had to stoop at the door to save his hat for indeed he was within two inches as big as bob smallpiece himself and now johnny being alone took the path to wormleyton pits it was six years since he had gone that way last and he might never go that way again mainly his way lay as it had lain when he carried the basket of sloes that night when his grandfather had hunted his last moth johnny had left childish fancies years behind him and now the trees were trees merely one much as the rest though green and cheerful in the sunlight but even as on that night his mind had run on london the longedfor london that was his home now and stale with familiarity so now he turned over once more the mystery of the old mans cutting off and with as little foreknowledge of the next chances in lifes hatful here branched the track by which he had made for theydon there was the tree under which he had last seen the old mans lanternlight and then the slade opened glorious with heather brambles and bushes about the pits were changedthis grown higher and wider that withered off and the pitsthe smaller pits at least seemed shallow enough holes under the eyes of a man of near six feet the deepest pitthe pitwas farthest and johnny could see a man whose figure seemed vaguely familiar sitting on its edge he picked his way across the broken ground and came to the pit on the side opposite to the stranger there was the hole where the old man had taken his deathblow perhaps the bottom had risen an inch or so because of gravelwashings but the big stone in the middle was still plain to see the man opposite was trimming wooden pegs with a pocketknife he wore corduroys of a cut that johnny held in remembrance johnny watched for a few seconds and then the man turned up a leathery brown face and johnny knew him it was amos honeywell notable as a poacher and chief of a family of poachers amos put a peg into his pocket and began on another well amos called johnny across the pit you dont know me the man looked up and stared no he said i dunt johnny gave him his name what answered amos putting away his peg unfinished johnny may the boy as used to be along o oad may the butterfly man as died in a axdent in this ere very pit yesif it was an accident oh it was that all right nough but why yere twice as tall an tarent so long nayther amos paused staring mightily at johnny and slapped his thigh why he said its the curiousest thing in natur seein you now an here too did ye see eer a funeral las

nothing but a casual crossing of ways just a chance from the hatful like all the rest of it and amoswell he was right too by such lights as he could see light was low behind the hills and dusk dimmed the keepers honest face as he waved his friends goodbye yes he would come to them in london one of these days soon well then soon together the three went down the scented lanes where the white ghostmoths began to fly and so into the world of new adventure the end printing office of the publisher

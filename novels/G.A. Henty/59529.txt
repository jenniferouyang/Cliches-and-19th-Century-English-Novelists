fred bingham was now rather an important person in his way he had a large number of works in hand he was contractor for miles of sewers in and around london he was building a noblemans mansion in sussex and a large church in birmingham he had a pier in hand down in cornwall and a railway in durham altogether he appeared to be a flourishing man people who met him casually spoke of him as an extremely pushing sharp young fellow with a pleasant manner men who met him in business said he was a cute fellow but hard sir hard as nails any one who had seen him at home as his wife and his servants saw him knew him for a morose and irritable tyrant not that he had not his pleasant moments when he would jest with his wife and speak jokingly to the servants and be for a short time pleasant and apparently lighthearted but the slightest thing would bring the cloud over his face and his sharp voice would say the most bitter things to every one around him regardless of who heard him his wife was greatly changed since he married her never actually pretty there had yet been a trusting kindliness in her face and under happier auspices the poor little heiress might have blossomed out into a very bright little flower but now the bud had closed up on itself as if stricken with the touch of a bitter march wind and she was a silent timid woman she loved her husband still but she feared him even more than she loved him she was always nervously trying to please him and was ever ready to laugh if he was in a humour to joke she bore his bitterest taunts without an answer although a flush of pain as if she had been struck came up sometimes over her face when he spoke so to her before the servants in money matters her husband was liberal he had always been openhanded as a boy and now he never grudged his wife any thing that she fancied she had her carriage and her maid and when she was in the country he seldom came back from his visit to london without a rich dress or a pretty bonnet or some present which he thought she would like to his servants too he was a liberal and in some respects a kind master he liked the pleasure of giving and if presents could have bought love he would have been adored by those around him but his irritable temper and his bitter tongue would constantly inflict wounds which no presents could salve no mere burst of good humour heal one reason of his irritability was unquestionably the state of his business large as it apparently was his position was precarious the whole of his wifes capital was sunk in it but that was as nothing in comparison to the requirements of such extensive works as he was now carrying on he had therefore been obliged to borrow large sums of money and to discount his payments for work done he was staying alone now in his house in harley street his wife being down at a place he had taken to be near his work at durham and as usual during these london visits was in an exceedingly irritable state of temper when among his letters he received one signed robert barton its contents were brief private enquiry office siri am in possession of information of the last importance to yourself and which i wish an early opportunity of discussing with you i shall be at this office from eleven until one every day or will call upon you at any time for which you may choose to make an appointment fred binghams pale face became even whiter than usual what the devil does this fellow want to see me about business of the last importance and his thoughts at once flew to the matter of his cousin frank pshaw he exclaimed that is out of the question it must be that he has heard that some one is not solvent or that some of my bills perhaps have got into bad hands at any rate i must go and see the fellow then he put mr bartons letter aside opened several of the others some of which he read through carefully others threw aside at a glance the last he opened was from his wife bah he said impatiently what quantities of twaddle women write as if any one was going to read them through and he tore the letter up and threw the fragments into a wastepaper basket he drew his desk to him and wrote several letters then he looked at his watch eleven oclock i will go up to the city at once and see this barton i shall only worry about it until i know what it is mary he said sharply as the servant entered fetch a hansom and look sharp about it mr barton was alone in his den when the clerk brought in mr binghams card show him in and as the clerk left the room mr barton rose took a small bundle of papers from an iron safe and placed them in a drawer by his side fred bingham entered take a seat mr bingham i have received a note from you this morning fred said shortly and thought it as well to call at once quite as well mr barton said slowly rubbing his chin and examining his visitors face as if to read his character quite as well he repeated rather more rapidly as if his survey had been a satisfactory one yes there is nothing like attending to business at once that has always been my rule fred bingham made a gesture of impatience if you will tell me what you want he said i shall be glad i have business of importance to attend to no doubt no doubt mr bingham but hardly i imagine of such importance as the present as you will i am sure allow when you have heard me now mr bingham he went on sharply and decisively as if he had now quite made up his mind as to his visitors character and the conclusion he had arrived at were satisfactory we will proceed to business we are both of us men of the world fred bingham did not like the opening his own experience had been universal that when two men agreed that they were men of the world they were about to propose or to carry out some doubtful business which would not bear a rigid investigation he only nodded however and the detective went on the business relates to family matters again the old fear came into fred binghams thoughts and the man who was watching him saw instantly that there was some sore point or other in his family affairs you are i believe sir the next of kin and recognised heir of captain bradshaw of lowndes square and of wyvern park in the county of leicester you may readily imagine that a man of my profession does not ask such a question from mere impertinent curiosity i presume not fred bingham said coldly you are mistaken my cousin mr maynard is an equally near relative with myselfindeed as son of the elder sister he is captain bradshaws nearest heir quite so mr barton said so i understood but i am also awarefor in these matters one of course makes oneself acquainted with all particularsthat a quarrel has arisen between captain bradshaw and mr maynard and that you may now not unreasonably be regarded as his sole heir i am not aware of captain bradshaws intention with regard to the disposal of his property fred bingham said stiffly no mr barton said as if surprised i imagined that you were at least it is whisperedthese things get whispered you knowthat you applied to a party in the city who shall be nameless and obtained a heavyish loan on the strength of your expectation in that quarter fred bingham coloured scarlet and was about to speak when mr barton stopped him pooh pooh my dear sir dont be angry as men of the world we understand these matters and the little affair in question is not known beyond a very small circle of safe men if men did not mention the matter to their particular friends you know accidents might happen a gentleman might borrow twice for instance from different parties upon the strength of his expectations fred bingham bit his lip for he had only the night before been meditating on the possibility of some such step as that suggested he did not speak and mr barton went on i think then that it will assist us to a better understanding of the position if we assumejust assume you knowthat you are the probable heir to captain bradshaws very large property now that captain bradshaw has had this unfortunate quarrel with your cousin mr barton laid a meaning stress upon the word unfortunate and fred bingham said hastily i had nothing to do with the quarrel of course not of course not mr barton said having not the least doubt but that he had a doubt of which he made a mental note for future use fred bingham felt that thus far he had had much the worst of the struggle and he said i really do not see mr barton where the conversation about family matters is leading us to patience my dear sir mr barton said composedly i am coming to the point now you being as we have assumed for the sake of argument the probable heir to the very large property of captain bradshaw it would be a new and somewhat unpleasant circumstance if another person should appear being a nearer relation than yourself and having consequently stronger claims upon his affections in fact let us suppose a grandson fred bingham was relieved of the fear which had hitherto oppressed him and he said angrily really mr barton i cannot enter upon any such impossible conjecture but suppose i tell you mr bingham that it is not a conjecture at all but a fact and that such a grandson is really in existence fred bingham for a moment sat speechless and then exclaimed fiercely i should say it was a lie no doubt you would no doubt you would mr barton said very composedly and very natural too but for all that it is true your cousin captain bradshaws daughter ran away from home married and died leaving a child behind her that child is alive fred bingham sat in complete stupefaction he had heard it is true years ago of a daughter of captain bradshaw but the possibility of her child being in existence to step in between him and the fortune had never entered his mind he did not doubt the fact for bartons manner was too earnest to be doubted he sat astounded and crushed under the unexpected disaster here mr barton went on quietly taking the papers from the drawer here is a copy of the register of her marriage here is a copy of the baptism of the infant and i could procurewere it to the point which it is nota copy of the register of her burial fred bingham sat for some time in silence but after the first burst of surprise and despair his busy brain began to work again why did this man come to him instead of going either to captain bradshaw himself or to the heir why did he come to him naturally because he saw an advantage in so doing because in fact he would get more out of him at least there was hope then when he spoke his words expressed these thoughts you have not finished mr barton of course you come to me with an object of course that object is money now why do you come to me before you go to them why do you suppose i would pay you more very good indeed sir i like doing business in a practical way and thats what i call practical talk i can only give you the answer in the words of your own question i came to you simply because i do believe you would give me more than either captain bradshaw or his grandson and also and mainly because when you and i have agreed upon the matter there is no fear of its going any furtherit would not suit either of us for it to get abroad now on the other hand captain bradshaw or his grandson might refuse to pay the relationship once disclosed i lose my hold upon them and if i were to try to enforce my claim i should not go into court with clean hands i was employed by captain bradshaw to trace his daughter and when i told him of her death i forgot to mention she had left a child you see the public might take a wrong view of it and it is even possible that i might lose my suit now with you i have none of these inconveniences i know if you agree to pay me you will do so because it is your interest you know i shall keep my part of the bargain because in the event of my opening my lips the public would know that i have acted in a rather unprofessional and underhand way and i should be spoken of in a way i should not like there is only one other point mr barton how am i to know this boy is still alive ah mr barton said approvingly i do like to deal with a man with his head well on his shoulders now you have hit upon the only weak point i cannot prove it i know the young man i see him constantly but without letting him know it i cannot prove it to you without his having his suspicions awakened how can i you must take my word for it i tell you he is alive if any sort of oath will satisfy you i will take it i cant say more than that fred bingham rose i can give you no answer now upon this it is all new to me i must think it over i will call tomorrow about the same time and he went out and got into the cab which had been waiting for him back again to harley street and drive quick fred bingham sat for some hours in his study that evening thinking over the new and unexpected impediment to his hopes to think of a grandson of the old man being alive just when everything looked so well was ever anything so frightfully unlucky however of course the question was was it worth while to buy this man off or not fred bingham had a clear head and he considered every possible argument which could be urged upon either side if he refused to treat and the heir was produced what then captain bradshaw had he had heard bitterly regretted his treatment of the mother and would no doubt receive the boy with joy and establish him as his heir of course he would leave a considerable sum to himself he would feel bound to do so fred did not deceive himself his uncle had never liked him as he had frank still he would leave him perhaps a third of the whole property suppose he bought this man off the whole property was worth perhaps suppose he gave for silence of course it would pay him well but would that be the end of it would he find himself in this mans power if he did so yes that was the real question the agreement of course would be that he would give a bond to pay a certain amount at his uncles death provided his uncle died ignorant of the existence of his grandson yes that would be it then he would pay the money in cash so that no trace of the transaction could be brought against him and he would receive in exchange the bond would barton have any hold upon him afterwards he did not think so he did not see how he could have any suppose he produced the grandson what then the will would have left the property to him and the grandson would not have the slightest claim could barton threaten to divulge the compact he could deny that it ever existed and barton would have no proof to adduce over and over again he thought it over and again and again he arrived at the same conclusion the grandson could have no claim barton could hold no threat over his head it was not so very bad after all and with this conclusion he went to bed the next day he called again at mr bartons office the interview was brief this time how much do you want to hold your tongue the estate is worth by what i hear i will charge ten per cent no fred bingham said if this heir turns up i should get at least a third i will give you ten per cent upon the rest come mr barton said i have waited twenty years i will take not a farthing less very well fred bingham said payable of course at my uncles death in the event of no nearer heir than myself appearing just so mr barton assented i have drawn up a bond on stamped paper up to the figures are not put in i will fill it up i owe robert barton the sum of which i agree to pay upon the death of captain bradshaw of lowndes square providing that no nearer heir than myself to his property be found but supposing fred bingham said that my uncle quarrels with me and leaves his property to some one else i dont think you are likely to let him quarrel with you mr bingham but should he do so i rely upon you for your own sake to come here and tell me so frankly and i will then restore you this paper and produce the grandson fred thought for a minute and then said yes that would suit us both there i have signed the bond dont leave it about good morning mr barton chapter ii ruined frank maynard and his wife had finished breakfast frank was reading the times and kate had just brought down baby to play with frank suddenly gave a sharp exclamation as of sudden pain what is it frank what is the matter frank did not answer his face had a look of utter dismay send baby away his wife rang the bell and baby was sent up to the nursery what is it frank dear something very bad tell me dearest katie frank said if this is true and there can be no doubt of it we are ruinedruined little woman how frank his wife asked unable to realise the misfortune how ruined dear the great indian bank is broken katiea complete smash but frank that is not altogether ruin i have heard you say half your money was in the shares of that bank and the other half in the bank of england so only half is gone no katie the bank has failed the notice says for an immense amount not onethird of the amount of the shares is called in they will call up the rest now and every farthing we have in the world will go katie oh my poor little wife my poor little wife my dearest i have you left so i am rich still do not give way frank my own boy you must not do that we shall do very well somehow dont give way frank my darling i am only thinking of you my little tender wife to think how different your life will be my dear frank i am not a hothouse floweri am a little wild irish girl do you think i cant rough it as well as you why frank i have been wondering lately whether i was always to lead such an idle useless life as i have lately with only baby to work for i am sure i shall be happier frank and you know dear i can be useful and perhaps earn money i am sure i could give singing lessons no no dont talk of it katie i am not a man to give way i was upset when i thought of you dear but i shall be only too proud and too glad to work for you and as long as i have a pair of hands you may be sure katie there is no need for you to talk of doing anything why you little goose have you no faith in me i can do all sorts of things can you frank kate said doubtfully well we shall see only let us trust each other dear and we can look the worst in the face you are a darling katie and i did not know what a treasure i had got there i feel all right again now so i will go up to the city perhaps things may not be as bad as they seem frank however derived but little comfort from what he heard in town the city was in a state of consternation the break down of the bank had been quite unexpected the indian had been looked upon as one of the most stable of the banks and no one knew which might go next the liabilities were described as tremendous it was certain that the shareholders would have to pay up to their last penny and that even then the depositors would suffer greatly frank went back again to thurloe square greatly depressed it is as bad as it can be katie he said in answer to his wifes questioning look when he entered it is no use deceiving ourselves we shall be called upon to pay up every penny we have well frank kate said simply we have the consolation that it is no fault of ours and i am sure dear we shall be very happy wherever we are i am sure we shall katie i suppose we shall not have to turn out just yet frank oh no there will be receivers appointed and then the calls will be made i should think it will be a couple of months before anything is settled ah then frank we need not worry ourselves we shall have plenty of time to think over our plans at that moment there was a knock at the door and prescott entered my dear frank my dear katefor frank and his wife had long since insisted that their friend should so call heri am sorry for this i only heard it this afternoon for i never look at the money article so directly i could get away from court i ran down to see you this is indeed a bad affair it cant be helped arthur kate said cheerfully its no use crying over spilt milk is it very bad frank every penny we have in the world prescott its no use mincing matters prescott sat down in consternation dont take it to heart arthur kate said you see we are very comfortable over it prescott could not answer for some time at last he said at least frank has one treasure left him no nonsense arthur else i shall be angry with you now please let us say no more about it till after dinner and then we will hold a council we will all go into franks snuggery and frank shall smoke his big meerschaum that always puts him in a good temper if hes ever so cross you are an impudent puss katie you know i never am cross oh what fibs frank you know you are a perfect bear sometimes there it is time for you to go upstairs dinner will be ready in five minutes kate left the room her husband remaining behind to say to his friend isnt she a brick prescott isnt she a downright little trump i tell you what prescott i never was sharp but i managed somehow to choose the very best little woman in the world and then he went upstairs after his wife at dinner prescott was the most silent of the party frank in his pleasure and pride at his wifes stoutheartedness was in really high spirits and katie having wisely turned the subject to travels frank rattled on about some adventures of his in albania and never came back again to england until the cloth was removed then kate said evan put the wine and glasses in your masters study now frank let us go there i have ordered a fire to be lighted it is more cheerful it was not until they had been seated for some minutes in franks smokingroom and until franks meerschaum was fairly alight that prescott brought the conversation to present matters by asking have you thought at all of going abroad frank well no frank said i have not thought about it but i should be open to any good appointment wolf killer to his majesty the czar of all the russias that would suit me capitally or if i could not get that say ambassador to madrid no no frank i am speaking seriously i mean are you thinking of going at once hundreds of men in your position will go the calls cannot be made for another month or six weeks and there is nothing in the world to prevent your selling out of the funds and you would still have a good income for the continent frank was silent after a pause his wife spoke but that would be cheating would it not arthur prescott hesitated he was too straightforward to equivocate i dont know that it would be absolutely cheating kate frank you see has lost a large sum by the fall of the bank and he may consider that he has a perfect right to save the rest if he can hundreds will do so no doubt still i suppose it is cheating all the same arthur kate said quietly if franks money properly belongs to the creditors of the bank it must be cheating if he goes off without paying it look here prescott frank said gravely the interest and sympathy of the public will in this as in all cases be with the depositor and not with the shareholder in this case more than ordinarily so for the depositors in the indian were old indian officers and their widows and children the distress this smash will cause will be terrible and by what i hear even after the greatest amount possible is wrung out of the shareholders there will not be nearly enough to pay the depositors in full now prescott i could stand a good deal of hardship and trial but i could not stand being pointed at as a man who had swindledthat would be the word old man there is no use mincing itthe widows and orphans who have been brought to want by the failure of the bank even for katies sake i could not do that you never thought we would did you arthur no i did not prescott answered i thought you would not still i thought it right to suggest the thing before it is too late to be carried out there is no doubt that a vast number of the unfortunate shareholders of the indian are preparing to spend the rest of their time on the continent it is very wicked of them katie said earnestly you are too hard little woman frank said we must not judge other people by ourselves there are circumstances under which i might myself do what they are doing for me there would be no excuse for choosing a life of dishonest ease to settingto at hard work of some sort i am not yet sevenandtwenty it is comparatively easy for me to begin life but suppose i were an old man with no possible kind of work to turn to to earn a living and with a wife of my own age and a grownup daughter or two what then what could i possibly do you must remember our case is just as hard as that of the depositors we bought shares at prices which paid five or six per centno extraordinary interestand we imagined that the money was absolutely safe the depositors put their money in the bank and received interest for it the bank goes from no fault of ours any more than of theirs we lose every penny invested they will receive at any rate some part of what they put in i think then that an old man in the case i have spoken of would be morally justified in trying to save anything which may remain to him but i do not think a young man would be perhaps so katie said thoughtfully at any rate i am glad you are a young man so am i kate frank laughed there prescott now we have quite decided upon that point what is your next idea my dear frank i have no idea prescott said it is for you to turn over in your mind what you think would suit you i was thinking of that as i came down from town prescott frank said disconsolately and upon my word i dont see what i am fit for i write a rascally bad hand and i am sure no one would take me as a clerk i couldnt do anything in the literary line to save my life i can pull an oar you know but then fellows must be apprenticed before they can be watermen upon my word the only thing i can see for myself he said ruefully is to go into the ring i fancy there aint above one or two men i couldnt hold my own with a prizefighter frank for shame how dare you talk of such a thing katie said indignantly he is only joking kate prescott said although he saw that frank had been half in earnest he is laughing at himself and us yes i suppose it would not do frank said with half a sigh but upon my word it is about all i am fit for you see arthur if frank could get any little thing to do here i could help i could give lessons in singing besides i can work very well i am a wonderful hand at bonnets you are a wonderful goose frank broke in seizing her and taking her from her chair on to his knees in his own easy chair and checking her remonstrances with do as you are told katie prescott wont mind frank i am really ashamed of you i shall go away i will frank please let me go not a bit of it katie here you are and here you remain now prescott please go on it is agreed katie is to give singing lessons and i am to stay at home and nurse baby frank that is unkind katie said with the tears in her eyes why should i not have the pleasure of helping too my own katie frank said if the worst comes to the worst you shall help but i hope that we shall hit on something better than that your proper work will be quite as hard my pet what with baby and me you will have quite enough to do i am afraid i shall be the most troublesome of the two now prescott have you anything else to propose nothing definite frank but if i were in your place with your strength and energy and with such a bravehearted wife to back me and help me i should emigrate i am afraid there is no sort of profession here for which you are fitted but you are just the man to get on out there a man who is strong and active and is willing to turn his hand to anything is safe to get on and no kind of work is considered dishonouring out there by jove prescott that would be just the thing for me but it would be a rough life for poor kate not rougher for me than for you frank besides you know that i could really help you out there i should think so kate still i think if we really do make up our minds to it it would be better for me to go out first to make a home for you katiea rough home dear but still a homeand for you to stay for a little while with the drakes look here frank his wife said with a tear glistening in her eye again and a laugh that was nearly a cry i promise you solemnly that if you once leave me behind you leave me behind for good you dont mean it do you husband no darling that is i dont mean it if you dont want it well prescott and which of the colonies do you think would suit me best ah that is a matter for great consideration frank you must do nothing in a hurry there are canada the cape the various australian colonies and new zealand you must get up the subject and settle a little what line you mean to take up by jove prescott it is a great idea and has taken a tremendous weight off my mind i did not see anything for it but the ring you know and kate does not seem to fancy that well we may consider the matter settled so far chapter iii proffered aid alice heathcote had noticed that for a week past captain bradshaw had been unusually absent and moody he had however upon the first occasion when she had inquired if anything were the matter answered so sharply nothing my dear what makes you get such ideas in your head that she had not again approached the subject and rather put it down to an access of her uncles chronic complaint of liver they were one evening at a small dinner party at the house of an old friend during a pause in the conversation at dessert their host remarked shocking bad business that of the indian bradshaw very captain bradshaw said curtly you had no shares in it i hope not a penny captain bradshaw answered bad business for your nephew frank i hear hes completely done for furniture advertised fine young fellow sorry for himhavent seen much of him of late however it doesnt matter so much in his case hes got a good uncle eh bradshaw frank and myself have had a difference captain bradshaw said stiffly i have not spoken to him since his marriage god bless my soul the host said in much confusion i beg your pardonnever dreamt of itnever upon my life you have been away so long you see it is of no consequence captain bradshaw said calmly we will change the subject alice heathcote had heard all this in silence she felt that she was very pale and was grateful when the hostess to break the awkward silence that ensued rose as captain bradshaw finished speaking and gave the signal for the ladies to retire alice took up a book as an excuse for being silent sat down upon an ottoman apart from the others and thought over what she had heard frank ruined the furniture to be sold was it possible what would frank do what could he do frank had been very wicked very very wrong but still he had for many years been her playmate and brother could it be possible that he was absolutely ruined had nothing to live on what would he do and with a wife too the wife of whom he used to talk so lovingly and proudly to her and a little child too no no whatever frank had done he must not want while she was so rich frank at any rate should never be poor but how could she do it alice was still thinking over this when the gentlemen came upstairs the host came and took his seat on the ottoman by her my dear miss heathcote i am very sorry i made such a terrible mistake at dinner but i had no idea of it i understand now why maynard came here so seldomdropped our acquaintance in fact i was rather hurt about it as an old friend and that is why i did not ask him and his wife to meet you today he had refused me twice but what is this all about i always made sure he was to be captain bradshaws heir i cannot tell you what it is about mr pierce alice said simply but i am afraid it will never be made up please tell me is he really ruined i am afraid so in fact i am sure of it he himself once mentioned to me that he was a large shareholder in the indian and i happened to meet him the day before yesterday and as an old friend you know spoke to him about it and said i hoped he was not hit hard i am indeed he said about as hard as can be when the calls are made every penny i have goes did he seem very low spirited mr pierce oh no her host said he seemed just as usual spoke out in his cheery sort of way as if it was a matter of no very great importance to himself that he was talking about and i naturally supposed as i had always looked upon him as captain bradshaws heir that he was by no means anxious about the future and you say that there is no chance of the quarrel being made up i am sorry indeed such a nice lad as he was and such a fine fellow as he had grown up if there is anything i can do miss heathcote if as an old friend i can try to bring matters round you may rely upon me thank you alice said but it would not be of the slightest use it would make matters worse indeed no nothing can be done another of the gentlemen now coming up the conversation was changed and shortly afterwards captain bradshaws carriage was announced neither spoke upon their way home and the only words exchanged as they separated upon the stair were good night uncle good night alice you look tired the next morning alice looked pale and ill but her uncle made no observation they were silent at breakfast at last alice said resolutely uncle you will not be angry with me i dont know alice i hope not i have always been a good girl guardy havent i yes alice a very good girl i have never teased you or wanted to have my own way have i well alice you have not teased me more than was reasonable that a young woman should do and i dont know that i ever particularly wanted you to go any way you did not yourself like captain bradshaw spoke playfully but he quite guessed what alice was going to say and was fully prepared to resist her uncle you had heard before of frank having lost all his money yes i had heard it before alice captain bradshaw said and then muttered to himself and serve him right too uncle alice said pleadingly can you bear to think of frank with his young wife and a baby being in want in absolute want he must do as other people do my dear and work for his living he is strong enough alice saw that it was useless trying to move her uncle and that if she persisted he would only get into a passion and make what she had quite resolved to do the more difficult uncle harry you know that i quite think with you about frank quite agree with you that he can never be to us what he formerly was without he explains and expresses repentance and sorrow for the past and if i know anything at all of frank if he could not or would not do it when you first wrote to him and when he was comfortably off he will not do it now i quite agree with you there alice well uncle i dont wish to influence you at all but for the sake of old times for the sake of the boy i loved as a girl i will not let him want i believe uncle that i have absolute control over my fortune yes miss heathcote her uncle said coldly i am sorry to say that you have oh uncle alice said bursting into tears dont speak so to me you are the only person i have to love in the world but i must help frank well my dear the old man said more kindly have your own way a wilful woman you know but mind i dont oppose you simply because i cant if i could i would i tell you that fairly but if in spite of that you choose to have your own way i shall not quarrel with you about it i have had quarrelling enough in my time god knows and i am not going to quarrel with you thank you uncle alice said brightening up i am sorry i cant do as you want me i am really but i cannot help it i have fifty thousand pounds havent i yes alice if i want to get some of itand i do wanthow do i set about it the money is invested in my name alice as your trustee it was so put when you were a child and has never been altered because i was able to sign for your dividends without troubling you if you want any of it out you give me authority i write to a broker and give him authority and he manages it will you please to write uncle and tell him to sell out ten thousand pounds dont look angry uncle please dont well alice i will do as you desire me but mind frank wont take it oh uncle dont say that alice cried indeed she had worried so much over the difficulty of persuading her uncle to consent to her wishes that she had never thought of the probability or otherwise of franks accepting it well do you think it likely yourself alice but he mustnt know it comes from me uncle well my dear have your own way i will carry out your wishes as you desire but mark my words frank wont take it frank may have done a blackguard dishonourable action once but we cant have been altogether mistaken in him we cast him off when he was well off he will not receive assistance from us now no he would not for himself uncle but he has others to think of now very well my dear captain bradshaw said coldly try two or three days after this as frank and his wife were sitting by the fire after tea talking about their now rapidly approaching change a letter was brought in frank opened it he gave a low whistle of surprise what is it frank messrs hankey beg to inform mr frank maynard that a sum of ten thousand pounds has been paid in to open an account in his name will he please to give an early call at the bank to complete the necessary formalities messrs hankey are not at liberty to state the name of the person by whom the money has been paid in what do you think of that katie of course it comes from captain bradshaw i am surprised i confess i did not think he would have given in kate looked thoughtfully into the fire are you sure he has given in frank well i suppose so katie there is no one else among my circle of acquaintances who is likely to have paid anonymously ten thousand pounds on my account mind i am not saying that we are going to take it thats a thing to be talked over unless he apologises amply and fully for his conduct of course it would be out of the question and even then katie glanced up at her husband he evidently had no thought that the offer could have come from anyone else katies womans instinct had at once guessed the truth and a little jealous pang had shot through her that another woman should help her husband to help him with money too as she thought of alices proud cold face as she had passed frank in the street only a month or two before a feeling of anger took the place of jealousy dont you see frank it is not your uncle it is miss heathcote has sent you this do you think so kate well it is likely enough she was always the kindesthearted girl possible his wife pouted her lip a little and her colour rose well frank of course you know her better than i do i only saw her once and after that i would rather go out as a servant than take money from her i call it a wilful impertinence frank i call it a downright insult a woman whom you have known from a child and who cut you dead in the streets the other day to send you money now you are poor frank it is a downright insult and the blood mounted in kates cheek and her eyes flashed very indignantly frank looked at her first in surprise then in amusement come here katie his wife did not move come here katie do as you are told come and let me look at you no frank im not going to be talked over kate said sturdily but she came nevertheless you jealous little woman you have never forgiven alice for being silly enough to care for me years ago yes i have forgiven her frank there was nothing to forgive in it she had just as much right to fall in love with you as i had i would have loved her very much for your sake if she would have let me i should not have minded her doing as her guardian told her and ceasing to see you but i do mindyes frank i do mindher passing you as she did she looked hard and cold not the face of some one who dared not look but the face of one who would not and then now to send you money out of pity just as she might give to a beggar in the streets no wonder i am angry frank and katie looked very indignant indeed there is a good deal in what you say katie and no doubt i ought to be more angry than i am i hardly know why i am not except i am essentially an easy going man very likely i should be angry if i were in your place you do not know alice heathcote as i do i have known her since she was a little girl and i loved her as a sister katie you must remember that a man may be blind to the faults of one he loves as a wife but men are always hard upon their sisters now i looked upon alice as a sister and i know she is a very true very affectionate very thoughtful girl not given to sudden likes and dislikes or to be moved by sudden impulses i am certain then kate as certain as i sit here that some extraordinary mistake at the nature of which i cannot even guess has arisen alice might obey captain bradshaw and hold no communication with me but she would never i would wager my life look cold or hard when she met me if alice heathcote no longer loves me as a brother it is because she has in some strange way been morally convinced that i am not worthy of her esteem and if i know aliceand i think i do know herit has cost her no slight pain before she came to the conclusion kate was softened perhaps you are right frank but you must make allowances for me you know it is galling to a wife that her husband should be assisted by a woman who used to love him no one would like that frank you know you would not like it now if anyone who was once in love with meand you dont know how much i used to flirt before i knew youwere to come forward now and offer me moneyespecially if he had you considered behaved very badly in other respects no katie frank said heartily i certainly should not i should consider it to be a confoundedly impertinent interference and should be monstrously inclined to punch his head for him kate laughed happily oh you easygoing man there frank now you have granted that and so excused me let us talk rationally about it do you mean to take the money or not of course not katie i never dreamt of it why didnt you say so at once then you tiresome boy and not tease me into a rage you never gave me a chance katie frank laughed no dear i would not have taken it from captain bradshaw much less from alice although i should like to stay in england for your sakeit will be a hard life for you abroad little woman thats an old subject kate said cheerfully now frank get out your books again and let us go into the intricate question of where we shall go we have quite decided against the united states and canada havent we yes frank i should not like to be among people who would talk of us in a contemptuous sort of way as britishers and i cant bear cold it lies between the cape australia and new zealand and so they took out their books again and studied maps and the price of land and the question of provisions and labour until it was time to go to bed the next day frank happened to be going near mr binghams office he liked his uncle but he did not see much of him for mr bingham was a good deal away and their lives lay in completely different circles they had met once before since the failure of the bank so that mr bingham was acquainted with the state of franks affairs and so frank you are still talking of going abroad yes frank said there is nothing else that i can see for it i confess that for myself i rather like the thought it is just the sort of life to suit me but my wife will i know be sorry to leave england she is very cheerful you know and so on but i can see she dreads it a little it is so different for a woman you see to what it is for a man ive been thinking frank that it is a pity you dont make up your mind to set to at work in england fred and i have plenty of work all over the country we cant be everywhere at once and it would be a very great advantage to us to have some one we can rely upon as ourselves of course you dont understand engineering work but for earthworks for example mere pick and barrow work the men only want a good ganger and the masters eye over them i have just got a contract for twenty miles of railway in yorkshire now if you like to come down i will make a fair calculation and give you the earthwork the great thing with navvies is for them to like the man they work for you are just the sort of man they would be likely to get on with you will save me one or two inspectors and this sort of work is always done cheaper by piece work it is a good thing to get into you know frank you would not perhaps make very much the first job but you would learn the business and be able to do well afterwards frank was silent a short time i am very much obliged to you uncle and personally i should like nothing better in fact it is just the sort of thing to suit me it is your contract uncle not freds because you see i dont mind working under you or any man older than myself but i should not like working under a fellow of my own age especially a cousin it is mine frank between ourselves i have determined to keep this matter in my own hands fred and i dont always agree but to take a contract for work of that sort requires capital does it not uncle very little frank you see the men are paid once a week or once a fortnight as the case may be and the work is measured up and paid for by the contractor once a month so in fact you would only require a fortnights pay for the men of course at first the work begins upon a small scale as it is impossible until the cuttings are fairly opened to put very many men on two or three hundred pounds would be enough for a beginning i could manage that frank said i have spoken to the official assignee of the bank and have told him i am ready to give up every halfpenny i have to meet the call but that i must have the proceeds of my furniture to pay other little debts and so on and i expect after i have cleared them off to have a hundred and fifty or two hundred pounds left if i had been going to emigrate i should have asked my wifes friends to have helped me with as much more one can ask friends to help when one is going abroad for good well uncle of course i cannot decide at once but i will let you know tomorrow or next day do frank it is a good thing to get into i can assure you and as we are likely to have plenty of work i think it is a really good opening far better than going out to the colonies frank went round to prescotts room prescott old man i want you to come round and dine this evening there is something i want to ask the opinion of you and katie about prescott came down accordingly frank did not broach the subject until after dinner was over now katie i want your opinion upon an offer i have had today and i have asked prescott down on purpose to take part in our councils so i will state the case prescott shall give his opinion and you shall decide i have had an offer to stay in england his wife looked up eagerly for myself i am ready either to refuse or accept the offer with equal willingness it is the sort of work that would suit me and which i should likein fact it is a good deal like the work i should have abroad an active outofdoor life my uncle bingham has asked me if i would like to go down to undertake the earthworks that is the looking after the navvies on a line he has got the contract for in yorkshire i should take the subcontract of the earthworks and as he says learn the business in time i should be capable of undertaking larger and more important works and he has plenty of opportunities for pushing me on now what do you think of it neither kate nor prescott answered now prescott what is your opinion of it well frank it is a difficult matter to give an opinion upon i was always in favour of your emigrating for the simple reason that i did not see anything here which was likely to suit you but i never disguised from myself that you both your wife particularly would have to encounter many hardships it appears to me that this may really lead to something railway contracting is a profitable business and if your uncle really chooses to push you it is as he says a good opening now in australia or the cape taking a farm of five hundred acres as you think of doing and getting it into cultivation is the work of years there is no future in it you will no doubt make a living even a comfortable competency but there seems little chance of your ever making enough to come back to england to live upon your means there is another thing to be said if this should turn out badly if you should lose what little money you take down with you your friends will all help and you can but go to australia after all now what do you say katie oh i quite agree with arthur frank i dont want to go away and never see our friends again very well frank said then thats settled hurrah for railroads in another week the sale took place at the maynards a sale is not a picturesque sight with its dirty jew brokers its unwashed hangerson its close crowded atmosphere its voluble auctioneer and its eager bidders but it is a sad business for those who look in the slightest degree below the surface here are the ruins of a household almost every one of the articles so carelessly examined so slightingly looked at so jeeringly commented upon has its own little history its reminiscences which make it sacred to those who have to part with it the little childs chair the watercolour drawing which your wife gave you ere yet she was your wife the chair she always sat inthese and a hundred other things are sacred relics to you while they are caviare to the world around frank and kate had gone into lodgings upon the previous day having paid off the servants and handed over the house to the broker with one of their followers only had they not parted frank had called evan in and said evan here are your wages up to next week that will make the month from the time i gave you notice i am sorry to part with you lad but of course it cant be helped whenever you want a character you have only to refer to me evan made no sign of taking up the money please mr maynard he said im not going but you must go evan i am a poor man and cant keep a servant any longer i am going down to work on a railway well mr maynard i shall go down too i can get some work on the line i dare say and i can come in to help of an evening after what you have done for me sir after what you did for aunt bessy im not going to leave you now lor sir mother wont take me in if i was to go home and tell her id left you no sir where you go i go if i cant be your servant i can do a few odd jobs and make myself useful between times and so as evan positively refused to be separated from his old master it was arranged that he should go down and work on the line a fortnight afterwards frank and his wife started for yorkshire chapter iv showing the hoof landfarn is a quiet place in south yorkshire and may be rather called a large village than a town with a semirural semiagricultural population the staple of its manufactures is of course wool and there are five or six flannel factories either on the main stream the farn or nestled up in little side valleys upon its tributaries the country round is undulating and pretty franks first care upon arriving was to look out for a house and he was fortunate in finding a pretty furnished cottage with a garden and paddock upon a hill side at a little more than half a mile from the town it had been standing empty for some time and the rent was only thirtyfive pounds a year in a week from their arrival the maynards were installed in their new home engaging the old woman who had previously been there as servant and taking a young girl from landfarn as nurse for baby kate was charmed with their new abode it was so quiet and pretty so enclosed in trees that it seemed quite shut out from the world indeed it would have been better as she afterwards acknowledged had there been fewer trees for they kept the house damp and in winter the paper had an awkward habit of peeling off and everything had to be taken out of boxes and drawers once a fortnight for a thorough drying and airing as for the garden it was so steep that walking in it was a difficulty and from a seat at the upper end one could almost look down the chimneys but indeed there was a really beautiful view from the garden below was the broad valley with the farn winding backwards and forwards the opposite hills were covered to their very summits with trees away to the right lay landfarn itself with its light smoke curling up and its church watching over it altogether they were very fortunate and were ready to be pleased with everything the only drawback to their house was that it was situated on the side of the town opposite to that from which the new line was to start mr bingham had taken a large house upon the other side of landfarn and came down with mrs bingham and the girls a day or two after frank had got fairly established a day or two after frank went with him over the line at portions of which men were already at work fencing it in and mr bingham explained the plans to frank and gave him a few ideas as to his new work when do we begin uncle in a week i hope to cut the first sod frank and then we shall go on in earnest it will be a good plan for you to take four men and to dig holes five or six feet deep in the principal cuttings to see what nature the ground is we are sure to have plenty of offers from small contractors accustomed to this country and we shall get a fair idea of the value of the work for the next few days frank was very busy and in high spirits it wanted only two days to the day fixed for the commencement of the work when frank on going down to the binghams found mr bingham looking very serious anything the matter uncle yes indeed frank a very serious affair indeed it seems that the southwest yorkshire railway got a bill two years ago for a branch from here to leeds and the first two miles run over exactly the same ground that we do everyone thought they had dropped the line from want of capital but today they have got their men at work fencing of course i shall knock the fences down it will be arranged no doubt but it must cause a good deal of delay i am going up to town at once to see the directors this was indeed serious news for frank mr bingham had other works in hand and to him it was a matter of comparative indifference but to frank it was of vital importance this is indeed a bad business uncle do you think the delay is likely to last long i cant tell you frank you know now as much as i do i will write to you from london as soon as we get legal opinions on the subject frank went up to the cottage very disheartened he told his wife what had taken place oh frank this is unfortunate what had we better do dear dont you think we had better go up to london again at once and carry out our former plan well katie at any rate we had better wait a short time until we hear from mr bingham you see we have taken this house for six months certain and we have had all the expense of coming down here it will have made a large hole in our little capital dear yes frank but it would be better to put up with that than to wait here spending more and doing nothing so it would katie but at any rate we had better wait for another fortnight by that time we shall see whether it is going on or not it was nearly a fortnight before an answer came from mr bingham and it was highly satisfactory counsel were of opinion that the other party had not a leg to stand upon that they ought to have opposed when the bill was before the house and that the last act overrode the former one an early day was named for hearing the case and there was no doubt that the work would begin immediately after both frank and kate agreed that there was nothing for it but to wait in the meantime they had got to know the few gentry of the place mr larpent who lived in the great house down on the hillside below their cottage and who owned some mines at a short distance from landfarn mr larpent was a shrewd practical man and his wife was very friendly with mrs frank as for fanny larpent their daughter she and kate soon became as intimate as sisters and frank laughed and said if he had not married katie he should certainly have fallen in love with fanny larpent the doctor too soon became a great ally of franks a short stout hearty man with a fund of good sense and fun there were a few other families in the place itself or in its immediate neighbourhood the usual entourage of all small country towns the clergyman the lawyer a halfpay officer or two a few small landed proprietors and three or four of the owners of the principal woollen factories some of these called upon the maynards very shortly after their arrival and most of the others influenced by the favourable reports of the new comers soon followed their example landfarn rather prided itself upon being a sociable place and there were many quiet tea drinkings and whist parties and musical evenings altogether frank and his wife liked the place very much in the meantime the southwest yorkshire began work upon their part of the line beyond the disputed point and frank making friends with the inspector passed much of his time with him watching the works and learning his new business upon this line evan went to work and frank saw but little of him now for it was too far off to return at night to work weeks passed the news from london was always favourable mr bingham wrote that the work must begin before long this delay was very wearying to both kate and frankmore perhaps to her than to him for frank was essentially an easy going man while kate was as decidedly an impetuous woman sometimes mr bingham came down sometimes fred but the visits of the former decreased in number while those of his son became more frequent constantly frank was tempted to give it up and as often some unusually cheering piece of news would come and they would decide that it would be madness after waiting so long to throw it up and to lose the benefit of all these months of delay and of all the money that they had spent six months passed over thussix weary anxious monthsand then arrived the welcome news that both parties had agreed upon a compromise and that work was certain to begin in another month at the latest with this joyful intelligence however came the news that the contract had changed hands and that fred bingham was to be the contractor in place of his father frank was very much vexed at this change he had always liked his uncle and had perfect faith in his good intentions towards him fred he objected to work under as being of his own age besides stoutly as he had always supported him he had doubts he could not entirely suppress of his good faith besides which fred had been decidedly cool during his visits to landfarn however it was too late to draw back now the hundred and fifty pounds which frank had brought down with him were gone now scarcely a pound remained and there was nothing to do for it but to make the best of matters at last the news came that the compromise was arranged that the southwest yorkshire was to make the disputed piece of work and that both companies were to have the right of using it fred bingham was to come down with his wife at the end of the week and work was to begin at once from the point beyond the junction this time there were no more delays and upon the day appointed fred bingham came down and took possession the same evening frank went down to see him fred was in his smokingroom well fred frank began i congratulate you as well as myself that all this weary delay is over at last it has been a terrible trial yes fred said coolly it has been a nuisance i suppose we are to begin at once fred yes fred bingham answered on monday i have got several offers for the cuttings but fred it was arranged between your father and myself that i was to have all the earthwork ah fred said very likely but the old man has nothing to do with it now and i am not bound by any foolish arrangements he may have made frank grew very white but he controlled himself and do you mean to say fred putting aside the fact of our being cousins that after my coming down here at your fathers wish after being here all these months receiving not a pennywhile your clerks and men down here have been paid just as usualuntil every penny i have in the world is gonedo you mean to say you are going to throw me over now i am not going to throw you over as you call it fred said if you are ready to do the work on the same terms as other people you can have it these are the offers i have had and he pushed some letters across to frank they were illiterate badly spelt epistles evidently from working men the work cannot possibly be done on the terms fred frank said when he had glanced through them the ground is tough blue clay with stones just the same that they have got on the other line in many cases you must use powder to it these men are mere wandering navvies they will make money as long as they are merely at work on the easy surface stuff and then when they find it doesnt pay will go off without paying their men i will take the work on the terms which any responsible person is willing to tender for it at yes fred bingham said but the responsible person would find money and not call upon me the first saturday for the mens pay you tell me yourself you have no money for a moment the impulse upon frank maynard to seize his cousin by the throat and to thrash him to within an inch of his life almost overpowered him but the thought of his wife sitting at home of the bills he already owed in the town of the house on his hands for another quarter and that he was actually without a penny rushed upon him and with a tremendous effort he kept down his passion fred continued in some respects i would rather keep the work in my own hands now what i think of doing is this i will take the highest of these estimates sixpence a yard for clay and a shilling for rock now you shall work the men just as if they were your own i shall pay them if there is any profit at the end that is if we have done the work under this price we will divide it between us and in the meantime you shall draw two pounds a week to be charged of course against the work what do you say to that fred spoke cheerfully as if he were making a most liberal offer i am perfectly certain fred that the work cannot be done at the price still if those are your only terms i must accept them i have no choice and mind frank work is to be work i shall expect you to do just the same as any other inspector would do to be on the work before the men begin at six in the morning and to be there till they knock off at night again frank had a very hard struggle with himself his teeth were set hard and the veins on his forehead stood out like cords but he only said of course i shall do my work like other people good night fred bingham looked after him for some time with his smile upon his lips ill make you smart before ive done with you my fine fellow and then he went out into the night air oh katie frank said to himself as he shut the door you little know what i have stood tonight for your sake my god my god what is to become of us to think that i should have been such a gross idiot as to believe all these years in this infernal scoundrel what have i done to make him hate me like this god knows i have always taken his part since he was a boy have quarrelled for him have supported him against prescott and alice and kate and all and now at last when he knows i am helplessly in his power bound hand and foot he treats me as ifgood heavens i shall go mad oh if i could only get out of this only carry out our old plan but there it is too late now at any rate i must stop for a time if the worst comes to the worst katie and i must put our pride in our pockets and ask the drakes to lend us enough to take us abroad frank you are dreadfully pale kate said anxiously when he came in i knocked against the gate in the dark frank said deceiving his wife for the first time and shook myself a bit i shall be all right presently where did you hurt yourself frank in the side but it is no odds it was the shock more than anything the gate was half open and i ran against the end its really nothing katie well frank and is it all right is the work to begin at last yes darling thank god it begins on monday and there is no hitch nothing disagreeable with fred no kate we have mutually agreed as to the terms of the contract i am to do it at so much a yard and as each cutting is done i am to be paid the profit and in the meantime i am to draw two pounds a week two pounds that seems very little frank well it can hardly be termed wealth katie but our expenses here are very small and i dare say we shall manage well enough besides as each cutting is finished there will be the profit it is only a pound a week to live on frank the rent and hannah and nurse come to the other pound well we must try katie and if we cant make it do i must ask fred to let me draw a little more i did not wish to press matters the first time you see he will soon see how useful i shall be and then no doubt there will be no difficulty about arranging to draw more each week at any rate thank god katie i am going to earn something at last chapter v finding a clue and so frank set to work he was not a man to do things by halves and threw himself with all his energies into it every morning soon after halfpast four he was up after he was out of bed he lit a small spiritlamp made his coffee and had his early breakfast when he was dressed then at a little after five he started for his three mile walk to his work at which he always arrived before six then a turn along the line and back again to his startingpoint by halfpast eight when the men stopped work for half an hour to breakfast then frank would go into a little turf hut by the side of the cutting and eat with an appetite sharpened by the keen morning air the breakfast he had brought with him another turn up and down the line and then at twelve oclock he would have a fire lit in his hut and warm up his dinner then up and down again until six or if the men were working overtime until eight and then three miles home again it was very hard work and frank had sometimes to sit down by the roadside of that last steep pull up to his cottage once there however he was strong and cheery again for the bright face was always on the look out for him and his slippers and his easy coat and his hot water and his tea and the cheerful smile better than all were sure to be ready for him few of his old london friends would have known frank now in his rough shootingcoat his gaiters and navvy boots and the beard which he had allowed to grow since he came down to yorkshire during this time frank and his wife suffered far more for each other than for themselves kate bright and cheerful as she was when frank was with her fretted much when he was away more especially of an evening she would picture him to herself toiling along the dark road so tired that as she well knew he could hardly drag himself along frank too worried about his wife for himself hard terribly hard as his work was he did not so much mind it was the thought of her sitting at home by herself all those long hours worrying about him which troubled him his only satisfaction was that he was doing his best his very best to earn her a living franks was immensely popular with his men some men have the knack of getting on with working men and this knack frank possessed in the highest degree he had a cheery word and a ready jest for each when he passed him he was strict with his work and soon thoroughly understood it but the men knew he never blamed unless blame was really deserved and they looked up to the gaffer as frank was termed with all the rough affection of which navvies are eminently capable at first one or two rough fellows not knowing their man had ventured to be insolent when frank reproved them and were summarily dismissed when they had been paid he told them that now they were no longer in his service they were his equals and could treat him as such and so taking off his coat he gave them a tremendous thrashing after that he had no trouble whatever and the rest of his men liked him all the better for it a few days after work had begun katie had gone down to call upon mrs fred mrs fred had been very glad to see her and promised to come up in a few days but her husband when he heard of kates visit told his wife that he did not choose that she should visit his inspectors wives and that he forbade positively her going up to the cottage a prohibition which his wife though with many quiet tears was forced to obey fred bingham by no means made himself popular with the people of the neighbourhood and after a time they ceased to call frank although reticent to kate as to his grievances was outspoken enough to the doctor and his other friends and fred bingham got a bad name in the place although he himself did not care about visiting it annoyed him exceedingly on sundays when they came out of church to see that frank and his wife were greeted warmly by all the people of the place while they merely drew by to let himself and his wife pass with a distant bow frank and his wife soon found that twenty shillings a week was an impossible sum to live on and in spite of her utmost economy the bills accumulated in a way which caused kate many a weary hour of anxiety indeed they could not have held on had it not been that three times they received assistance the first was when their second child was born about five months after the work began when the event was approaching frank had written to prescott and his friend had sent him twenty pounds the second help was a week or two after babys advent when a letter arrived from mrs drake who was quite in ignorance of the state of their circumstances and sent a present of twenty pounds also for christening things for the newcomer the third present came three months later and for this they had to thank though unwittingly fred bingham fred had been up in london and as was his invariable custom upon these occasions had called upon his uncle captain bradshaw was out but miss heathcote was at home now between alice and fred there was a feud which had existed ever since she had rejected him he had never forgiven her for refusing him and indeed next only to frank maynard hated her beyond any living thing alice on her part despised him she had looked upon him with absolute contempt not unmingled with fear since the occasion when he had taunted her with her love for frank it was only for captain bradshaws sake that she bore with him but so great was her love for her uncle that she would not by look or word say anything before or to him to shake his confidence in fred she knew he liked fred not as he had loved frank but with a passive sort of liking and that he looked upon him as his only possible heir fred perfectly understood her motive for silence and showed himself to her as he really was in a way he did not often show himself to any one except his wife upon the present occasion he went in how are you getting on down in yorkshire fred pretty well alice nothing to grumble about fred alice said i have been waiting to get an opportunity of speaking to you alone i want to ask you how frank maynard is getting on i have no one to ask but yourself i know it is an interesting subject fred sneered alices eyes flashed yes he continued you need not look angry alice he is getting on as well as he could expect i suppose and how well is that fred well said fred carelessly he is a sort of inspector and what are an inspectors duties fred what does he have to do well he has to be on the work at six oclockunfortunately he lives three miles away but thats his businesshe has to be there at six and he has to look after the men all day till six in the evening that is if the men aint working overtimeif they are he is there till eight and has he a horse fred a horse fred said scornfully no thank you i dont have my inspectors riding about on horseback do you mean to say fred that frank maynard has to walk to work three miles of a morning and back at night and to be on his feet all day of course fred said what would you have alice bit her lips until the blood nearly came and how much do you pay him per week for work like this two pounds a week really two pounds a week yes that is the exact figure alice heathcote drew her breath hard then she got up and rang the bell the servant came james show mr bingham to the door and remember he is never to be admitted unless my uncle is at home fred bingham hesitated but there was a look of white anger in alices face that warned him she was perfectly in earnest and as she stood looking more even than her natural height in her passion with her compressed lips and little clenched hands fred thought that for once he had gone too far and without a word went out when james had left the room alice walked up and down for a few times and then throwing herself upon the sofa cried bitterly presently she rose went up to her room and wrote a note dear mr prescott the matter on which i write is between ourselves alone and i rely upon you to keep it so although matters have occurred which make it impossible that the breach between your friend and us can ever be healed still it pains me beyond description to hear that he is working down in yorkshire from morning to night upon pay which can scarcely keep him and his family from starvation i would do anything to save him from this wretched state but he will i know accept nothing at my hands i enclose three ten pound notes you will understand that i enclose this sum only because i know that he would not receive more will you do me the very great kindness to manage it as a loan from yourself it is a harmless fraud and i can think of no other method will you tell him you have had a heavy case on and are enabled without hurting yourself to offer him the money without inconvenience please do this mr prescott i ask you both for your friends sake and in the name of the long standing regard which has always existed between yourself and yours sincerely alice heathcote and so frank received another thirty pounds from prescott which he accepted without hesitation believing that prescott could spare it and knowing that under similar circumstances his own purse would have been entirely at his friends service for a time therefore the maynards were straight again the tradesmens bills which had pressed so heavily were paid off and a few things which were most urgently required were purchased all this while fred bingham had apparently been on friendly terms with frank at times he was cold and distant with him carrying his position as master to the very extreme of what he saw frank would bear at other times he chatted with him in the most friendly mannerand it is difficult to say under which mood frank found it most difficult to keep his temper sometimes he would go up on sunday afternoon and smoke a pipe on the seat in front of the cottage chatting with frank and ignoring altogether his wifes short answers and evident dislike of his presence for kate when she did not like any one made no secret of her feelings you are very high and mighty my lady he said to himself one day as he drove homewards in his handsome dogcart but ill give you something to think of before long a few days afterwards he walked into franks cottage in the afternoon to kates great astonishment was just riding by mrs frank and thought i would come in to have a chat thank you kate said but im particularly busy today oh dont mind me mrs frank im no stranger you know i wish you were kate muttered half audibly i wanted to talk to you about frank you see this life is a very hard one for him and it is greatly to be wished that something could be done for him it is not i that make it hard for him kate said pointedly i have broken no promises i didnt tempt him to come down here and then make him work almost like a common navvy no quite so mrs frank fred said composedly but that is not now to the point what i was thinking of is could not this unfortunate quarrel between frank and his uncle be made up kate looked full at him with her honest eyes i expect mr bingham you know more of the quarrel than we do fred bingham coloured a little i suppose we both know pretty well all about it mrs frank it has been a most unfortunate circumstance but i should think that captain bradshaw by this time would be able to make allowances and to overlook the past kate rose from her seat her little figure looking grand in its indignation i dont know what you mean fred bingham but if you mean that frank has done anything which requires to be forgiven or looked over youre telling a lie and i franks wife tell you so what fred bingham said in tones of surprise has frank really kept you in ignorance all this time of the cause of quarrel i always thought you were the most forgiving of women but i see now by your manner that you do not know i know all that frank knows kate said and that is just nothing really i am sorry fred bingham began because if you are in ignorance of this sad affair it makes it so much the more difficult to make it up with captain bradshaw but i think that if you did but know it you might be able to act as mediator and i feel sure my uncle could not bear malice any longer i do so wish to see things made up that if you will promise solemnly to keep it a secret painful as it is i will tell you the real cause of quarrel you see stop fred bingham stop kate cried impetuously do not dare to say a word to me not for fifty times captain bradshaws money would i hear a word against frank and more than that do you think after what i know of you that i would believe you if you took an oath on the bible dont speak sir she said passionately i warn you if you say a word one single word i will tell my husband and if you know him as well as i do you will know that if he thought you were trying to make mischief between us he would beat you like a dog before all your men i only wished to put matters straight fred bingham said cowed by the might of kates anger you did not fred bingham you never wished to do anything of the sort i dont believe you ever wanted to do a good action from the day you were born you simply wanted to make mischief you only wanted to tell me a lie under promise of secrecy i swear to you fred bingham said that what i was going to tell you captain bradshaw will corroborate if you write to him then likely enough fred bingham you lied to him as well as to me you are quite capable of it and now go you may rely that for franks sake though not for yours i shall not mention that you have been here but if you ever come again when i am alone and try to make mischief between frank and me i will tell him whatever the consequences may be fred bingham went away crestfallen and never came up to the cottage again two more months passed it is nearly a year since frank began work at landfarn things are unchanged it is a sunday afternoon which frank and kate always look forward to during the whole week as the one day when they are happy together after church if it is fine frank sits in front of the cottage and plays with charley who is now two years old katie sits by his side and reads to him or talks of old days they are very happy there and agree that on sunday the works shall never be alluded to evan does a little in the garden or helps jane to carry the baby about evan has been on the works ever since they began he is eighteen now and his navvy work has widened him out into a broad young fellow he does not live at the cottage it is too far from his work but he comes up on saturday afternoon when the pay is over and stops until monday morning working in the garden and making himself useful in many little ways on the day in question the afternoon was wet and frank had for want of anything else to do been turning over his desk and tearing up the accumulated letters of months among other letters which he had so treated was the one which he himself had written to captain bradshaw and which had been returned unopened its no use keeping that any longer he had said to his wife it is not a pleasant thing to stare one in the face every time one opens ones desk kate nodded and the letter was torn to pieces and with its envelope thrown carelessly with the others presently evan came in with charley on his shoulders having been engaged in a game of romps with him in the next room evan will you take out all the scraps and burn them and tell hannah she can lay the cloth evan gathered up the fragments and left the room in about five minutes he returned with a serious face and with an envelope in his hand what is it evan please sir i was dropping the pieces one by one into the kitchen fire when i see this envelope yes evan and what is there peculiar about that envelope frank asked amused for the lad looked so unnaturally serious that he could hardly help smiling please sir theres a seal on it yes evan its unbroken do you remember katie my tearing the letter open so as to show you the seal yes frank i remember it quite well please sir isnt the seal a hand yes evan its a hand but its only three fingers hasnt it sir yes evan it has only three fingers its a crest but what is there curious in that well sir its curious because i never saw a hand with three fingers on before but ive heard mother say that brother james you know sir him as is a cripple when his mother died she had a seal round her neck with only three fingers god bless me evan that is very curious very frank said very interested if this should only turn out as i think by jove katie it would put that little blackguards nose out of joint and no mistake what do you mean frank i dont know what you are talking about i will tell you dear let me see evan how old is james now hes rather better than twenty sir just so katie of course it may not be so but if it is not its a curious coincidence youve heard me say that captain bradshaw had a daughter who married and ran away from home and that uncle never heard of her till he heard she was dead and had died in great want yes i remember frank well katie as nearly as i can tell that is about twentyone years ago now it is really possible that this poor woman who died at the holls was her and that this is her son whom captain bradshaw has never known was alive a threefingered hand is not a common crest i will write to prescott at once and ask him to go into the affair oh katie if it should turn out so it will be glorious of course my uncle will leave him a part anyhow of his estate by jove i can forgive uncle having sent back my letter unanswered if it is the means of finding his grandson and doing fred bingham out of part of the fortune chapter vi strange tidings arthur prescott was one day surprised at the receipt of the following letter from frank maynard my dear old prescott i am not a good letter writer and when things are not going on well i dont write at all things are not going on well and i have not written you and katie and everyone else have been right and i have been wrong and fred bingham is a damned scoundrel but thats no news and i am not writing about that now i am writing about a very extraordinary discovery which has been made here this afternoon i was clearing out my desk and tore up a lot of old letters and things evan who is a firstrate lad and as true as steel cleared up the letters and seeing a seal unbroken looked at it it was the seal of the last letter i had from captain bradshawhis crest you know the threefingered hand well evan asserts that the mother of the cripple lad had a seal round her neck with a threefingered hand if so it is possiblenay probable that this lad is captain bradshaws grandson whether he knows of it or not i cannot say in spite of his inexplicable conduct to me i cannot believe it this is quite in your line old man and i leave you to act as you think best i think my uncle ought to be told in case he should be ignorant of it yours very affectionately frank maynard prescott read the letter through twice and then putting on his hat went straight down to mrs holl he was greatly shocked at the striking change which had taken place in the appearance of the cripple lad but after the first greeting said james i want to talk to your mother would you mind going into the next room for a few minutes james wheeled his box into his room and mrs holl closed the door how dreadfully ill he looks mrs holl ay sir and he is ill he frets and mopes here and i fear nothing but change which the doctor says he ought to have can save him poor lad i fear me he wont be here long we must hope better things mrs holl and the matter i have come about may lead to it lor sir mrs holl said how can that be a curious discovery has been made mrs holl which may i dont say will lead to our tracing who his mother was you dont say so sir mrs holl said i do indeed mrs holl i hear from evan that his mother had a seal with a threefingered hand upon it have you got it yes sir i have it locked up please let me see it mrs holl produced from a chest a small bundle of clothes and carefully done up in paper a small seal prescott examined it there was no question that it was a threefingered hand were these her things mrs holl yes sir thats all there were now mrs holl if i am right the linen will be marked l b or at any rate l something l b were the maiden initials of the lady and as she died little over a year after her marriagefor she was i believe marriedit is probable her clothes would bear her maiden initials yes sir sure enough they are marked l b i remember it was l b because i looked particular to see if they were marked in full in hopes of finding out about her there it is sir l b clear enough and now mrs holl have you any reason to suppose any one has ever had any interest or watched the boy yes sir that there has and here mrs holl related at length the history of the mysterious visits of barton and how they had found out that he had once been a bow street runner but now kept a private detective office prescott looked serious this is bad news mrs holl it looks as if the boys friends knew of his whereabouts but did not choose to own him however it may not be so he said thoughtfully this man may have found it out accidentally and kept it dark with a purpose of making money some day out of the secret and now mrs holl what year was it the poor woman came here in may sir her child was about two months old then that will do mrs holl please lend me the seal i will take great care of it do not say anything to james i may be mistaken and nothing may come of it after all i will see you again tomorrow or next day prescott walked away very slowly and went the whole length of sloane street up and down thinking over the best course to pursue he then turned into lowndes square and knocked at the door which was once so familiar to him is captain bradshaw in yes sir and prescott was shown into the drawingroom captain bradshaw and miss heathcote were both there and prescott who in the thoughts of the important business in hand had forgotten the possibility of his meeting alice stood for a moment irresolute captain bradshaw frowned heavily for a moment on hearing the name alice heathcote turned a little pale mr prescott i am glad to see you captain bradshaw said coming forward and shaking hands alice you remember mr prescott alice did and shook hands too and really warmly in the first place because with a womans intuition she had known of old that he had loved her and in the next place because he was franks dearest friend why she should have liked him for the last reason she could not have explained even to herself mr prescott captain bradshaw went on i am really glad to see you and shall be always happy to do so but only upon the condition the absolute condition that you make no allusion to past times or to other persons in fact that you come here as mr prescott to see an old friend and not in the quality of an ambassador for other people i do not come here in the quality of an ambassador captain bradshaw prescott answered quietly although you would naturally suppose so from my coming at all nor do i come here to renew an acquaintance which i valued and should still value at the highest rate greatly as i value it i could not accept friendship when my best and truest and most valued friend is excluded i do not wish to discuss the point with you captain bradshaw i know what your feelings on the subject must be when you can deliberately cast off a man whom i know you loved but the origin of those feelings is to me an utter mystery i respect them however and you i am sure will respect the friendship the love i have for a man whom i have for many years looked upon as a brother the business i have come upon is of an entirely different nature i give you my honour it relates in no way to what we have spoken of may i ask you to give me a few minutes private conversation alice heathcote rose thank you mr prescott she said warmly giving him her hand for what you have said i always believed in you that you were honest and true thank you for your defence of your friend i am glad yes i am glad to hear him once again spoken well of tell frankyes uncle i must speak nowtell frank that although i cannot struggle against certainties still that i cannot believe the worst of him tell him that though our paths in life can never come together again i wish him and his heartily well and believe and trust that that life will atone as far as atonement can be made for his error before prescott could speak she had pressed his hand and left the drawingroom prescott turned to captain bradshaw and was about to demand what franks fault had been that he should be thus spoken of when the old man rose and said gravely no mr prescott i will not listen to you i will not answer any questions if you are ignorant of the cause of the division between myself and my nephew a division which nothing can possibly heal remain in ignorance frank has his own trials now god forbid that i should say aught which might deprive him of a friend like yourself nothing you could say would do that prescott said gravely but now sir to the business upon which i came it is like the other a painful an extremely painful business and you will i know believe that nothing but the feeling of its extreme importance could lead me to ask you the question with which i must begin you had a daughter named laura captain bradshaw turned deadly pale a look of extreme pain came across his face and he gasped hoarsely forbear sir forbear you do not know what you are saying it is twenty years since i heard her name mentioned how dare you call her up again and he laid a trembling hand upon prescotts shoulder forgive me captain bradshaw i know at least i can guess the pain i am causing but i must do it pray sit down sir and pray answer my questions i will ask as few as possible i will simply relate facts if i am wrong stop me captain bradshaw sank back into his chair conquered by the steady calmness of his visitor and buried his face in his hands at the end of the year or at the beginning of you discovered that she had made a marriage with a person much beneath her she left the house and i believe you never saw her again you never forgave her i did sir the old man said passionately i did forgive her i searched all england through for her but i never heard of her until god help me i heard she was dead thank god for that at least prescott said the man or one of the men you employed to trace your daughter was a bow street runner named barton it was the old man said feebly though how you should know i cannot tell now captain bradshaw for my last question this barton told you and told you truly that your daughter was dead but did he ever tell you she had left a child behind her a child the old man almost screamed a child laura left a child dont say it dont say it have i not been punished enough for my cruelty by knowing that my girl my only girl laura died of want and now you say she left a child a child in misery and want and i rolling in wealth have never helped it oh my god my god it is too much and the old man sank down in his chair sobbing like a child prescott did not interrupt him indeed he was too much affected at the sight of the old mans agony to be able to trust himself to speak at last he said it is not so bad as you imagine sir the child has been brought up in poverty but not in want he has been kindly nurtured and cared for by the poor people in whose house his mother died all that love and kindness could do for him has been done as they took the mother in and cared for her and nursed her to the last so they adopted the child as their own they never knew who he was it has been discovered now only by accident this seal sir which was the sole article of value she possesseddo you recognise it the old man took it and his tears fell more gently as he looked at it yes it was hers he said i gave it her when she went to school poor child poor child then starting up he went on but why do we wait herewhy do we not go to fetch him my dear sir prescott said gently i must prepare you for this meeting the boy when very young had an accident which injured his spine and he has been a helpless cripple ever since he is now very ill the doctors recommend change of air and scene and i trust that they will restore him to health he is an extraordinary young man he is of the highest intelligence and has educated himself in a wonderful way save that he is a cripple you might well be proud of your grandson the old man groaned oh if i had but known it if i had but known it why did not barton find out he did captain bradshaw he has known it all the time impossible captain bradshaw exclaimed impossible it is true sir he has never lost sight of him he has been in the habit of coming to see him every few months the atrocious villain the infernal scoundrel captain bradshaw exclaimed furiously why did he not tell mewhat was his motive i can only imagine sir that he intended to keep it secret until the boy came of age in order to get him to promise a very large sum of money upon being placed in possession of proofs of his birth the scoundrel the villain ejaculated captain bradshaw almost beside himself with passion i will punish him i will kill him mr prescott you are a lawyer i will give ten thousand pounds to have him hung we will talk of that presently prescott said soothingly in the meantime the great point is to get your grandson here of course of course captain bradshaw said the current of his thoughts again changed i will tell alice first and he went to the door alice alice come down directly miss heathcote soon entered the room and was astounded at seeing her uncle walking up and down the room with the tears flowing down his cheeks alice he said i am a miserable old man i drove my daughter from her home in a fit of rage i tried afterwards to find her but i never heard of her until it was too late and the news came to me she was deadhad died of want alice think of thatand now i hear all these years afterwards that she has left a son behind her and he has grown up a cripple brought up by the charity of some poor people whom said the old man solemnly may god bless for their goodness alice was too surprised to make any comment upon this story but could only kiss her uncle soothingly then she turned to prescott for further explanation sit down captain bradshaw he said for a few minutes and recover your composure i will tell you all i know about it the two sat down while prescott related all he knew of the story beginning with his first meeting the lad telling mrs holls story as nearly in her own words as he could recall it at which point the tears flowed fast again from the eyes of both the old man and miss heathcote he then simply said that the boy evan who was with frank down in yorkshire had recognised the crest upon an old letter of captain bradshaws as being identical with the one owned by jamess mother when he had done captain bradshaw said thank you very much for what you have done in this case and now how shall we get the boy here i think sir if you will allow me i will go down to the livery stables at knightsbridge and get an invalid carriage and order it to come round here at once with a couple of men then we will walk round together and i will go in first and prepare him for it thank you mr prescott thank you very much and alice heathcote looked a thankyou which far more than repaid prescott for his exertions chapter vii owned at last prescott went with captain bradshaw and alice heathcote as far as the street in which the holls lived the carriage waiting in sloane street until wanted then prescott pointed out the house and asked the others to wait near for a few minutes until he should summon them he then lifted the latch and went in i am back sooner than i expected mrs holl do not leave james as the boy was preparing to wheel himself away i wish you to hear what i have to say james it must no doubt have often seemed hard to you that you should have no one in the world with whom you are really connected whose care and love you had a right to claim sometimes it has sir the cripple said quietly but i need not have thought so no one could have loved me more or have been kinder to me than mother and father here and he took mrs holls hand in his yes james you have been indeed fortunate in that respect but others might have perhaps had it in their power to lighten your life more to have taken you to see the world and the wonders and beauties of it the lads eyes brightened they might sir and i ownit is wrong and sinful perhapsbut the one thing i have always longed for was to see the country and the wide fields and the green trees i have read of and above all to see the sea the great moving infinite sea oh how glorious it must be but there sir he said resuming his quiet manner it wasnt to be you know and it is not for me to complain why do you ask such questions sir i will tell you james and here prescott went slowly and plainly through the narrative of the quarrel of jamess mother with her father of her flight and of the treachery of barton in concealing the fact of his existence from captain bradshaw the cripple listened to it all with greater composure than mrs holl did only when prescott described the emotion of captain bradshaw did he appear affected it is a strange story sir he said when prescott had finished and i am very glad to hear my poor mother was forgiven for myself sir it makes but little difference i am not like other men still it will be a pleasure to me to be able to have what books i like and to see for the first time the world after what you have told me of my grandfather i shall be glad if only for his sake had he been a cold proud man who would have been ashamed of his cripple relative i would have remained here where all have been so kind to me my real father and mother are here dont think of us james mrs holl said crying john and me will be only too glad to know you have doctors and comforts and change of air such as we could not give you no dont you worry yourself about us james your grandfather is waiting outside james with his niece may they come in it was a touching scene when captain bradshaw entered he paused at the door and looked wistfully at the pale figure in his quaint chair then he came forward and took the lads thin hand in his my poor boy my poor boy he said my lauras child to think you should have been all these years so near to me and that i should never have dreamt of your existence james i have to ask your pardon it is too late to ask hers now for the past i would have atoned it to her but i could not let me atone it to you poor grandfather the lad said it has been hard on you too all these yearsharder than on me you could not find a child againi found another mother yes indeed the old man said and turning to mrs holl who was standing by crying audibly you good woman how can i thank you what can i say to you in my dead childs name and in my own but mrs holl you and your husband will surely have your reward you know the words i was naked and ye clothed me sick and ye visited me hungry and ye took me in god will bless you no thanks i can give you can repay you as your own good conscience must do i never can repay you and yet mrs holl in some way or other you shall find harry bradshaw is not ungrateful dont talk of it sir mrs holl sobbed me and john only did our duty and it was a real pleasure too for james has always been a happiness and a comfort to us cept as to his accident he has never caused us a sore moment and now mrs holl you will spare him to me the old man said you have i hear other children she was my only one my claim is as nothing to yours but for his own sake you will let him go lor yes sir and glad to know he is with his own people and well cared for but you will let us come to see him sometimes mrs holl was soon assured upon this point and captain bradshaw then turned again to his grandson who during this time had been talking to alice heathcote or prescott the lad was pleased and happy with his new relations as to captain bradshaws earnestness there could be no doubt and the lad felt in looking up at alice and in listening to her quiet gentle voice that it would be indeed pleasant to live with people like these who would understand his thoughts and feelings as the kind friends around him could never have done but he refused to assent to captain bradshaws proposition that the carriage should come to take him away no grandfather he said i cannot go away and let father come home and find i have gone without a word i must see him first please go home now sir i should like to think it all over and to talk with mother here in a few days i will come but not now in vain captain bradshawwho greatly admired the thoughtful kindness of the lads decisionargued against it in vain mrs holl entreated him with tears in her eyes not to mind them but to go with his new friends the boy was firm and captain bradshaw could not but respect his decision the next morning captain bradshaw and alice again called and again the next day but it was not until the third day that james gave way to the entreaties of all around him and consented to leave those who had for so many years acted as parents to him by eight oclock that evening he was comfortably installed in an invalid chair in the drawingroom at lowndes square that was a wonderful evening to him the spacious room the handsome furniture the soft light of the candlesthe whole atmosphere of comfort and luxury were almost bewildering to him who had scarcely from his earliest remembrance passed the threshold of the home he had lived in very delightful to his ear was the pleasant talk of captain bradshaw and the softened accents of alice heathcote and when the latter at her uncles request sat down and sang to him he could hardly believe that it was all true and that he was indeed always to live in this atmosphere of refinement and luxury not less were his newlyfound relatives pleased with him they were surprised at his easy and quiet mode of addressing himself and at the acquaintance which he showed with books and literature he was well read in the countries they had travelled in and took his part in conversation quietly but with modest confidence the next evening prescott came to dinner james had been carried down in his chair and to him the rich appointments of the dinner table and the various strange dishes were a matter of extreme surprise but with native good breeding he expressed nothing of what he felt but took his part gaily in the conversation after dinner captain bradshaw said now james you can either stop down here and hear us talk or you can go up stairs with alice and ask her to play to you i will go up stairs if you will allow me james said and prescott almost envied him as his chair was carried out of the room followed by alice he is a fine fellow mr prescott i am proud of him ah if he had not been a cripple and the old man sighed he is very weak too but i think he looks better already i think he does sir prescott said i feel confident that the change will do him good and now captain bradshaw i am going to ask what steps you are going to take to prove that this lad is your grandson prove it captain bradshaw said surprised why there is no doubt about the matter to our minds no prescott said the seal the initials on the clothing and the agreements of dates and ages are quite sufficient still it would be of course satisfactory both to yourself and him to have the case put in a shape which no one could doubt there is no doubt for instance in our minds of the marriage of his mother because you had it from her own lips but it would be desirable to have the certificate as also the register of the boys birth and some sort of proof if obtainable that the poor lady who died at mrs holls was his mother and your daughter as you say it would be better mr prescott as far as the estates go it makes no difference i have no son so the entail is broken and i can leave them as i choose and it will therefore make no actual difference whether james is legally proved to be my heir or not still it would be as you say desirable how is it to be done well prescott said hesitatingly unquestionably the best plan would be to go to barton i have no doubt he has carefully procured all the necessary evidence he may perhaps demand an exorbitant sum but now that he must see he will get nothing in the way he had intended we may make terms with him no no mr prescott captain bradshaw said striking the table with his hand not one farthing shall that infernal scoundrel get from menot one single farthing if it had not been for himbut there i shall only get in a passion if i talk about him and captain bradshaw gulped down a glass of wine with a force and fury which nearly deprived him of breath well sir in that case we must try other meansadvertising and so on i will if you will entrust the matter to me think the matter over and set about it quietly do mr prescott i am greatly indebted to you for your kindness already very greatly and only wishthere i see what you are going to say dont say it but i have been thinking it over and nowyes i knew there was something else i wanted to speak to you about and to ask you to do for me about those good people the holls you know i cant offer them money but anything money could buy you know anything i would do for them prescott thought for a minute i should say sir the way to make john holl a rich man in his own way would be to buy him two or three carts and half a dozen horses and to purchase some little established connection at the same time as a carrier or dust contractor or something of that sort the very thing captain bradshaw said i give you carte blanche buy the lease you know of the house and furniture and stable and all that make all the arrangements and come to me when you have done for a cheque for the amount and above all dont be afraid of making it too large there i am glad thats off my mind now if you wont take any more wine well go upstairs upon the following evening at halfpast eight when he knew that the children would be in bed and that john holl would be smoking his pipe prescott went down to his house he had made john holls acquaintance at the time when he had seen about the arrangements for bessys sailing to join her husband in australia i am main glad to see you mr prescott sit down sir we had a letter from our evan this morning he seems to like navvying work very much evan does and lor how fond he is of mr maynard to be sure but there that aint to be wondered at he be an outandouter theres no mistake about he shocking bad job his losing all his money in that there bank werent it sir it was mr holl prescott said lighting his pipe a very bad business indeed please sit down mrs holl else i shant be able to talk to john here mrs holl took her work and sat down at the table a strange thing your james turning out to be a rich man at last john ay that were a rum turn out sir sarahs been to see him today and she says he seems as comfortable and as right as ninepence i have known captain bradshaw for a long time john and i am sure he and james will get on capitally together what tickles my fancy mr prescott john said taking his pipe out of his mouth and laughing to himself what tickles my fancy more than all the rest is to think that chap barton after all the years of snuffing and smelling about here aint going to get anything out of it to think he knew all along as how as james were captain bradshaws grandson and never said a word about it i wouldnt mind giving a poundwell no i dont know as id mind giving five poundfor a turn up with him for half an hour hes a pretty stiff one but i think john holl said meditatingly i think id give him soup in half an hour i wish i could pay him out and i aint quite sure i cant perkinsyou know perkins sir of the stunners prescott nodded well ive heard perkins say that the sloggerknow the slogger mr prescott prescott again noddedthat the slogger says as how he knows that against barton as would make his life not worth a brass farthing if it was known indeed prescott said much interested i think i will go down and see the slogger john barton has got some papers or rather knows where to get them which are essential to prove legally who james is and if i could put the screw on to him i might get him to tell me all about it well sir its friday tonight you wont find him at the stunners tomorrows the night for the stunners and you are safe to catch him there then and i expect hell tell you sharp enough if he thinks it will do barton a bad turn he hates him like poison i know for barton got his brother transported four or five years back and i have heard him swear he would be square with barton some day yet i will go down john i used often to be at the stunners years ago with mr maynard and how goes business john pretty much as usual sir dust is pretty steady its looking up though dust is theyre making such a sight of bricks round london now that cinders fetch their price i can remember when dust warnt worth next to nothing and the contractor was paid for carting it away lor bless you its as good as money now the gaffer as i works for hes made a snug thing of it i hear hes going out of it with enough to live on at one time he could scarce pay his men it used to be a doubt in my mind all the week whether i would get my money on saturday night and now they say he has got his five thousand pounds and hes going to give it up and go down into the country how many carts has he mr holl hes got eight carts and fifteen horses some are double carts and some single you see johnsons his name down beyond cremorne i dont suppose it will make much odds to me he has promised to pass me over to the new gaffer when he sells off are you going sir yes mr holl it is almost time i was off good night good night mrs holl i daresay i shall see you before long again chapter viii scotching a snake at nine oclock the next morning prescott went into the lively stunners perkins was as usual at his post behind the bar in his shirtsleeves well perkins how go things with you lor mr prescott what a time it is since youve been into the old crib to be sure the sight of you is good for ones eyes come inside sir and he shook hands warmly with prescott and led the way into his snuggery behind the bar a mere slip of a room but comfortable and decorated with the portraits of many worthies of the ring in fighting costume and defiant attitudesnot perhaps a handsome set of men but with an undeniable development of biceps in the post of honour over the mantelpiece was the portrait of perkins himself in fighting costume as he appeared on standing up for the first round of that celebrated fight of his with unknown his portrait as taken in the sixtyfirst and last round of that tournament would have been less pleasant to see upon the mantelpiece were several silver cups with inscriptions stating that they had been presented to perkins by admirers of his science endurance and british pluck sit down mr prescott and light up these cigars are a good brand now sir name your liquor prescott named his liquor perkins himself mixed it and then having left the charge of the bar to his assistant took his seat by prescott and how go things with you perkins bobbish mr prescott bobbish no great shakes perhaps but nothing to grumble about i dont think the young swells are quite what they were stroll in you know and look on but dont go in so much for work as they used to do dont take their punishment so kindly you know bad job that about mr maynard sir heard about it from john holl holls boy being in his service now he was what i call firstrate just firstrate shoulder a little too low perhaps but i defy any man to point out another blemish wonderful quick for a heavy weight and such a hitter i tell you what mr prescott though i shouldnt like it to go further i never put on the gloves with any man that i felt so unsafe with as with mr maynard he stood just a little over me he was as active on his pins as a kitten and very quick with his head he didnt mind how hard you hit him never lost his temper but was always there and then just when you didnt expect it out would come his left like a sledgehammer and his right after it ah he was a outandouter a champion spoilt sir i call him a champion spoilt id have backed him against the slasher sir and put every halfpenny i had on it prescott laughed yes he is an awkward customer perkins and now whats going on upstairs theres a few of the old lot and half a dozen novices will you walk up presently sir is the slogger here yes hes here sir unsteady hand the sloggercant keep him off his lush always breaks down in his training ive stood twenty on him twice but its no good so hes give up work and comes here regular to spar worst of him is he will get on late and make a row you remember mr maynard paid his fines and took him out twice hes better than he used to be i had to tell him that he must give it up or clear out for he got my place a bad name i want to have a talk with him perkins a man named bartoni believe from what john holl says you have met him at his placehas got some papers relating to a cousin of mr maynards this man barton is a great scoundrel and i dont know how to get at him but i hear that the slogger thinks he has got some sort of hold over him yes perkins said i told holl about it i know the slogger thinks it is a great pull but he aint a very longheaded chap aint the slogger however mr prescott you can talk to him here bill he called to a boy go upstairs and tell the slogger hes wanted down here the boy returned with word that the slogger was at present in the ring with nobbler jack but would be down shortly in a few minutes the slogger himself appeared very hot very red in the face and a little puffed about the lips servant mr prescott he said long time since i saw you yes slogger ive been too busy and am getting too stiff to do much with the gloves now sit down and take something to drink gin cold is my liquor sir now mr prescott perkins said when he had brought in the required refreshment ill leave you to talk it over with the slogger ill just go upstairs and see how things are getting on this business i want to speak to you about slogger concerns mr maynard and myself and i rely upon you to do anything you can for us that i will sir the man said heartily mr maynard and you have been good friends to me and im your man now who is it sir ill tumble against him somehow and give him pepper i dont care if i get six months for it not a snap sir not for you and mr maynard prescott laughed it is not in that line slogger and if it was you know mr maynard could do it for himself so he could sir none better still he mightnt like to get in the papers you know i hoped i might have done him a good turn so you can slogger but not in that line you know a man named barton that i do the man said angrily he got my brother bill transported but ill be even with him some day it is about that i wanted to speak to you barton has been paid by mr maynards uncle to find out something instead of that he has cheated him completely and has kept some documents in his hands which are of great importance he will now want a large sum of money to give them up the old gentleman is so indignant that he swears he wont pay him a penny now if you have really got some pull over barton and can put on the screw so as to make him give up the papers you will do barton as ill a turn as he has done you you will greatly oblige us and you will put a fifty pound note into your pocket done it is with you its a match the man said i have got what i fancys a pull over barton but i never used it before because i never saw my way i will tell you sir and you can put it on as you think best you remember i went with perkins and mr maynard and you to that chartist meeting my eye what a lark that were to be sure well sir there was a big slouching chap standing in front of me when the row began he didnt go in for fighting but his hat got knocked off in the skrimmage and a black wig he wore and i saw his short grey hair and knew him at once for barton for it was only a week before i had seen him in the witnessbox against my brother i tried to get at him to give him a remembrancer but there were half a dozen round all busy at me at once so i had enough to do to keep close to the others well sir not long after this came the blow up of the whole business and i heard it said among some chaps i knew who were pretty deep in it that they had been blown upon i asked who they suspected and they told me that it must have been one of the committee but there were only one chap who had been on it who they didnt know and he werent nowhere to be found hed give out he was a joiner and worked down clerkenwell but they searched every shop and made every enquiry and no chap like him had been heard of there i asked about his looks and just as i expected i found out it was barton if id told em what i thought bartons life wouldnt have been worth no not a days purchase for a lot of em had sworn if they ever found out who it was theyd do for him and i didnt somehow like the thought of that it aint english you know sir nothing manly and standup about itwhat i call a foreigneering sort of job so i kept it dark thinking some day if any of my pals got into a hole i could put the screw on to barton and make him get em off there sir thats all i know what do you think of it very good slogger very good indeed i think i can manage with that now will you meet me tomorrow morning at the door of his office at eleven oclock i have written the address down upon that bit of paper so that there can be no mistake about it i do not want you to go in with me but just to be there if wanted all right mr prescott im on and so prescott took his leave and soon emerged from the narrow street into the broad glare of the haymarket the next day at eleven prescott entered mr bartons office and sent in his name ask him to walk in prescott took a seat and made a quick survey of the man opposite my name is prescott mr barton i am a barrister i have come down to speak to you relative to some business you transacted a good many years since for captain bradshaw the man gave a slight start and his face grew visibly pale i dont think you acted quite on the square so to speak upon that occasion mr barton he paused but the detective did not speak it was hardly the right thing to do you know although perhaps clever you have the reputation for being a very clever man you know mr barton and prescott paused again but barton did not speak although prescott could see that his lips moved as if he was muttering a deep oath and drops of perspiration stood on his forehead still you see barton even very clever men make a mistake sometimes a waiting game pays sometimes but perhaps more often it does not the detective could stand it no longer but burst out with a fearful imprecation what are you driving at only at this mr barton prescott went on composedly that when you forgot to tell captain bradshaw that his grandson was alivethe man uttered an exclamation which was almost a groan but prescott without heeding him continuedalive and well and allowed him to remain all these years in ignorance of itwith the intention of course of extorting a very large sum from the boy when he came of age for the knowledge of his birthit would have been wiser to have assured yourself that the mother had left no sign no little valuables such as seals with crests and so on which might lead to the discovery of the mother without your kind interference it was not likely of course but it turned out so and the lad is now at his grandfathers house as his acknowledged and recognised heir the detective listened in stupefied silence this utter overthrow of all he had schemed for for so many years completely crushed him for a moment he thought of the document he held from fred bingham then he remembered that it was expressly voided by the appearance of the heir then he sat for a time with his forehead on his hand thinking deeply prescott quietly watching him all the time at last he said well barton what do you make of it i make this the man said doggedly that the boy may or may not be his grandson but he has no proof whatever of it the woman who died at the holls may have stolen the things or they may have been given to her by the other you have no proofeven if you knew that it was his daughter which you dontthat the child was hers and you have no proof that his parents were ever married even if you could prove the other points we have not prescott said frankly and it is precisely for that reason that i come to you of course you have got all these proofs and i want you to furnish them to us and how much do you propose to give for them barton asked cautiously i have waited for twenty years and i wont give up the game for a trifle captain bradshaw is so angry at the manner in which you have deceived him that he will not give one farthing and do you think that if i have those proofs barton sneered i am going to give them up for nothing do you take me for an idiot not at all prescott answered unmoved i have already said that i take you to be a clever man although things have hardly turned out as you expected i will tell you what my advice to captain bradshaw will be i shall recommend him to publish a statement of the case under the head of extraordinary recovery of a missing heir in every newspaper in england relating the whole particulars i dont think your business would be worth much after that i dont care the man said doggedly you wont frighten me that way i am going to retire i shall shut my office up next week for good going to retire to enjoy your honest savings mr barton prescott said cheerfully then we must go to work in another way we know the marriage took place in or near london so that an offer of fifty pounds reward will very soon produce that certificate as to the birth of the child it is more difficult let me see he said thoughtfully narrowly watching the face of the man who was sitting in sulky silence opposite to him she was very poor very her husband died i fancy before the child was born so she was likely to have been confined in a workhouse yes he said seeing a slight change in the mans face certainly in a workhouse and as we know the date to within a month we shall have no difficulty about that part of the business you may do what you please barton said bringing his clenched hand down upon the table with a fierce execration you may do what you please but you can never prove the connection beyond the personal ornaments and they are no proof at all no legal proof in themselves prescott said quietly but strong corroborative proof which coupled with connection of dates and ages the personal appearance of the lady and other points would make a strong casea very strong case well as you wont help us we must do our best so you are thinking of retiring from business mr barton yes i am growled the man sulkily and now i will trouble you to walk out a snug little place at putney or hampstead eh mr barton i dont want any chaff the man said rising you had better move and before i make you i am just going mr barton i was only about to say that it would not be a pleasant thing for you when you were walking in your garden in the dusk of evening smoking your pipei suppose you do smoketo have a bullet put suddenly into you from behind a hedge i am afraid by what i hear that it is not unlikely i only mention it as a friend you know good morning mr barton turned very pale he was as has been said physically a coward and this picture prescott had drawn cowed him at once he put his back against the door what do you mean mr prescott are you threatening me i prescott said in a surprised tone i just the contrary mr barton why you dont suppose man do you that i would hire a man to murder you because you decline to furnish me with a necessary link in a chain of evidence and prescott laughed pleasantly i was only acting as a friend you know mr barton one hears things sometimes and if a word of warning can avert mischief of course one gives it good morning barton irresolutely half moved away from the door and then his fear got the better of him and he determined to see whether it was a mere threat or a real danger i have done my duty he said sturdily and i am afraid of no man very right barton do your duty and fear no man is an excellent rule to act on still you know men sometimes have a little malice among themselves even against men who have done their duty now i will give you a case in point at the chartist business three years ago the men knew that their plans were betrayed and their leaders transported by the information of a man who called himself a joiner of clerkenwell they have sworn to murder him if they find him out and upon my word i believe they will keep their oath i know that they never have found out who it was but i have heard that at two oclock this afternoon they are to be told now there is a case in point supposing that informer had been yourself i ask you would it be safe for you to indulge in an evening pipe in your garden mr barton actually trembled with terror and rage this is a conspiracy against my life mr prescott i will go off at once and swear an information against you against me mr barton you are mad if i am conspiring at all it is in your favour i hear a rumour and i mention it to you i put a hypothetical case for your opinion and you have it in your power to prevent this information being known yes mr barton this is quite between ourselves but there is a man leaning against the doorway oppositeyes there he is and prescott looked out of the window now if i wink at that man as i go out that man will go straight to his home and will keep his mouth shut for the rest of his life and he is the only man besides myself who knows of that little affair if i dont wink at him i really cant answer which way he will walk there are the papers the detective said completely cowed and taking some papers from an iron safe here are copies of certificates of the marriage and baptism of the child what else do you want i want you to go before a magistrate with me and swear this affidavit i have prepared saying that in pursuance of instructions you received from captain bradshaw you traced his daughter from the place where her child was born that you never lost sight of her and that she died at john holls and that the child is the one mentioned in the certificate of baptism without a word barton followed prescott downstairs and as they went out stole a glance at the lounging figure opposite who with his hands in his pockets was apparently absorbed in the operation of smoking a pipe but who after they had passed moved leisurely after them when they came out from the mansion house prescott said good morning mr barton that is i think satisfactory to all parties the detective walked off without saying a word he was too completely beaten even to retort its all right slogger prescott said to the man he was a dreadful cur come tomorrow at eleven oclock to my rooms in the temple and i will hand you over the money all right governor ill be there and the man turned off again westward chapter ix john holl dust contractor arthur prescott went up the same evening to lowndes square the invalid had gone to bed and captain bradshaw and miss heathcote were alone well mr prescott captain bradshaw said after the first greetings i suppose you have no news to give us yet i have better than news captain bradshaw i have these to give you there are all the proofs required in any court of law in the world to prove that james is your grandson and legitimate heir really mr prescott yes really captain bradshaw my dear sir the old man said shaking him warmly by the hand i am delighted i dont know how to thank you i have been thinking since i saw you that it would be necessary to come to terms with that scoundrel barton and i am very glad you took it upon yourself to act without asking me first how much have you had to promise him a heavy sum of course but i shant grudge it not a very heavy amount sir considering their value i shall want a cheque from you for fifty pounds fifty pounds exclaimed captain bradshaw do you mean to say barton gave them up for fifty pounds no that he did not prescott laughed nor would he have given them up for much less than a hundred times that amount if it is any satisfaction to you captain bradshaw barton will not get one penny i will tell you the whole story but it is rather a long one so you had better sit down to listen to it so they sat down alice heathcote putting aside the light work upon which she had been engaged prescott then told the story of his success and when he had done captain bradshaw was in a state of the greatest delight to think of your getting the better of that rascal it is admirableupon my word it is admirable dont you think so alice yes uncle indeed i do we are all very very much obliged to mr prescott and prescott felt that he was amply repaid now mr prescott if you will come down into my study for a moment i will write you the cheque prescott followed him downstairs captain bradshaw sat down and wrote two cheques now mr prescott he said when he had finished the second you will not be offended at what i am going to say i am an old fellow you know and have known you a great many years you are a young man and you have done me a great servicea very great service i am speaking of your restoring james to me you have now rendered me another and have saved me a large sum of money will you let me look at all this in a professional point of view i am a very rich man no my dear captain bradshaw prescott said firmly i am not in the least offended at your offering it to me but i could not take money for doing what has been a great pleasure as you say i have known you since i was quite a boy and have received very many kindnesses from you and it is very hard if i may not have the pleasure of doing you a slight service now you are wrong prescott captain bradshaw said but you must have your way i am sorry very sorry you will not let me prove in my own way that i feel grateful to you however theres an end of it and he tore up one of the cheques believe me my dear boy if you ever do want a friend harry bradshaw is your man thank you sir prescott said shaking hands with him warmly i quite believe you and am very happy in the belief i will see about the other business in the morning prescott went upstairs again for a short time when he had gone captain bradshaw said that is a fine fellow alice a very fine fellow i wish i could see my way to doing him a good turn i have been asking him delicately you know my dear as an old man might ask a young one to let me treat him as my legal adviser in the matter but he would not hear of it it is not often that a cheque for five hundred pounds gets thrown into the fire alice looked pleased i do wish i could do something for him but i dont see my way alicedo you alice shook her head but as she bent over her work a flush mounted up to her forehead as if the idea of some reward prescott would care about had occurred to her whatever it was she did not mention it to her uncle it was about a week after this that john holls master said to him one evening when he went up with the carts at the end of the days work by the way john the carts wont go out tomorrow ive sold the whole thing out as i told you i was going to and tomorrow the things change hands and the new name will be painted on the carts well gaffer john said weve worked a good many years together and i am as sorry as can be that youre going to leave us have you spoken a word for me to the new gaffer i aint as young as i was master but no man can complain i dont do a fair days work ive told him about you john and youll find it all right i was talking about you and your wife having brought up that boy and of his having turned out a rich chap he was quite tickled about it and so was his wife shes a kindish sort of woman john and she said she should like to see your wife now master you neednt have gone on upon that affair john said reproachfully there never wernt nothing in it you know yes john but i was only saying that it was a rum start and you see it may do you good you know it always does do good when a master and man take a fancy to each other so you come up tomorrow afternoon at three oclock to square up and tell your wife to brush up a bit and come along with you thank you master ill come and i daresay sarah will though the old woman wont like it i know nor indeed did john himself for there is no man more proud and independent in his own way than an english workman indeed he would have absolutely refused to bring his wife but he did not like to hurt the feelings of his old master who had evidently wished to do him a service by the bye john his master said as he tamed to leave the yard rumly enough the new gaffers name is the same as yours john holl is it now said john well that is rum not that holl is an uncommon name or john either for that matter but to see it on our carts will be rum lor how my mates will chaff me to be sure i know what it will behullo john set up on your own account old man i say john stole a cart lor bless me i shall never hear the end of it and john went off laughing to himself john had as he anticipated some trouble with sarah but he had put the case to her somewhat diplomatically and said that the new gaffers wife wanted to know the story of james being found and turning out a rich man and then he had turned her attention off by telling her that the new gaffers name was john holl wont it be a rum start sarah to see ones own name on the carts sarah was greatly amused at the idea and when the appointed time came made no objection to starting with her husband for chelsea lor john what a time it is sin you and me went out walking together on a week day if you do take a holiday which aint often we have the children with us it do seem strange like lass lor what a shapely young girl you were when i took my first walk with you do you remember it mother ay john sarah said with a softening of her voice i aint likely to forget that while i live well john ive been as happy as i hoped to be ay mother john said weve had no cause to grumble if we aint done quite so well as we hoped then sairey weve done as well as we could have fairly expected well here we are and im blest if there aint all the carts with their new name on them john holl dust contractor it dont look bad he said critically as he spelt the letters out slowly i wonder what the new gaffers like well john his old master said coming out of the house into the yard come to square up eh how are you mrs holl and he went into a little outhouse and paid john holl his wages up to the preceding night now john i will take you indoors to the new master at the door however john and his wife were surprised to meet mr prescott ah mr holl how are you how are you mrs holl had a little business here too you see come in and he led the way into a neat little parlour the former master remaining outside hullo john exclaimed in utter astonishment when upon entering he saw the cripple boy sitting by the fireside in the very box in which he had sat so many years by their own hearth and which on coming out they had left in the spot where it had so long stood yes father its me sure enough well mother how goes it you see i came down here with mr prescott sarah kissed her foster son tenderly and john holl shook him by the hand but where john said looking round uneasily is the new gaffer hell be here presently father sit you downsit down mother yes my boy but the master mightnt like it if he came in here and found us making so free you sit down mother the new master wont mind it hes a good fellow is the new master aint he mr prescott he is indeed prescott said warmly a right good fellow so good a fellow mother that when he was a young man and not long married he took a poor boy out of the streets and brought him up did he really though sarah said ah thats why he wants to see us he has heard about james turning out a gentleman and he wonders whether his lad will do the same like enough mother john said i wish hed come though for i cant but feel as im intruding here dont you be uneasy father i want to tell you about the new master for i know you and mother will like him his name you know is john holl yes john said john holl dust contractor its writ up on the carts james just so father john holl dust contractor well father john holl when he was a young man wasnt a contractor at all but just a dustman when he had not been married long he took a poor little baby whose mother had diedshe was no relation to him mother none at all just a poor creature without friendsand they took in the baby and brought him up as their own he must be a real good fellow john holl dust contractor john put in never remembering that he had done the same thing he is father i told you youd like him well the worst of it was the poor baby grew up a cripple just like me mother but they didnt love it or care for it any the less but nursed it and watched over it with even greater tenderness than they had for their own healthy children well mother years afterwards it was found out who the boy was and he went away to his new relations they were rich people mother and felt that they owed very much to those who had taken care of the poor boy for so many years so mother without saying anything about it they bought a business with a house and furniture and carts and horses and all and john holl dust contractor came to the house and found the cripple boy sitting where he had sat so many years at their fireside to say welcome home dear mother and dear father and he held out his hands to them both sarah understood it now and in a moment was crying on her knees by the chair with her arms round his neck john holl sat a picture of utter bewilderment he did not even now understand it and was stupefied at his wifes sudden emotion do you not understand mr holl prescott said coming to his assistance do you not see you are john holl dust contractor the house and the carts and horses are yours jamess grandfather has bought them for you for me john holl repeated still incredulous yes for you father james said dont you see mother believes it john holl took the cripples hand now his voice trembled its too much lad its altogether too much we couldnt take it my boy we only did our duty jamessairey and me you need have no hesitation john prescott said putting his hand upon the mans shoulder captain bradshaw is very rich this is really nothing to him he feels under a great obligation to you and besides he likes to give pleasure to james you cant help it now its all paid for and you are john holl dust contractor we watched you go out and sent the child whom you left at home to fetch the others from school your eldest girl is packing up the things a cart was to be at the door half an hour afterwards and your things and the children will all be here by five oclock james is going to stay with you till seven and then a cab will call for him so your wife must set to and make you at home there is a girl in the kitchen and a fire and everything ready so mother will only have to get tea as usual now i will leave you and prescott went out and left them to their happiness several times in the next half hour john holl went out into the yard and spelt over the name john holl dust contractor and repeated it over many times to himself it was not until six oclock when the whole family were seated round the table james at his old place by sarahs side as half laughing half crying she cut up the bread and butter that john really realised to himself that it must be true and that he was really and identically john holl dust contractor chapter x well matched mr barton closed the office immediately after the departure of arthur prescott and went straight home very wrath was his wife when he told her the events of the day you are a miserable cur barton and i always told you so this was all the comfort he got from rachel presently she continued at any rate you ought to get a round sum out of that young bingham for that paper he gave you mr barton reflected well yes rachel as you say something ought to be done there something done rachel said contemptuously you are a poor thing barton its lucky for you youve made up your mind to drop the business you never had much head though i was fool enough once to think you had youre getting to be a downright foolthats what you are mr barton uttered a feeble protest dont tell me robert barton i know you if no one else does and you may take my word for it do you think this young bingham could let you keep that paper why when he sees this new heir he will know at once why you went to him to sell the secret and he will see that he is all right for the boys life is not worth you say a years purchase well what would his chance be worth if you were to go to the old man and prove to him that bingham knew about the boy being alive and had paid you to keep it dark you ought not to give up that paper barton for a penny under a couple of thousand that will be something out of the fire at any rate you have got a head on your shoulders rachel theres no mistake about that its very lucky for you barton i have his wife said mollified its lucky weve one between the two of us anyhow fred bingham came up to town a few days after james had been installed in his new home the evening after his arrival he as usual went to call upon his uncle he was astonished upon entering the drawingroom to see a pale young man sitting in a sort of invalid chair with his uncle and miss heathcote how are you fred captain bradshaw said warmly here is a gentleman i wish to introduce you to my grandson james there my boy congratulate me for a moment fred bingham felt as though he would have fallen fortunately captain bradshaw in the exuberance of his feelings patting him on the back shaking his hand and demanding his congratulations gave him time to rally and collect his thoughts before he was called upon to speak at any rate his uncles warmth proved that his first suspicion had been incorrectbarton had not betrayed the bargain between them at last he said really uncle i am so surprised i hardly know what to say are you in earnestis this gentleman really your grandson i had no idea you had one no more had i fred not the slightest in the world cant tell you all the story nowfound it out quite by accident most extraordinary coincidence james this is my nephew fred of whom you have often heard me speak i am sure uncle i am truly glad at the discovery fred bingham said with great warmth this is indeed a most providential restoration isnt it fred just what i say myselfjust what alice says fred now uttered a few words to james as he shook hands with him expressing his great pleasure at meeting with a new relation who would he knew add so much to the happiness of captain bradshaw and then he turned to speak to alice between them now it was declared war and fred felt in the sparkle of alices eye and in the slight sarcastic smile on her lips that she had read his first horrified surprise and appraised his subsequent phrases at their true value is not this indeed a strange and unexpected pleasure she said i knew you would join so heartily in our delight confident and secure as alice was of her own position and fearless as she was by nature she could scarcely repress a little shiver at the glance of deadly hate which fred bingham gave her from under his fair eyelashes then as his uncle was speaking to the cripple he answered in a low tone it is indeed miss heathcote it is a pity that the one member of the family is absent whose presence would make your happiness complete feeling contented in the thought that he was nearly quits in this little sparring match fred turned and sat down by james and entered into an animated conversation with him coolheaded as he was however he could not sustain this long he wanted to be away in quiet to think over this unexpected misfortune he soon pleaded an engagement and rose to leave captain bradshaw however insisted on his going down to the library with him in order that he might give him a short narrative of the matters relating to his newlyfound grandson fred kept up his attention to the narrative uttering short ejaculations of wonder or pleasure in their proper places when captain bradshaw had finished his narrative he said of course this affair my dear fred will to some extent make a difference in your prospects i say frankly that it was my intention previously to have left all my property to you alice is amply provided for and i had no one else whom i should have cared to enrich but you need not be afraid my dear boy you will have a very handsome slice yet frank murmured a few words of deprecatory thanks and then took his leave very fast he walked down lowndes square swinging his cane violently and at times cutting at the air with it as he turned into the roar of knightsbridge his speed slackened and he began as was his wont to speak to himself through his closed lips so that is the heir i can understand now why barton came to me he did not think he would live till he came to be of age he may not no one can say he may live for yearsthese sort of people always do if he outlives the old man as is likely enough i shall at most get a third i suppose he will leave the boy the estates and me his money and perhaps some of the farms of course i must make myself pleasant to this imp in case he should outlive the old one but i dont think he will he added more cheerfully barton evidently did not give him a yearand he maynt even last that still this will shake my credit with the jews i shall have difficulty in getting them to wait of course my agreement is at an end with barton i agreed to pay him at my uncles death in the event of no nearer heir appearing yes he will be sold anyhow if the boy dies it will after all be a lucky thing he has turned up besides even after paying barton he might have been an annoyance in some sort of way yes it may be for the best after all how barton must have sworn when he heard it i wish i had been there to watch his face the laugh would have been upon my side i fancy no wonder he wouldnt tell me who the heir wasan old fox by jove and here he stopped in his walk in consternation he has got that paper of mine he was safe enough to keep it dark before for it was worth twelve thousand pounds to him now its worth nothing and if he chooses to show it to the old man i am ruined by gad i am completely under his thumb and for once in his despair at this new danger fred bingham lost his jaunty elastic walk and crawled along piccadilly with the step of an old man presently he hailed a cab and when he reached home astonished the servant by taking a candle and going straight up to his bedroom without a single unpleasant remark the next morning he went down to mr bartons office that worthy had by one of his emissaries learnt that fred bingham had returned to town the day before and had gone up in the evening to captain bradshaws fred bingham was paler than usual but he was cool and collected and thoroughly prepared for the encounter he began the conversation of course you have heard that the boy has turned up yes mr bingham i have heard that and it is a bad job for both of usworse for me though than for you it will do you no harm in the long run he wont live the year out it was sharp practice of yours barton coming to me when you found he was not likely to live to come of age a deucedly clever stroke though but i dont think hes as bad as you think my uncle told me he has picked up a great deal in the few days since he came there i tell you he wont see out the year sir i heard him cough every three minutes the last time i was with him if he aint in a consumption i never heard anyone naturally enough the excitement has brightened him up for a while but take my word he is not good for a year fred bingham felt his hopes revive well you may be right he said by the way he added indifferently as he has turned up you may as well return me that agreement of mine of course it is useless now well mr bingham i have been thinking that little matter over and i think on the whole i should prefer to keep it the detective said with a cold smile i do not see that it can be of any use to you now barton it expressly states the money is only to be paid in the event of no nearer heir making his appearance and now this boy has turned up it is of course worthless well as a legal document it is not of much value i allow but its as a sort of keepsake i should wish to preserve it for a while at least its all ive got you see after twenty years waiting come barton its no use our beating about the bushwhat will you take to give it up well you see mr bingham it is not worth much to me but its worth all captain bradshaws estates to you i only have to put that paper into your uncles hand and explain the little circumstance connected with it for you to lose every penny you are putting the case strongly barton very strongly fred bingham said with a coolness that surprised and alarmed the detective yes if captain bradshaw saw that document and believed itand believed itit would as you say cost me the whole of the property which if the lad dies as i believe he will no doubt will come to me but you would not gain a single penny by it barton and as you owe me no grudge there would be no satisfaction in ruining me besides captain bradshaw would not believe you if i have not that deed in my possession when i leave this officei have a cab with a fast horse at the doori shall go straight to my uncle and tell him that a scoundrel named barton with whom i have had a little business once or twice in making inquiries as to character has been threatening to ruin me with him by means of a forged paper pretending that i knew of the boys existence captain bradshaw already knows you are a scoundrel he knows you have deceived him all these years and believes you capable of any crime when therefore you appear before him and show him a document signed with a signature perfectly unlike mineperfectly unlike mr bartonyou will probably find yourself kicked into the street by the footman so you see the game is not so completely in your hands as you thought mr barton sat completely staggered by his visitors coolness fred bingham followed up his advantage come barton you are a clever fellow but you have lost the game the signature does not in the slightest degree resemble my own i did it not with any intention of disputing the claim if you acted fair but as a precaution in case you did not now i dont want to act hardly on you and i dont want i say honestly even a suspicion to arise in my uncles mind i tell you what i will do in exchange for that deed i will give you a bond stating that in consideration of valuable services you have rendered me in the exercise of your business as a detective i undertake to pay you three thousand pounds upon the death of captain bradshaw should he carry out his declared intention of making me either wholly or partially his heir these are my terms what do you say and you will sign that before a witness certainly fred bingham said mr barton rose and gave his clerk directions to go out and get a stamp of the necessary value the agreement was then drawn up and signed the exchange was effected and fred bingham tore up the former deed into the smallest possible pieces then greatly satisfied with the result of this his second encounter with mr barton he went out into the city to transact the business which had brought him up to london chapter xi avenged another fortnight went on and the beneficial effect which the excitement of the change had effected in the health of the cripple boy began to disappear and a short irritating cough constantly harassed him captain bradshaw called in the best medical advice and their verdict proved the death knell of his hopes his grandsons lungs were seriously affected he might of course live for a long time yes change might be beneficial torquay yes torquay would be just the place and so to torquay it was decided that they should proceed in a few days one morning alice heathcote was talking alone with the invalid when the name of fred bingham was mentioned do you like him alice no james miss heathcote said to tell you the truth i do not like him at all but my uncle is very fond of him and so i keep my dislike to myself i am glad you dont like him james said i took a dislike to him i dont know why he was very kind and friendly but i did not like him i was afraid perhaps i was prejudiced but if you dont like him i am sure i was right i am not infallible you know james miss heathcote said half smiling but in this case i am pretty sure that my dislike is well founded james thought for a time i have heard the name of bingham before and i was trying to remember when it has just struck me a mr maynard whom evan holl is at work with is under a mr bingham a contractor down in yorkshire it is the same mr bingham alice said quietly why how can that be alice mr bingham is a cousin of mr maynard and in that case grandfather would be maynards uncle too yes he is james but there has been a quarrel between them has there james said i am sorry for that i knew mr maynard he came twice to mothers and he was so frank and cheery and so kindhearted too why it was he who sent out at his own expense bessy hollshe was mothers sister you knowto australia to join her husband i never saw such a fine fellow so generous and kind evan would lay down his life for him and he is very poor now very evan said so in his letter he lost all his money when the great indian bank broke what could grandfather have quarrelled with him about why alice you are crying i have not offended you have i i beg your pardon no no james i am foolish thats all and now james i will tell you a secret once i loved frank maynard loved him with all my heart i thought he loved me but it was all a mistake you understand james he was not the least to blame well when i found out my mistake i tried hard to cure myself and had come when he married to look upon him quite like a brother well james we found outat least uncle found out and told methat he was not what we had thought him and that he had done a very wicked thing i cant tell you what it was james well uncle wrote to him and he never answered never tried even to excuse himself it was so bad a thing james we could never esteem him or know him again it almost broke uncles heart and it made me suffer very much too james just as if it had really been a brother who had done it when we heard he had lost all his money we sent some to a bank for him without saying who it came from but i suppose he guessed and so would not accept itanyhow he sent it back i know he is very poor and that it must be dreadful to be under fred bingham everyone speaks well of frank mr prescott likes him so much you tell me how kind he was and i know yes i know how frank and straightforward and true he was james and i do so wish it could be made up and forgiven he has been punished and his conscience must have punished him more than uncles anger could do but we ought not to cast him out all his life for one sin i was as angry and sorry as uncle was at first james but i do so grieve over it i do so fret when i think of him and how he wants a friend now i cannot ask uncle to forgive him i have been as hard as he has but would you james he will not refuse you anything you could put it on the ground of what he did for your aunt when she was in distress poor frank i do feel for him so and alice who had tried hard to speak steadily again broke down certainly i will ask it alice i do not think my grandfather will refuse me and james sat for some time with a look of sad thought on his face i will speak to him tonight after dinner after dinner accordingly james refused to go upstairs as usual with alice and had his chair wheeled close to his grandfather for some time they talked upon ordinary subjects and then there was a pause james sat toying with a dessertknife in his thin hands and coughed once or twice with the short hacking cough that went to his listeners heart may i tell you a story grandfather certainty james captain bradshaw said some time ago uncle nearly three years now i was at work at my flowermaking you know when a very tall goodlooking gentleman came in about some business with mother he was very kind and talked for some time in a bright cheery way he bought some of my flowers and sent me down a great box of books to study god bless him captain bradshaw said interjectionally some time after uncle we were in great trouble john holls brother william was sentenced to be transported as a head chartist and his poor wife aunt bessy as i used to call her was in terrible grief the same gentleman happened to hear of it and came down and paid her expenses to join her husband in australia which she did a few months afterwards this gentleman is now very poor he has lost all his money and has quarrelled with a rich relative his name is frank maynard grandfather it is of no use deceiving ourselves i know i am dying i know i cannot live many months let my one request to you be that for my sake you forgive him and let him be to you what i would have been i will i will james captain bradshaw said wiping his eyes i have been thinking ever since you came here of forgiving him i have had a lesson heavy enough for any one man of the sin of unforgiveness i will forgive him james i will see him and tell him so but he cannot yet come back here to us perhaps some day but not now but at least i will make him independent and comfortable i loved him james very dearly and would have trusted him with my life and when confidence like that finds it is mistaken it is very hard to heal i know that all men would not look at his fault as i did but he did it deliberately he told me the first time he had seen her how pretty she was and i warned him not to go again as mischief might follow he took my advice in good part and i thought no more of it until her old father stood before me and called for vengeance he had that day been to see his daughters body which wasgood god james what is the matterwhat is the matter boy speak to me james was sitting as if stricken with a fit his thin face was as pale as death his eyes unnaturally large were fixed and staring his hand was clenched at last he said grandfather was her name carry walker yes james that was her name did you know her know her the cripple lad repeated with a ghastly laugh know her look at me three years ago i was a cripple as i am now but i was strong and well and active i could swing by my arms like a monkey i was a cripple but i was happy and lighthearted a girl used to come in to talk to me she was an angel as good and as beautiful as one i worshipped her i could have kissed the ground she trod on she was not for me a poor cripple i never dreamt it but i worshipped her as i might have done an angel of light and she knew it but never looked down upon menever jeered at a cripples adoration but was like a sister with me a scoundrel killed her you know how i never blamed her she was not to blame i know she was as pure and as sinless as an angel but she was as trusting and he deceived her with her went my life i did not care to live i longed to die all my spirits and my strength went i only longed for one thing i longed to know who had done iti longed to kill him i once suspected i had mentioned his name and she had changed colour and seemed confused but i believed him so good and so true that i blamed myself for the doubt and now i know at last that those doubts were only the truth carry carry i have avenged you at last grandfather the man who killed her has killed me for myself i could still say forgive him for her sake i say cast him out for ever i do james the old man said solemnly henceforth he is dead to me did i see him dying of want at my feet i would not stretch out a hand to save him thank you grandfather the cripple said with his face set in a savage joy and then it softened again as he murmured to himself at last at last carry ii the poor cripplehave avenged you then he said to his grandfather please go upstairs uncle and send alice down to me she asked me to speak to you i must tell her please ask her to come down to me in a minute alice came down at the sight of the lads face of almost ghastly pallor she said oh james i fear you have been exciting yourself too much and i see he has refused you how could he no alice he has granted what i asked him listen to me alice i have told him a story i will tell it you i loved not as men love but as one might worship an angel a girl who came to talk to me and cheer my life she was all that was good and bright and pure i need not tell you the resti see you can guess it i have prayed and longed with a despairing longing that i might some day punish this man i knew not who he was the impotent rage the intense longing this sorrow and pity have for months been killing me at last i have avenged her frank maynard may die of want before grandfather would stretch out a hand to save him a look of deep pain of horror and of pity succeeded each other on alice heathcotes face until the closing sentence and then she threw herself on her knees by his side and took his hand oh james i am so sorry i pity you so much but do not say that forgive as you would be forgiven it is his one fault it is a terrible sin jamesa dreadful dreadful sin but think what he must have suffered think what remorse he must have felt she would say to you forgive james oh have mercy upon him for his poor wifes sake for mine no alice i can only think of carry and i will never never forgive him the cripple spoke in a tone of bitter pleasure which there was no hope of changing his face looked into the distance with a strange smile of gratified vengeance and alice heathcote without a word rose proudly from her knees and with a face as pale as his left the room chapter xii shaking off the yoke it was dusk one evening when frank was plodding his weary way home as he passed through landfarn he met the doctor ah maynard how are you well enough morgan but amazingly tired come in and have a cup of tea i cant doctor my wife is expecting me and will be anxious till i get home walk part of the way with me the kindly little doctor walked along with him you cant go on like this maynard you will never do any good with this little brute of a cousin of yours your wife too is getting thinner and paler the wear and anxiety are too much for her do you think i dont see it morgan frank exclaimed passionately i do nothing but think of it i dont care for the work hard as it is but its the thought of her sitting there alone all the day ive been thinking today i must make an end of it i cant stand it any longer i shall kill that fellow i was nearly breaking out today the only thing is hes afraid of me now he knows hes gone too far he comes down and blows up but he darent say a word to me hes no fool and he knows that if he gave me a chancejust a chance i would thrash him to within an inch of his life before the men ay and i would too its as much as i can do to keep my fingers still when i see him coming i wish hed break his neck said the doctor but id rather he did it himself than that you should do it for him i tell you who i pity more than i do you maynard whos that doctor his wife poor thing she wont last long and it will be a merciful release for her ay indeed frank said i have heard of entertaining an angel unawares but if ever a woman married a devil unawares she did well maynard i must turn back my patients will be wanting me keep your heart up man and get out of this as soon as you can i will frank said to himself as he strode on in the darkness no one can say i have not stuck to it like a man its nearly two years since i came down by jove it seems to me i have been here an age ill tell katie tonight that i give it up australia will be a joke to this thank god here i am home a bright light streamed out through the door and a bright face came to open it as her ears caught the sound of his tread on the gravel well dear how are youvery tired poor old boy there sit down frank ill unlace your boots hannah bring some hot water for your master tea is all ready frank and ive got some sausages for you heres your coat dear and your slippers now you look comfortable and what did you have for dinner katie i kate asked oh charley and i had cold meat hes such a good little fellow frank she added hastily but frank paid no attention to the latter remark cold meat he half groaned to himself there was not a scrap left i had to pick the bones last night there was plenty frank kate said anxiously and we had rice pudding too bythebye frank she said suddenly there is a parcel come for you ive been wondering all day what it could be no i wont open it till youve begun your tea there now ill open it two covers three covers how carefully it is done up frank therewhy it is a jewelcase oh frank what a splendid chainwhat a superb chain it was a magnificent chain of full length for a lady made of rough gold alternated with large pearls and as thick as a mans little finger frank and kate both gazed at it in astonishment good gracious frank said who in the world has sent you that katie what a present for a woman whose husband cant earn a dinner for her he added bitterly frank you shant talk like that kate said forgetting all about the chain and going round to frank oh frank you will break my heart if you do let us only hope for the best dear and all will come right ive made up my mind today katie that i wont stay here any longer thank god kate said fervently anythinganything will be better than this oh frank and she cried on his neck i am so glad dear i would not propose it but oh i have so wished you would what are you thinking of doing we will talk it over katie after tea you are forgetting your chain who can have sent it kate took it out of its case and held it up oh frank what a magnificent chain to be sure and what a curious one with such rough gold and such splendid pearls can it be real frank i dont know kate is there no letter look in the top of the case oh yes frank here is a little note addressed to memrs frank maynard ballaarat mrs maynard it is now three years since your husband helped a brokenhearted woman in the time of her greatest distress when she was friendless and hopelesswhen it seemed to her that her husband was to be parted from her for everwhen to both it seemed that god had forsaken them your husband on whom they had no claim even of the slightest came to them he gave them hope and life he restored them to each other and to the world buoyed up by hope the husband gained the approbation of those above him and the term of his punishment was remitted he came to the gold fields there he worked at his trade he first built wooden huts then took contracts and bought land a town sprang up that land is worth a hundred times what he gave for it he is now a rich man he can never repay we can never repay him whose kindness has made us what we are my husband wishes me to say that he has heard from his brother that mr maynard is down in yorkshire at work upon a railway if you would not think it presuming on our part we would say why not come out here work of that kind is abundant and well paid for my husband can procure contracts and would be only too glad and too proud to find the necessary capital and to work in concert with and under mr maynards directions accept a small remembrance of the grateful regard which is borne by her who with her husband prays god daily to bless our benefactor and those he loves bessy holl frank fairly sobbed aloud kate when she could speak laid her hand upon his and said reverently cast thy bread upon the waters and after many days it shall return again unto thy bosom frank took her in his arms dear wife at last there is a future for usat last there is an end to our anxiety and care let us thank god for it this man means what he says and from him at least i am not too proud to receive assistance he has already made a position there and with a staunch and able friend like that we may rely upon making our way does it not seem strangely providential frank that just as you helped him and his wife when everything seemed at its worst so he now holds out hope for us when we were ready nearly to despair it is so katie i accept it as gods providence and we will act upon it now dear give me some fresh tea mine is quite cold and even joy does not do away with hunger what a heavy chain frank and the pearls are really magnificent they have sent the chain with an object katie they had heard from the holls of our circumstances down here no doubt they were too delicate to send money so they have sent this chain they have almost pointed out that it is not meant to wear it would be equally out of place here as at ballaarat besides the roughness of the work is out of all proportion to its value no katie these noble people have sent the chain to pay our passage out there just as i paid hers what a strange coincidence and how delicately they have done it the intrinsic value of that chain katie with such pearls as those must be at least three or four hundred pounds when will you do something frank kate said when tea over frank had taken his seat in his easy chair by the fire and had lighted his pipe you dont mean to go to work tomorrow do you yes katie i will turn out as usual it will be a real pleasure for i shall know it is for the last time i shall go there and stick at it until he comes round as usual in the middle of the day and then i shall tell him im going i know it will rile him tremendously for in the first place i am very useful to him in the second he will lose the gratification he has in seeing me under him and in the third place he is bound under heavy penalties to have the first bit of the line ready in three weeks and its as much as he can possibly do to get it finished i should not be surprised if half the men leave when they hear im going they hate him nearly as much as i do and if they leave the line cant be open in time and the directors are sure to enforce the penalty for i know he has quarrelled with them oh frank kate said earnestly how i hate that man it is very wicked i know but i hate him with all my heart i should like to see you say goodbye to him and oh frank i would give all i have in the world and thats not saying much to see you take the little wretch by the collar and thrash himi should frank yes you may shake your head i know it is wrong but think how he has treated you all these months i do think katie and what is much more i think how you have suffered all these months and yet i will go away without thrashing him it is not from want of good will katie but i am just afraidno not of him dear but i am afraid of the law for theres nothing would give him such pleasure as to get me put in gaol for six months i believe he would not grudge the thrashing and in the next place katie i am afraid of myself if i once lost my temper with himif i once touched himand there was such an intense menace in franks tone that katie was frightenedif i once touched fred bingham i should kill him no no frank katie said anxiously i was only joking i do hate him but i would not have you touch him for anything no no dear promise me you will keep your temper with him yes katie i wont touch him i shall probably express my sentiments somewhat forcibly but if i know him when he sees that i am no longer under his thumb he will know better than to say a word which would give me an excuse for doing it and now katie its halfpast nine and i must go off to bed thank god tomorrow is the last morning i shall go up to london with the chain the day after tomorrow pet i dare not trust it by post very quickly the next mornings work passed over frank he walked up and down the length of the work watching the men at work at the various smaller cuttings he gave a direction here and asked a question there but all the time the thought was dancing in his brain for the last time for the last time then he went back to the great cutting it was a busy sight with the swarms of men each working like a part of a great machine without confusion and without noise each man knowing what he had to do and doing it with all his might the speed with which the long lines of waggons were filled by men below and men on the bank beside them and by men wheeling the stuff from points beyond sometimes the silence would be broken by the sound of mallets striking upon great wedges and by a cry of look out lads shes moving and then down with a crash would come a portion of the face of the high clay wall previously holed at its foot as deeply as the men could swing their picks and then dozens of men would swarm upon the fallen mass and tear it to pieces with picks and spearheaded crowbars called devils sometimes too from where the clay was toughest would come a warning cry and then the dull report of a heavy shot used instead of the wedges for tearing it asunder its jolly work frank said to himself with any other master i should have liked it very much and above all if i were the master myself well i may be some day who knows it was just twelve oclock when fred bingham was seen coming along the line on foot as usual but with his pretty pony led after him by one of the boys he looked at everything sharply as he came along and addressed a few unpleasant remarks to the men at the tip then he came on to the entry of the cutting have the men knocked off he asked the ganger yes sir about two minutes since hum fred bingham said producing his watch it wants two minutes to twelve yet by my time we went to work sir by mr maynards watch and we knocked off exactly at twelve whether it had been exactly twelve or not i should have knocked the men off when i did said frank whom his cousin had not noticed except by a slight nod when he arrived i always stop when i have filled a set of waggons whether its five minutes to twelve or five minutes past how many sets have you filled today fred asked eleven and how many are you working a day seventeen then the men will have done by four oclock somewhere about that frank said if they can get seventeen sets filled by four oclock fred bingham said they ought to do twenty i differ from you frank said coolly men who are working piece work expect to get away by four i am certain if they were working day work they would not get fifteen sets full by six they do a very good days work thats your opinion maynard i am master here and i insist upon twenty sets being filled in future you may insist till youre black in the face frank said but you wont get it done i know what a fair days work is and i consider twenty sets to be more than a fair days work and i wont ask the men to do it you wont eh fred bingham said turning sharp upon him you will do as i order you maynard or you leave these works very well frank said calmly then i do leave them i have worked here fred as i dont believe any other man in the world would have worked for the same pay you know that i have got your work done more cheaply for you than you could have got it done any other way i suppose the pay suited you or you would not have stayed fred bingham answered do you mean what you say because if you do you can go to the office and get your money i quite mean it frank said calmly from this moment i am no longer in your employ and now fred bingham as you are no longer my master i can speak out you have treated me as i believe never was man treated before your father persuaded me to come down here you took advantage of the delay in the works to grind me down to a salary you would not have offered to the commonest man worse you have taken advantage of my position knowing my circumstances and that i was under your thumb to say things to me and to treat me as you no more dare have done under other circumstances than you dare have flown i know why you hated me because i was popular here and you are not because people were ready to be friends with your paid inspector who would not be friends with you because i was liked and you were hated you hated me for this i have put up with it in silence i have borne your petty insults and you dared not no dared not go beyond a certain point but now thank god i am free you thought you were to be a petty god here and you hated me because i would not bow down at your feet you petty tyrant you miserable insignificant little despot i have done with you for ever and you may thank your fates that i go without giving you the thrashing you so richly merit fred bingham had grown very white as frank spoke but he only said keep your heroics frank the sooner you go the better i shall be pleased dont you lay a hand on me maynard or you will regret it he said as frank made a step towards him you miserable paltry little cur frank said contemptuously i should despise myself if i were to touch you lads come here he shouted in a loud voice and the men many of whom had looked curiously on during the evidently warm colloquy between the man they looked upon as their master and the contractor drew round look here my lads frank said you see this miserable little undersized cur he is my cousin you would hardly think it but its a fact he has cheated and deceived and insulted me time after time lads thank god i am able at last to leave him and i want you all to hear me tell him that he is a loathsome little blackguard i dont thrash him now as my fingers itch to do because he would have the law upon me and i have other things to see to but i warn him solemnly if ever i get the chance i will thrash him to within the last inch of his life and now lads goodbye we have got on i hope well together i have liked you and i hope you have liked me i am sorry to leave you all but i cant stand this any longer i wish you all well lads and i never expect to get a better lot of men under me goodbye lads i leave at once amidst a chorus of goodbye your honour and many a hearty shake of a rough hand frank moved out of the crowd of men who surrounded him and strode homewards fred bingham had stood without saying a word while this scene was going on and without one of the men paying the slightest attention to him the men after a few words to each other separated to finish their dinners fred bingham stood by the side of the cutting and looked down presently he saw one or two of the men put on their jackets and the following colloquy ensued evidently intended for his ears what are you up to bill ive jacked up the man said im off to the office bob to get whats owing to me after working for a real gentleman i aint going to work for such a as that thing on the top there ay ay bill i expect most of us are of one mind there wait a minute and i am with you ay ay said a chorus of men round and in little groups they put on their coats and went off towards the town until not a single being was left and the great cutting which half an hour before had been so full of life stood idle and deserted with the picks and shovels and tools strewn idly about and the teams munching their oats without a driver for a long time fred bingham stood immoveable then with a deep curse he turned away ill be even with you yet maynard this is one for you but ive had the best of it yet the news rapidly spread over the works that mr maynard had left and the next morning out of the thousand men previously at work not twenty answered to their names fred bingham was riding moodily homewards when he came up to a young navvy who was walking in the same direction fred bingham wanted to go up to one of the cuttings which was close to the road and so he dismounted and called to the lad in his usual sharp imperious way here you boy hold my horse for me the lad looked roundhold it yourself he said oh its you is it holl dont give me any of your insolence or ill lay my whip over your back its more than you dare do the lad said fred bingham was personally not a coward and in his present state of sullen fury he did not hesitate a moment but struck the boy across the cheek with all his force with the ridingwhip evan had not been a navvy for two years and a half without having his share of fighting he was not tall but he was broad and powerful and he sprang forward and before fred bingham could get his hands up he struck him a tremendous righthanded blow in the face which knocked him off his feet as if struck with a thunderbolt then smarting with the pain of the blow on his cheek he caught up the ridingwhip and lashed fred bingham mercilessly over the head and body exclaiming the first was for me but thats for master thats for master curse you then throwing down the broken whip he said there you wont forget that in a hurry now you may go fred bingham rose to his feet half blinded with rage and pain twenty pounds if youll bring him into the town he shrieked to two navvies who had come up just as the affair began not if you made it a hundred one of the men said grinning you hit him first and it serves you dd well right fred jumped on to his horse with a curse and galloped furiously towards the town you have just about served him out young one my eye how you did lay it on youve spoilt his beauty for some time theres two of his front teeth gone and his lips my crikey he wont go grinning about for some time now if you take my advice youll make yourself scarce have you got any money in your pocket only fourpence evan said the two men consulted together heres three bob thats all weve got between us all rightyou take it weve got a few shillings to get at the office evan took the money will you see mr maynard and tell him im going to start at once for sheffield its thirty miles off and ill be there by morning hes going up to town and ill meet him at the station and come on with him all right lad well tell him youd better keep in the fields for the first few miles frank had been home about an hour when the servant told him that one of his men wished to speak to him frank went to the door ah baker he said what is it well gaffer ive come up to speak to you about evan but i dont want any one to hear meand he looked round mysteriously nonsense man theres no one to hear you here but come in the man followed into the sittingroom this is baker katie one of my best platelayers kate smiled at the man who bowed confusedly now what is it baker well sir young holls got himself into a scrape surely has he frank said much vexed what the deuce has he been up to now hes never got into a scrape before since i had him well sir its a bad job this too the man said with a twinkle in his eye for he had heard the colloquy at the cutting and guessed that frank would be the reverse of angry well out with it man whats he been doing frank said impatientlyfighting fighting aint no name for it gafferknocking a gentleman down knocking two of his front teeth out and then giving it him with his own whip till there aint a whole place on his face where i could lay the top of my little finger good gracious frank exclaimed why he must have gone mad he couldnt have been drinking there was not time for that besides i never knew him drink what the deuce could have possessed him what had the gentleman done well it was all the gents own fault gaffer i must say that for holl the gentleman asked holl to hold his horse and the lad wouldnt do it and gave him cheek so the gentleman he up with his whip and hit holl across the face and holl went at him like mad and gave him one on the mouth which as i said master knocked two of his teeth out and cut his face right open and then he took the whip and he cut him about with it till his face ismy eye i cant tell you what his face isnt like well it served him right that is a thrashing would have served him right but not such a tremendous licking as this and whats become of evan he started across the fields for sheffield master he said he would be at the station to meet you in the morning and its well he is for the police are out all over the place for him its very tiresome said frank but who is this unfortunate man who has got this tremendous licking well master and again the mans eyes twinkled his name is mr frederick bingham what shouted frank do you mean to say its fred bingham thats him gaffer sure enough hurrah frank shouted do you hear that katie thrashed like a sack and two of those front teeth he was so fond of showing down his throat im glad kate said heartily im glad id have given anything to have seen it so would i katie why didnt you tell me at once it was fred bingham he asked the man i always like to keep my good news for the last master the man said with a grin frank and kate both laughed here my lad frank said heres five shillings to drink my health be sure you dont let out where holl is gone trust me gaffer the man said im as close as a mole goodbye your honour i wish you luck wherever you go frank gave the man a warm shake of the hand goodbye lad keep yourself steady well katie he said when he went back to the parlour i am pleased to think of that rascal getting his deserts after all so am i frank its very unwomanly i have no doubt but im delighted about an hour later there was a noise on the gravel in front and frank went to the door there was an inspector and three policemen while behind them on his horse with his face bound up in a complete mat of bandages sat fred bingham what do you want inspector frank who knew the man said we have come up mr maynard in search of a lad who has committed an aggravated assault upon mr bingham and who is supposed to be here i have heard another version of the story frank said the boy was struck first and he only gave the fellow who hit him what he richly deserved but he is not here inspector i have not seen him since i left work do your duty inspector and search the house fred bingham exclaimed speaking thickly and with difficulty hold your tongue you bingham frank said and get off my property this instant i warn youyou are trespassing you can search the house if you like inspector but i give you my word of honour that holl is not here that he has not been here and that i am perfectly unaware where he is at the present time if he were here i should advise him at once to give this ruffian who struck him in charge for the assault there are witnesses who saw it i believe you paid him to assault me maynard fred bingham said furiously no you dont bingham frank said calmly these sort of things i am in the habit of taking into my own hands and i warn you you are in my debt still and that if ever i have a chance i will clear it off no this time you brought it upon yourself for daring to insult some one who was not bound hand and foot to you i dont know about the rights of the case sir the inspector said however of course i will take your word about his being here mr maynard come boys we must search somewhere else and the whole party went off down the drive another week and frank maynard kate and the children were in london jane the nurse had also accompanied them to london she having expressed her willingness to accompany her master and mistress to the end of the world but kate confided her private opinion to frank that the fact of evan deciding also to go with them to australia exercised a not inconsiderable influence in her decision mr and mrs holl would have wished evan to stay at home to assist his father in the business but evan although much struck with the dignity and comfort of the position of john holl dust contractor refused to leave frank and neither john nor sarah would say a word to shake his fidelity he took up his abode however with his father and mother up to the time for sailing prescott had taken lodgings for the party at kensington met them at the station and went home with them frank and kate were both in high spirits for kate had written to mrs drake saying that she had not wished to weary her by telling her how badly things had gone with them since the time of the stoppage of the great indian bank but that frank had been for two years down in yorkshire learning railway work and that they had now made up their minds to emigrate to australia where they had a friend who would be enabled to push them she concluded by asking mrs drake if she would advance them two or three hundred pounds the reply came by return of post gently upbraiding kate for not having written before to say how they were situated and enclosing a cheque from mr drake for five hundred pounds the next day teddy himself came up he was as full of fun and life as ever sarah he said would have come too but she could not leave her baby who was only a month old but she as well as mr and mrs drake sent every kind message frank had at once consulted the papers and had found that the tasmania a firstclass packet would sail in ten days for melbourne a passage was at once taken for the whole party and for the next week frank and kate accompanied by teddy had an immense deal of work to get through kate was quite another woman now she had never shown before her husband how anxious she was but the strain had told upon her severely now however it was over and with the hope of a bright future before her she almost regained her former cheerful brightness during the ten days of their stay in london formerly she had dreaded the thought of emigrating it had all seemed so vague and dim and the chance of ever returning had been so slight but now there was every hope of success and as kate was taking all she loved with her she would not have fretted had she known they were never to return at last the day of sailing arrived prescott and teddy drake went on board at the docks and remained with them until the pilot went ashore at the downs very hearty were the adieux and good wishes but kate kissed her cousin and her husbands faithful friend with scarce a tear in her eye and with charley held up in her arms and her husband standing with his arm round her watched the boat until its occupants were no longer distinguishable now frank she said as she turned away from the bulwark after the last wave of her handkerchief we are fairly off at last and ive got you all to myself for the next five months i suppose i ought to be very miserable at leaving england but it has treated me so badly lately that i am not so sorry as i ought to be you keep hold of me charley the vessel is beginning to roll a little and you will be down if you dont mind here frank you take him up i will go and see after jane and baby i do not expect she is such a good sailor as i am and i must look after baby for the next day or two i feel very happy dont you husband very darling and i have every reason to do so the past has been a sort of bad dream katie we mustnt think any more of it now dear you go down and i will light my pipe and look after charley chapter xiii not guilty captain bradshaw had now been down at torquay for nearly two months the haughty coldness with which alice heathcote had for some time treated the invalid boy after his refusal of the prayer she had made him on her knees had now worn off he was evidently sinking fast and alices offended pride faded into pity at the sight of his worn looks and failing strength the invalid had for some time talked but little and tears often came up into his eyes as he sat silent and abstracted one day especially after he had received a letter from london he sat more silent even than usual and looked several times wistfully across at alice who had palpably been crying for a short note from prescott had told her the same news which james had heard in a letter from evan at last he spoke alice he said softly i do not think i shall live very long would you mind kissing me alices tears flowed again now as she bent over the pale face and kissed him he took her hand and looked up forgive me alice i have been very hard and wicked i have thought it over what you said that evening ever since i have been sorry and yet i could not give way i had so longed i had so prayed that i might have vengeance that i was blinded and mad i know now i was wrong what am i a poor dying cripple that i should carry my vengeance to the grave i feel now that you were right alice she would have forgiven and i forgive now for her i could not do it beforei could not do it while he was in england i could not have borne to have seen him but now that i know he has sailed i can do it it is a grudging forgiveness you will say it is alice i have had a very hard fight with myself and i think i could have gone down to the grave without doing it if it had not been for your words if it is any satisfaction to you alice it is you who have won it he can come back again if he likes when he arrives out there i shall be gone long before he can even get the letter alice bent over him and kissed him again thank you james you have made me very happy when captain bradshaw came in alice with a glance at the invalid rose to leave the room but he said no please stay alice grandfather you love me do you not yes indeed my boy i do the old man said earnestly grandfather you would like to know i died happy captain bradshaw nodded affirmatively he could not trust himself to speak i shall not die happy unless you grant my prayer alices prayer and mine frank maynard sailed today for australia write and tell him to come back again i let him go because i could not have borne to have seen him but tell him to come backtell him that you and alice forgive him tell him that i who loved carry so muchthat i feel that i can speak in her name forgive him toofully and wholly will you do this grandfather do it for my sake yes my boy the old man said his voice trembling i forgive him for your sake write kindly grandfather he has suffered enough send him plenty of money to come home at once and tell him my place here is vacant for him take him again to your heart i cannot but think with alice that except in this one great sin he is good and honest and now please i should like to be quiet a little while the next morning james went out as usual in his chair alice heathcote walking alongside they went down to the beach and there stopped awhile james looking out over the sea how quiet and how beautiful it is alice i am very very glad that i have been able to see it i think i should have known about the country from books but no book could give me an idea of the sea shall we go back now the chair was turned homewards until passing a small circulating library alice said i want some note paper james do you mind stopping a minute while i get it no alice and ask them to send me out some books to look at i always like to see the books before i choose them alice heathcote went into the shop an old man was behind the counter i want some notepaper and please will you take a few of the last novels to the gentleman in the invalid carriage at the door that he may choose a set as alice spoke a young woman came forward selected several books and went with them to the door alice heard a strange hoarse cry from james carry and then there was a dull sound as the young woman fell heavily on the floor alice ran first out to james who was deadly pale and gazing with a strange fixed stare into the shop what is it james tell me what is the matter he did not answer till she touched him carry he said carry alive oh thank god thank god the footman by alices direction assisted the old man in raising the insensible woman and carrying her into the parlour alice waited until she recovered and then returned into the shop and beckoned the old man to follow her you are mr walker i presume yes the old man said i am madam and let me implore you do not mention to any one what has happened if you only knew what carry has gone through i am sure you would not and now just as we were getting comfortable again you may rely upon me mr walker but i must see your daughter and ask her some questions the happiness of a whole family depends upon her answer i will come in at nine oclock this evening very well maam the old man said but pray pray say nothing about it you may rely upon me miss heathcote said james was very quiet and still upon his way home only to think he muttered gently to himself carry alive after all when he reached the door he said to alice please tell grandfather i shall go and lie down for a while uncle harry alice said a very strange thing has happened we went into a shop and found mr walker and his daughter what captain bradshaw said perfectly astounded mr walker and his daughter do you really mean her alice yes uncle there is no mistake about it but i thought she was drowned alice we did think so uncle but you see she is not i shall be able to tell you more tonight uncle i am going to see her at nine this evening going to see her alice yes uncle we have been acting too much in the dark all along part of the accusation against frank is untrue anyhow thank god for it and i am determined now to find out from her how much frank really was to blame i am afraid we have been very cruel uncle nonsense alice her uncle said testily the old mans daughter was missing and he came to me after seeing what he certainly thought was her body fortunately it was not that misery is off our minds anyhow i am quite ready to forgive frankin fact i have forgiven him and i really do not see any use in making any more inquiries into the matter i am very glad and very thankful too uncle but my point of view in the matter naturally differs somewhat from yours besides uncle i really want to see this unfortunate young woman captain bradshaw looked intensely surprised yes uncle i want to see her for jamess sake poor boy i fear uncle he cannot last very much longer and i am sure it would make him very happy if he could have her to nurse him and be with him to the end but my dear alice do you remember my dear uncle alice said gently i only remember how terribly she must have suffered we are going to forgive frank and to take him back again is it for us to throw this poor girls fault in her face my dear her uncle said kissing her i beg your pardon you are a dear good girl and i am an old fool at nine oclock alice heathcote attended by a footman went down to the library the shop was closed but the door was opened by mr walker she is in the parlour maam and please he said nervously please dont speak harshly to her she has suffered so much telling the servant to wait outside alice went in mr walker remained in the shop in which the gas was still burning while alice went through into the parlour beyond carry was sitting at the table but rose as she entered carry had changed very much from the merryfaced girl who three years before used to stand behind the counter in new street she was not yet twentyone but she had a look of quiet womanly sorrow on her face which made her look years older the golden tresses were hidden now beneath a plain widows cap her dress was entirely black which set off the extreme paleness of her complexion in manner she was quiet and almost dignified and was still very pretty but of an entirely different expression from the prettiness of old she bowed gravely to alice and apparently waited for her to speak my name alice began is miss heathcote i am ward to captain bradshaw of lowndes square carry paled a little at the name the gentleman you saw at the door in the invalid chair whom you knew at mr holls has turned out to be captain bradshaws grandson he is dying i fear he cannot live more than a month or two longer and one of my objects in coming tonight was to ask you to come and nurse him carry gave a start of surpriseme yes alice said gently he has always loved you and it would be a great satisfaction to him to have you near him you will be received as a friend by all will you come carry hesitated and then the blood rushed into her face but do you know yes alice said we know your sad history and how you must have suffered still we say will you come your father can surely spare you for a little and you can if you like come back here every night if you have any other ties and she hesitated no miss heathcote carry said in a low voice my child died a year since i will come to you and oh thank you for speaking so kindly as you have done and her eyes filled with tears and now alice said i must ask and i beg of you to answer me painful as it is to both of us a few questions about that wretched time all we know is that your father called upon my uncle and accused his nephew of having deceived and deserted you and said that he had seen your body he thought so miss heathcote but it was not god spared me that sin i went out blind and despairing when i read that he was married i went out to drown myself but when i got to the river i thought of my fathers agony and i felt he would forgive me and though i would rather oh how much rather have died i resolved for his sake to live but it was too much for me and i was taken ill i think i went out of my mind for a while and came to myself in a hospital then i wrote to my father and he came to me we went down to weymouth first and took a shop there baby was born there people thought i was a widow and were very kind but when baby died i did not like it and came here six months ago and now i must ask you a more painful question you do not know the sorrow and misery this has caused me he was to me as a brother to my uncle as a son we have never seen him since he has been ruined and has gone out to australia to work for his living now that we know you are living we can forgive him but i esteemed him and thought so highly of him that i would so like to know if there is not some little palliation you will tell me carry and she took her hand in her earnestness for gods sake tell me the truth even if it is against yourself i do so want when i see him again to find that though he has sinned i may yet esteem him somewhat as i used to do was it in a moment of madness or did he solemnly promise to marry you alice awaited the reply with an intense anxiety upon her face carry was very pale and was a moment before she answered miss heathcote i wish i could tell you that it was as you hope i have forgiven him and wish him no ill but it was not so he over and over again promised to marry me he swore it on the bible he said if his uncle did not die in a month or two as he expected he would marry me privately i can show you his letter she added i have it still it is not necessary miss heathcote said sadly i feel you are telling me only the truth oh carry and she burst into tears if you knew how i have hoped against hopehow i buoyed myself up all these years with the faith that when your father said that he had deliberately deceived you under promise to marry you he said so only in his grief and anger but it is all over now only from your own lips could i have believed that frank maynard would have i beg your pardon carry said turning very white again and trembling all over who did you say seeing her agitation alice said hastily i beg your pardon for paining you by mentioning his name who did you say again carry asked frank maynard alice said surprised at this strange conduct frank maynard carry said is it frank maynard who has been accused all this time yes yes alice said the possibility of a mistake flashing across her and leaping up she seized carry by the shoulders oh carry carry for gods sake tell me it was not hetell me and i will fall on my knees and bless you tell me it was not he frank maynard again carry repeated i never saw him but once no it was captain bradshaws nephew mr bingham alice gave a cry that was almost a scream of joy and then fell on her knees great god i thank thee she sobbed out merciful god i thank thee that thou hast taken this great burden off methat thou hast cleared my brother from this accusation then with her face on carrys knee she cried more quietly for some time carry crying too although she hardly even yet comprehended what had happened and is it possible she asked at last when alice had a little recovered her composure that mr maynard has been accused of this how could such a terrible mistake have occurred your own father accused him of it to captain bradshaw impossible carry said then she rose opened the door and called to her father who was walking nervously up and down the shop during this long interview to come in father she said a dreadful mistake has somehow occurred miss heathcote says that you went to captain bradshaw and accused mr maynardthe mr maynard who saved your life you know fatherof being the cause of my death god bless my soul mr walker exclaimed in a state of extreme nervous astonishment the lady must be mistaken i never thought of such a thingit never entered my mind why should it carry looked at miss heathcote in perplexity my father is a very nervous man miss heathcote but i dont see how he could have made such a mistake as that as he says why should he alice too was puzzled can you remember what you did say mr walker i cant exactly remember what i said mr walker answered i always had a wretched memory but i am pretty sureyes i am quite surei told him his nephew had caused the death of carry for i thought she was dead then that is how the mistake occurred alice said seeing at last the truth you said nephew and he knowing from franks own lips that he had called at your house and had seen your daughter thought it was he probably he the more thought so because frank told him how very pretty your daughter was and captain bradshaw warned him not to call again because he might be losing his heart he never did call but once miss heathcote carry said glad even now to know why frank maynard had never come again to see her but we never knew that mr maynard was captain bradshaws nephew indeed how should we we always thought thatthat he was the only nephew i see it all now mr walker you thought captain bradshaw had only one nephew and accused him captain bradshaw knew one of his nephews had been to your house and admired your daughter and naturally thought at once of him poor frank poor frank but why did not mr maynard defend himself miss heathcote he never had an opportunity alice said my uncle wrote to him a very violent letter not i believe mentioning the exact offence but turning him off for ever and as they had not beenand alice coloured a littleon very good terms for some little time before i suppose frank was too high spirited to reply though i wonder he did not write too still i cant blame him for that but oh she burst out as the thought struck heroh the wickedness the vileness of the other he knew the fault for which frank was turned off and which made him my uncles sole heir and yet all this time he has encouraged the mistake and taken franks place while frank has been working for his bread and has he really done that carry asked has he really let mr maynard be accused all this time he has and more he has twitted me who he knew cared for frank as a brother with his conduct papa carry said solemnly turning to her father let me thank god that i did not marry this man a thousand times better as it is with the shame and the disgrace and the sorrow than the life i should have led with such a wretch as this to think she said bitterly that i could have loved him and believed in him thank godthank god for my escape and now mr walker alice heathcote said it is very late but i must ask you to come round with me to my uncle i cannot rest until i have shown him what a terrible wrong we have committed towards poor frank you will come tomorrow morning to see james she asked carry taking her hand it will be an act of real kindness yes carry said i will come without fail here papa is your hat and coat and mind how you come back chapter xiv waiting for the ship where is captain bradshaw was alice heathcotes first question as escorted by mr walker and the footman she entered the house in the diningroom miss heathcote alice entered followed by mr walker oh uncle she said passionately we have been so cruel and so wrong it has been such a terrible mistake after all and poor frank is quite quite innocent oh uncle im so happy so so glad and she threw her arms round captain bradshaws neck her uncle was too much surprised to speak at first innocent my dear yes uncle quite quite innocent here is mr walker to tell you sit down mr walker captain bradshaw said rather stiffly for he believed that the present was some scheme on the part of the old man to prove that carry had not gone wrong at all let me hear what you have to say i can hardly understand i confess how my nephew can be innocent in this matter although i have heard today and with pleasure that your daughter was still alive well sir mr walker began in his usual nervous hesitating way it seems it was a mistake altogether i thought of your nephewi knew him to be your nephewand i did not know the other was your nephew at all so you see you thought i meant the wrong onethat was how it was captain bradshaw looked at alice in bewilderment damme alice if i can make head or tail of what he says or what he means he means this uncle he knew you had a nephew but he only knew you had one nephew he came to accuse that nephew as the destroyer of his child that man whom he accused was not the nephew you were thinking of it was fred bingham who had done this thing and not frank maynard frank never went there again after that evening when he spoke to you they never knew he was in any way related to you it was fred bingham he spoke of he was the man mr walker knew to be your nephew and who had ruined his daughter captain bradshaw sat thunderstruck he looked helplessly at stephen walker who corroborated what alice had said by putting in yes sir that is what i meant to say when i came to you i came to ask for vengeance against the mr bingham i knew to be your nephew i never thought of mr maynard i did not know he was your relation at all i only knew him as the man who had saved my life captain bradshaw listened as a man in a dream then leaping on his feet with his quick hasty way he exclaimed then frank never had anything to do with it at all nothing uncle nothing at all he is quite innocent quite uncleas innocent as we are my god exclaimed the old officer what have i been doing oh what a miserable old man i am alice was it not enough for me that i turned a daughter out to die in the street and now i have left frank my dear dear boy to struggle for a living to sail thousands of miles away to work for his wife and children with his own hands oh alice why did i ever believe it what shall i do you are happier than i am alice for you never believed him quite guilty you always said it was impossible while i never doubted it for a moment my poor boy my brave noble frank and he sat down again in his chair and cried unrestrainedly how you must have suffered why did you not writewhy did you not demand as you had a right why you were thrown off but there after that letter of mine who can blame you as for him and the old man leaped up again in one of his furies of rage as for him and he walked up and down the room but there he said presently we can talk of him afterwards the great question is frank is it too late to stop him alice he sailed yesterday uncle alice said sadly yes yes alice so james said but many of those emigrant vessels touch at plymouth we may stop him yet we will start there in the morning what is the ships name alice alice did not know never mind i will go down to the station and he rang the bell violently james go out and get a carriage if the places are shut up wake them up say i will pay anythingi must have a carriage down to the station i will telegraph to prescott to meet me at plymouth tomorrow my dear yes it is late but i will find out where the telegraph clerk lives he will be glad enough to get up and send a message to london for a ten pound note very much astonished was arthur prescott at being awakened at two oclock in the morning by a loud and continued knocking at his door and still more when he opened it on seeing a railway porter standing there beg pardon sir the man said touching his hat message just come up from torquay past usual hours clerk thought it might be special offered to bring it down thank you prescott said wait till i strike a light here is halfacrown for yourself good night and prescott returned to the table to read the telegram it was quite characteristic of the man who had sent it infernal mistake about frank damned old fool must stop him does his ship put in at plymouth i start there at once telegraph to me at royal hotel name of ship come there yourself by first train in the morning walker is an incoherent ass not so great an ass as i am whod have thought it fred bingham a knave and a scoundrel you will understand i cant say i do prescott said to himself as after examining a bradshaw he again got into bed it seems that it is all coming right at last but why or how or who walker is or what fred bingham has got to do with it or what the mistake was i have not the least conception at any rate my course is to go up to the office to inquire whether the ship will put into plymouth to telegraph to captain bradshaw and to go down to plymouth by the eleven oclock train i wonder whether alice heathcote will be there he says yes and wondering upon this point prescott fell asleep again captain bradshaw arrived with alice heathcote at the royal hotel plymouth at eleven in the morning they had telegraphed before starting from torquay to order rooms at the royal it had hardly been a pleasant journey for alice for she would like to have sat quiet without talking she was anxious about the question of catching the emigrant vessel but even this was a matter of minor importance to her her one great emotion was joy that frank was worthy of her esteem and love that she could think of him again as her girlhoods trusty friend as her brother that it might be a year before they met again was as nothing now even had she known she would never meet him again it would have been scarce a drawback to her pleasure the only cloud on her sunshine was the feeling of selfreproach for having doubted him still severe upon herself as she was disposed to be for this reason she could not but allow that under the circumstances she could hardly have thought otherwise and she consoled herself that even against the apparently crushing evidence she had always uttered a sort of protest of disbelief with this feeling then of happiness and confidence she would have liked to lie back in her corner of the railwaycarriage and to enjoy her thoughts but her uncle was in a most excitable mood he was as glad as alice was that his favourite was innocent of the fault which had so long been laid against him and he was far more anxious than she was as to the chance of arresting his journey his gladness and anxiety were both alternated with bursts of reproach against himself for having been so hasty in believing frank to have been guilty and in fits of furious anger against fred bingham against whom he fulminated threats of all kinds mingled with little outbursts of petulance against alice herself for her indifference upon driving up to the door of the royal captain bradshaw leaped hastily out of the carriage with the agility of a man of thirty any telegram for me captain bradshaw yes sir i believe there is up in your room come along alice her uncle said hurrying her movements telegram has come and then he followed the waiter muttering angrily at the infernal stupidity of people taking a telegram upstairswhy the deuce couldnt they have it ready for me at the door just like them here they reached the sittingroom and tore open the envelope of the telegram ships name tasmania captain has open orders his putting into plymouth will depend upon the wind i come down by eleven train delighted matters are cleared up how is the wind and the captain turned abruptly to the waiter wind sir dont know sir then go and see sir the captain roared wrathfully damme what are you here for except to know what way the wind is the man returned looking rather sulky the wind is southerly sir southerly is it captain bradshaw said well i am no wiser as far as i know than i was before i think uncle alice said gently the best plan will be to go down to the sea the sailors there will know what wind a ship is most likely to put in here with and how long she will be with such weather as this in coming round from london certainly alice let us start at once the questioning was at alices request left to her for her uncles impatient hastiness would have rendered it a far more difficult process they went up to a sailor leaning upon the seawall and looking through a telescope at some vessels in the offing would you kindly tell us whether vessels sailing from london to australia and not being bound to put in here would be likely to do so with the wind blowing as at present the sailor touched his hat well my lady they might and they might not of course it would depend partly upon the number of passengers and the sea stock they had on board this is an emigrant ship alice said well miss the sailor said turning round again to the sea as if to assure himself that no change had taken place i should say yes its a very light breeze you see and they will be a week or so coming round from the downs if it does not freshen and they would be likely to put in here to fill up again with water before she takes her departure i cant say for sure you see miss he said seeing how anxious his questioner was some captains are more given to putting in here than others are but i should say if this wind holds its odds he comes in and if it shifts to the southwest which is likely enough it makes a foul wind of it and then hes pretty sure to run in when did she sail miss she left gravesend early on tuesday morning ay and this is friday well miss she is likely enough to be here on monday or tuesday if the wind holds as at present and how are we to know if she comes in alice asked well miss if you want to catch her directly she drops anchor your best plan will be to go to the signalstation and ask them to send a man down to your hotel directly she is sighted thank your honour god bless you as captain bradshaw dropped a halfsovereign into his hand well upon the whole alice that is as good as we could have expected yes i think so uncle we have nothing to do but to wait in the afternoon prescott arrived alice was looking from the window when the fly drew up and she said to her uncle i will go to my room uncle while you explain the matter to mr prescott my dear mr prescott i am most glad to see you i find we have a good chance of stopping frank what a mistake it has all been to be sure i always said i was an old fool but i never really thought so until now i am indeed glad captain bradshaw that the mistake has been cleared up but i shall be very glad if you will tell me what it has been about for to myself as well as to frank the whole affair has been a perfect and complete mystery it must have been so indeed mr prescott what did you think it was for i suppose you must have had some opinion upon it prescott hesitated speak out mr prescott i want to know what poor frank really thought of it well captain bradshaw the only thing in which frank could conceive that he had displeased you was in thwarting your wishes with regard to miss heathcote he had hoped that you had ceased to feel any anger upon that point before he married but when he received your letter his only conclusion and i own my own agreed with his was that you had brooded over the matter until it had become a sort of hallucination with you in fact that upon that point you had to speak frankly gone a little out of your mind i held that opinion until i saw you at the time your grandson was discovered by the way in which you spoke and also by the manner in which miss heathcote expressed herself with regard to the breach between you and frank i saw that my suspicions were altogether wrong and that there was some to me altogether unknown and perfectly inexplicable cause of complaint against frank i was convinced at the time that it must be an error i have so perfect a faith in frank i have known him so closely and so intimately for so many years he is so perfectly frank and open with me about i may almost say every thought that i was certain he could wilfully have done nothing to forfeit your esteem and that of miss heathcote you refused to explain and i was forced to put it down to one of those extraordinary mistakes which sometimes occur and which one can only leave to time to solve and now i hope captain bradshaw that you will tell me what this supposed error of frank could have been i will tell you mr prescott you remember coming one night to me and telling me that frank had picked a man up from almost underneath the wheels of an omnibus and had had a narrow escape of being run over himself yes i remember perfectly his name waslet me seeahwalker just so mr prescott some little time after frank came in one evening and told me that he had been to see mr walker that he was a superior person for his station of life and that he had an extremely pretty daughter i am a man of the world mr prescott and i know how these sort of things end i remember i told him that they were certain to end badly that a man either made a fool of himself and married her or a rascal of himself and seduced her frank was at first inclined to laugh at my advice but at last he owned that i was right that the girl was a pretty loveable sort of girl and that it would be just as well perhaps that he should not call again i remember perfectly prescott said frank coming up to my rooms and telling me i know he said uncles a good old boy and i wont go there any more and i really dont think he did frank is as open as the day and he would have been certain to mention it to me i am sure he is mr prescott but like an old fool as i was i doubted him afterwards and you must confess i had reason somewhere about a year afterwards frank was married and went off on his travels well a fortnight after that a man came to me nearly out of his mind he said his name was walker that his daughter had been seduced by my nephew under a promise of marriage that he had promised solemnly to marry her secretly at once and to make it public at my death which he thought could not be far off the old man offered to show me letters proving this and said that his daughter had drowned herself at the news of my nephews marriage and he had just been down to see her body now mr prescott i appeal to you how could i doubt that frank maynard was a miserable scoundrel prescott was perfectly thunderstruck but it could not be true sir i will wager my life it was not true but it was true mr prescott the proofs are undoubted every word the old man uttered was truth except that he was mistaken as to the body for his daughter after all did not commit suicide and is still alive now mr prescott what could miss heathcote and myself think but that frank maynard was utterly unworthy of our esteem i do not of course doubt what you say captain bradshaw prescott said warmly i have no doubt you are confident in the proofs you have received but only from frank maynards own lips will i believe this terrible charge against him ah the old man said sadly thats what i ought to have done i ought to have gone to frank and said this is the charge you shall be your own judge can you after this ever be anything to me again but then mr prescott you must remember that much as i loved frank maynard and well as i believed i knew him you knew far more of him than i did a father can know but little of his sons private life his familiar friend can judge him much better than a father can you know what each other does there are no secrets between you young men know young men as they are old men only know them as they choose to be known you see you had the advantage of me knowing franks inner life you consider yourself capable of being assured he would not do this knowing frank only as an old man knows a young one i was obliged to believe the evidence was true but captain bradshaw your telegram said it had been all a mistake and yet you now say the evidence was perfectly true and both statements are correct mr prescott mr walker told me my nephew had basely seduced his daughter under promise of marriage and he spoke truly i knowing that frank knew her of course supposed that the accusation was against him mr walker did not even know frank was my nephew but yet he spoke the truth my nephew did seduce his daughter under promise of marriage but only last night did i find out that the nephew who did it was fred bingham who as far as walker knew was the only nephew i had i see it all now prescott said delighted but do you mean to say sir is it possible that fred bingham has all this time known the reason of franks disgrace has taken his place in your affections and allowed him to be disgraced for his own crime he has done all that mr prescott and he is a damned scoundrel by gad sir the old man said furiously i am an old man but if i wasnt his uncle id horsewhip him in the public streetsid put a bullet in his bodyid by gad sir id have him flayed alive indeed he must be a great rascal captain bradshaw i never liked him i always distrusted him but i never gave him credit for such villainy as this for some time longer they talked the matter over and prescott soothed the old mans selfcondemnation by assuring him that he did not see that under the circumstances he could have doubted franks guilt but you ought to have seen him sir you ought at least to have given him an opportunity of defence so i ought mr prescott but frank was a littlejust a littleto blame too he knew how i loved him and he ought to have conquered his pride and to have insisted upon knowing precisely what he was charged with ah if he had but answered my letter and demanded an explanation all this misery and mistake might have been avoided but you seem to forget captain bradshaw that frank did answer the letter and that you returned it unopened without a word of explanation returned his letter mr prescottreturned his letter unopened you are labouring under some mistake frank never sent me a single line so it was impossible i could have returned it i can only say mr bradshaw that i know from my positive knowledge that frank did write because although i was away at the time when he told me about it he went to his desk and took out the letter and indignantly threw it upon the table and saidthere prescott there is my only answer my own letter returned unopened captain bradshaw sat stupefied he could not doubt what prescott said after a pause he rose without a word and knocked at the door of alice heathcotes bedroom which communicated with the sittingroom alice please come here alice came in oh mr prescott so you have heard it all poor frank have we not been cruel and you always believed in him but we will make it up to him now wont we uncle my dear her uncle said in a tone of mild despair another mystery has arisen in the course of this extraordinary circumstance and i want you to tell me whether i or mr prescott is dreaming i was saying what a pity it was that frank knowing how i loved him had not put aside his pride and written to me demanding an explanation mr prescott asserts that frank did write and that i returned his letter unopened oh no uncle never not a line came from frank do you not remember those three weary weary days after his return from abroad when we waitedhoping praying that frank would write some line of extenuation some prayer for pardon do you not remember that at the end of the three days you said to meit is no use waiting any longer alice let us go abroad and alice heathcotes eyes filled with tears at the thought of that sad time no no mr prescott you are mistaken frank never wrote i am puzzled miss heathcote and of course credit your and your uncles assertion that you never received the letter but i must reassert that frank did write for i saw his letter it was returned unopened in an envelope apparently directed for i know his handwriting by captain bradshaw and sealed with his crest by the way it was the very seal on that envelope which two years afterwards evan holl recognised and which led to the discovery of your grandson captain bradshaw and alice looked at each other in astonishment this letter prescott went on after a pause must have reached your house because it was returned in an envelope sealed with a seal kept in the house you never received it who did there must have been some treachery at work captain bradshaw and it is needless to point whose interest it was to suppress this letter and to do it in such a way as to make it impossible for frank with any selfrespect whatever to write again the exact effect in fact which it did have he never could have done such a thing as that mr prescott alice heathcote said doubtingly i do not know miss heathcote fred bingham was playing for high stakes at that time james had not been discovered your uncle had told him that he had disowned frank and made him his sole heir he had kept silent as to his own fault and franks innocence he knew therefore that the result of a meeting must be the eventual discovery of the truth and his own absolute disgrace under the circumstances then he would of course have used every effort to prevent any letter frank might write from reaching you he might have bribed the postman to let him see all the letters before delivering them at the house or he might have paid one of your servants to keep them back for him by gad captain bradshaw said in a violent passion i will get to the bottom of this business whatever it costs me no wonder frank and you thought i was mad they thought i was out of my mind alice by gad i will have some one hung for it before i have done and captain bradshaw walked furiously up and down the room who was in the habit of taking the letters from the postman the footman alice said he has been with us ever sincehe went abroad with ushe is downstairs now will you let me speak to him captain bradshaw but if you do please let me do it my own way if we frighten him he will of course say nothing captain bradshaw rang the bell tell my footman to come up we want to ask you a few questions james prescott said when the man entered you have been in captain bradshaws service for some time eight years sir altogether now james i want you to answer my questions just as if captain bradshaw were not here you understand me you are to speak just as you think well james you have found captain bradshaw a kind master yes sir the man said he is a very good master a little irritable at times jameseh the man who had some sense of quiet humour repliedyes sir lets out a bit but soon gets over it alice heathcote smiled and captain bradshaw angry as he was laughed outright just so jameslets out a little and soon gets over it still on the whole you get on very well with him and would do anything in your way to serve him that i would the man said earnestly for he was really attached to his master prescott saw that he meant what he said and adopted his course of questioning accordingly now you remember the time before you went on to the continent yes sir do you remember anything particular about that time the man was silent speak out james captain bradshaw wants you to speak the exact truth well sir i remember it well because master was awful cantankerous about that time worse than he ever was before or since i thought i should have had to have left him have you any idea why captain bradshaw was more irritable than usual about that time again the man was silent come james it is a matter of importance to your masteri may say of great importance i am not asking these questions for amusement well sir the man said i believe master was bothered by letters from a man who was threatening him captain bradshaw and alice heathcote uttered simultaneous ejaculations of surprise but prescott made a sign to them to be quiet and proceeded with his crossexamination quite so james your master was troubled by a letterwriter who threatened him well james mr bingham when he told you that told you that it was important for your masters sake that he should not receive these threatening letters the man turned very pale come james you acted for the best i have no doubt you meant to do your master a service and captain bradshaw will not be angry with you if you do but speak the truth you see we have all the particulars we only wish to receive the corroboration from your own lips mr bingham told you that for your masters sake it was important he should not receive these threatening letters and he asked you to show all that came by post before giving them to your master yes sir that was just it he said he had found out the man who was sending the letters and that he would be able in a few days to put a stop to it and save master from being bothered the day the letter did come he told me i need not trouble any more for that he was to see the man that night and that master would not be annoyed in future the infernal scoundrel captain bradshaw broke out the infernal scoundrel one more question and i have done james prescott said did you see what mr bingham did with the letter no sir he said he wanted to write a letter and he went into the diningroom and stayed there a few minutes he did write i remember at least the inkstand was on the table and the taper had been alight i remember because there was a blot of sealingwax upon the cloth and i had a deal of trouble in getting it out that is all james captain bradshaw will quite believe that you did it for the best and acted under mr binghams instructions in the matter but let it be a lesson to you never again to tamper with letters when i tell you that captain bradshaws annoyance was caused entirely because that letter had not arrived as he expected it that it was entirely because he did not receive it that he went on to the continent and that the very greatest unhappiness has been caused in his mind and in that of other people by his not getting it that will do james the man retired without a word for he saw by captain bradshaws face that anything he could say would only make matters worse he went downstairs in a state of great despondency for he was much attached to his master late in the evening he was taken up to bed in a state of maudlin intoxicationfor the first time since he had been in captain bradshaws serviceand with many entreaties that they would only bring that little beggar here and see what hed give him there was a silence after he had left the room the whole mystery is cleared up you see prescott said dont talk about it alice heathcote remarked it is too shocking and unnatural i must go out captain bradshaw said if i stop here and cant thrash some one i shall have a fit i must walk it off mr prescott please amuse my niece i shall be back by dinner time and so he went out and anyone who saw him as he paced up and down the esplanade with the most rapid steps striking with his cane viciously at every post he passed must have come to the conclusion that he was a terribly excitable old gentleman indeed there was a little silence after captain bradshaw had left and then alice heathcote said now mr prescott i want you to tell me all about frank and his wife you are aware i know nothing whatever of their life for the last three years i only know the bank failed and poor frank lost all his money and that they went down into yorkshire on a railroad please tell me all about them prescott told all the story how happy they had been together and how well they had borne the loss of their fortune and how brave and hopeful and true franks wife had been dear katie i shall love her so much alice said how happy frank has been in having such a brave heart to stand by his side in his misfortune how proud he must be of her yes prescott said his wife is indeed one in a thousand miss heathcote frank has been a very lucky man in spite of his troubles this quite reminds me of old times mr prescott when you were a boy at westminster franks faithful achates as he used to call you yes thats a long time back now miss heathcote you used to call me prescott in those days ah i was a little girl in those days mr prescott with short frocks and a small development of respect there is six oclock striking i must go up and dress for dinner prescott sat quiet for some time it was a long time back twelve years and he had loved her ever since might he yet hope to win this great prize some day chapter xv reconciled captain bradshaw returned to dinner in a greatly mollified state and that meal passed off very pleasantly the talk turned principally upon frank and his doings for captain bradshaw as well as alice was anxious to know all that had occurred since they had been separated it was very pleasant to them to be able to talk unrestrainedly upon a subject which they both had so much at heart but which had been so long interdicted only once was captain bradshaws wrath kindled into expression and do you mean to tell me sir do you mean to tell me that that infernal little rascal after cheating frank out of his place here induced him to go down to yorkshire kept him doing nothing until he had spent the little money he took down and then kept him at work like a common foreman on two pounds a week yes sir that is all frank got i wonder frank did not break his neck for him i wonder how he stood it a single day how could he help it sir he had not a penny at the time both he and his wife were too proud to write to her relations i know from what he has told me that over and over again he was on the edge of breaking out but with his wife and children what could he do as he told me he ground his teeth and bore it but it has a little changed frank captain bradshaw it has made him rather sore and i think you must prepare yourself for a little difficulty when you first meet him frank would have cheerfully borne anything himself but it has tried him very much to see his wife suffer and i can assure you from what he has told me that she has actually suffered katie was as bright as ever when she came up to london before starting but there was no mistaking from her face that she has had a great deal to go through frank never told even me to whom he told nearly everything the shifts to which they were reduced but there was a look of sharp pain came across his face when he spoke of those times which told me more than any details could have done there was silence for a short time and then prescott desirous of changing the subject said i may not see you tomorrow morning before i start for town captain bradshaw but i hope you will telegraph to me the instant the ship is signalled i will come down by the next train go up to town mr prescott quite impossible my dear sir we cannot spare you i shall want you above all things to explain matters to frank because its as likely as not that he will not listen to me for a moment come mr prescott it is friday today you cannot get up to town until tomorrow afternoon the next day is sunday and the ship will very likely come in on monday pooh pooh my dear boy it is out of the question i really have a good deal to do prescott said i told the clerk i should be sure to return by tonights mail but as you say i should not gain much by it and i would very much rather stay here so if you really think my presence is at all essential at the meeting between yourself and frank i do think it most essential my dear prescott he knows anyhow that you are his sincere friend while he looks upon me as a despotic savage halfinsane old man and so prescott remained and was very happy for the next three days it was so pleasant being with alice walking beside her sitting with her and having long quiet ttettes while captain bradshaw read the paper or dozed in his chair the wind still held to the south with a little west and was very light and uncertain and it was not until the morning of tuesday as they were at breakfast that the messenger came in to say that a vessel was just coming into the roads with the tasmanias number flying thank god captain bradshaw ejaculated fervently now alice finish your breakfast my dear and let us be off as soon as we can the sooner we get it over the better for i can tell you i feel as nervous as a schoolboy going up to confess a fault to his master it was a long row out to the tasmania and seemed to them all even longer than it really was they were very silent as they neared the ship round which several other boats were already lying while others were like themselves approaching her prescott said i think i can see frank leaning over the bulwarks i think it as well that he should not notice us until we are fairly on board he will not know you through your veil miss heathcote and captain bradshaw and myself will keep our heads bent as they neared the ladder alice put her hand on her uncles arm dear uncle you will not be hasty whatever he says to you remember how he has suffered and how unjustly no my dear you need not be afraid i have been too hasty already nothing frank can say will be more than i know i deserve you can trust me for once to keep my temper they ascended the steps and then prescott pointed out to them a group standing a short distance off looking at the land kate had baby in her arms while frank was holding charley on his shoulder please wait here and look over the side prescott said in accordance with their previously arranged plans while i find the captain they did so and prescott speedily found the officer in a few words prescott explained to him that he had come off with a gentleman and lady to see mr maynard and a capital fellow too the captain said warmly one of the right sort and no mistake while as for his wife shes a trump sir thats what she is no grumbling no discontent takes everything as it comes and is as cheery and as bright as if she had been accustomed to it all her life i am afraid captain you will not be pleased when i tell you our errand an unfortunate mistake has led to a quarrel between him and his uncle a very rich old gentleman to whom he will be the sole heir the mistake has been cleared up and explained since you left the river and his uncle is here with me to take him home again i shall be sorry indeed to lose him for he has been the life and soul of the passengers since we started kept them in good spirits got up gamesjust the fellow to sail with but if its for his advantage i shall not grudge him his fortune is there anything i can do for you yes captain i wanted to ask you if you would kindly let me have the use of your cabin for a few minutes with all my heart and the captain led the way to his cabin this way uncle and prescott and captain bradshaw went into the cabin which was on deck while alice remained looking over the bulwarks in her former position frank was romping with charley and keeping him in screams of delight by pretending to be about to throw him over the bulwarks when one of the boys came up please sir the captain will be glad if you will step into his cabin certainly frank said setting the boy down upon the deck there charley dont get into mischief i expect it is about the luggage katie i was asking him last night whether he would have some of it up on deck when we had anchored kates attention was thoroughly taken up now with the two children for charley evinced an inclination to toddle after his papa please stop charley mr cairns kate cried laughingly to a passenger near the child the gentleman addressed was on the point of seizing the child when a lady who was coming up caught it up in her arms and bore him struggling violently back to kate you little scamp his mother said if you dont keep quiet by me i must send for nurse and then looking up and seeing that charley was in the arms of a stranger she stopped she had never seen alice heathcote but once and then only for a brief moment and she did not in the slightest recognise the lady who stood before her alice put the child down by her side and said you do not know me i am alice heathcote kate drew back then she drew herself up haughtily i suppose you wish to see my husband miss heathcote i will send for him his uncle is in the cabin with him alice said quietly he has come on board to explain to and alices intuition taught her that kate would not like to hear her husbands christian name from her lips to my cousin that a terrible mistake has taken placeand thatthat charley come here kate said sharply as the child was pulling at the strange ladys dress it is rather late for explanation miss heathcote the time for that has long passed thank god frank and i can for the future depend upon ourselves cousin alice said humbly will you listen to mewill you let me speak with you alone for a little while kate stood irresolute for a moment and then seeing her nurse approaching gave the baby to her and telling charley to be a good boy led the way to their little cabin kate was very sore with their visitorsore because she remembered the cold proud face with which she had passed frank in knightsbridgesore because she had sent him money when he was in poverty with these thoughts kate led the way with an air which might have befitted her had she been a queen and miss heathcote her bond slave when they entered the cabin kate said now miss heathcote i am willing of course to listen to you but i tell you i am sorry you have come we have done with england we have learned the true value of our friends and we are content to be all in all to each other you have one friend still in whom you trust i think alice said arthur prescott is here with my uncle yes kate said he is a friendyes frank trusts him and so do i alice hesitated and then laying aside her previously quiet tone she said cousin kate franks wife listen to me do you know i love frank as a brother do you knowi can humble myself to youthat i once loved him more do you know that i once so loved him that i could have gone through even what you have gone through to know that he loved me i learned from his own lips that it was not to be that he loved me as a sister but nothing more i accepted the fact kate i fought against my love and i learned to look at him only as a dear brother do you think i did not suffer what have your sufferings been to what mine then were you have borne disappointment neglect want but you have had frank always with you you have known that he prized you beyond all beside but i conquered myself i heard that you had won his heart and upon the day of his marriage i could have stood beside the altar and could have listened to his vows to you without a pang and could have loved you as a sister for his sake then kate i heard he wasoh forgive me for saying so now forgive me for believing itthat he was wicked that he had done a dishonourable wicked action you can smile proudly at the accusation you are his wife i was only his sister i really never believed it in my heart and yet my uncle told me that doubt was impossible still i hopedhoped against hopethat it was not so frank came back and no letter came in answer to my uncles reproach to him yes she said in answer to kates movement we know now that he wrote but my uncle never got it it was sent back by other hands i will tell you how presentlyand then kate all hope died out we travelled abroad and tried hard to forget the past now only since you sailed from london we have learned the truth have learned how unjustly and cruelly we have doubted frank oh cousin make allowance for me i know what you must have thought of us but in our place we could not but have doubted kate i have heard so much of you these last three days i do so want to love you and to be loved by you i know you are so worthy to be franks wife can you not forgive me kate can you not thinking of what i have suffered take me to your heart kate had listened at first coldly and then tearfully and at last as alice ceased she threw herself upon alices neck and cried oh alice why did we not know each other before with the exception of fanny larpent who was too young for kate to confide her great troubles to she had since she married had no female friend and she had often longed for some one in whom she could really trust and confide all the feelings which she had so bravely concealed from her husband when alice began to speak she had hardened herself against her she had determined not to melt but this cry for forgiveness of the stately woman before her had broken down the barrier she had set up and kate when she once gave way gave way altogether to both women tears were a relief alice who had cried most before was the first to recover now i must tell you the whole story katie i may call you katie maynt i yes alice but i dont want to know the story i am content to know it was all a mistake and i am glad to hear that franks uncle has come to say goodbye to him for frank will i know always be glad to think kindly of his uncle and of you alice she put in frank never believed you were against him but katie alice said we have not come to say goodbye at all we have come to take you on shore yes really katie she said earnestly as kate made a motion of positive denial poor james uncles grandson cannot live long and uncle wants frank and you to come and live with him and be his children he has got mr bingham kate said coldly neither frank nor i want to take his place fred bingham has turned out a very wicked man katie it was for his fault that we have doubted poor frank but it has all come to light now and uncle will never see him again really alice kate exclaimed it is very wicked i knowbut then i am not not at all goodbut i hate fred bingham if i was a man i should kill him you may look shocked alice but i dont care i would kill him and there is no doubt that fred bingham would have fared but badly if he had fallen into kate maynards hands and now katie i will tell you the whole story and i am sure if you can forget for a moment you are franks wife and can put yourself in our place you will allow that there is a good excuse for us in having believed what we heard and having doubted all we had previously known of him very quietly and clearly alice heathcote went through the long and complicated story kate listened attentively to it and when alice had finished she said frankly indeed alice i cant blame captain bradshaw or you for believing this story i am very very glad it was not told to me for i dont see how i could have helped believing it myself and if frank hesitates if he will not make friends with my uncle katie will you persuade him yes alice i have been willing enough to go with frank but i love the old country and shall be very very glad to stay here frank maynard had entered the captains cabin and there had at once seen prescott my dear old man he exclaimed this is kind of you come to say a last goodbye eh well i can tell you we are as jolly as possible katie is a capital sailor and the cubs are as good as and here he stopped abruptly seeing the third person in the cabin whom standing a little behind the door he had hitherto not noticed for a moment an indignant flush flew up over his face and then his expression softened and he said uncle you here well i am glad you were a very kind friend in old days and i am glad to find you have come to say god speed you on your journey the old man was much affected oh frank frank it has all been a mistake a cruel mistake but it is not too late my boy i will make it up stop uncle frank said coldly i wish to have no excuses you have believed you had good reasons for casting me off that is all past now you have come to say goodbye and i am ready to say goodbye uncle with all my heart i wish to carry no regrets with me in my new life we will shake hands if you please without any excuses no no frank you do not understand me it has all been a terrible mistake but it is all cleared up now i want you to come back with me and live with me to be my heir and thank you frank said bitterly i have had enough of trusting in others i have done with it fool as i was i believed that men i loved and trusted loved and trusted me i have done with thati believe in my own right arm now and trust to that alone please god i will earn a living in future without thanks to any man no uncle i go on my own path and trust to myself alone for the future but frank the old man said humbly frank listen to me you have been cruelly wronged but be it so uncle my conscience absolves me from all fault i am glad you have found out you are mistaken glad to say goodbye kindly with you but no uncle i am no longer a boy and am not to be thrown off and whistled back again at the first call do you know what i have gone through uncle do you know i have not known how to pay for my wifes daily food do you know i have seen her exposed and franks voice rose in his anger to hardship do you know i have put up with indignities and insults and have had to bear them in quiet for her sake do you know that i have borne things patiently which i blush now to think ofinsults for which as there is a god in heaven i would have killed him had it not been for her and now you talk of a mistake of staying here and forgetting the pastno uncle the past will never be forgotten things like this last till death and while i live i will never forget or forgive if ever in my life i meet him alone i will kill him as mercilessly and pitilessly as i would a dog i would prescott so help me god and frank strode backwards and forwards across the little cabin in a fury of passion captain bradshaw had not interfered in any way to check the torrent of franks indignation he felt by the passion with which he spoke how intensely frank must have suffered and his sympathies were wholly with him when frank ceased speaking the old man made a gesture to prescott to intervene my dear frank prescott began you know i hope and believe that i am a true friend and that i would not hesitate to give my life to serve you yes yes old man frank said warmly you know that i rely upon you as upon myself i frank have your welfare and more i have your honour at heart as you have yourself i ask you to sit down quietly and hear the story i will tell you you will then see how the very natural doubt of your honour arose in your uncles mind you will see how indeedand i your friend say itit was impossible for him to have acted otherwise than he did you will when you have heard it be the first to allow that you yourself an impulsive man would have acted exactly as he did you will see that a tissue of falsehood has been thrown round you by fred bingham bad as you believe him to be you know absolutely nothing of what he is capable if you will but listen frank fairly and dispassionately you will i am sure grant that there is nothing which can prevent you with the highest feeling of selfrespect standing in the place as your uncles heir from which fred bingham has been cast out for ever the last words of prescott had more effect with frank maynard than all that he had previously said if that is the case prescott i shall be easily satisfied god knows i have never courted my uncles money that i loved him for his kindness to me as a boy and not with any idea of the money he might leave me if i only know that fred bingham will not be his heir i should care not one single scrap if every farthing were to go to the charities of london then you will give me a patient hearing frank yes prescott i will and frank sat down resolutely to listen step by step prescott went through the whole story and explained every particular of the deeplaid scheme by which frank had been made to bear the blame of anothers sin frank had promised to be a patient listener but he hardly kept his promise he constantly interrupted prescotts story with ejaculations of rage questions and furious outbreaks when prescott had finished captain bradshaw said there frank now you see how i was deceived can you forgive an old man for having been taken in by a scoundrel and for having doubted you my dear uncle my dear dear uncle frank cried leaping up and taking the old mans two hands forgive there is nothing to forgive i am so glad to find that it has all been a mistake and that as i am restored to you you are restored to me i dont care a rap for the property uncle leave it to whom you like but i am very happy to feel that we are to each other what we used to be and you will leave the ship frank and come ashore with us i dont know uncle frank said doubtingly my katies a very proud little woman in her way and she has been sorely tried i am quite ready to forget all the past but i cannot answer for her she will not move an inch for the sake of position or moneyindeed they will i know make her more resolute to go than she might otherwise be i shall tell her the story uncle and leave it in her hands quite right frank but you need not tell her the story i think she knows it by this time alice is with her mind uncle frank said leading the way out i leave it with katie if she is the least soreand you know she will naturally be less ready to make allowances than i amif she is the least sore if she says to me i would rather go frank i go i shall be very very glad to know that i go friends with you unclethat this miserable misunderstanding is cleared up but whatever the pecuniary consequence to me however much you may be grieved or offended i abide by katies wishes halloa charley boy he broke off as his child came running up to him holding up his arms to be lifted up wheres mamma down in cabin pappy left charley here with jane gone down with lady frank went downstairs with his uncle and prescott he went to his cabin door and opened it kate was sitting on the berth with her arms round alice heathcotes waist both had evidently been crying come in frank here is a friend there was no hesitation on alices part she rose from her seat and fell crying into franks arms oh frank frank can you forgive us frank kissed her cheek and said there is nothing to forgive alice it has been a cruel mistake but none of us are to blame it is all over now then releasing her he turned to kate kiss me darling thank god all this is over and we are all friends again this is my uncle will you kiss me katie the old man said i have been an old fool but frank has forgiven me will you forgive me too yes kate said kissing him frankly it is all over now it is left to you katie the old man said all our future is in your hands frank is my heir in any case in any case he will have an income at once to live here or wherever he chooses it is for you to decide katie frank has left it entirely in your hands will you go out to australia and be happy in each other or will you stay here and cheer an old mans life this time kate gave a kiss without being asked and said simply i always hated the thoughts of going out of england if frank really wishes to stay i shall be very very glad and so it was settled a short conversation only was necessary to arrange as to details captain bradshaw himself proposed that as the things they had got could be of no possible use to them in england it would be the best plan to divide them among the emigrants the captain being called in agreed to get them on deck during the voyage to put them all up to auction and divide the proceeds among the poorer emigrants and then summoning the astonished and delighted evan and jane the partyafter a great handshaking and many good wishes between frank and kate and their late fellowvoyagersgot into their boat and amid three hearty cheers from the emigrants pulled for shore chapter xvi squaring accounts it was a happy party which sat down to dinner that day at the royal captain bradshaw was delighted with his newlyfound niece and kate on her part was no less pleased with the cheery warmhearted kindly old indian officer so much did they take to each other that both alice and frank laughingly declared that they should be jealous they had dined early for prescotts business absolutely obliged him to go up by the mail train to london for the present they had formed no plans but it was arranged that at any rate for a fortnight they should go down to torquay where prescott promised to join them in a few days frank walked with him down to the railway station and saw him off and upon his return found his wife and captain bradshaw vying with each other in their praises of his friend alice was sitting by thoughtfully with a flush upon her cheek i do wish i could do something for him frank but legal promotion is not in my line i am afraid prescott is hardly eligible for a place on the bench yet uncle he is very hard working and clever but the bar is slow work i suppose he has not much beyond his profession very little uncle i know his income was not sufficient to keep him before he got any practice and he was obliged to draw upon his capital but he told me last year that he was paying his expenses now which was highly satisfactory considering he had only been called four years dear old prescott frank said enthusiastically i wish he could get some very nice girl with plenty of money to marry him frank had at the moment spoken without any special meaning but kate who had long known from frank where prescott had given his heart glanced up at alice and saw that the colour had mounted up to her very forehead kate drew her own conclusions from this and at night confided to frank that she thought that alice heathcote would some day carry out his wish regarding prescott do you mean that you think she will marry him kate kate nodded hes an awfully good fellow katie i only hope you may be right if she does she will have to ask him for i feel pretty sure prescott will never summon up courage sufficient to ask her in spite of alice being an heiress and prescott a poor man i shall consider her to be a lucky girl i think so too frank its lucky for you he did not come down with you that time into staffordshire for there is no saying that i might not have taken a fancy to him ah katie but he might not have taken a fancy to you frank laughed he has been thinking of alice for i dont know how long well frank kate said looking round the room the tasmania was well enough you know but this is more comfortable after all i should think so frank laughed and thank goodness there will be no deckwashing over our heads at five oclock tomorrow morning the next day the party were installed at torquay james greeted frank maynard with a quiet warmth he had been rather better during the time that his uncle had been away and seemed very happy under the quiet nursing of carry walker she came to him every day after breakfast walked out beside his chair and went home again to her father during the afternoon which james spent in the drawingroom with his friends dinner over he went up to his room and there carry and usually alice heathcote chatted or read to him until he went to bed evan had now taken the place of his former attendant and drew him in his chair when he went out and many were the visitors of torquay who looked pityingly back at the evidently dying cripple and at the quiet sadlooking young lady in mourning who walked beside him prescott came down according to promise three or four days after the others and upon the morning after his arrival captain bradshaw took him aside now mr prescott i want to ask your opinion and advice i have had a letter this morning from that rascal fred bingham he says that he is not particularly busy at present and that he intends to come down here to stop a day or two he will arrive he says tomorrow in the middle of the day do you think of stopping him no no captain bradshaw said exultingly on no account whatever i only wish i could invite the whole of torquay to be present at the meeting i am only debating in my mind whether i will horsewhip the scoundrel or leave it to frank no no captain bradshaw his punishment will be heavy enough not that i pity him for i do not think any possible punishment would be too great if i thought horsewhipping would increase his punishment i would say horsewhip him as much as you please or rather let frank do it but i think quiet contempt and the utter downfall of all his schemes will be a punishment greater than any severe personal pain could give him i am sorry you are not in favour of horsewhipping captain bradshaw said discontentedly my fingers old as they are are itching for it dont you thinkeh no indeed sir prescott said laughing besides he would have his action for assault and battery and we should have a public scandal which for all our sakes but more especially for the sake of miss walker we ought to avoid yes yes the old man said i forgot the poor girl of course you are right what should you advise then i should say sir let him come up into the drawingroom where just yourself james and i shall be then i leave it to you to state the facts i would tell miss heathcote and katie that he is coming but i would not let frank know anything about it keep him out of the way somehow else we shall have a violent scene frank is an easygoing man and i never saw him but once or twice fairly roused but when he is captain bradshaw he is terrible and strong as he is the whole of us together would hardly keep him from nearly killing fred bingham if he once got near him serve him right too captain bradshaw muttered to himself well prescott arrange it as you like alice and kate were accordingly warned but prescott had some difficulty in persuading the latter to agree that frank should be kept in the dark her sentiments being entirely in accordance with those of captain bradshaw in the matter of horsewhipping at last however she reluctantly gave way to the arguments of alice and prescott and agreed to keep the matter from frank it had been arranged that nothing should be said to james until the morning as they did not wish to excite him that evening as carry and alice came together out of the room of the invalid alice said please come to my room miss walker for a moment i want to speak to you alone i think it right to tell you in order that you may leave earlier than usual so as to avoid any risk of a meeting that he you understand who i mean will be here tomorrow at one oclock carry turned a little pale i am not afraid to meet him miss heathcote it is not i who have to be ashamed now i know him as he is my only shame is that i should ever have loved him ever have been deceived by him i have long ceased to think of him as anything to me now i despise him utterly thank you all the same miss heathcote but i am not afraid of meeting him and with an air of pride which sat strangely upon her usually quiet figure carry walker went home to her father the next day at a quarter to one alice heathcotefor kate had obstinately refused to have any hand whatever in getting her husband out of the waysaid suddenly by the way frank i want you to do a commission for me certainly alice what is it i wish you would go down to the musicshop at the other end of the esplanade and ask if they have got the isabella waltzes very well alice but wont this afternoon do we can all walk down there together i particularly want them to try after lunch frank i have a particular reason oh very well alice frank laughed if you have got a particular reason of course theres an end of it come along prescott you may as well walk with me you have nothing to do yes mr prescott has frank i want him here oh you do alice you appear to me to have become a species of despot this morning well i suppose i must do as i am told kate beat the ground impatiently with her foot and would have spoken had not alice looked imploringly at her you savage girl alice said when frank had gone out of the room you were very nearly stopping him i was kate said resolutely and im sorry i didnt you may laugh arthur but im quite in earnest i consider its cheating frank shamefully alice did not answer but turned to prescott now mr prescott will you wheel james in here from the next room come katie you will be glad afterwards we have not let you have your own way a few minutes afterwards there was a sharp knock at the door the footman who had been previously instructed by prescott to say nothing about the presence of the maynards led the way to the drawingroom as fred bingham left the hall he heard a loud burst of childish laughter james he called but the man did not appear to hear but went on to the door which he opened i wonder who the devil that child is passed through fred binghams mind in that short instant i hate children that fellows face had a sort of malicious grin on it what can be up and then he advanced with his usual pleasant smile towards his uncle how are you uncle you are looking wonderfully well and james too is and here he stopped abruptly startled by the look of deadly hate and rage which sat on the cripples pale face james has been rather better lately captain bradshaw said he does not look well now for he is a little excited but he has got a new nurse who suits him admirably a most excellent young woman and an old friend i am very glad to hear it uncle fred stammered seeing that some serious danger the nature of which he could not comprehend threatened him an old friend did you say yes fred an old friend i daresay you would remember her name if i were to mention it indeed fred said the thought of all his possible enemies flashing through his mind what is it i will answer a voice said and to the astonishment of the others as well as that of fred bingham a lady in black entered carry walker fred bingham do you remember her fred bingham recoiled as from a heavy blow carry he gasped alive yes alive fred you thought me dead you thought the secret safe and secure in your own position let the punishment fall upon another oh it was a brave act fred a brave act to deceive a trusting girl who had no friends but an old fathera brave act to marry another and to leave her to diea brave act to let the blame rest on your cousin and to take his place believing that i lay in my grave but god spared my life spared it that i might frustrate all your hopes and plans and cast you down when you thought your success was certain fred bingham she said advancing a step towards him and rising grandly above him in her indignation as he shrank back from her i despise myself that i ever loved youi loath myself that i ever listened to you but at last fred my wrongs are avengedthe helpless friendless girl you deceived and deserted has her hour of triumph at last heartless pitiless mean fred bingham since i have known you as you are i thank god daily for one thingi thank him that at least i am spared the misery the degradation of being the wife of such a creature and now goodbye fred bingham i never thought to see you again i once trembled at the thought of meeting you now i feel only contempt we have met twice fred bingham the first time you had your victorynow i have mine i pray god we may never meet again and carry actually majestic in her indignation and contempt swept from the room none of the other actors in the drama had spokento them all it had been a surprise and they were all but most of all the invalid boy astounded at this burst of really grand passion on the part of the ordinarily quiet and gentle woman fred bingham seemed to writhe under the girls words his face was ashen pale his natty figure almost trembled in vain he tried to speak the words faded on his lips the room seemed to swim around him as he felt the utter extinction of his plans and schemes when carry had left the room he endeavoured to rally and would have spoken but captain bradshaw interrupted him go fred bingham attempt no excuses we know all even to the fact of your tampering with my servants and sending back franks letter and now let me give you one piece of advice frank and his wife are hereyes back in their proper places frank is at this moment out but he may return at any moment if you value a whole skin i should say go before he does return and one last word and here the old man strode forward if i ever catch you in my house again damme if i dont have you whipped out by the maids without a single word fred bingham staggered out of the room felt his way rather than walked downstairs and mechanically putting his hat upon his head went through the open door which james with mock civility held wide open for him as he was going down the steps however a gentleman walking rapidly turned up them he stopped and with almost a cry of exultation exclaimed fred bingham then he went on with an unnatural coolness which was more deadly than the fiercest outburst of fury would have been so fred we have met again at last the time for wiping out a little of our score has arrived no he said as fred shrank back i will not touch you with my hands had we met in another place i would not have answered for you i will punish you as i would punish a dog james he said grasping his enemy by the collar with a force from which he would have been powerless to escape had he had ten times his natural strength fetch me that ridingwhip which i bought yesterday out of the hall and tell my wife to come here fred bingham had recovered now from the shock he had suffered physically he was not a coward and he faced his powerful opponent with the courage of despair for a moment he made a tremendous effort to escape but frank held him without moving a muscle as if even unconscious of his struggles you shall repent this outrage fred bingham hissed between his teeth frank maynard only smiled he smiled again when the servant brought him out the heavy ridingwhip which he grasped with his right hand then he waited immoveable a light rapid step was heard in the hall and kate stood at the door katie time was when you urged me to do this for your sake i refused now dear my time has come i am going to thrash him to within an inch of his life no frank no let him go he has been punished enough kate and alice had gone again into the drawingroom when they had heard fred bingham go downstairs they had just began to speak when the servant entered please maam you are to go downstairs to mr frank he has got mr bingham and i do think he will kill him for the man had been frightened at franks expression when he took the whip from him all the party rose and made a movement oh katie alice burst out stop kate said very pale stop all of you i will go down alone i know frank none of you could turn him not a hairs breadth now i do not know whether i can i will try no wife frank answered her appeal he has been punished for cheating his uncle he has been punished for carry but he has not been punished for you ii your husband katetake that in my own hands frank had not looked at his wife while he spoke his eyes wide with a savage glare looked down upon his victim and his powerful arm was slowly but steadily raised kate clung to him frank oh frank i forgive him yes katie you forgive him for yourself but i dont forgive him for my wife stand aside katie there was something so menacing so deadly in the cold calmness of his tone that kate shuddered while fred bingham although he had despairingly nerved himself for the ordeal yet felt the blood tingling in every vein oh frank if you love me if you care for me let him go katie for the last time stand aside kate threw her arms closer round him frank husband look at me have i been a good wife to you have i ever once murmured have i tried hard to make your life happy frank since we have been married i never asked you any great favour i ask it now frank for this wretched mannot for his sake but for minefor the sake of your little wife who so loves you oh frank frank and kates eyes closed and had not franks right arm closed round her she would have fallen franks face had softened as she spoke and as the little figure drooped more heavily upon him his fingers unclosed from their vicelike hold of fred bingham then without a word without any apparent knowledge of the man he had released he raised his wife and carried her into the house two days after this captain bradshaw was sitting alone with his grandson when after a pause the invalid said i want you to give me some money grandfathersomething i can do as i like with god bless my soul my boy captain bradshaw said hastily why did you not ask before how much do you want oh i want a great deal grandfather when i die i want to know that carry is provided for she was so kind to me in the old days she would not take money from youshe would not take it from mebut when i am dead if i leave it to her she would i think take it it would make me very happy grandfather yes yes my boy the old man said wiping his eyes hastily i will transfer an amount to your name and then you can do with it what you like i will write up today to my broker to sell out how much shall i say james and to invest it in stock in your name will that do a silent pressure of the hand was the answer i do not think i shall live to be of age grandfather but you will not dispute my will and he smiled contentedly another two days and it is the eve of their leaving torquay they have all gone down to the rocks frank kate and captain bradshaw are engaged in assisting charley to hunt for small crabs alice heathcote and arthur prescott are sitting a little apart of course we shall see a great deal of you in london mr prescott frank and katie are going to stay with uncle till they find a house to suit them i will come as often as i can miss heathcote but i must go back in earnest to work now i have been having a long holiday it has been a pleasant one has it not alice asked shyly very pleasanttoo pleasanti shall have hard work to put it out of my head and to settle down to work again in my chambers i have been thinking mr prescott that now we have settled into our old friendly terms i must go back to my girls habit and drop the mister uncle and frank and katie and every one call you so so in future i shall say prescott alice spoke jestingly but she coloured thank you very much miss heathcotethank you very much but you are mistaken kate calls me arthur alice hesitated this time the colour flooded her whole face and she said in a very low voice but you call her by her christian name i cannot call you arthur unless you call me alice alice did not look up when she spoke she knew what she had said she was offering herself to him she knew he would not ask her a rush of happiness came into prescotts heart was this great prize he had loved and waited for all these years his after all he took her hand alice i have loved you ever since i knew you i loved you with a boys adoration i have loved you with a mans love ever since i have never ventured to hope until latelynever even dreamt that you could return it is this great happiness mine after all oh alice do you really love me a minute afterwards charley ran up to his mamma mammy i want to whisper kate lifted him up mammy uncle arthur is very naughty i saw him kiss aunt alice and quite right too kate said heartily if he had not been a bashful goose hed have done it a fortnight ago its all right charley but dont say anything about it here take your basket and run off to grandpapa hes caught a crab three weeks after this time fred binghams name appeared in the gazette and on the very same day among the announcements of deaths was that of his wife beyond the fact that he went to america nothing was ever heard of him for certainty afterwards although two or three years later at kates request frank made an effort to trace him in order to settle a small annuity upon him he never succeeded in hearing of him with certainty the only clue was that a person answering his description was shot in a cardroom in a low gambling saloon in new york john holl is a happy and a flourishing man he does not exert himself greatly now but prefers sitting by his fireside and smoking his pipe the real management of the business lies in the hands of his son evan who is shortly going to take a wife to himself and kate maynard is on the lookout for another nurse down in a pretty cottage near the new forest live an old gentleman and his daughter a very pretty but very quiet woman whose tender love and care for her father have won her the esteem of all around many offers has she had but she has gently refused them all and it is generally understood that the young widow will never marry again years on perhaps she may but at present every thought and affection are centred in her father frank maynard and his wife live in lowndes square with them resides their uncle who is still alive although now a very old man he thinks a little sadly sometimes of a grave down at torquay within sound of the murmur of the waves where according to his wishes sleeps the cripple boy but generally he is as bright and cheery as ever and spoils kates children and she has four immensely arthur prescott lives in wilton place so that the friends are as intimate as ever and kate on the strength of her superior knowledge upon the subject of children is in great request with alice at wilton place the end

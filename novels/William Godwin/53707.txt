edinburgh and cumming dublin london printed by a r spottiswoode new street square advertisement the publishers of the collection of standard novels are extremely desirous that i should furnish them with a few lines by way of introduction to the appearance of st leon in its present form i am however at a loss how to oblige them in the original preface i frankly stated the sources upon which i had drawn for the idea and conduct of the work i have therefore no remarks to offer but these which follow in i produced the novel of caleb williams i believed myself fortunate in the selection i had made of the ground plot of that work an atrocious crime committed by a man previously of the most exemplary habits the annoyance he suffers from the immeasurable and ever wakeful curiosity of a raw youth who is placed about his person the state of doubt in which the reader might for a time be as to the truth of the charges and the consequences growing out of these causes seemed to me to afford scope for a narrative of no common interest i was not disappointed caleb williams was honoured with the public favour the consequence was that i was solicited to try my hand again in a work of fiction i hesitated long i despaired of finding again a topic so rich of interest and passion in those days it was deemed a most daring thought to attempt to write a novel with the hope that it might hereafter rank among the classics of a language the most successful english writers in that province of literature had scarcely gone beyond three it had not then been conceived that the same author might produce twenty or thirty at the rate of two or three per annum and might still at least retain his hold upon the partiality of his contemporaries to sir walter scott we are indebted for this discovery at length after having passed some years in a state of diffidence and irresolution i ventured on the task it struck me that if i could mix human feelings and passions with incredible situations i might thus attain a sort of novelty that would conciliate the patience at least even of some of the severest judges to this way of thinking st leon was indebted for a local habitation and a name one of my most valued friends mr northcote has often told me that the public may sometimes be interested in the perusal of a book but that they never give themselves any trouble about the author he therefore kindly advised me on no occasion to say any thing in print about myself the present race of readers seem scarcely disposed to verify this maxim they are understood to be desirous to learn something of the peculiarities the life character and behaviour of an author before they consign him to the gulph of oblivion and are willing to learn from his own testimony what train of thoughts induced him to adopt the particular subject and plan of the work upon the perusal of which they are engaged june preface the following passage from a work said to be written by the late dr john campbel and entitled hermippus redivivus suggested the first hint of the present performance there happened in the year an odd accident at venice that made a very great stir then and which i think deserves to be rescued from oblivion the great freedom and ease with which all persons who make a good appearance live in that city is known sufficiently to all who are acquainted with it such will not therefore be surprised that a stranger who went by the name of signor gualdi and who made a considerable figure there was admitted into the best company though nobody knew who or what he was he remained at venice for some months and three things were remarked in his conduct the first was that he had a small collection of fine pictures which he readily showed to any body that desired it the next that he was perfectly versed in all arts and sciences and spoke on every subject with such readiness and sagacity as astonished all who heard him and it was in the third place observed that he never wrote or received any letter never desired any credit or made use of bills of exchange but paid for every thing in ready money and lived decently though not in splendour this gentleman met one day at the coffee house with a venetian nobleman who was an extraordinary good judge of pictures he had heard of signor gualdis collection and in a very polite manner desired to see them to which the other very readily consented after the venetian had viewed signor gualdis collection and expressed his satisfaction by telling him that he had never seen a finer considering the number of pieces of which it consisted he cast his eye by chance over the chamber door where hung a picture of this stranger the venetian looked upon it and then upon him this picture was drawn for you sir says he to signor gualdi to which the other made no answer but by a low bow you look continued the venetian like a man of fifty and yet i know this picture to be of the hand of titian who has been dead one hundred and thirty years how is this possible it is not easy said signor gualdi gravely to know all things that are possible but there is certainly no crime in my being like a picture drawn by titian the venetian easily perceived by his manner of speaking that he had given the stranger offence and therefore took his leave he could not forbear speaking of this in the evening to some of his friends who resolved to satisfy themselves by looking upon the picture the next day in order to have an opportunity of doing so they went to the coffee house about the time that signor gualdi was wont to come thither and not meeting with him one of them who had often conversed with him went to his lodgings to enquire after him where he heard that he had set out an hour before for vienna this affair made a great noise and found a place in all the newspapers of that time it is well known that the philosophers stone the art of transmuting metals into gold and the elixir vit which was to restore youth and make him that possessed it immortal formed a principal object of the studies of the curious for centuries many stories beside this of signor gualdi have been told of persons who were supposed to be in possession of those wonderful secrets in search of which hundreds of unfortunate adventurers wasted their fortunes and their lives it has been said of shakespear that he exhausted worlds and then imagined new but the burthen sustained by shakespear was too heavy for the shoulders of any other individual i leave the first part of the task above mentioned to be divided among those celebrated novelists living and dead who have attempted to delineate the scenes of real life in this little work i have endeavoured to gain footing in one neglected track of the latter province the hearts and the curiosity of readers have been assailed in so many ways that we writers who bring up the rear of our illustrious predecessors must be contented to arrive at novelty in whatever mode we are able the foundation of the following tale is such as it is not to be supposed ever existed but if i have mixed human feelings and passions with incredible situations and thus rendered them impressive and interesting i shall entertain some hope to be pardoned the boldness and irregularity of my design some readers of my graver productions will perhaps in perusing these little volumes accuse me of inconsistency the affections and charities of private life being every where in this publication a topic of the warmest eulogium while in the enquiry concerning political justice they seemed to be treated with no great degree of indulgence and favour in answer to this objection all i think it necessary to say on the present occasion is that for more than four years i have been anxious for opportunity and leisure to modify some of the earlier chapters of that work in conformity to the sentiments inculcated in this not that i see cause to make any change respecting the principle of justice or any thing else fundamental to the system there delivered but that i apprehend domestic and private affections inseparable from the nature of man and from what may be styled the culture of the heart and am fully persuaded that they are not incompatible with a profound and active sense of justice in the mind of him that cherishes them true wisdom will recommend to us individual attachments for with them our minds are more thoroughly maintained in activity and life than they can be under the privation of them and it is better that man should be a living being than a stock or a stone true virtue will sanction this recommendation since it is the object of virtue to produce happiness and since the man who lives in the midst of domestic relations will have many opportunities of conferring pleasure minute in the detail yet not trivial in the amount without interfering with the purposes of general benevolence nay by kindling his sensibility and harmonising his soul they may be expected if he is endowed with a liberal and manly spirit to render him more prompt in the service of strangers and the public nov travels of st leon chapter i there is nothing that human imagination can figure brilliant and enviable that human genius and skill do not aspire to realize in the early ages of antiquity one of the favourite topics of speculation was a perfect system of civil policy and no sooner had plato delineated his imaginary republic than he sought for a spot of earth upon which to execute his plan in my own times and for upwards of a century before them the subject which has chiefly occupied men of intrepid and persevering study has been the great secret of nature the opus magnum in its two grand and inseparable branches the art of multiplying gold and of defying the inroads of infirmity and death it is notorious that uncommon talents and unparalleled industry have been engaged in this mighty task it has i know been disputed by the audacious adversaries of all sober and reasonable evidence whether these talents and industry have in any case attained the object they sought it is not to my purpose to ascertain the number of those whose victory over the powers and inertness of matter has been complete it is enough that i am a living instance of the existence of such men to these two secrets if they are to be considered as two i have been for years in the habit of resorting for my gratification i have in my possession the choice of being as wealthy as i please and the gift of immortal life every thing that i see almost i can without difficulty make my own for what palaces pictures parks or gardens rarities of art or nature have not a price at which their owner will consent to yield them the luxuries of every quarter of the world are emptied at my feet i can command to an extent almost inconceivable the passions of men what heart can withstand the assault of princely magnificence what man is inaccessible to a bribe add to these advantages that i am invulnerable to disease every sun that rises finds the circulations of my frame in the most perfect order decrepitude can never approach me a thousand winters want the power to furrow my countenance with wrinkles or turn my hairs to silver exhaustless wealth and eternal youth are the attributes by which i am distinguished from the rest of mankind i do not sit down now to write a treatise of natural philosophy the condition by which i hold my privileges is that they must never be imparted i sit down purely to relate a few of those extraordinary events that have been produced in the period of my life which is already elapsed by the circumstances and the peculiarity to which i have just alluded it is so obvious as to make it almost improper to specify it that the pursuit in which so many of my contemporaries are engaged and the end of which i have so singularly achieved is in its appearance infinitely more grand and interesting than that which occupied the thoughts of plato and the most eminent writers of antiquity what is political liberty compared with unbounded riches and immortal vigour the immediate application of political liberty is to render a mans patrimony or the fruits of his industry completely his own and to preserve them from the invasion of others but the petty detail of preservation or gradual acquisition can never enter into competition with the great secret which endows a man in a moment with every thing that the human heart can wish considered in this light how mean and contemptible does the ambition of the boasted ancients appear compared with ours what adept or probationer of the present day would be content to resign the study of god and the profounder secrets of nature and to bound his ardour to the investigation of his own miserable existence it may seem perhaps to many that the history of a person possessed of advantages so unparalleled as mine must be like the history of paradise or of the future happiness of the blessed too calm and motionless too much of one invariable texture and exempt from vicissitude to excite the attention or interest the passions of the reader if he will have patience and apply to the perusal of my narrative he will in no long time perceive how far his conjecture is founded in sagacity and reason some persons may be curious to know what motives can have induced a man of such enormous wealth and so every way qualified to revel in delights to take the trouble of penning his memoirs the immortality with which i am endowed seems to put out of the question the common motives that relate to posthumous fame the curiosity here mentioned if it really exists i cannot consent to gratify i will anticipate nothing in the progress of my story my motive for recording it will probably become evident i am descended from one of the most ancient and honourable families of the kingdom of france i was the only child of my father who died while i was an infant my mother was a woman of rather a masculine understanding and full of the prejudices of nobility and magnificence her whole soul was in a manner concentrated in the ambition to render me the worthy successor of the counts de st leon who had figured with distinguished reputation in the wars of the holy land my father had died fighting gallantly in the plains of italy under the standard of louis the twelfth a prince whose name was never repeated to me unaccompanied with the praises due to his military prowess and to the singular humanity of disposition by which he acquired the title of the father of his people my mothers mind was inflamed with the greatness of my ancestors and she indefatigably sought to kindle in my bosom a similar flame it has been a long established custom for the barons and feudal vassals of the kings of france to enter with great personal expense into the brilliant and dazzling expeditions of their sovereigns and my father greatly impaired his fortune in preparations for that very campaign in which he terminated his life my mother industriously applied herself to the restoration of my patrimony and the long period of my minority afforded her scope for that purpose it was impossible for any boy to be treated with more kindness and considerate indulgence than i was during the period of my adolescence my mother loved me to the very utmost limits perhaps of human affection i was her darling and her pride her waking study and her nightly dream yet i was not pampered into corporeal imbecility or suffered to rust in inactivity of mind i was provided with the best masters i was excited and successfully excited zealously to apply myself to the lessons they taught i became intimately acquainted with the italian writers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries i was initiated in the study of the classics to the cultivation of which the revival of letters at this time gave particular ardour i was instructed in the principles of the fine arts there was no species of accomplishment at that time in vogue that my mother was not anxious i should make my own the only science i neglected was the very science which has since given rise to the most extraordinary events of my life but the object to which my attention was principally called was the pursuit of military exercises and the cultivation of every thing that could add to the strength agility or grace of my body and to the adventurousness and enterprise of my mind my mother loved my honour and my fame more than she loved my person a circumstance that tended perhaps more than any other to fix the yet fluctuating character of my youthful mind was my being present as a spectator at the celebrated meeting between francis the first and henry the eighth king of england in a field between ardres and guines my mother refused to accompany me being already arrived at an age in which curiosity and the love of festive scenes are usually diminished and the expenses incurred by all the nobility who attended upon this scene being incompatible with the economy to which she rigidly adhered i was therefore placed under the protection of the marquis de villeroy her brother and with two servants who attended me formed a part of his suite i was at this time fifteen years of age my contemplations had been familiar with ideas of magnificence and grandeur but my life had been spent in the most sequestered retirement this contrast had a particular effect upon my disposition it irritated to a very high degree my passion for splendour and distinction i lived in the fairy fields of visionary greatness and was more than indifferent to the major part of the objects around me i pined for every thing the reverse of my present condition i cultivated the exercises in which i was engaged only as they were calculated to prepare me for future achievements by the incident i have mentioned i was transported at once from a scene of modest obscurity to a scene of the most lavish splendour that the world perhaps ever contemplated i never remembered to have seen even paris itself the prevailing taste of europe has for some time led very much to costliness in dress this taste in its present profusion i believe took its rise in the field of the vale of ardres the two kings were both in the vigour of their youth and were said to be the handsomest men of the age in which they lived the beauty of henry was sturdy and muscular that of francis more refined and elegant without subtracting in any considerable degree from the firmness of his make henry was four years older than his brother monarch the first of them might have been taken as a model to represent a youthful hercules and the last an apollo the splendour of dress that was worn upon this occasion exceeds almost all credibility every person of distinction might be said in a manner to carry an estate upon his shoulders nor was the variety of garments inferior to the richness wolsey a man whose magnificence of disposition was only surpassed by the pride of his soul was for the most part the director of the whole he possessed the most absolute ascendancy over the mind of his master at the same time that francis artfully indulged his caprice that he might claim from him in return a similar indulgence in weightier matters the pomp of processions and the ceremony of opening this memorable festival went first a sort of solemn and half moving pageant which the eye took in at leisure and took in till it was filled this was succeeded by every thing that was rapid animated and interesting masques and exhibitions of all kinds and which was still more to me and which my soul devoured with indescribable ardour joustings tilts and tournaments without end the beauty of the armour the caparisons of the steeds the mettle of the animals themselves and the ardour and grace of the combatants surpassed every thing that my fancy had ever painted these scenes were acted in the midst of a vast amphitheatre of spectators where all that was noble and eminent of either country was assembled the manliness of aspiring youth and the boundless varieties of female attraction all were in their gayest attire every eye was lighted up with complacency and joy if heraclitus or any other morose philosopher who has expatiated on the universal misery of mankind had entered the field of ardres he must have retracted his assertions or fled from the scene with confusion the kings were placed at either end of the lists surrounded with their courtiers every eye through this vast assembly was fixed upon the combatants the body of every one present was inclined this way or that in unconscious sympathy with the redoubted knights from time to time as the favourites of either party prevailed the air was rent with shouts and acclamations what added to the fascination of all that i have yet mentioned was that now for the first time in an equal degree perhaps for centuries the stiffness of unwieldy form was laid aside and the heart of man expanded itself with generosity and confidence it burst the fetters of ages and having burst them it seemed to revel in its new found liberty it is well known that after a few days of idle precaution and specious imprisonment on both sides francis one morning mounted his horse and appeared without guards or any previous notice before the tent of henry the example was contagious and from this time all ceremony was laid aside the kings themselves entered personally into the combats of their subjects it was a delightful and a ravishing spectacle to witness the freedom of the old roman manners almost of the old roman saturnalia polished and refined with all that was graceful and humane in the age of chivalry it may easily be imagined what an effect a scene like this was calculated to produce upon a youth of my age and my education i recollected with anguish that the immaturity of my years precluded me from taking any active part in the spectacle my appearance however was sufficiently advantageous i was presented to francis the first he did me the honour to question me respecting my studies and finding in me some knowledge of those arts and that literature of which he was himself so zealous a favourer he expressed to my uncle a great satisfaction with my figure and acquisitions i might from this time have been taken to court and made one of the pages to this illustrious monarch but the plan of my mother was different she did not wish for the present that my eye should be satiated with public scenes or that the public should grow too familiarly acquainted with my person she rightly judged that my passion for the theatre of glory would grow more impetuous by being withheld for some time from the gratifications for which it panted she wished that i should present myself for the first time among the nobility of france an accomplished cavalier and not suffer the disadvantage of having exposed in the eye of the world those false steps and frailties from which the inexperience of youth is never entirely free these motives being explained to the king he was graciously pleased to sanction them with his approbation i accordingly returned to finish the course of my education at my paternal chteau upon the banks of the garonne the state of my mind during the three succeeding years amply justified the sagacity of my mother i was more eager for improvement than i had ever yet been i had before formed some conceptions of the career of honour from the books i had read and from the conversation of this excellent matron but my reveries were impotent and little compared with what i had now seen like the author of our holy religion i had spent my forty days without food in the wilderness when suddenly my eyes were opened and i was presented with all the kingdoms of the world and all the glory of them the fairy scene continued for a moment and then vanished leaving nothing behind it on all sides but the same barrenness and gloom by which it had been preceded i never shut my eyes without viewing in imagination the combats of knights and the train of ladies i had been regarded with distinction by my sovereign and francis the first stood before my mind the abstract and model of perfection and greatness i congratulated myself upon being born in an age and country so favourable to the acquisition of all that my soul desired i was already eighteen years of age when i experienced the first misfortune that ever befel me it was the death of my mother she felt the approach of her dissolution several weeks before it arrived and held repeated conversations with me respecting the feelings i ought to entertain and the conduct it would become me to pursue when she should be no more my son said she your character and the promise of your early years have constituted my only consolation since the death of your excellent father our marriage was the result of a most sincere and exclusive attachment and never did man more deserve to be loved than reginald de st leon when he died the whole world would have been nothing to me but one vast blank if he had not left behind him the representative of his person and the heir to his virtues while i was busied in your education i seemed to be discharging the last duty to the memory of my husband the occupation was sacred to the honour of the dead even before it became so peculiarly pleasing to me upon its own account as i afterwards found it i hope i have in some measure discharged the task in the manner in which my lord your father would have wished it to have been discharged if he had lived i am thankful to heaven that i have been spared so long for so dear and honourable a purpose you must now my son stand by yourself and be the arbitrator of your own actions i could have wished that this necessity might have been a little further deferred but i trust your education has not been of that sort which is calculated to render a young man helpless and contemptible you have been taught to know your rank in society and to respect yourself you have been instructed in every thing that might most effectually forward you in the career of glory there is not a young cavalier among all the nobility of france more accomplished or that promises to do greater honour to his name and his country i shall not live to witness the performance of this promise but the anticipation even now pours a long stream of sunshine on my departing hour farewell my son you no longer stand in need of my maternal care when i am gone you will be compelled more vividly to feel that singleness and self dependence which are the source of all virtue be careful of yourself be careful that your career may be both spotless and illustrious hold your life as a thing of no account when it enters into competition with your fame a true knight thinks no sacrifice and suffering hard that honour demands be humane gentle generous and intrepid be prompt to follow wherever your duty calls you remember your ancestors knights of the holy cross remember your father follow your king who is the mirror of valour and be ever ready for the service of the distressed may providence be your guardian may heaven shower down a thousand blessings upon your innocence and the gallantry of your soul the death of my mother was a severe blow to my heart for some time all the visions of greatness and renown which had hitherto been my chosen delight appeared distasteful to me i hung over her insensible corpse when it had been committed to the earth i repaired every day to the spot where it was deposited at the hour of dusk when all visible objects faded from the eye when nature assumed her saddest tints and the whole world seemed about to be wrapped in the darkness of the tomb the dew of night drizzled unheeded on my head and i did not turn again towards the turrets of the chteau till the hour of midnight had already sounded through the stillness of the scene time is the healer of almost every grief particularly in the sprightly season of early youth in no long period i changed the oppression of inactive sorrow for the affectionate and pious recollection of my mothers last instructions i had been too deeply imbued with sentiments of glory for it to be possible when the first excess of grief was over that i should remain in indolence the tender remembrance of my mother itself in no long time furnished a new stimulus to my ambition i forgot the melancholy spectacle of the last struggles of her expiring life i even became accustomed no longer to hear her voice no longer to expect her presence when i returned to the chteau from a short excursion her last advice was now all that survived of the author of my existence chapter ii i was in this state of mind when early one morning in the beginning of summer soon after i rose i was startled by the sound of trumpets in the plain near the chteau the bugle at the gate was presently sounded the drawbridge was let down and the marquis de villeroy entered the court yard accompanied by about thirty knights in complete armour i saluted him with respect and the tenderness excited by recent grief he took me by the hand after a short repast in the hall and led me to my closet my son said he it is time to throw off the effeminacy of sorrow and to prove yourself a true soldier of the standard of france i trust my lord replied i with modest earnestness that you well know there is nothing after which my heart so ardently aspires there is nothing that i know worth living for but honour show me the path that leads to it or rather show me the occasion that affords scope for the love of honour to display itself and you shall then see whether i am backward to embrace it i have a passion pent up within me that feeds upon my vitals it disdains speech it burns for something more unambiguous and substantial it is well rejoined my uncle i expected to find you thus your reply to my admonition is worthy of the blood of your ancestors and of the maternal instructions of my sister and were you as dull as the very stones you tread on what i have to tell you might even then rouse you into animation and ardour after this short preface my uncle proceeded to relate a tale every word of which inflamed my spirits and raised all my passions in arms i had heard something imperfectly of the state of my country but my mother carefully kept me in ignorance that my ambition might not be excited too soon and that when excited it might be with the fullest effect while i impatiently longed for an occasion of glory i was far from apprehending what i now found to be true that the occasion which at this period presented itself was such that all the licence of fiction could scarcely have improved it the marquis de villeroy described to me the league now subsisting against france he revived in my memory by terms of the most fervent loyalty the accomplishments and talents of my royal master he spoke with aversion of the phlegmatic and crafty disposition of his imperial rival and with the language of glowing indignation inveighed against the fickleness of the capricious henry he described the train of disasters which had at length induced the king to take the field in person he contrasted with great effect the story of the gallant chevalier bayard the knight without fear and without reproach whose blood was still fresh in the plains of the milanese with that of the constable of bourbon the stain of chivalry whom inglorious resentment and ungoverned ambition had urged to join the enemies of his country in neglect of his loyalty and his oath he stimulated me by the example of the one and the infamy of the other and assured me that there never was an opportunity more favourable for acquiring immortal renown i wanted no prompter in a passion of this sort and immediately set about collecting the whole force of my clients and retainers i shook off the inglorious softness of my melancholy and was all activity and animation the lessons of my youth were now called into play i judged it necessary to invite the assistance of some person of experience to assist me in marshalling my men but i did much of what was to be done myself and i did it well it was my first employment in the morning and the last that was witnessed by the setting sun my excellent mother had left my revenues in the best order and i spared no expense in the gratification of my favourite passion however eager i felt myself to take the field the desire to appear in a manner worthy of a count de st leon restrained me and i did not join the royal army till the imperialists having broken up the siege of marseilles and retreated with precipitation into italy the king had already crossed the alps entered the milanese and gained uncontested possession of the capital from milan francis proceeded to pavia glory was the idol of his heart and he was the more powerfully excited to the attack of that place because it was the strongest and best fortified post in the whole duchy the more he displayed of military prowess the more firmly he believed he should fix himself in his newly acquired dominions the inhabitants would submit to him the more willingly and the enemy be less encouraged to enter into a fresh contention for what he had acquired such at least were the motives that he assigned for his proceedings in reality perhaps he was principally induced by the brilliancy which he conceived would attend on the undertaking it was a few weeks after the opening of the siege that i presented myself to my royal master he received me with those winning and impressive manners by which he was so eminently distinguished he recollected immediately all that had passed at our interview in the vale of ardres and warmly expressed the obligations which france had at various times owed to my ancestors he spoke with earnest respect of the virtues and wisdom of my mother and commended the resolution by which she had in former instances held me back from the public theatre young gentleman said the king i doubt not the gallantry of your spirit i see the impatience of a martial temper written in your face i expect you to act in a manner worthy of your illustrious race and of the instructions of a woman who deserved to be herself a pattern to all the matrons of france fear not that i shall suffer your accomplishments to rust in obscurity i shall employ you i shall assign you the post of danger and of renown fill it nobly and from that hour i shall rank you in the catalogue of my chosen friends the siege of pavia proved indeed to be a transaction in the course of which military honour might well be acquired it was defended by a small but veteran garrison and by one of the ablest captains that europe at that time possessed he interrupted the approaches of the besiegers by frequent and furious sallies in vain by the aid of our excellent artillery did we make wide and repeated breaches in the fortifications no sooner did we attempt to enter by the passage we had opened than we found ourselves encountered by a body composed of the choicest and bravest soldiers of the garrison the governor of the city who though grey headed and advanced in years was profuse of every youthful exertion was ordinarily at the head of this body if we deferred our attack or not having succeeded in it proposed to commence it anew with the dawn of the following day we were sure to find a new wall sprung up in the room of the other as if by enchantment frequently the governor anticipated the success of our batteries and the old fortification was no sooner demolished than we beheld to our astonishment and mortification a new wall which his prudence and skill had erected at a small interval within the line of the former one of these attacks took place on the second day after my arrival at the camp of our sovereign every thing that i saw was new to me and inflamed me with ardour the noise of the cannon which had preceded the attack and which was now hushed the inspiring sounds of martial music which succeeded that noise the standards floating in the air the firm and equal tread of the battalion that advanced the armour of the knights the rugged resolute and intrepid countenances of the infantry all swelled my soul with transport hitherto unexperienced i had beheld the smoke of the artillery in the midst of which every thing was lost and confounded i had waited in awful suspense till the obscurity should be dissipated i saw with pleasure and surprise the ruin of the wall and the wideness of the breach all that had been recorded of the military feats of christian valour seemed then to stand crowded in my busy brain the generosity the condescension the kindness with which the king had addressed me the day before urged me to treble exertion i was in the foremost rank we surmounted the ditch we were resisted by a chosen body of spaniards the contention was obstinate brave men generous and enterprising spirits fell on the one side and the other i seized the cloth of a standard as in the playing of the wind it was brought near to my hand between me and the spaniard that held it there ensued an obstinate struggle i watched my opportunity and with my sword severed the flag from its staff at this moment the trumpets of the king sounded a retreat i had received two severe wounds one in the shoulder and the other in the thigh in the contest i felt myself faint with the loss of blood a french officer of a rude appearance and gigantic stature accosting me with the appellation of boy commanded me to surrender the standard to him i refused and to convince him i was in earnest proceeded to wrap it round my body and fastened it under my arm soon after i became insensible and in this situation was accidentally found by my uncle and his companions who immediately took me and my prize under their care as soon as i was a little recovered of my wounds the king seized an opportunity after having bestowed loud commendations upon my gallantry of conferring the honours of knighthood upon me in the face of the whole army while our tents were pitched under the walls of pavia i was continually extending the circle of my acquaintance among the young gentry of france who like myself had attended their sovereign in this memorable expedition i had some enemies made such by the distinctions i obtained during the siege but they were few the greater part courted me the more the more i showed myself worthy of their attachment envy is not a passion that finds easy root in a frenchmans bosom i was one of the youngest of those who attended on the siege but my brothers in arms were generous rivals who in the field obstinately strove with me for superior glory but over the convivial board forgot their mutual competitions and opened their hearts to benevolence and friendship let us not was a sentiment i heard often repeated forget the object that led us from our pleasant homes to pour from the heights of the alps upon the fields of italy it is to humble the imperious spaniard to punish the disloyal bourbon to vindicate the honour of our beloved and illustrious monarch those walls cover the enemy yonder mountains serve to hide them from our assault let no frenchman mistake him who marches under the same standard for an adversary the trenches had not been opened before pavia till about the beginning of november the winter overtook us and the siege was yet in progress with some apparent advantage indeed to our side of the question but by no means promising an instant conclusion the season set in with unusual severity and both officer and soldier were glad as much as possible to fence out its rigour by the indulgences of the genial board my finances as i have said were at the commencement of the expedition in excellent order i had brought with me a considerable sum and it was not spared upon the present occasion there were however other things to be attended to beside the demands of conviviality the king became impatient of the delays of the siege the garrison and the inhabitants were reduced to great extremities but the governor discovered no symptoms of a purpose to surrender in the mean time intelligence was brought that bourbon was making the most extraordinary exertions in germany and promised to lead to the enemy a reinforcement of twelve thousand men from that country while the imperial generals by mortgaging their revenues and pawning their jewels and still more by their eloquence and influence with those under their command were able to keep together the remains of a disheartened and defeated army in expectation of his arrival there was some danger therefore if the siege were not speedily terminated that the king might ultimately be obliged to raise it with ignominy or to fight the enemy under every disadvantage francis however was not to be deterred from his undertaking he swore a solemn oath that pavia should be his or he would perish in the attempt thus circumstanced he conceived a very extraordinary project pavia is defended on one side by the tesino the scene of the first of the four famous battles by which hannibal signalised his invasion of italy the king believed that if this river could by the labour of his army be diverted from its course the town must instantly fall into his hands he was encouraged to the undertaking by recollecting a stratagem of a similar nature by which cyrus formerly made himself master of the city of babylon it was a thought highly flattering to the grandeur of his soul to imagine that posterity would in this instance institute a parallel between him and cyrus the great the plan for diverting the course of the tesino produced a new and extraordinary scene it was as may well be believed a work of uncommon labour a new channel was to be scooped out and deepened and while the stream was turned into this channel piles were to be sunk and an immense mound of earth created as an effectual impediment to the waters resuming their former course this was a heavy burthen to the soldier in addition to the disadvantage of being encamped during the course of a winter remarkably severe for the climate in which we fought by any other army the task would have been performed with cloudiness and discontent if not complained of with repining and murmurs but here the gaiety of the french character displayed itself the nobility of france who attended their sovereign in great numbers accompanied the infantry in their labour we laid aside the indulgence of the marque of tapestry and carpets we threw off our upper garments and each seized a spade a barrow of earth or a mattock we put our hands to the engines and refused no effort under pretence that it was sordid or severe while the trees were leafless and nature appeared bound up in frost sweat ran down our faces and bedewed our limbs the army were encouraged by our example an employment which under other circumstances would have been regarded as rigid was thus made a source of new hilarity and amusement it was a memorable sight to behold the venerable and grey headed leaders of the french army endeavouring to exert the strength and activity of their early years to me who had but lately arrived at the stature of manhood and who was accustomed to all the exercises which give strength and vigour to the frame this new employment was in no degree burdensome i felt in it the satisfaction that a swift man experiences when he enters the lists of the race i congratulated myself upon the nature of my education if it be a sin to covet honour that guilt was mine and so great was my appetite for it that i was inexpressibly rejoiced to observe the various ways in which it might be gratified strange as it may seem this scene of a winter camp in the midst of blood and sweat surrounded with dangers and called on for unparalleled exertions appears to me through the vista of years that is now interposed between to have been one of the happiest of my life the gay labours and surprises of the day were succeeded by a convivial evening in which we did not the less open our hearts though frequently liable to be interrupted in our midnight revels by the inexhaustible activity and stratagems of the enemy in this various and ever shifting scene i forgot the disasters that occurred and the blood that flowed around me all sense of a large and impartial morality was for the time at least deadened in my breast i was ever upon the alert the diversity of events neither suffered my spirits to flag nor reflection to awake it is only upon such occasions or occasions like these that a man is able fully to feel what life is and to revel in its exuberance above all i was delighted with the society and friendship of my brother officers they honoured me they loved me i seemed to feel what sympathy was and to have conscious pleasure in making one in a race of beings like myself such were my sensations it must not however be imagined that all about me felt in these respects as i did i was deeply indebted in this particular to my youth and my fortune the old endeavoured to brace themselves in vain they sunk under the continual pressure the poor soldier from the ranks laboured incessantly and i laboured as much as he but he had little opportunity to recruit his vigour and renovate his strength there was yet another class of persons in the camp whose gaiety was much less interrupted than mine these were the king and the generals who commanded under him they could not be entirely devoid of thought and consideration they suffered much anxiety from the length of the siege and felt that every period of delay increased the doubtfulness of the event antonio de leyva governor of the city necessarily felt himself alarmed at the extraordinary project in which we were engaged and made every exertion to prevent it one evening the king sent for me to his tent and told me in confidence that the enemy intended that very night to make three several attacks upon our mound one on each side of the stream and one by means of boats in the centre two of these he said were merely intended as feints the west bank of the tesino was the point against which their principal exertions would be directed on that side he was resolved to command in person the boats with which he proposed to resist their flota he confided to one of the most famous and valuable officers of his army the detachment on the east bank he purposed to intrust to my uncle and myself he observed that the detachment he could spare for that purpose after having formed the other two bodies and reserved a sufficient number for the defence of the camp and the works would be small and he warned me to the exertion of a particular vigilance it would be doubly unfortunate if a body the attack upon which was to be merely a feigned one should nevertheless be routed go added he fulfil my expectations deport yourself answerably to the merit of your first achievement and depend upon it that you will prove hereafter one of the most eminent supporters of the martial glory of france the marquis de villeroy divided our little force into two bodies with the larger he lay in wait for the enemy near the scene of the expected attack the smaller he confided to my direction and placed so that we might be able to fall upon the rear of the garrison troops as soon as they should be fully engaged with our comrades in the situation assigned me i took advantage of the skirts of a wood which enabled me to approach very near to the expected route of our assailants without being perceived by them the night was extremely dark yet the vicinity of my position was such that i could count the numbers of the adversary as they passed along before my hiding place i was alarmed to find that they amounted to at least the triple of what we had been taught to expect they were no sooner past than i despatched to the king a young knight my particular friend who happened to be with me to urge the necessity of a reinforcement at the same time i sent a messenger to my uncle by a circuitous route to inform him of what i had observed and the step i had taken and to entreat him to defer the attack as long as consistently with propriety it should be possible the enemy however had no sooner arrived at the place of his destination than the troops of the marquis no longer capable of restraint rushed to engage the spaniards were at first surprised but a short time led them to suspect the weakness of their assailants nor was the assistance i brought to my uncle sufficient to turn the fortune of the fight we lost many of our men the rest apparently gave ground and it was a vain attempt amidst the darkness of the night to endeavour to restore order and rally them to the assault we were already almost completely overpowered when the succours we expected reached us they were however unable to distinguish friend from enemy a storm of mingled rain and snow had come on which benumbed our limbs drove fiercely in our faces and rendered every object alike viewless the carnage which in this situation took place was terrible our blows were struck at random a frenchman was not less dreadful than a spaniard when the battle ceased scarcely one of the enemy was left alive but we observed with astonishment and horror the number of the besiegers who had probably in the midst of the confusion been cut to pieces by their own countrymen i am now arrived at the period which put an end to the festivity and jocundness of the campaign all after this was one continued series of disaster about the close of january our work though not wholly interrupted was considerably retarded by a succession of heavy rains this was injurious to us in many ways our project which was executed in the midst of waters rendered additional damp a matter of serious consideration we were also seized with an apprehension of still greater magnitude which was speedily realised the snows being at length completely dissolved and the quantity of water continually increasing we perceived one afternoon strong symptoms that our mound the principal subject of our labour and source of our hope was giving way in various places the next morning at daybreak it rushed down every where at once with wonderful violence and noise it is difficult to describe the sensation of anguish which was instantly and universally diffused the labour of many weeks was overthrown in a moment as we had proceeded in our work we every day saw ourselves nearer the object to which we aspired at this time our project was almost completed and pavia was in imagination already in our hands to gain possession of which had cost us such unremitted exertions the display of so much gallantry and the loss of so many soldiers we were confounded at the catastrophe we saw we gazed at each other each in want of encouragement and every one unable to afford it still however we were not destitute of advantages the garrison began to be in want both of ammunition and provisions they were in a general state of discontent almost of mutiny which scarcely all the address and authority of the governor were able to suppress if the town continued longer unrelieved it was sure to fall into our hands but even this our last hope was considerably diminished by the intelligence we received the very day after the destruction of our mound that the imperial army after having received large reinforcements was approaching in considerable force the king had some time before in the height of his confidence and elation of his heart sent off a detachment of six thousand men to invade the kingdom of naples for upon that as well as the milanese he had inherited pretensions from his immediate predecessors but though the enemy was superior in numbers and a part perhaps of their forces better disciplined than ours they laboured under several disadvantages to which we were not exposed the emperor though his dominions were more extensive did not derive from them a revenue equal to that of francis as he did not take the field in person the war appeared to his subjects only a common war proceeding upon the ordinary motives of war but my countrymen were led by their sovereign were fresh from the recent insolence of an invasion of their own territory and fought at once for personal glory and their countrys honour the king who commanded them seemed expressly formed to obtain their attachment and affection his nobles became enthusiastic by the example of his enthusiasm and willingly disbursed their revenues to give prosperity and clat to the campaign the first question that arose upon the approach of the enemy was whether we should break up the siege and attend in some strong post the slow but sure effect of their want of money and the consequent dispersion of their troops or wait their attack in our present posture the former advice was safe but to the gallant spirit of francis it appeared ignominious he was upon all occasions the partisan of rapid measures and decisive proceedings and his temper with the exception of a few wary and deliberate counsellors accorded with that of our whole army for some days we congratulated ourselves upon the wisdom of our choice we presented to the enemy so formidable an appearance that notwithstanding the cogent motives he had to proceed he hesitated long before he ventured to attack us at length however the day came that was pregnant with so momentous expectation if through the whole limits of our camp there was not a man that did not feel himself roused upon this glorious occasion to me it was especially interesting the scene accorded with the whole purpose of my education and novelty made it impressive i lived only in the present moment i had not a thought a wish a straggling imagination that wandered beyond the circuit of the day my soul was filled at one minute wild with expectation and at another awed into solemnity there is something indescribably delicious in this concentration of the mind it raises a man above himself and makes him feel a certain nobleness and elevation of character of the possession of which he was to that hour unconscious fear and pain were ideas that could find no harbour in my bosom i regarded this as the most memorable of days and myself as the most fortunate of mortals far indeed was i from anticipating the disgraceful event in which this elation of heart speedily terminated the sun rose bright in a cloudless sky the cold of the season was such as only to give new lightness and elasticity to the muscles and animal spirits i saw few of those objects of nature which in this delightful climate gave so sacred a pleasure to the human soul but in my present temper there was no object of sight so ravishing as the firm and equal steps of the martial bands the impatience of the war horse and the display of military standards nor any music so enchanting as the shrillness of the pipe the clangor of the trumpet the neighing of steeds and the roaring of cannon it is thus that man disguises to himself the real nature of his occupation and clothes that which is of all things the most nefarious or most to be lamented with the semblance of jubilee and festival the imperialists were at first unable to withstand the efforts of french valour they gave way on every side we pursued our advantage with impetuosity to the slaughter of whole ranks mowed down with tremendous celerity to the agonies of the dying i was blind their groans had no effect on my organ for my soul was occupied in another direction my horses heels spurned their mangled limbs and were red with their blood i fought not merely with valour but with fury i animated those around me by my example and my acclamations it may seem contrary to delicacy to speak with this freedom of my own praises but i am at my present writing totally changed and removed from what i was and i write with the freedom of a general historian it is this simplicity and ingenuousness that shall pervade the whole of my narrative the fortune of the day speedily changed the cowardice and desertion of our swiss allies gave the first signal of adversity the gallant commander of the garrison of pavia sallied out in the midst of the fight and suddenly attacked us in the rear a stratagem of the imperial general effected the rout of our cavalry the whole face of the field was utterly reversed it would be in vain for me to attempt to describe even the small part that i beheld of the calamity and slaughter of the french army at this distance of time the recollection of it opens afresh the almost obliterated wounds of my heart i saw my friends cut down and perish on every side those who together with myself had marched out in the morning swelled with exultation and hope now lay weltering in their blood their desires their thoughts their existence were brought to a fatal termination the common soldiers were hewed and cut to pieces by hundreds without note and observation many of the first nobility of france made desperate by the change of the battle rushed into the thickest of the foe and became so many voluntary sacrifices choosing rather to perish than to turn their backs with dishonour in the battle i had two horses killed under me the first of them suffered a sort of gradual destruction he had already received one wound in the nostrils and another in the neck when a third shot carried away two of his feet and laid him prostrate on the earth bernardin my faithful attendant observed what was passing and immediately brought me a fresh charger but i had not long mounted him when he received a wound which killed him on the spot i was myself hurt in several places and at length the stroke of a sabre brought me to the ground here i remained for a long time insensible when i recovered and looked around me i found myself in entire solitude and could at present perceive no trace either of the enemy or of my own people soon however i recollected what had passed and was but too well assured of the defeat my countrymen had sustained weak and battered as i was i attempted to retire to a place of greater security i had scarcely changed my ground before i saw a trooper of the enemy rushing towards me with the intention to take away my life fortunately i observed a tree at hand to the shelter of which i hastened and partly by moving the branches to and fro and partly by shifting my position i baffled my adversary till he became weary of the attempt a moment after i saw one of my most intimate and familiar companions killed before my eyes it was not long however before a party of fugitive french came up to the spot where i stood and i like the rest was hurried from the field my uncle perished in the battle it is wonderful how men can harden their hearts against such scenes as i then witnessed it is wonderful how they can be brought to co operate in such demoniac fury and more than demoniac mischief barbarity and murder but they are brought to it and enter not from a deplorable necessity but as to a festival in which each man is eager to occupy his place and share the amusements it seemed to me at that time as it seems to me now that it should be enough for a man to contemplate such a field as i saw at pavia to induce him to abjure the trade of violence for ever and to commit his sword once more to the bowels of the earth from which it was torn for so nefarious a purpose these sensations though now finally established in my mind were at the time of which i am writing but of fleeting duration the force of education and the first bent of my mind were too strong the horror which overwhelmed me in the first moments of this great national defeat subsided and the military passion returned upon me in its original ardour my convictions and the moral integrity of my soul were temporary and i became myself a monument of that inconstancy and that wonder to which i have just alluded various circumstances however prevented this passion from its direct operation the character of france was altered by the battle of pavia though mine remained the same it was in the fullest degree decisive of the fortune of the war milan and every other place in the duchy opened their gates to the conqueror and in a fortnight not a frenchman was left in the fields of italy of the whole army only a small body effected an orderly retreat under the command of the duke of alenon many persons of the highest distinction perished in the battle many were made prisoners by the enemy france by this event found the list of her noblesse considerably reduced in numbers add to which those whose loss she sustained were almost all of them taken from among the most distinguished and meritorious in the catalogue but what constituted the principal feature in this memorable event was that the king himself was found in the number of the prisoners nor was he released by his ungenerous competitor till after more than a twelvemonths confinement during this period francis tasted of the dregs of adversity inclined in the first instance to judge of his rival by himself he expected a liberal treatment in this he was deeply disappointed after a detention of many months in the milanese the scene of his former successes he was transferred to madrid he was personally neglected by the emperor while his disloyal subject was treated with singular distinction the most rigorous terms were proposed to him all this had the effect in one instance of sinking him into a disease of languor and dejection which he was not expected to survive and in another of inducing him to execute an instrument by which he abdicated the crown and declared his resolution of remaining a prisoner for life his confinement was at length terminated by his solemnly engaging to compulsory articles which he was determined to break as soon as he found himself at liberty an alternative peculiarly grating to the liberality of his spirit this reverse of fortune materially changed his character the fine spirit of his ambition was from this time evaporated and while he still retained the indefeasible qualities of his soul and was gallant kind hearted and generous he bartered as far as was compatible with his disposition the enterprising and audacious temper he had previously manifested for the wary and phlegmatic system of his more fortunate competitor his genius cowered before that of charles and the defeat of pavia may perhaps be considered as having given a deadly wound to the reign of chivalry and a secure foundation to that of craft dissimulation corruption and commerce chapter iii the lists of military ambition then being closed if not permanently at least for a time my mind took a new bias and without dismissing its most cherished and darling passion pursued a path in the present emergency to which the accidents of my youth had also guided me if my mother had survived she would probably either not have consented to my serving at the siege of pavia or at least would have recalled me to the obscurity of my paternal chteau as soon as the campaign was at an end i had not fully completed the twentieth year of my age at the period of the memorable battle in which my sovereign was made prisoner i was left without adviser or guide even the marquis de villeroy my mothers brother of whatever consequence his admonitions to me might have proved was taken from me in this fatal engagement the king himself perhaps had it not been for the dreadful calamities in which he was now involved might have condescended to interest himself in some degree in my welfare by the course of events i was left yet a minor and with an ample revenue at my disposition to be wholly guided by the suggestions of my own mind in the portion of his reign already elapsed the splendid and interesting qualities of francis had given a new spring to the sentiments of the nation he was the most accomplished and amiable prince of the time in which he lived there was but one of all the sovereigns of christendom that could cope with him in power the emperor charles and as charless peculiarities were of a sort that frenchmen were accustomed to regard with aversion and contempt so there had not been a doubt among my compatriots of the side upon which the superiority would ultimately rest by the events of the day of pavia they were confounded and overwhelmed they did not despair of their country they soon felt and felt to its utmost extent the rank which france held among the european states but the chain of their ideas was interrupted they could not but be conscious that the fortune of the kingdom had received a grievous check the illustrious career which they had in fancy already traversed was postponed to a distant period the consequences which flow from a suppressed ambition may easily be imagined the nobility of france exchanged the activity of the field for the indulgences of the table that concentrated spirit which had sought to expand itself upon the widest stage now found vent in the exhibition of individual expense and above all the sordid and inglorious passion for gaming a vice eminently characteristic of the age now especially gained strength and drew multitudes into its destructive vortex it was perhaps impossible for a young man to have entered the theatre of the world under less favourable auspices in what i have already written i felt myself prompted to enlarge with complacency upon the sentiments and scenes of my youth and i have yielded to the suggestion the same internal admonition makes me shrink from entering with minuteness into the detail of my ruin i recollect my infatuation with abhorrence i fly from the memory with sensations inexpressibly painful i regard it as a cloud that overshadowed and blackened for ever the fair prospects of my earlier years i shall not enumerate all my youthful companions or all my youthful follies i committed a mistake obvious enough at this immature period of my existence when i mistook profusion and extravagance for splendour and dignity and the prudent economy which my mother had practised served in the present instance as the pander to my vices the whole tendency of my education had been to inspire me with a proud and restless desire of distinction and i was not content to play a second part in the career of my vices as i should not have been content to play a second part in the genuine theatre of honour and fame in all that was thoughtlessly spirited and gaily profligate i led the way to my compeers and was constantly held up by them as an example by this conduct i incurred the censure of the rigorous and the old but the voice of censure reached me much seldomer than that of adulation my person and demeanour were the topics of general applause i was tall and well proportioned my frame was slender and agile but with an appearance of the fullest health my countenance was open commanding and animated my rank and situation in the world gave me confidence the fire and impetuosity of my temper rendered my gestures easy rapid expressive and graceful the consequence of all this was to confirm me in a plan of life which i early laid down to myself and from which i never in any instance deviated i put aside those rules as splenetic and hypercritical which confessors preach and with which the preceptors of young men are accustomed to weary and alienate the minds of their pupils the charge of being disorderly and unthinking i despised that of imprudence even when meant for blame sounded in my ear like the voice of encomium but accustomed from education to sentiments of honour and from habit to the language of eulogy it is difficult for any man to be more firmly bent than i was to incur no breath of dishonour or to draw the line more peremptorily between the follies of youth and the aberrations of a gross and unprincipled spirit it may be alleged indeed and with considerable justice that the habit of gaming is an exception to this statement it was with hesitation and reluctance that i entered into this habit i saw it as it was and as every ingenuous and undebauched mind must see it base and sordid the possession of some degree of wealth i regarded indeed as indispensable to a man who would fill a lofty and respectable character in the world a character that by uniting the advantages of exterior appearance with the actions of a hero should extort the homage of his species but in the picture i drew of this man in my mind i considered wealth as an accident the attendant on his birth to be dispensed with dignity not to be adverted to with minuteness of attention deep play is certainly sufficiently inconsistent with this character the direct purpose of the gamester is to transfer money from the pocket of his neighbour into his own he rouses his sleepy and wearied attention by the most sordid of all motives the fear of losing pierces his heart with anguish and to gain to obtain an advantage for himself which can scarcely exceed and which seldom equals the injury his competitor suffers is the circumstance which most transports his heart with delight for this he watches for this he calculates an honourable gamester does not seize with premeditation the moment when his adversary is deprived by wine or any other cause of his usual self possession he does not seek with sober malice to play upon his passions he does not enter with avidity into the contest with an unpractised but presuming rival but he cannot avoid rejoicing when he finds that accident has given him an unusual advantage i have often thought that i could better understand how a man of honour could reconcile himself to the accursed and murderous trade of war than to the system of the gaming table in war he fights with a stranger a man with whom he has no habits of kindness and who is fairly apprised that he comes against him with ruinous intent but in play he robs perhaps his brother his friend the partner of his bosom or in every event a man seduced into the snare with all the arts of courtesy and whom he smiles upon even while he stabs i am talking here the mere reason and common sense of the question as it relates to mankind in general but it is with other feelings that i reflect upon the concern i have myself individually in the subject years roll on in vain ages themselves are useless here looking forward as i do to an existence that shall endure till time shall be no more no time can wipe away the remembrance of the bitter anguish that i have endured the consequence of gaming it is torture it is madness poverty i have drained thy cup to the dregs i have seen my wife and my children looking to me in vain for bread which is the most intolerable distress that of the period in which all the comforts of life gradually left me in which i caught at every fragment of promise and every fragment failed in which i rose every morning to pamper myself with empty delusions in which i ate the apples of purgatory fair without but within bitterness and ashes in which i tossed through endless sightless nights upon the couch of disappointment and despair or the period when at length all my hopes were at an end when i fled with horror to a foreign climate when my family that should have been my comfort gave me my most poignant agony when i looked upon them naked destitute and exiles with the tremendous thought what and who it was that had caused their ruin adversity without consolation adversity when its sting is remorse self abhorrence and self contempt hell has no misery by which it can be thrown into shade or exceeded why do i dwell upon or at least why do i anticipate this detested circumstance of my story let me add one remark in this place and pass on to the other particulars of this epoch of my prodigality it is true i must take this shameful appellation to myself i was a gamester but in the beginning i took no concern in that species of science which is often implied in the appellation my games were games of hazard not of skill it appeared to my distempered apprehension to be only a mode in which for a man to display his fortitude and philosophy i was flattered with the practice of gaming because i saw in it when gracefully pursued the magnanimity of the stoic combined with the manners of a man of the world a magnanimity that no success is able to intoxicate and no vicissitude to subvert i committed my property to the hazard of the die and i placed my ambition in laughing alike at the favours of fortune and her frowns in the sequel however i found myself deceived the fickle goddess sufficiently proved that she had the power of making me serious but in her most tremendous reverses i was never influenced to do any thing that the most scrupulous gamester regards as dishonourable i say not this for the purpose of giving colour and speciousness to my tale i say it because i have laid it down to myself in this narrative as a sacred principle to relate the simple unaltered truth another characteristic of the reign of francis the first is its gallantries it is well known how much the king was himself occupied with attachments of this sort his government was rather the government of women than of politicians and the manners of the sovereign strongly tended to fix the habits of his subjects a very young man rather takes the tone of his passions from those about him than forms one that is properly his own and this was my case in the present instance as well as in the preceding originally of an amorous constitution i should perhaps have quieted the restlessness of my appetites without ostentation and clat had not the conduct of my youthful associates in general led me to regard gallantry as an accomplishment indispensably necessary in a young man of rank it must be confessed indeed that this offence against the rigour of discipline has a thousand advantages over that of gaming few women of regular and reputable lives have that ease of manners that flow of fancy and that graceful intrepidity of thinking and expressing themselves that is sometimes to be found among those who have discharged themselves from the tyranny of custom there is something irresistibly captivating in that voluptuousness which while it assumes a certain air of freedom uniformly and with preference conforms itself to the dictates of unsophisticated delicacy a judicious and limited voluptuousness is necessary to the cultivation of the mind to the polishing of the manners to the refining of sentiment and the developement of the understanding and a woman deficient in this respect may be of use for the government of our families but can neither add to the enjoyments nor fix the partiality of a man of animation and taste but whatever there may be in these considerations certain it is that the conduct i pursued in matters of gallantry led me into great and serious expenses the mistresses with whom i chanced to associate had neither the inexpressible captivation of madame de chateaubriant nor the aspiring and impressive manners of the duchess detampes they had however beauty and vivacity frolic without rudeness and softness without timidity they had paid some regard to points of knowledge and taste considering these as additional means for fixing the partiality of their paramours and knowing that they had no security for the permanence of their prosperity but in the variety of their attractions in their society i was led into new trains of reflection a nicer consideration of human passion and the varieties of human character and above all into a greater quickness and delicacy in matters of intellectual taste my hours for the most part rolled swiftly and easily away sometimes in the society of the young the gay and the ambitious of my own sex and sometimes in the softer and more delicious intercourse of the fair i lived in the midst of all that paris could at that time furnish of splendid and luxurious this system of living was calculated to lull me in pleasing dreams and to waste away existence in delirious softness it sufficiently accorded with the sad period of our sovereigns captivity when my young compatriots sought to drown the sense of public and patriotic considerations in copious draughts of pleasure nor did the monarchs return immediately restore to france her former haughtiness and pride the course of sensuality in which i was now engaged though it did not absolutely sink into grossness may well be supposed to have trodden upon the very edge of licence i and my companions were young we were made fearless and presuming by fortune and by rank we had laid aside those more rigorous restraints which render the soberer part of mankind plausible and decent by making them timid and trite i will not contaminate the minds of my innocent and inexperienced readers by entering into the detail of the follies in which i engaged one thing it is necessary to remark as essential to the main thread of my story my expenses of all kinds during this period of self desertion drained my resources but did not tarnish my good name my excesses were regarded by some as ornamental and becoming but by all were admitted as venial the laurels i had won in the field of military honour were not obscured by my subsequent conduct i was universally ranked among the most promising and honourable of the young noblemen of france i had some rivals i did not pass through this turbulent and diversified scene without disputes but no one cast a reflection upon my name no one ventured to speak of me with superciliousness and opprobrium nor was my temper more injured than my reputation from every dispute i extricated myself with grace and propriety i studied the pleasure and ease of all with whom i associated and no man enjoyed more extensively than i did the sweets of friendship as far as the sweets of friendship can be extensively enjoyed chapter iv i had been now two years in habits of life and a mode of expense extremely injurious to my patrimony when a circumstance occurred which promised completely to deliver me from the ruinous consequences of my own folly this was no other than my encounter with that incomparable woman who afterwards became the partner of my life and the mother of my children i cannot even now recollect her without tears the sentiment which her very name excites in my mind is a mingled feeling on the one hand of the most exquisite and unspeakable delight a feeling that elevates and expands and electrifies my throbbing heart and on the other of the bitterest anguish and regret i must develope the source of this feeling marguerite louise isabeau de damville was at the period of our first meeting in the nineteenth year of her age her complexion was of the most perfect transparency her eyes black and sparkling and her eyebrows dark and long such were the perfect smoothness and clearness of her skin that at nineteen she appeared five years younger than she was and she long retained this extreme juvenility of form her step was airy and light as that of a young fawn yet at the same time firm and indicative of strength of body and vigour of mind her voice like the whole of her external appearance was expressive of undesigning i had almost said childish simplicity yet with all this playfulness of appearance her understanding was bold and correct her mind was well furnished with every thing that could add to her accomplishments as a wife or a mother her indulgent parents had procured her every advantage of education and circumstances had been uncommonly favourable to her improvement she was encouraged and assisted in the art of drawing for which she discovered a very early talent by leonardo da vinci and she formed her poetical taste from the conversation and instructions of clement marot but amidst the singular assemblage of her intellectual accomplishments there was nothing by which she was so much distinguished as the uncommon prudence of her judgments and the unalterable amiableness of her manners this was the woman destined to crown my happiness and consummate my misery if i had never known her i should never have tasted true pleasure if i had been guided by her counsels i should not have drained to the very dregs the cup of anguish the house of her father the marquis de damville was the resort of all the most eminent wits and scholars of that period particularly of marot rabelais erasmus and scaliger this was my first inducement to frequent it my education had inspired me with an inextinguishable love of literature and the dissipation in which i was at this time involved could not entirely interrupt the propensity the most thoughtless and extravagant period of my life had occasional intervals of study and reflection and the gay animated and ingenious conversation of the men i have mentioned had always peculiar charms for me i had continued for some time to visit at the marquiss hotel before i encountered the beautiful marguerite the first time i saw her she made a deep impression upon me the marquis who was one of the most benevolent and enlightened of mankind had been led by my character and manners to conceive a warm friendship for me he saw the ruin in which i was heedlessly involving myself and believed that it was not yet too late to save me as he thought that there was no method so likely to effect my reformation as the interposition of domestic affections he was not unwilling to encourage the attachment i began to feel for his daughter on my part i wanted but little encouragement i no sooner observed her manners and became acquainted with her merits than my heart was unalterably fixed i became as it were a new man i was like one who after his eyes had grown imperceptibly dim till at length every object appeared indistinct and of a gloomy general hue has his sight instantaneously restored and beholds the fabric of the universe in its genuine clearness brilliancy and truth i was astonished at my own folly that i could so long have found gratification in pleasures mean and sensual i was ashamed of my own degradation i could not endure the comparison between the showy unsubstantial attractions of the women i had hitherto frequented and the charms of the adorable marguerite the purity of her mind seemed to give a celestial brilliancy and softness to the beauties of her person the gross and brutal pursuits of the debauchee are often indeed described by the same epithets as the virtuous and refined passion with which i was now for the first time inspired but experience convinced me that they differed in their most essential features the marquis saw the state of my mind and addressed me thus count said he i feel the most ardent friendship for you i am inexpressibly concerned for your welfare you will be convinced of this when i have furnished you with a clue to my late conduct towards you i regard you if not as a ruined man at least as a man in the high road to ruin your present habits are of the most dangerous sort they appear to you perfectly conformable to principles of the strictest honour nay they come recommended to you by a certain clat and dignity with which they seem to be surrounded i could say to you recollect yourself be not misled by delusive appearances consider the present state of your fortune and the state in which your mother left it you cannot be ignorant how greatly it is impaired how has this circumstance arisen have your revenues been expended in the service of your country have you purchased any thing by them that will confer on you lasting renown put together the sum of actions which piece by piece you have been willing to regard as indifferent and innocent if not as graceful and becoming you cannot but be struck with their monstrous deformity is it possible that you can be ignorant of the nature of poverty there is such a thing as honourable poverty the poverty of cincinnatus was honourable who impoverished himself by paying the fine which was factiously imposed on his son and then was contented to pass his time alternately between the highest situations and the most rigid simplicity the poverty of a man of genius such as rabelais if not honourable is interesting when we compare his merits and worth with that of many of those persons upon whom fortune has blindly lavished her favours it is honourable if he have declined the means of enriching himself by the sacrifice of his independence and his principles but of all earthly things the most contemptible is the man who having wasted his goods in riotous living yet hungers after the luxuries that have proved his bane and feasts himself upon the steam of dainties of which he has lost the substance poverty always sufficiently disadvantageous in a degenerate age where attention and courtship are doled forth with scales of gold is tremendous to him he is the scorn of all mankind wherever he is a guest he is invited only to be trampled upon and insulted he is capable of nothing and is a burden to society and mankind the helplessness of age advances upon him with stealing steps and he is destined to gather all its miseries and none of its consolations i might have talked to you thus but i refused it i apprehend something of the nature of advice i know that it can seldom be attended with its genuine effect and will never be received with deference and pleasure where its motives are capable of misconstruction if i had talked to you thus i might have appeared to be indulging the tyranny of age i might have seemed to assume an unbecoming air of superiority and command it could not have been clear that i was honestly interested in that about which i affected so much concern i doubt not the ingenuousness of your nature i doubt not that you would have been struck with the picture but i must be permitted to doubt the adequate and lasting effect of my expostulation i was not willing by my forwardness and loquacity to wear out one of the great springs of human improvement i have determined on your reform for that purpose i think it necessary to combine my remonstrances and advice with a change of your habits and situation you have tasted largely of what are commonly called the pleasures of life but there are pleasures that you have not tasted at this moment you anticipate them and anticipate them with the ardour of a lover but you know not yet all the gratifications that attend upon domestic affections i am willing to bestow upon you my daughter i consent to prove the purity of my advice and the sincerity of my regard by committing her happiness to the risk she is a treasure the equal of which perhaps the world does not hold i speak not of her personal attractions but in understanding accomplishments and virtue i firmly believe no woman living can compare with her in possessing her you will be blessed beyond the lot of princes but at the same time that i shall thus put happiness within your grasp remember that i commit to your disposal the happiness of marguerite you are a worthy and an honourable man your talents and your virtues will constitute her felicity her portion will redeem the injury which your patrimony has suffered from your excesses and you will have enough for yourselves and for your mutual offspring i cannot believe that with such a deposit intrusted to you you will consent to bring her to misery and ruin i have one condition however to stipulate with you i require of you as the pledge of her happiness that you break off your present modes of life that you separate yourself from your connections and retire into the country upon your paternal estate you are yet too young to be in danger from that tyranny of custom which often renders men more advanced in life incapable of relishing the simple and genuine pleasures you will find contentment and joy in the society of my daughter and in the bosom of your rising family you will be happy in the circle of your own hearth and have little to ask of the rest of mankind if in any ill omened and inauspicious moment the allurements of your present vices forgive the plainness of my speech should resume their power over you i hope at least that i shall never live to see it that i shall not be taught by bitter experience that i have sacrificed to the disinterestedness of my friendship the happiness of my daughter and of my posterity my heart weeps blood while i record the admonitions of this noble and generous man a nobler france did not contain through all her boundaries refined by literature polished by the best society his age could afford grown grey in the field of honour and particularly distinguished by the personal attachment and confidence of his sovereign what was all this advice to me what return did i make to this unparalleled kindness and friendship i ruined this admirable woman i involved her in poverty and shame with the most savage barbarity i prepared for her an immature grave can i forget this of what avail to me are immortal life and immortal youth oh marguerite marguerite for ever thy image haunts me for ever thy ghost upbraids me how little have i proved myself worthy of such a partner rather what punishment what plagues what shame and detestation have i not deserved praised be heaven the last prayer of the marquis of damville at least was granted he did not live to witness my relapse my profligacy and insanity i resume the thread of my story i listened to the address of the marquis with reverence and admiration i accepted his conditions with joy i married his adorable daughter and conducted her to my paternal estate in the bourdelois now only it was that i tasted of perfect happiness to judge from my own experience in this situation i should say that nature has atoned for all the disasters and miseries she so copiously and incessantly pours upon her sons by this one gift the transcendent enjoyment and nameless delights which wherever the heart is pure and the soul is refined wait on the attachment of two persons of opposite sexes my beloved marguerite guided and directed me at the same time that she was ever studying my gratification i instructed her by my experience while she enlightened me by the rectitude and decision of her taste ours was a sober and dignified happiness and its very sobriety served to give it additional voluptuousness we had each our separate pursuits whether for the cultivation of our minds or the promotion of our mutual interests separation gave us respectability in each others eyes while it prepared us to enter with fresh ardour into society and conversation in company with each other hours passed over us and appeared but minutes it has been said to be a peculiar felicity for any one to be praised by a man who is himself eminently a subject of praise how much happier to be prized and loved by a person worthy of love a man may be prized and valued by his friend but in how different a style of sentiment from the regard and attachment that may reign in the bosom of his mistress or his wife self complacency and self satisfaction may perhaps be numbered among the principal sources of contentment it is necessary for him who would endure existence with patience that he should conceive himself to be something that he should be persuaded he is not a cipher in the muster roll of man how bitter is the anguish we are sometimes doomed to sustain in this respect from the marks we receive of other mens indifference and contempt to feel that we are loved by one whose love we have deserved to be employed in the mutual interchange of the marks of this love habitually to study the happiness of one by whom our happiness is studied in return this is the most desirable as it is the genuine and unadulterated condition of human nature i must have some one to sympathise with i cannot bear to be cut off from all relations i desire to experience a confidence a concord an attachment that cannot rise between common acquaintance in every state we long for some fond bosom on which to rest our weary head some speaking eye with which to exchange the glances of intelligence and affection then the soul warms and expands itself then it shuns the observation of every other beholder then it melts with feelings that are inexpressible but that the heart understands without the aid of words then the eyes swim with rapture then the frame languishes with enjoyment then the soul burns with fire then the two persons thus blest are no longer two distance vanishes one thought animates one mind informs them thus love acts thus it is ripened to perfection never does man feel himself so much alive so truly etherial as when bursting the bonds of diffidence uncertainty and reserve he pours himself entire into the bosom of the woman he adores marguerite de damville was particularly distinguished from every other woman i ever knew by the justness of her taste and the vividness of her feelings this circumstance was a fund of inexhaustible delight and improvement to me we were both of us well acquainted with the most eminent poets and fine writers of modern times but when we came to read them together they presented themselves in a point of view in which they had never been seen by us before it is perhaps more important that poetry and every thing that excites the imagination or appeals to the heart should be read in solitude than in society but the true way to understand our author in these cases is to employ each of these modes in succession the terrible the majestic the voluptuous and the melting are all of them in a considerable degree affairs of sympathy and we never judge of them so infallibly or with so much satisfaction as when in the presence of each other the emotion is kindled in either bosom at the same instant the eye beams pregnant with sentiment and meaning involuntarily meet and mingle the voice of the reader becomes modulated by the ideas of his author and that of the hearer by an accidental interjection of momentary comment or applause confesses its accord it was in this manner that we read together the admirable sonnets of petrarch and passed in review the sublime effusions of dante the letters of eloisa to abelard afforded us singular delight we searched into the effusions of the troubadours and among all their absurdities and inequality we found a wildness a daring pouring forth of the soul an unpruned richness of imagination and from time to time a grandeur of conception and audacious eccentricity of thought that filled us with unlooked for transport at other times when not regularly engaged in this species of reading we would repeat passages to each other communicate the discoveries of this sort that either had made in solitude and point out unobserved beauties that perhaps neither of us would have remarked but for the suggestions of the other it is impossible for two persons to be constituted so much alike but that one of them should have a more genuine and instantaneous relish for one sort of excellence and another for another thus we added to each others stores and acquired a largeness of conception and liberality of judgment that neither of us would have arrived at if separate it is difficult to imagine how prolific this kind of amusement proved of true happiness we were mutually delighted to remark the accord of our feelings and still more so as we perceived that accord to be hourly increasing and what struck either as a blemish in the other wearing out and disappearing we were also led by the same means to advert to the powers of mind existing in each the rectitude of judgment and delicacy of feeling as our attachment hourly increased we rejoiced in this reciprocation of benefits while each gave or received something that added to value of mind and worth of character mutual esteem was incessantly kept alive and mutual esteem is the only substantial basis of love each of us hourly blessed our common lot while each believed it impracticable elsewhere to have found so much worth blended with so much sweetness but we did not confine ourselves to the library and fireside we walked we rode we travelled together we observed together the beauties of nature and the system of the universe we traversed many provinces of france and some parts of italy and spain we examined the characters of mankind as they are modified by the varieties of natural descent or the diversities of political government in all this we found peculiar gratification there is something in the scent and impression of a balmy atmosphere in the lustre of sunshine in the azure heaven and the purple clouds in the opening of prospects on this side and on that in the contemplation of verdure and fertility and industry and simplicity and cheerfulness in all their variations in the very act and exercise of travelling peculiarly congenial to the human frame it expands the heart it makes the spirit dance and exquisitely disposes us for social enjoyment the mind becomes more elevated and refined it assumes a microscopical and unwonted sensibility it feels things which in ordinary moments are unheeded and unknown it enjoys things too evanescent for a name and too minute to be arrested it trembles with pleasure through every fibre and every articulation one thing is necessary to be mentioned in this place though while it adds to the fidelity of delineation i am aware it breaks the tone of feeling and the harmony of the picture but it is not my intention in this history to pass myself for better than i am i have laid down to myself the sacred maxim of absolute truth and impartiality i must confess therefore with whatever anguish my extreme inferiority to my incomparable partner she had all the simplicity of genuine taste the more she delivered herself up to nature the greater was her content all superfluous appendages and show appeared to her as so many obstacles to enjoyment she derived her happiness from the tone of her own mind and stood in no need of the gaping admiration and stupid wonder of others to make her feel herself happy but i retained the original vice of my mind the gestures of worship and the voice of applause were necessary to me i did not suffice to myself i was not satisfied with the tranquil and inglorious fruition of genuine pleasures forgetting the vain and anxious tumult of the world and forgotten by those who figured on its theatre it may be that marguerite could and ought by insensible degrees to have rooted out this disease of my mind but i am concerned only with the statement of facts and i know that no such thing was the effect of our intercourse this absurd passion did not however at this time lead me to any fatal extremities it contented itself with the frivolous gratification resulting from a certain portion of ostentation and expense i maintained a considerable train of servants my apartments were magnificent and my furniture splendid when we travelled it was with an attendance little short of princely idiot that i was to regard this as an addition to the genuine pleasures which i have above enumerated when we were at home every accidental guest was received and entertained with extraordinary pomp a pomp not directed to add to his accommodation but that was designed to leave him impressed with astonishment and admiration at the spirit of his host often indeed did i feel this ostentation an encumbrance often did i languish for the ease and freedom which result from a mediocrity of circumstances but this i called doing honour to my ancestors and my country and vindicating the consideration due to the house of st leon to quit this painful recollection a circumstance which tended at this time to fill the measure of my happiness consisted in the dear pledges which marguerite bore me of our mutual affection it is impossible for him who has not experienced it to conceive the accumulation which a genuine tenderness derives from this source the difficulties are many that attend upon pregnancy trifles are at that period sources of fatigue and injury it is necessary that the person should be protected and the mind tranquil we love to watch over a delicate plant that appears to call for all our anxiety and attention there is in this case the sentiment without the repulsive circumstances that attends upon our sympathy with a dangerous and alarming disease marguerite by her sensibility and growing attachment abundantly rewarded my cares at length the critical period arrives when an event so extraordinary occurs as cannot fail to put the human frame in considerable jeopardy never shall i forget the interview between us immediately subsequent to her first parturition the effusion of soul with which we met each other after all danger seemed to have subsided the kindness which animated us increased as it was by ideas of peril and suffering the sacred sensation with which the mother presented her infant to her husband or the complacency with which we read in each others eyes a common sentiment of melting tenderness and inviolable attachment this she seemed to say is the joint result of our common affection it partakes equally of both and is the shrine in which our sympathies and our life have been poured together never to be separated let other lovers testify their engagements by presents and tokens we record and stamp our attachment in this precious creature a creature of that species which is more admirable than any thing else the world has to boast a creature susceptible of pleasure and pain of affection and love of sentiment and fancy of wisdom and virtue this creature will daily stand in need of an aid we shall delight to afford will require our meditations and exertions to forward its improvement and confirm its merits and its worth we shall each blend our exertions for that purpose and our union confirmed by this common object of our labour and affection will every day become more sacred and indissoluble all this the present weakness of my beloved marguerite would not allow her to say but all this occurred to my reflections and when we had time tranquilly to compare our recollection of the event it plainly appeared that in all this our hearts and conceptions had most truly sympathised the possessing a third object a common centre of anxiety to both is far from weakening the regard of such a couple for each other it does not separate or divert them it is a new link of connection each is attached to it the more for the sake of either each regards it as a sort of branch or scion representing the parent each rejoices in its health its good humour its smiles its increase in size in strength and in faculties principally from the idea of the gratification they will communicate to the other were it not for this idea were it possible the pleasure should not be mutual the sentiment would be stripped of its principal elevation and refinement it would be comparatively cold selfish solitary and inane in the first ten years of our marriage my wife brought me five children two sons and three daughters the second son only died in his infancy my predominant passion at this time was that of domestic pleasures and employments and i devoted myself jointly with the mother to the cultivation of the minds of my children they all in a considerable degree rewarded our care they were all amiable taught by the example of their parents they lived in uncommon harmony and affection charles the eldest was a lad of a bold and active disposition but the sentiments of virtue and honour that were infused into him both by marguerite and myself found a favourable reception and promised to render those qualities which if left to themselves might have been turbulent and dangerous productive of the happiest consequences julia his eldest sister was uncommonly mild and affectionate alive to the slightest variations of treatment profoundly depressed by every mark of unkindness but exquisitely sensible to demonstrations of sympathy and attachment she appeared little formed to struggle with the difficulties of life and the frowns of the world but in periods of quietness and tranquillity nothing could exceed the sweetness of her character and the fascination of her manners her chief attachment was to her mother though she was by no means capable of her mothers active beneficence and heroic fortitude louisa the second daughter resembled her mother in person and promised to resemble her in character marguerite the youngest differed from the whole family in the playfulness and frolic of her disposition her vivacity was inexhaustible and was continually displaying itself in innocent tricks and smart unexpected sallies nothing could possibly be more ingenuous than this admirable infant nothing more kind considerate and enthusiastic in her tenderness and grief when an occasion occurred to call forth these sentiments but the moment the sorrowful occasion was over she would resume all her vivacity and even sometimes in the midst of her tears some trait of her native humour would escape i know not whether all the family were not more attached to the little marguerite than to any other individual member as she certainly oftenest contributed to their amusement and pleasure such was the amiable circle one and all of whom have been involved by me in the most tremendous ruin and disgrace chapter v charles was now nine years of age his mother and myself had delighted ourselves with observing and forwarding the opening of his infant mind and had hitherto been contented with the assistance of a neighbouring priest by way of preceptor but as he was our only son we were desirous that he should obtain every advantage of education we were neither of us illiterate but in the course of twenty three years which had elapsed since i was myself of charless age the progress of literature and the literary passion in europe had been astonishingly great and i was anxious that he should realise in his own person every benefit which the fortunate and illustrious period of human affairs in which he began to exist seemed to hold out to him beside there was an impetuosity and forwardness in his character that seemed ill to brook the profound solitude and retirement in which his mother and i were contented to live his case demanded companions of his own age a little world of fellow beings with whom he might engage in their petty business and cares with whose passions his own might jostle or might sympathise who might kindle his emulation and open to him the field of fraternal associations and amity there was however a considerable difficulty attendant on this question the schools of real literature in france where languages were properly taught and science might be acquired were at this time exceedingly few the nearest university was that of toulouse at the distance of twenty six leagues this was practically speaking as far from us as paris itself was then our darling child to be torn from his parents from all he was accustomed to see and all by whom he was loved to be planted in the midst of strangers to have his mind excited to observation and the spirit of generous contention roused at the risk of suppressing the tender affections of his soul and the sentiments of duty reliance and love there seemed however to be no alternative it was necessary that a temporary separation should take place intellectual improvement was a point by all means to be pursued and we must direct our efforts to keep alive along with it those winning qualities and that softness of heart which had hitherto rendered charles so eminently our delight such were our fond speculations and projects for the future it was at length determined that i should proceed along with him to paris i could there observe upon the spot the state of the university and the means of learning that existed in the metropolis and could consult with some of those eminent luminaries with whom i had become acquainted at the house of the marquis de damville marguerite declined accompanying me upon this occasion her father was dead she could not think of quitting her daughters for any considerable time and our nuptial engagement of residing always in the country gave her a repugnance to the removing with her whole family to paris it was left probable that she might come to me when the business was settled if at that time it was determined to leave her son at the capital and that she might then reconduct me to the place which had been the scene of all my happiness but which i was destined never to revisit in peace preliminaries being at length fully adjusted in the manner that appeared suitable to the importance of the occasion i set off for the metropolis of my country which i had seen only once and that for a very short period in the course of ten years that visit had been produced by a very melancholy circumstance the death of the marquis de damville marguerite and myself had then been summoned and arrived at his hotel but a few days before he expired though extremely weakened by the mortal disease under which he laboured he retained all the faculties of his mind and conversed with us in the most affectionate and endearing terms he congratulated us upon our mutual felicity nor could the situation in which we found him upon the brink of an everlasting oblivion of all earthly things abate the sincerity and fervour of his delight he thanked me for my carriage and conduct as a husband which he said might with propriety be held up as a model to the human species he applauded himself for that mingled discernment and determination which as he affirmed had so opportunely secured my virtue and his daughters happiness he trusted that i was now sufficiently weaned from those habits which had formerly given him so much alarm at the same time he conjured me by every motive that an overflowing enthusiasm could suggest to persist in my good resolutions and never to change that residence where i had found every degree of delight of which the human mind is in its present condition susceptible do not said he be drawn aside by ambition do not be dazzled by the glitter of idle pomp and decoration do not enter the remotest circle of the vortex of dissipation live in the midst of your family cultivate domestic affection be the solace and joy of your wife watch for the present and future welfare of your children and be assured that you will then be found no contemptible or unbeneficial member of the community at large such were the last advices of the marquis de damville excellent man how ill were your lessons remembered how ill your kindness remunerated he died in the sixth year of our marriage the serious impression which this event produced in my mind gave me small inclination to enter into any species of society and disposed me to quit paris as soon as every respect had been paid to the obsequies of the deceased upon my arrival in the metropolis on the present occasion i immediately sought to renew my acquaintance with those amiable and eminent persons who had for the most part constituted the circle of the marquis de damville they received me with that interest and attention that i have usually found attendant on a cultivated mind the pleasure was considerable that resulted from meeting them thus again after ten years cessation of intercourse a few of them indeed were dead and others dispersed by various accidents in different parts of france or of europe the greater part however i still found in that celebrated city which might well be considered as the metropolis of the civilised world the king had early been distinguished by his love of letters and the arts and added years while they abated in his mind the eagerness of ambition and glory gave new strength to his more cultivated propensities the liberality of his conduct and the polished ease that characterised his manners produced a general predilection in favour of the capital in which he resided i found all my former friends matured and improved by the silent influence of time their knowledge was increased their views rendered wider their conversation was more amusing and instructive their manners more bland and unaffected but if their characters had experienced revolution mine was more materially changed i had before encountered them with all the heat and presumption of youth with no views so much present to my mind as those of chivalry and a factitious honour with no experience but that of a camp i was impetuous volatile and dissipated i had not rested long enough upon any one of the flowers of intellect to extract its honey and my mind was kept in a state of preternatural agitation by the passions of a gamester it was now become cool moderate and tranquil the society of marguerite had contributed much to the improvement of my character i had lived in no idle and brutish solitude but in the midst of contemplation and letters and i had the passions of a husband and a father in the extremest degree attached to his family these passions will be found perhaps to be the true school of humanity the man whose situation continually exercises in him the softest and most amiable charities of our nature will almost infallibly surpass his brethren in kindness to sympathise with and promptness to relieve the distresses of others will it be accounted strange that in paris surrounded by persons of various knowledge and liberal benevolence i found myself under the influence of other feelings than any i had lately experienced i was like a man who had suffered long calamity in a famished vessel or a town besieged and is immediately after introduced into the midst of luxury to a table loaded with the most costly dainties every viand has to his apprehension an exquisite relish and every wine a delicious flavour that he never perceived in them before let no one infer that my love for marguerite was diminished it has already sufficiently appeared in the course of my narrative that no happiness could be more consummate than mine was with this admirable woman had i been called upon to choose for the seat of my future life between my paternal chteau in the bordelois with marguerite to grace my abode on the one hand and all the gratifications that paris could afford on the other i should not have hesitated even for an instant but the mind of man is made capacious of various pleasures and a person of sound and uncorrupted judgment will perhaps always enjoy with emotion the delights which for a long time before he had not encountered however enviable his content may have been under their absence i delighted to converse with the men of genius and refinement with whom paris at this time abounded it was a feast of soul of which i had rarely partaken in my rural retreat i delighted to combine excellence with number and to a considerable degree at least variety of intercourse with sentiments of regard and friendship in these select societies i found no cold suppressions and reserve their members were brethren in disposition similar in their pursuits and congenial in their sentiments when any one spoke it was that the person to whom he addressed himself might apprehend what was passing in his thoughts they participated with sincerity and a liberal mind in each others feelings whether of gay delight or melancholy disappointment thus situated i forgot for a time my engagements with marguerite the scenes of st leon its fields its walks its woods and its streams faded from my mind i forgot the pleasure with which i had viewed my children sporting on the green and the delicious rural suppers which i had so often partaken with my wife beneath my vines and my fig trees at the period of the setting sun when i set out for paris these images had dwelt upon my mind and saddened my fancy at every stage i felt myself removed still further from the scene where my treasures and my affections were deposited but shortly after new scenes and new employments engaged my thoughts the pleasures which i sought but weakly at first every time they were tasted increased my partiality for them i seemed for a time to be under the influence of an oblivion of my former life thus circumstanced the folly which had so deep a root in my character took hold of me i hired a magnificent hotel and entertained at my own expense those persons in whose society i principally delighted my circles became more numerous than those of the marquis de damville and were conducted in a very different style of splendour and profusion i corresponded with marguerite but i continually found some new pretext for lengthening my stay and she on her part though the kindest and most indulgent of women became seriously alarmed and unhappy as my parties were more numerous than those of the marquis de damville had been they were more mixed among others i occasionally associated with some of those noblemen who had been the companions of my former dissipation and gaming an obvious consequence resulted from this parties of play were occasionally proposed to me i resisted i yielded my first compliances were timid hesitating and painful i recollected the lessons and exhortations of my excellent father in law at length however my alarms abated i reproached myself with the want of an honourable confidence in my own firmness and the cowardice of supposing that i was not to be trusted with the direction of my conduct one evening i ventured beyond the cautious limits i had at first prescribed myself and won a considerable sum this incident produced a strong impression upon me and filled my mind with tumult and agitation there was a secret that i had concealed almost from myself but which now recurred to me with tenfold violence i was living beyond the means i had to discharge my expenses my propensity of this sort seemed to be fatal and irresistible my marriage with marguerite had occurred opportunely to heal the breaches i had at that time made in my fortune and to take from me the consciousness of embarrassments which i should otherwise have deeply felt the death of the marquis however deplorable in other respects happened at a period when the spirit of profusion and magnificence which characterised me had again involved my affairs in considerable difficulty it might be supposed that these two cases of experience would have sufficed to extirpate my folly but they had rather the contrary effect in each of them the event was such as to prevent extravagance and thoughtlessness from producing their genuine results and of consequence they appeared less criminal and mischievous in my eyes than otherwise they probably would have appeared i rather increased than diminished my establishment upon the death of my father in law i had no reasonable prospect of any property hereafter to descend to me that should exonerate me from the consequences of further prodigality but i did not advert to this i saw myself surrounded by my children they were the delight and solace of my life and yet i was needless of their interests sometimes i resolved upon a more rigid economy but economy is a principle that does not easily lay hold of any but a heart framed to receive it it is a business of attentive and vigilant detail it easily escapes the mind amidst the impetuosity of the passions the obstinacy of rooted propensities and the seduction of long established habits marguerite indeed did not share with me in these follies the simplicity and ingenuousness of her mind were such that she would have been as happy in a cottage as a palace but though she did not partake my vices an ill judged forbearance and tenderness for my feelings did not permit her effectually to counteract them this is perhaps the only defect of character i am able to impute to her after i had won the sum to which i have alluded i retired to my hotel full of anxious thoughts it produced upon me in some degree the same effect as ordinarily belongs to a great calamity i lay all night sleepless and disturbed ruin and despair presented themselves to my mind in a thousand forms heedless prodigality and dilapidated revenues passed in review before me i counted the years of my life i had completed the thirty second year of my age this was scarcely half the probable duration of human existence how was i to support the remaining period a period little assorted to difficulties and expedients and which in the close of it seems imperiously to call for every indulgence hitherto an interval of four or five years had repeatedly sufficed to involve me in serious embarrassment my children were growing up around me my family was likely to become still larger as my offspring increased in years their demands upon my revenues would be more considerable were these demands to be slighted were my daughters nay was the heir of my rank and my name to be committed to the compassion of the world unprovided and forlorn what a cheerless prospect what a gloomy and disconsolate hue did these ideas spread upon that future which the health of the human mind requires to have gilded with the beams of hope and expectation i had already tried the expedient of economy and i had uniformly found this inestimable and only sheet anchor of prudence gliding from my deluded grasp could i promise myself better success in future there seemed to be something in my habits whether of inattention ostentation or inconsistency that baffled the strongest motives by which parsimony and frugality can be enforced why did these thoughts importunately recur to me in the present moment they were the suggestions of a malignant genius thoughts the destination of which was to lead me into a gulf of misery and guilt while i was going on in a regular train of expense while i was scooping the mine that was to swallow me and my hopes together i had the art to keep these reflections at bay now that i had met with an unexpected piece of good fortune they rushed upon me with irresistible violence unfortunate coincidence miserable rather let me say guilty abandoned miscreant as soon as i rose in the morning i went to the closet where the evening before i had deposited my recent acquisitions i spread out the gold before me i gazed upon it with intentness my eyes a moment after rolled in vacancy i traversed the apartment with impatient steps all the demon seemed to make his descent upon my soul this was the first time that i had ever felt the struggle of conscious guilt and dishonour i was far indeed from anticipating that species of guilt and that species of ruin which soon after overwhelmed me my mind did not once recur to the possibility of any serious mischief i dwelt only as gamesters perhaps usually do upon the alternative between acquisition and no acquisition i did not take into the account the ungovernableness of my own passions i assumed it as unquestionable that i could stop when i pleased the thoughts that tortured me were in the first place those of a sanguine and unexperienced adventurer in a lottery whose mind rests not for a moment upon the sum he has risked but who having in fancy the principal prize already in his possession and having distributed it to various objects and purposes sometimes fearfully recurs to the possibility of his disappointment and anticipates with terror what will be his situation if deprived of this imaginary wealth i had now for the first time opened my eyes to the real state of my affairs and i clung with proportionable vehemence to this plank which was to bear me from the storm in the second place i felt though darkly and unwillingly the immorality of my conception to game may in some instances not be in diametrical opposition to liberality of mind but he who games for the express purpose of improving his circumstances must be an idiot if he does not sometimes recollect that the money lost may be as serious a mischief to his neighbour as the money gained can possibly be a benefit to himself it is past a question that he who thus turns his amusement into his business loses the dignity of a man of honour and puts himself upon a level with the most avaricious and usurious merchant though i was far from having digested a specific plan of enriching myself by these discreditable means yet the very tumult of my thoughts operated strongly to lead me once more to the gaming table i was in no humour to busy myself with my own thoughts the calmness of literary discussion and the polished interchange of wit which had lately so much delighted me had now no attraction for my heart the turbulence of a scene of high play alone had power to distract my attention from the storm within i won a second time i felt the rapidity and intenseness of my contemplations still further accelerated i will not over again detail what they were suffice it to say that my hopes became more ardent my conception of the necessity of this resource more impressive and my alarm lest this last expedient should fail me more tormenting the next time i lost half as much as the sum of my winnings i then proceeded for several days in a nearly regular alternation of gain and loss this as soon as the fact unavoidably forced itself upon my mind only served to render my thoughts more desperate no exclaimed i it was not for this that i entered upon so tormenting a pursuit it is not for this that i have deserted the learned societies which were lately my delight and committed myself to a sea of disquiet and anxiety i came not here like a boy for amusement or like one who has been bred in the lap of ignorance and wealth to seek a relief from the burden of existence and to find a stimulus to animate my torpid spirits am i then to be for ever baffled am i to cultivate a tract of land which is to present me nothing in return but unvaried barenness am i continually to wind up my passions and new string my attention in vain am i a mere instrument to be played upon by endless hopes and fears and tormenting wishes am i to be the sport of events the fool of promise always agitated with near approaching good yet always deluded this frame of mind led me on insensibly to the most extravagant adventures it threw me in the first place into the hands of notorious gamblers men of real property shrunk from the stakes i proposed as though they were in some degree infected with the venom of gaming their infection was not so deep as mine nor with my desperation of thought the players with whom i engaged were for the most part well known to every one but myself not to be able to pay the sums they played for if they lost nay this fact might be said in some sense to be known to me as well as the rest though i obstinately steeled myself against the recollection of it one evening i won of one of these persons a very large sum for which i suffered him to play with me upon honour the consequence was simple the next morning he took his departure from paris and i heard of him no more before this however the tide of success had set strongly against me i had sustained some serious vicissitudes and while i was playing with the wretch i have just mentioned my eagerness increased as my good luck began and i flattered myself that i should now avenge myself of fortune for some of her late unkindnesses my anguish why should i call the thing by a disproportionate and trivial appellation my agony was by so much the greater when i found that this person the very individual who had already stripped me of considerable sums had disappeared and left me without the smallest benefit from my imaginary winnings no man who has not felt can possibly image to himself the tortures of a gamester of a gamester like me who played for the improvement of his fortune who played with the recollection of a wife and children dearer to him than the blood that bubbled through the arteries of his heart who might be said like the savages of ancient germany to make these relations the stake for which he threw who saw all my own happiness and all theirs through the long vista of life depending on the turn of a card hell is but the chimera of priests to bubble idiots and cowards what have they invented to come into competition with what i felt their alternate interchange of flames and ice is but a feeble image of the eternal varieties of hope and fear all bodily racks and torments are nothing compared with certain states of the human mind the gamester would be the most pitiable if he were not the most despicable creature that exists arrange ten bits of painted paper in a certain order and he is ready to go wild with the extravagance of his joy he is only restrained by some remains of shame from dancing about the room and displaying the vileness of his spirit by every sort of freak and absurdity at another time when his hopes have been gradually worked up into a paroxysm an unexpected turn arrives and he is made the most miserable of men never shall i cease to recollect the sensation i have repeatedly felt in the instantaneous sinking of the spirits the conscious fire that spread over my visage the anger in my eye the burning dryness of my throat the sentiment that in a moment was ready to overwhelm with curses the cards the stake my own existence and all mankind how every malignant and insufferable passion seemed to rush upon my soul what nights of dreadful solitude and despair did i repeatedly pass during the progress of my ruin it was the night of the soul my mind was wrapped in a gloom that could not be pierced my heart was oppressed with a weight that no power human or divine was equal to remove my eyelids seemed to press downward with an invincible burden my eyeballs were ready to start and crack their sockets i lay motionless the victim of ineffable horror the whole endless night seemed to be filled with one vast appalling immovable idea it was a stupor more insupportable and tremendous than the utmost whirl of pain or the fiercest agony of exquisite perception one day that my mind was in a state of excessive anguish and remorse i had already contrived by this infernal means to dispossess myself of the half of my property my son came unexpectedly into my chamber for some time i had scarcely ever seen him such is a gamester all the night while he slept i was engaged in these haunts of demons all the day while he was awake and studying with his masters or amusing himself i was in my bed chamber endeavouring to court a few broken hours of sleep when notwithstanding the opposition of our habits i had the opportunity of seeing him i rather shunned to use than sought to embrace it the sight of him had a savour of bitterness in it that more than balanced all the solace of natural affection it brought before me the image of his mother and his sisters it presented to my soul a frightful tale of deserted duties it was more galling and envenomed than the sting of scorpions starting at the sound of the opening door i called out abruptly and with some harshness who is there what do you want it is i sir replied the boy it is charles come to pay his duty to you i do not want you now you should not come but when you know i am at leisure answered i somewhat disturbed very well sir very well i am going as he spoke his voice seemed suffocated with tears he was on the point of shutting the door and leaving me to myself charles said i not well knowing what it was i intended to do he returned come here my dear boy i took his hand i drew him between my knees i hid my face in his neck i shook with the violence of my emotion go go boy you perceive i cannot talk to you i pushed him gently from me papa cried he i do not like to leave you i know i am but a boy and can be but of little use to you if mamma were with you i would not be troublesome i should cry when i saw you were grieved but i would ask no questions and would leave you because you desired it i hope you have not had any bad news no my boy no come to me to morrow and i will be at leisure and will talk a great deal to you ah papa to morrow every day that i did not see you i thought it would be to morrow and there was one to morrow and another to morrow and so many that it seemed as if you had forgotten to speak to me at all why charles you do not doubt my word i tell you that to morrow you shall see me as long as you please well well i will wait but do then let it be all day i will not go to college and it shall be a holiday papa i do not like my lessons half so well as i did since i have neither you nor mamma that i can tell what they are about good bye charles be a good boy remember to morrow good bye papa now i am sure you look a good deal better than you did at first let me tell you something about the lesson i read this morning it was a story of zaleucus the locrian who put out one of his own eyes that he might preserve eye sight to his son this artless story thus innocently introduced cut me to the soul i started in my chair and hid my face upon the table papa what is the matter indeed you frighten me zaleucus was a father what then am i yes zaleucus was very good indeed but do you know his son was very naughty it was his disobedience and wickedness that made him liable to such a punishment i would not for the world be like zaleucuss son i hope papa you will never suffer from my wilfulness you shall not papa indeed indeed i caught the boy in my arms no you are very good you are too good i cannot bear it well papa i wish i were able to show you that i love you as well as ever zaleucus loved his son i was melted with the ingenuousness of the boys expression i quitted him i paced up and down the room suddenly as if by paroxysm of insanity i seized my child by the arm i seated myself i drew him towards me i put my eye upon him boy how dare you talk to me of zaleucus do you mean to insinuate a reproach do i not discharge a fathers duty if i do not know urchin i will not be insulted by my child the boy was astonished he burst into tears and was silent i was moved by his evident distress no child you have no father i am afraid you have not you do not know my baseness you do not know that i am the deadliest foe you have in the world dear papa do not talk thus do not i know that you are the best of men do not i love you and mamma better than every body else put together well charles cried i endeavouring to compose myself we will talk no more now did not i tell you you should not come to me but when you knew it was a proper time i hope you will never have reason to hate me i never will hate you papa do to me what you will he saw i wished to be alone and left me chapter vi in the evening of the same day my beloved marguerite arrived unexpectedly at paris in the beginning of our separation i had been to the last degree punctual in my letters i had no pleasure so great as retiring to my closet and pouring out my soul to the most adorable of women by degrees i relaxed in punctuality ordinary occupations however closely pursued have a method in them that easily combines with regularity in points of an incidental nature but gaming when pursued with avidity subverts all order and forces every avocation from the place assigned it when my insane project of supplying the inadequateness of my fortune by this expedient began to produce an effect exactly opposite i could not but with the extremest difficulty string my mind to write to the mistress of my soul i endeavoured not to think with distinctness and attention of the persons whose happiness was most nearly involved with mine i said to myself yet another venture must be tried fortune shall change the animosity with which she has lately pursued me i will repair the breaches that have been sustained and i shall then return with tenfold avidity to subjects that at present i dare not fix my mind upon my letters were accordingly short unfrequent and unsatisfactory and those of marguerite discovered increasing anguish perturbation and anxiety what a change in the minds of both had the lapse of a few months produced not that my attachment had suffered the diminution of a single particle but that attachment which had lately been the source of our mutual felicity was now fraught only with distress my mind was filled with horrors and marguerite expected from me an encouragement and consolation in absence which alas i had it not in my power to give i had now continued in paris for a time vastly greater than i had originally proposed after having remained more than ten days without receiving one word of intelligence a letter of mine was delivered to marguerite more short mysterious and distressing to her feelings than any that had preceded the ten days silence from me who at first had never missed an opportunity of pouring out my soul to her and contributing to her pleasure was exquisitely painful there is scarcely any thing that produces such a sickness of the heart as the repeated prorogation of hope but when the letter arrived that had been so anxiously looked for when the hand writing of the superscription was recognised when the letter was treasured up for the impatiently desired moment of solitude that the sacred emotions of the heart might suffer no interruption and when it at last appeared so cold so ominous so withering to the buds of affection the determination of marguerite was speedily formed the relations that bound us together were of too mighty a value to be dispensed or to be trifled with she felt them as the very cords of existence for ten years she had known no solace that was disconnected from my idea no care but of our own happiness and that of our offspring benevolent she was almost beyond human example and interested for the welfare of all she knew but these were brief and mutable concerns they were not incorporated with the stamina of her existence i was the whole world to her she had no idea of satisfaction without me her firmness had been sufficiently tried by the interposal of separation and absence how was she to interpret the obscurity that had now arisen had i forgotten my family and my wife had i been corrupted and debauched by that paris the effects of which upon my character her father had so deeply apprehended had i in contempt of every thing sacred entered into some new attachment had the attractions of some new beauty in the metropolis made me indifferent to the virtue of my children and the life of their mother perhaps the length of our attachment had infected me with satiety and the inconstancy of my temper had been roused by the charms of novelty perhaps the certainty of her kindness and regard had no longer allurements for me and i might be excited to the pursuit of another by the pleasures of hope combined with uncertainty and of a coyness that seemed to promise compliance hereafter even while it pronounced a present denial these were the images that haunted her mind they engendered all the wildness and all the torments of a delirious paroxysm she resolved that no time should be sacrificed to needless uncertainty and that no effort of hers should be unexerted to prevent the mischief she feared it was evening when she arrived i was upon the point of repairing to that scene of nightly resort the source of all my guilt and all my miseries i enquired of my sons valet where he was and how he had been in the course of the day he was gone to bed he had appeared unusually sad sometimes in tears and while he was undressing had sighed deeply two or three times while i was collecting this account in my own apartment the gates of the hotel opened and a number of horsemen entered the court yard i was somewhat surprised because though i was accustomed to see much company few of my acquaintance visited me at so late an hour except on the evenings appropriated to receive them i crossed the saloon to enquire one of the servants exclaimed it is bernardins voice it must be my mistress that is come nothing could be further from my mind than the thought of her arrival i flew through the passage i was on the spot the moment that the servant prepared to conduct his mistress from the litter i received marguerite in my arms and led her into the house if i had expected her arrival i should infallibly have met her at this moment with anxiety and confusion i should have gone round the circle of my thoughts and should not have had confidence to encounter the beam of her eye but the event was so unexpected as to drive all other ideas from my mind and in consequence i enjoyed several minutes ages rather let me say of the sincerest transport i kissed the mistress of my soul with ecstasy i gazed upon her well known lineaments and features i listened to the pleasing melody of her voice i was intoxicated with delight upon occasions like this it seems as if every former joy that had marked the various periods of intercourse distilled its very spirit and essence to compose a draught ten times more delicious and refined than had ever before been tasted our meeting was like awaking from the dead it was the emancipation of the weary captive who exchanges the dungeons gloom for the lustre of the morning and who feels a celestial exhilaration of heart the very memory of which had been insensibly wearing away from his treacherous brain all my senses partook of the rapture marguerite seemed to shed ambrosial odours round her her touch was thrilling her lips were nectar her figure was that of a descended deity her pleasure was not less than mine it is indeed absurd it may be termed profanation to talk of solitary pleasure no sensation ordinarily distinguished by that epithet can endure the test of a moments inspection when compared with a social enjoyment it is then only that a man is truly pleased when pulse replies to pulse when the eyes discourse eloquently to each other when in responsive tones and words the soul is communicated altogether we are conscious of a sober a chaste and dignified intoxication an elevation of spirit that does not bereave the mind of itself and that endures long enough for us to analyse and savour the causes of our joy for some time we rested on a sofa each filled and occupied with the observation of the other my eyes assured marguerite of the constancy of my affection my kisses were those of chaste undivided entire attachment our words were insignificant and idle the broken and incoherent phrases of a happiness that could not be silent at length marguerite exclaimed it is enough my fears are vanished i have no questions to ask no doubts to remove yet why my reginald did you suffer those doubts to gather those fears to accumulate surely you knew the singleness of my affection how many painful days and hours might you have saved me almost by a word forgive me my love replied i waste not the golden hour of meeting in recrimination feeling as your angelic goodness now makes me feel i wonder at myself that i could for one moment have consented to separation that i could have thought any thing but this existence or that having experienced the joys that you have bestowed i could lose all image of the past and dwelling in a desert imagine it paradise recrimination rejoined marguerite no my love you make me too happy to leave room for any thing but gratitude and affection forgive me reginald if i pretend that in meeting you thus i find myself your superior in happiness and love you only awake from lethargy forgetfulness of yourself and of me but i awake from anguish a separation that i desired not at first and of which i hourly wished to see an end from doubts that would intrude and refused to be expelled from the incessant contemplation and regret of a felicity once possessed but possessed no longer melancholy ideas gloomy prognostics overspread my sleepless nights and bedewed my pillow with tears this it is that at last has driven me from my family and daughters resolved to obtain the certainty of despair or the dispersion of my fears have i known all this and think you that i do not enjoy with rapture this blissful moment while we were thus conversing charles entered the room he was not yet asleep when his mother arrived he heard her voice and hastened to put on his clothes that he might rush into her arms the pleasure marguerite had conceived from our meeting and the affectionate serenity that had taken possession of her soul infused double ardour into the embraces she bestowed on her son he gazed earnestly in her face he kissed her with fervency but was silent why charles said she what is the matter with you are not you glad to see me that i am mamma so glad that i do not know what to do with myself i was afraid i never should have been glad again pooh boy what do you mean you were not mother sick were you yes indeed i was sick sick at heart not that i am a coward i think that i could have been satisfied to have been without either my father or you for a little while but papa is so altered you cannot think he never smiles and looks happy and when i see him instead of making me joyful as it used to do it makes me sad dear reginald replied the mother looking at me is it possible that while my heart was haunted with fear and suspicions separation alone should have had such an effect on you i dare say it was that interposed the boy i could not make papa smile all i could do but now you are come he will soon be well how much he must love you mamma the artless prattle of my son struck anguish to my soul and awakened a whole train of tormenting thoughts alas thought i can it indeed be love that thus contrives against the peace of its object would to god my child that my thoughts were as simple and pure as thy innocent bosom and yet added the boy as if recollecting himself if he could not see you sure that was no reason for him to avoid me he seemed as much afraid of me as i have seen some of my play fellows of a snake indeed mamma it was a sad thing that when i wanted him to kiss me and press me to his bosom he shrunk away from me there now it was just so as he looks now that papa used to frown upon me i cannot tell how often now is not that ugly mamma i could no longer govern the tumult of my thoughts peace urchin cried i why did you come to mar the transport of our meeting just now marguerite i forgot myself and was happy now all the villain rises in my soul my wife was so astonished at the perturbation of my manner and at the words i uttered that she was scarcely able to articulate reginald in broken accents she exclaimed my love my husband no matter said i it shall yet be well my heart assures me it shall be not disturbed my love i will never cause you a moments anguish i would sooner die a thousand deaths forget the odious thoughts that poor charles has excited in me so unseasonably they were mere idle words depend upon it they were while i was speaking marguerite hid her face upon the sofa i took her hand and by my caresses endeavoured to soothe and compose her at length turning to me reginald said she in a voice of anguish do you then endeavour to hide from me the real state of your thoughts was the joy that attended our meeting perishable and deceitful after ten years of unbounded affection and confidence am i denied to be the partner of your bosom no marguerite no this was but the thought of a moment by to morrows dawn it shall have no existence in my bosom why should i torment you with what so soon shall have no existence to myself meanwhile be assured my love instead of suffering diminution is more full more fervent and entire than it ever was at this instant my mind experienced an extraordinary impression instead of being weaned by the presence of this admirable woman from my passion for gaming it became stronger than ever if charles had not entered at the critical moment he did i should have remained with marguerite and amidst the so long untasted solace of love have at least for this night forgotten my cares but that occurrence had overturned every thing had uncovered the wounds of my bosom and awakened conceptions that refused to be laid to sleep again the arms of my wife that were about to embrace me suddenly became to me a nest of scorpions i could as soon have rested and enjoyed myself upon the top of vesuvius when it flamed new as i was to this species of anguish tranquilly and full of virtuous contentment as i had hitherto passed the years of my married state the pangs of a guilty conscience i was wholly unable to bear i rose from my seat and was upon the point of quitting the room marguerite perceived by my manner that there was something extraordinary passing in my mind where are you going reginald said she i answered with a slight nod not far i replied attempting an air of apathy and unconcern she was not satisfied you are not going out she enquired i returned to where i had been sitting my love i was going out at the moment of your arrival it is necessary i assure you i hope i shall soon be back i am sorry i am obliged to leave you compose yourself you are in want of rest and had better go to bed stop reginald afford me a minutes leisure before you depart leave us charles good night my dear boy kiss me remember that your mother is now in the same house with you and sleep in peace the boy quitted the room reginald said the mother i have no wish to control your desires or be a spy upon your actions but your conduct seems so extraordinary in this instance as to dispense me from the observation of common rules i have always been a complying wife i have never set myself in contradiction to your will i appeal to yourself for the truth of this i despise however those delicacies an adherence to which would entail upon us the sacrifice of all that is most valuable in human life can i shut my ears upon the mysterious expressions which charless complaints have extorted from you can i be insensible to the extraordinary purpose you declare of leaving me when i have yet been scarcely half an hour under the roof with you before charles came in you seem to have entertained no such design my love replied i how seriously you comment upon the most insignificant incident is it extraordinary that your unexpected arrival should at first have made me forget an engagement that i now recollect st leon answered my wife before you indulge in surprise at my earnestness recollect the circumstances that immediately preceded it through successive weeks i have waited for some satisfactory and agreeable intelligence from you i had a right before this to have expected your return uncertainty and a thousand fearful apprehensions have at length driven me from my home and brought me to paris i am come here for satisfaction to my doubts and peace to my anxious heart wonder not therefore if you find something more earnest and determined in my proceedings now than upon ordinary occasions give me i conjure you give me ease and relief if you are able if not at least allow me this consolation to know the worst be pacified marguerite i rejoined i am grieved heaven knows how deeply grieved to have occasioned you a moments pain but since you lay so much stress upon this circumstance depend upon it i will postpone the business i was going about and stay with you this concession voluntary and sincere produced an effect that i had not foreseen marguerite gazed for a moment in my face and then threw herself upon my neck forgive me my beloved husband she cried you indeed make me ashamed of myself i feel myself inexcusable i feel that i have been brooding over imaginary evils and creating the misery that corroded my heart how inexpressibly you rise my superior but i will conquer my weakness i insist upon your going to the engagement you have made and will henceforth place the most entire confidence in your prudence and honour every word of this speech was a dagger to my heart what were my feelings while this admirable woman was taking shame to herself for her suspicions and pouring out her soul in commendation of my integrity i looked inward and found every thing there the reverse of her apprehension a scene of desolation and remorse i embraced her in silence my heart panted upon her bosom and seemed bursting with a secret that it was death to reveal i ought in return for her generosity to have given up my feigned engagement and devoted this night at least to console and pacify her but i could not and i dared not the wound of my bosom was opened and would not be closed the more i loved her for her confidence the less i could endure myself in her presence to play the hypocrite for so many hours to assume a face of tranquillity and joy while all within was tumult and horror was a task too mighty for human powers to execute i accepted of marguerites permission and left her even in the short interval before i quitted the house my carriage was near to betraying me i could perceive her watchful of my countenance as if again suspicious that some fatal secret lurked in my mind she said nothing further upon the subject however and i presently escaped the inquisition of her eye it is scarcely necessary to describe the state of my mind as i passed along the streets it is sufficient to say that every thing i had felt before from the passion of gaming was trivial to the sensations that now occupied me now first it stood confessed before me a demon that poisoned all my joys that changed the transport of a meeting with the adored of my soul into anguish that drove me forth from her yet untasted charms a solitary wanderer on the face of the earth my busy soul drew forth at length the picture of what this encounter would have been if it had been sanctified with the stamp of conscious innocence at one moment i felt myself the most accursed of mankind i believed that he who could find as i did barrenness and blasting in the choicest of heavens blessings must be miserable beyond precedent or hope shortly after however i reviewed again the image of my poison and found in it the promise of a cure the more desperate my case appeared to me with the greater insanity of expectation did i assure myself that this one night should retrieve all my misfortunes in giving to it this destination indeed i should afflict the gentle bosom of my wife but too probably with some hours of uneasiness but the event would richly repay her for so transitory a suffering i would then open my whole mind to her i would practise no more reserves i should no longer be driven to the refuge of a vile hypocrisy i would bid farewell to the frowns and the caresses of fortune i would require of her no further kindnesses if i were incapable myself of a rigid economy i would commit implicitly to marguerite the disposal of my income whom i knew to be every way qualified for the office with these reflections i nerved my mind to the most decisive adventures why should i enter into a long detail of the incidents of this crisis soon though not immediately i began to lose considerable sums i brought with me in the first instance a penetrating eye a collected mind an intellect prepared for unintermitted exertion misfortune subverted all this my eye grew wild my soul tempestuous my thoughts incoherent and distracted i was incapable of any thing judicious but i was determined to persevere i played till morning nor could the light of morning induce me to desist the setting sun of that day beheld me a beggar there is a degree of misery which as it admits of no description so does it leave no distinct traces in the memory it seems as if the weakness of the human mind alike incapacitated it to support the delirium of joy and the extremity of sorrow of what immediately succeeded the period to which i have conducted my narrative i have no recollection but a horror beyond all names of horror wild inexplicable unintelligible let no one however imagine that the temporary desertion of the soul is any alleviation of its misery the mind that sinks under its suffering does not by that conduct shake off its burden rather ten thousand times rather would i endure all the calamities that have ever yet received a name the sensations and history of which are capable of being delineated than sustain that which has no words by which to express itself and the conception of which must be trusted solely to the faculties and sympathy of the reader where is the cold and inapprehensive spirit that talks of madness as a refuge from sorrow oh dull and unconceiving beyond all belief i cannot speak of every species of madness but i also have been mad this i know that there is a vacancy of soul where all appears buried in stupidity and scarcely deserves the name of thought that is more intolerable than the bitterest reflections this i know that there is an incoherence in which the mind seems to wander without rudder and pilot that laughs to scorn the superstitious fictions of designing priests oh how many sleepless days and weeks did i endure the thoughts frantic the tongue raving while we can still adhere if i may so express myself to the method of misery there is a sort of nameless complacency that lurks under all that we can endure we are still conscious that we are men we wonder at and admire our powers of being miserable but when the masts and tackle of the intellectual vessel are all swept away then is the true sadness we have no consciousness to sustain us no sentiment of dignity no secret admiration of what we are still clinging to our hearts all this i venture to affirm with the full recollection of what i suffered when restored to my senses present to my mind when the account was closed and the loss of my last stake had finished the scene i rose and quitting the fatal spot where these transactions had passed entered the street with a heart oppressed and a bursting head my eyes glared but i saw nothing and could think of nothing it was already nearly dark and the day which had been tempestuous was succeeded by a heavy and settled rain i wandered for some time not knowing whither i went my pace which had at first been slow gradually increased and i traversed the whole city with a hurried and impatient step the streets which had contained few persons at first gradually lost those few i was almost alone i saw occasionally ragged and houseless misery shrinking under the cover of a miserable shed i saw the midnight robber watching for his prey and ready to start upon the unwary passenger from me he fled there was something in my air that impelled even desperate violation to shrink from the encounter i continued this incessant unmeaning exertion for hours at length by an accidental glance of the eye i found myself at the gate of my own hotel heedless of what i did i entered and as nature was now completely exhausted within me sunk down in a sort of insensibility at the foot of the grand staircase this stupor after a considerable interval gradually subsided i opened my eyes and saw various figures flitting about me but i seemed to myself equally incapable of collecting my thoughts and of speech my understanding indeed shortly became clearer but an insuperable reluctance to voluntary exertion hung upon me i explained myself only in monosyllables a sort of instinctive terror of disclosing what had passed to the admirable woman i had sacrificed maintained in me this perpetual reserve for several days together i sat from morning till night in one immovable posture nor was any thing of force enough to awaken me to exertion chapter vii it was not long before the unhappy partner of my fortunes was informed of what had passed the wretches who had stripped me of my all soon made their appearance to claim what was no longer mine what would have been their reception if i had sufficiently possessed myself to parley with them on the subject i am unable to determine i could not have preserved the wreck of my property from their grasp but at the expense of an indelible stain upon my honour yet my desperation would probably have led me to a conduct equally extravagant and useless in the condition in which i was the whole direction of the business devolved upon marguerite and never did human creature demean herself with greater magnanimity and propriety she saw at once that she could not resist their claims but at the expense of my reputation for herself she valued not riches and had no dread of poverty and thus circumstanced she had the courage herself to bring to me the papers they offered the object of which i scarcely understood and to cause me to annex that signature which was to strip her and her children of all earthly fortune her purpose was as soon as this business was over to cause us to quit france and retire into some scene of virtuous obscurity but she would not leave behind her for the last descendants of the counts de st leon any avoidable disgrace her mode of reasoning upon the subject was extremely simple obscurity she regarded as no misfortune and eminent situation where it fairly presented itself as a responsibility it would be base to shrink from ignominy alone she considered as the proper theme of abhorrence for the fickleness and inconstancy of fortune it is impossible to answer by one of those reverses in which she appears to delight she might yet restore us to the lustre of our former condition but if the name of st leon was henceforth to disappear from the annals of france she was desirous at least as far as depended on her that it should expire like the far famed bird of arabia in the midst of perfumes when the whole situation of marguerite is taken into consideration the reader like myself will stand astonished at the fortitude of her conduct she had come to paris unable any longer to tranquillise the agitation of her mind and exhausted with fears suspicions and alarms when she arrived she experienced indeed one delusive moment of transport and joy but that was soon over it was succeeded by reflections and conjectures respecting the mysteriousness of my behaviour it was succeeded by my unexpected departure and the hourly expectation of my return after the lapse of a night and a day i returned indeed but in what a condition drenched with rain trembling with inanition speechless and alone scarcely had she received notice of my arrival and come forward to meet me than she saw me fall motionless and insensible at her feet she watched my recovery and hung with indescribable expectation over my couch she was only called away by the wretches who came to advance their accursed claims and to visit her with the intelligence of our ruin as with a thunderbolt already enfeebled and alarmed by all the preceding circumstances they spoke with no consideration to her weakness they stooped to no qualifications and palliatives but disclosed the whole in the most abrupt and shocking manner any other woman would have sunk under this accumulation of ill marguerite only borrowed vigour from her situation and rose in proportion to the pressure of the calamity she took her resolution at once and answered them in the most firm and decisive language the period of inactivity and stupor that at first seized me was succeeded by a period of frenzy it was in this condition that marguerite conducted me and my children to an obscure retreat in the canton of soleure in the republic of switzerland cheapness was the first object for the most miserable pittance was all she had saved from the wreck of our fortune she had not chosen for beauty of situation or magnificence of prospects the shock her mind had sustained was not so great as to destroy her activity and fortitude but it left her little leisure for the wantonness of studied indulgence the scene was remote and somewhat sterile she conceived that when i recovered my senses an event which she did not cease to promise herself solitude would be most grateful at least to the first stage of my returning reason hither then it was that she led me our son and three daughters immediately upon our arrival she purchased a small and obscure but neat cottage and attired herself and her children in habits similar to those of the neighbouring peasants my paternal estates as well as those which had fallen to me by marriage had all been swallowed up in the gulf which my accursed conduct had prepared marguerite made a general sale of our moveables our ornaments and even our clothes a few books guided by the attachment to literature which had always attended me were all that she saved from the wreck a considerable part of the sum thus produced was appropriated by my creditors marguerite had the prudence and skill to satisfy them all and was contented to retain that only which remained when their demands were discharged this was the last dictate of her pride and the high born integrity of her nature at the time that she thus departed a voluntary exile from her native country two servants accompanied us in our flight whose attachment was so great that even if their attendance had not been necessary it would have been found somewhat difficult to shake them off marguerite however was governed by the strictest principles of economy and whatever the struggle might have been with the importunity of humble affection in dismissing these last remains of our profuse and luxurious household she would have thought herself obliged to proceed even to this extreme if judicious parsimony had demanded it from her but it did not our youngest daughter was at this time only twelve months old and it would have been scarcely possible for the mother however resolute in her exertions to have discharged the cares due to such a family at a time when the father of it was suffering under so heavy an affliction one female servant she retained to assist her in these offices she could not dispense herself from a very assiduous attention to me she could never otherwise have been satisfied that every thing was done that ought to be done that every tenderness was exercised that might be demanded by my humiliating situation or that sufficient sagacity and skill were employed in watching and encouraging the gleams of returning reason the violence of my paroxysms however was frequently such as to render a manual force greater than hers necessary to prevent me from effecting some desperate mischief bernardin a trusty servant nearly of my own age and who had attended upon my person almost from infancy was retained by marguerite for this purpose i was greatly indebted for the recovery which speedily followed to the affectionate anxiety and enlightened care of this incomparable woman it is inconceivable to those who have never been led to a practical examination of the subject how much may be effected in this respect by an attachment ever on the watch and an understanding judicious to combine where hired attendance would sleep and the coarseness of a blunt insensibility would irritate nay perhaps mortally injure it is scarcely possible to imagine a wife more interesting and admirable than marguerite appeared upon the present occasion fallen from the highest rank to the lowest poverty she did not allow herself a mean and pitiful regret no reverse could be more complete and abrupt but she did not sink under it she proved in the most convincing manner that her elevation was not the offspring of wealth or rank but was properly her own she gave a grace even a lustre to poverty which it can only receive from the emanations of a cultivated mind her children were reconciled and encouraged by her example and soon forgot those indulgences which had not yet had time to emasculate their spirits the deplorable situation to which the father of the family was reduced was far from inducing her to cease from her efforts in the bitterness of despair she determined for the present to be both a father and a mother to her children she looked forward with confidence to my speedy recovery though i was the author of her calamities she did not permit this consideration to subtract from the purity of her affection or the tenderness of her anxiety she resolved that no word or look of hers should ever reproach me with my misconduct she had been accustomed to desire rank and affluence and indulgence for her children that her son might run the career of glory which his forefathers ran and that her daughters might unite their fates with what was most illustrious and honourable in their native country but if she were disappointed in this she determined as far as it should be in her power to give them virtue and cheerfulness and content a mind that should find resources within itself and call forth regard and esteem from the rest of mankind my recovery was fitful and precarious sometimes appearing to be rapidly on the advance and at others to threaten a total relapse among the expedients that marguerite employed to re excite the slumbering spark of reason was that of paternal affection ever on the watch for a favourable opportunity she sometimes brought to me her own little namesake who though only twelve months old did not fail to discover unequivocal marks of that playfulness and gaiety which made so considerable a part of her constitutional character her innocent smiles her frolic and careless laughter produced a responsive vibration that reached to my inmost heart they were not unfrequently powerful enough to check the career of my fury or to raise me from the lowest pitch of despondence julia wept for me and louisa endeavoured to copy the offices of kindness she was accustomed to see her mother perform charles who conceived more fully than the rest the nature of my indisposition was upon all occasions solicitous to be admitted into my presence and attended me for the most part with speechless anxiety while his watchful glistening eye uttered volumes without the assistance of words his mother at length yielded to his importunity and he became established the regular assistant of bernardin in the care of my person the restlessness and impetuosity he had hitherto manifested seemed upon this occasion entirely to subside hour after hour he willingly continued shut up in my chamber eager for every opportunity of usefulness and gratified with that complaisance with which the human mind never fails to be impressed when it regards its actions as beneficent or approves its temper as compassionate the restoration of my health was greatly retarded by the melancholy impressions which necessarily offered themselves to my mind when recollection resumed her seat it was fortunate for me that this sort of retrospection appears not to be the first thing that occurs after a paroxysm of insanity when the tide of incoherent ideas subsides the soul is left in a state of exhaustion and seems by a sort of instinct to shun the influx of tumultuous emotions and to dwell upon such feelings as are mild tranquil and restorative once however when i was nearly recovered the thought of what i had been and the recollection of what i was violently suggesting themselves to my mind brought on a relapse attended with more alarming and discouraging symptoms than my original alienation at that moment marguerite was for the first time irresistibly struck with the conception that mine was an incurable lunacy and as she afterwards assured me at no period down to that instant had she felt herself so truly inconsolable but even a sentiment of the last despair was incapable of superseding the active beneficence of marguerite her assiduities so far as related to this fatal calamity were at length crowned with success her gloomy prognostics were not realised and the distemper of my understanding quitted me for ever wretched however as i have already remarked beyond all common notions of wretchedness were my thoughts when my soul returned to its proper bias and i fully surveyed the nature of my present situation marguerite who by her sagacity and patience had recovered me from a state of the most dreadful disease now exerted herself to effect the more arduous task of reconciling me to myself she assured me that she forgave me from her inmost heart nay that she was thankful to providence which in the midst of what the world calls great calamities had preserved to her what she most valued my affection entire she contrasted what had been the subject of her apprehensions before she came to paris with what had proved to be the state of the case afterwards she averred that the worst that had happened was trivial and tolerable compared with the image that her fears had delineated she had feared to find my heart alienated from her and herself a widowed mother to orphan children she dreaded lest i should have proved myself worthless in her eyes lest i should have been found to have committed to oblivion the most sacred of all duties and for the gratification of a low and contemptible caprice to have sacrificed all pretensions to honour and character for that indeed her heart would have bled against that all the pride she derived from her ancestry and my own would have revolted that would have produced a revulsion of her frame snapping the chain of all her habits and putting a violent close upon all the sentiments she had most fondly nourished she dreaded indeed that she should not have survived it but the mistake i had committed was of a very different nature i had neither forgotten that i was a husband nor a father i had only made an injudicious and unfortunate choice of the way of discharging what was due to these characters what had passed was incapable of impeaching either the constancy of my affections or the integrity of my principles she forgave me and it was incumbent upon me to forgive myself she assured me that poverty in her apprehension was a very slight evil and she appealed to my own understanding for the soundness of her judgment she bid me look round upon the peasantry of the neighbourhood upon a footing with whom we were now placed and ask my own heart whether they were not happy one disadvantage indeed they were subjected to the absence of cultivation and learning she could never bring herself to believe that ignorance was a benefit she saw the contrary of this practically illustrated in her own case in mine and in that of all the persons to whom through life she had been most ardently attached she wished her children to attain intellectual refinement possess fully the attributes of a rational nature and to be as far removed as possible from the condition of stocks and stones by accumulating a magazine of thoughts and by a rich and cultivated sensibility but the want of fortune did not in our case as in the case of so many others shut them out from this advantage it was in our own power to bestow it upon them it was the part of a reasonable man she told me not to waste his strength in useless regrets for what was past and had already eluded his grasp but to advert to the blessings he had still in possession if we did this in our present situation we should find every reason for contentment and joy our pleasure in each other and the constancy of our attachment was unassailed and unimpaired where were there two married persons she would venture to ask who had more reason to applaud their connection or to whom their connection was pregnant with so various gratifications from ourselves we had only to turn our thoughts to our children and we were surely as singularly fortunate in this respect as in each other charles who had always been the subject of our pride had lately exhibited such an example of patient sympathy and filial affection as perhaps had never been equalled in a child so young the sensibility of julia the understanding of louisa and the vivacity of marguerite were all of them so many growing sources of inexhaustible delight our children were intelligent affectionate and virtuous thus circumstanced she entreated me not to indulge that jaundice of the imagination which should create to itself a sentiment of melancholy and discontent in the midst of this terrestrial paradise most virtuous of women now perhaps the purest and the brightest among the saints in heaven why was i deaf to the soundness of your exhortations and the generosity of your sentiments deaf indeed i was a prey to the deepest dejection they appeared to me the offspring of misapprehension and paradox supposing in the mean time that they were reasonable and just in the mouth of her who uttered them i felt them as totally foreign to my own situation the language as they were of innocence it was not wonderful that to an innocent heart they spoke tranquillity and peace marguerite looked round upon the present rusticity and plainness of our condition and every thing that she saw talked to her of her merit and her worth if we were reduced she was in no way accountable for that reduction it had been the test of her magnanimity her patience and the immutableness of her virtue she smiled at the assaults of adversity and felt a merit in her smiles how different was my situation every thing that i saw reminded me of my guilt and upbraided me with crimes that it was hell to recollect my own garb and that of my wife and children the desertion in which we lived the simple benches the unhewn rafters the naked walls all told me what it was i had done and were so many echoes to my conscience repeating without intermission and without end its heart breaking reproaches sleep was almost a stranger to me these incessant monitors confounded my senses in a degree scarcely short of madness itself it is the property of vice to convert every thing that should be consolation into an additional source of anguish the beauty the capacity and the virtue of my children the affection with which they regarded me the patience and attentiveness and forbearance of their excellent mother were all so many aggravations of the mischief i had perpetrated i could almost have wished to have been the object of their taunts and execration i could have wished to have been disengaged from the dearest charities of our nature and to have borne the weight of my crimes alone it would have been a relief to me if my children had been covered with the most loathsome diseases deformed and monstrous it would have been a relief to me if they had been abortive in understanding and odious in propensities if their hearts had teemed with every vice and every day had marked them the predestined victims of infamy the guilt of having stripped them of every external advantage would then have sat light upon me but thus to have ruined the most lovely family perhaps that existed on the face of the earth the most exemplary of women and children in whom i distinctly marked the bud of every excellence and every virtue was a conduct that i could never forgive even to myself oh damville damville best of men truest of friends why didst thou put thy trust in such a wretch as i am hadst thou no presentiment of the fatal consequences wert thou empowered to commit thy only child and all her possible offspring to so dreadful a risk indeed it was not well done it was meant in kindness but it was the cruellest mischief that could have been inflicted on me i was not a creature qualified for such dear and tender connections i was destined by nature to wander a solitary outcast on the face of the earth for that only that fearful misery was i fitted why misguided misjudging man didst thou not leave me to my fate even that would have been less dreadful than what i have experienced wretch that i am why do i reproach my best benefactor no let me turn the whole current of my invective upon myself damville was actuated by the noblest and most generous sentiment that ever entered the human mind what a return then have i made and to what a benefit all the previous habits of my mind had taught me to feel my present circumstances with the utmost acuteness marguerite the generous marguerite stood with a soul almost indifferent between the opposite ideas of riches and poverty not so her husband i had been formed by every accident of my life to the love of splendour high heroic feats and not the tranquillity of rural retirement or the pursuits of a character professedly literary had been the food of my imagination ever since the faculty of imagination was unfolded in my mind the field of the cloth of gold the siege and the battle of pavia were for ever present to my recollection francis the first bayard and bourbon eternally formed the subject of my visions and reveries these propensities had indeed degenerated into an infantine taste for magnificence and expense but the roots did not embrace their soil the less forcibly because the branches were pressed down and diverted from their genuine perpendicular that from a lord descended from some of the most illustrious houses in france and myself amply imbued with the high and disdainful spirit incident to my rank i should become a peasant was itself a sufficient degradation but i call the heavens to witness that i could have endured this with patience if i had endured it alone i should have regarded it as the just retribution of my follies and submitted with the most exemplary resignation but i could not with an equal mind behold my wife and children involved in my punishment i turned my eyes upon the partner of my life and recalled with genuine anguish the magnificence to which she was accustomed and the hopes to which she was born i looked upon my children the fruit of my loins and once the pride of my heart and recollected that they were paupers rustics exiles i could foresee no return to rank but for them and their posterity an interminable succession of obscurity and meanness a real parent can support the calamity of personal degradation but he cannot bear to witness and anticipate this corruption of his blood at some times i honoured marguerite for her equanimity at others i almost despised her for this integrity of her virtues i accused her in my heart of being destitute of the spark of true nobility her patience i considered as little less than meanness and vulgarity of spirit it would have become her better i thought like me to have cursed her fate and the author of that fate like me to have spurned indignant at the slavery to which we were condemned to have refused to be pacified and to have wasted the last dregs of existence in impatience and regret i could act that which had involved us in this dire reverse but i could not encounter the consequences of my act the state of my mind was in the utmost degree dejected and forlorn i carried an arrow in my heart which the kindness of my wife and children proved inadequate to extract and the ranklings of which time itself had not the power to assuage the wound was not mortal but like the wound of philoctetes poisoned with the blood of the lernean hydra i dragged it about with me from year to year and it rendered my existence a galling burden hardly to be supported a great portion of my time was passed in a deep and mournful silence which all the soothings that were addressed to me could not prevail on me to break not that in this silence there was the least particle of ill humour or sullenness it was a mild and passive situation of the mind affectionate as far as it was any thing to the persons around me but it was a species of disability my soul had not force enough to give motion to the organs of speech or scarcely to raise a finger my eye only and that only for a moment at a time pleaded for forbearance and pardon i seemed like a man in that species of distemper in which the patient suffers a wasting of the bones and at length presents to us the shadow without the powers of a human body this was at some times my condition but my stupor would at others suddenly subside mechanically and in a moment as it were i shook off my supineness and sought the mountains the wildness of an untamed and savage scene best accorded with the temper of my mind i sprung from cliff to cliff among the points of the rock i rushed down precipices that to my sobered sense appeared in a manner perpendicular and only preserved my life with a sort of inborn and unelective care by catching at the roots and shrubs which occasionally broke the steepness of the descent i hung over the tops of rocks still more fearful in their declivities and courted the giddiness and whirl of spirit which such spectacles are accustomed to produce i could not resolve to die death had too many charms to suit the self condemnation that pursued me i found a horrible satisfaction in determining to live and to avenge upon myself the guilt i had incurred i was far from imagining that the evils i had yet suffered were a mere sport and ostentation of misery compared with those that were in reserve for me the state of mind i am here describing was not madness nor such as could be mistaken for madness i never forgot myself and what i was i was never in that delirium of thought in which the patient is restless and active without knowing what it is that he does and from which when roused he suddenly starts shakes off the dream that engaged him and stands astonished at himself mine was a rage guided and methodised by the discipline of despair i burst into no fits of raving i attempted no injury to any one marguerite therefore could not reconcile herself to the placing me under any restraint i frequently returned home with my clothes smeared with the soil and torn by the briars but my family soon became accustomed to my returning in personal safety and therefore whatever was the uneasiness my wife felt from my excursions she preferred the enduring it to the idea of imposing on me any species of violence the state of my family presented a singular contrast with that of its head marguerite was certainly not insensible to the opposition between her former and her present mode of life but she submitted to the change with such an unaffected cheerfulness and composure as might have extorted admiration from malignity itself she would perhaps have dismissed from her thoughts all retrospect to our former grandeur had not the dejection and despair that seemed to have taken possession of my mind forcibly and continually recalled it to her memory for my sufferings i am well assured she felt the truest sympathy but there was one consideration attending them that imperiously compelled her to task her fortitude they deprived me of the ability of in any degree providing for and superintending my family it became therefore incumbent upon her to exert herself for the welfare of all had we never fallen under this astonishing reverse i might have spent my whole life in daily intercourse with this admirable woman without becoming acquainted with half the treasures of her mind she was my steward and from the result of her own reflections made the most judicious disposition of my property she was my physician not by administering medicines to my body but by carefully studying and exerting herself to remove the distemper of mind unfortunately no distempers are so obstinate as mental ones yet had my distemper had any lighter source than an upbraiding conscience i am persuaded the wisdom of marguerite would have banished it she was the instructor of my children her daughters felt no want of a governess and i am even ready to doubt whether the lessons of his mother did not amply supply to charles his loss of an education in the university of paris the love of order the activity the industry the cheerfulness of let me say this illustrious matron became contagious to all the inhabitants of my roof once and again have i stolen a glance at them or viewed them from a distance busied sometimes gravely sometimes gaily in the plain and have whispered to my bursting heart how miserable am i how happy they so insurmountable is the barrier that divides innocence from guilt they may breathe the same air they may dwell under the same roof they may be of one family and one blood they may associate with each other every day and every hour but they can never assimilate never have any genuine contact is there a happier family than mine in all the valley of this far famed republic is there a family more virtuous or more cultivated with all the refinements that conduce to the true dignity of man i i only am its burden and its stain the pleasure with which i am surrounded on every side finds a repellent quality in my heart that will not suffer its approach to whatever is connected with me i communicate misfortune whenever i make my appearance those countenances that at all other times spoke contentment and hilarity fall into sadness like a pestilential wind i appear to breathe blast to the fruits of nature and sickliness to its aspect marguerite expostulated with me in the most soothing manner upon the obstinacy of my malady my reginald my love said she cease to be unhappy or to reproach yourself you were rash in the experiment you made upon the resources of your family but have you done us mischief or have you conferred a benefit i more than half incline to the latter opinion let us at length dismiss artificial tastes and idle and visionary pursuits that do not flow in a direct line from any of the genuine principles of our nature here we are surrounded with sources of happiness here we may live in true patriarchal simplicity what is chivalry what are military prowess and glory believe me they are the passions of a mind depraved that with ambitious refinement seeks to be wise beyond the dictates of sentiment or reason there is no happiness so solid or so perfect as that which disdains these refinements you like me are fond of the luxuriant and romantic scenes of nature here we are placed in the midst of them how idle it would be to wish to change our arbours our verdant lanes and thickets for vaulted roofs and gloomy halls and massy plate alas reginald it is i fear too true that the splendour in which we lately lived has its basis in oppression and that the superfluities of the rich are a boon extorted from the hunger and misery of the poor here we see a peasantry more peaceful and less oppressed than perhaps any other tract of the earth can exhibit they are erect and independent at once friendly and fearless is not this a refreshing spectacle i now begin practically to perceive that the cultivators of the fields and the vineyards are my brethren and my sisters and my heart bounds with joy as i feel my relations to society multiply how cumbrous is magnificence the moderate man is the only free he who reduces all beneath him to a state of servitude becomes himself the slave of his establishment and of all his domestics to diminish the cases in which the assistance of others is felt absolutely necessary is the only genuine road to independence we can now move wherever we please without waiting the leisure of others our simple repasts require no tedious preparation and do not imprison us in saloons and eating rooms yet we partake of them with a more genuine appetite and rise from them more truly refreshed than from the most sumptuous feast i prepare for my meal by industry and exercise and when it is over amuse myself with my children in the fields and the shade though i love the sight of the peasants i would not be a peasant i would have a larger stock of ideas and a wider field of activity i love the sight of peasants only for their accessories or by comparison they are comparatively more secure than any other large masses of men and the scenes in the midst of which they are placed are delightful to sense but i would not sacrifice in prone oblivion the best characteristics of my nature i put in my claim for refinements and luxuries but they are the refinements and purifying of intellect and the luxuries of uncostly simple taste i would incite the whole world if i knew how to do it to put in a similar claim i would improve my mind i would enlarge my understanding i would contribute to the instruction of all connected with me and to the mass of human knowledge the pleasures i would pursue and disseminate though not dependent on a large property are such as could not be understood by the rustic and the savage our son bred in these fields indeed will probably never become a preux chevalier or figure in the roll of military heroes but he may become something happier and better he may improve his mind and cultivate his taste he may be the counsellor and protector of his sisters he may be the ornament of the district in which he resides he may institute in his adoptive country new defences for liberty new systems of public benefit and new improvements of life there is no character more admirable than the patriot yeoman who unites with the utmost simplicity of garb and manners an understanding fraught with information and sentiment and a heart burning with the love of mankind such were fabricius and regulus among the ancients and such was tell the founder of the helvetic liberty for my part i am inclined to be thankful that this unexpected reverse in our circumstances has made me acquainted with new pleasures and opened to my mind an invaluable lesson if you could but be prevailed on to enter into our pleasures to dismiss idle reproaches and pernicious propensities our happiness would then be complete the expostulations of marguerite often excited my attention often my respect and sometimes produced a sort of imperfect conviction but the conviction was transient and the feelings i have already described as properly my own returned when the fresh and vivid impression of what i had heard was gone it was in vain that i heard the praises of simplicity and innocence i was well pleased to see those who were nearest to me not affecting contentment but really contented with these things but i could not be contented for them the lessons of my education had left too deep an impression i could myself have surrendered my claim to admiration and homage as a penance for my misdeeds but i could not figure to myself a genuine satisfaction unaccompanied by these accessories and this satisfaction i obstinately and impatiently coveted for those i loved chapter viii while i murmured in bitterness of soul at the lowness to which my family was reduced a still heavier calamity impended as if in vengeance against the fantastic refinements of distress over which i brooded i was wandering as i had often done with a gloomy and rebellious spirit among the rocks a few miles distant from the place of our habitation it was the middle of summer the weather had been remarkably fine but i disdained to allow the gratifications which arise from a pure atmosphere and a serene sky to find entrance in my soul my excursions had for some days been incessant and the sun which matured the corn and blackened the grapes around had imbrowned my visage and boiled in my blood i drank in fierceness and desperation from the fervour of his beams one night as in sullen mood i watched his setting from a point of the rock i perceived the clearness of the day subsiding in a threatening evening the clouds gathered in the west and as night approached were overspread with a deep dye of the fiercest crimson the wind rose and during the hours of darkness its roarings were hollow and tempestuous in the morning the clouds were hurried rapidly along and the air was changed from a long series of sultriness to a nipping cold this change of the atmosphere i disregarded and pursued my rambles a little before noon however the air suddenly grew so dark as to produce a sensation perfectly tremendous i felt as if the darkest night had never exceeded it the impetuous motion to which i had been impelled partly by the fever in my blood and partly by the turbulence of the season was suspended mechanically i looked round me for shelter but i could ill distinguish the objects that were near me when a flash of lightning blue and sulphureous came directly in my face with a brightness that threatened to extinguish the organ of vision the thunder that followed was of a length and loudness to admit of no comparison from any object with which i am acquainted the bursts were so frequent as almost to confound themselves with each other at present i thought only of myself and the recent habits of my mind were not calculated to make me peculiarly accessible to fear i stood awe struck but rather with the awe that inheres to a cultivated imagination than that which consists in apprehension i seemed ready to mount amidst the clouds and penetrate the veil with which nature conceals her operations i would have plunged into the recesses in which the storm was engendered and bared my bosom to the streaming fire meanwhile my thoughts were solemnised and fixed by observing the diversified dance of the lightnings upon the points of the rocks contrasting as they did in the strongest manner with the darkness in which the rest of the scene was enveloped this added contention of the elements did not however suspend the raging of the wind presently a storm of mingled hail and rain poured from the clouds and was driven with inconceivable impetuosity the hailstones were of so astonishing a magnitude that before i was aware i was beaten by them to the ground not daring to attempt to rise again i simply endeavoured to place myself in such a manner as might best protect me from their violence i therefore remained prostrate listening to the force with which they struck upon the earth and feeling the rebound of their blows from different parts of my body in about twenty minutes the shower abated and in half an hour was entirely over when i began to move i was surprised at the sensation of soreness which i felt in every part of me i raised myself upon my elbow and saw the hailstones in some places lying in heaps like hillocks of ice while in others they had ploughed up the surface and buried themselves in the earth as i looked further i perceived immense trees torn from their roots and thrown to a great distance upon the declivity to the noise that they made in their descent which must have been astonishingly great i had been at the time insensible such were the marks which the tempest had left upon the mountains in the plain it was still worse i could perceive the soil for long spaces together converted into a morass the standing corn beaten down and buried in the mud the vines torn into a thousand pieces the fruit trees demolished and even in some places the animals themselves lambs sheep and cows strewing the fields with their mangled carcasses the whole hopes of the year over which my eyes had glanced a few minutes before for it was near the period of harvest were converted into the most barren and dreary scene that any quarter of the globe ever witnessed i was mounted upon a considerable eminence and had an extensive prospect of this horrible devastation as i stood gazing in mute astonishment suddenly a fear came over me that struck dampness to my very heart what was the situation of my own family and their little remaining property amidst this dreadful ruin i was in a position where though i nearly faced our habitation a point of the rock intercepted it from my sight the obstacle was but a small one yet it would require a considerable circuit to overcome i flew along the path with a speed that scarcely permitted me to breathe when i had passed the upper rock the whole extensive scene opened upon me in an instant what were my sensations when i perceived that the devastation had been even more complete here than on the side where i first viewed it my own cottage in particular which that very morning had contained and i hoped continued to contain all that was most dear to my heart seemed to stand an entire solitude in the midst of an immense swamp marguerite whose idea upon our retreat into switzerland had been that of conforming without reserve to the new situation that was allotted us had immediately expended the whole of what remained from the shipwreck of our fortune in the purchase of the cottage in which we dwelt and a small portion of land around it sufficient with economy for the support of our family under her direction the hills had been covered with vines and the fields with corn she had purchased cows to furnish us with milk and sheep with their fleeces and had formed her establishment upon the model of the swiss peasantry in our neighbourhood reverting to the simplicity of nature appeared to her like building upon an immovable basis which the clash of nations could not destroy and which was too humble to fear the treachery of courts or the caprice of artificial refinement it was all swept away in a moment our little property looked as if it had been particularly a mark for the vengeance of heaven and was more utterly destroyed than any of the surrounding scenes there was not a tree left standing there was not a hedge or a limit that remained within or around it chaos had here resumed his empire and avenged himself of the extraordinary order and beauty it had lately displayed i was not overwhelmed with this astonishing spectacle at that moment nature found her way to my heart and made a man of me i made light of these petty accessories of our existence and the thought of my wife and my children simply as they were in themselves filled every avenue of my heart for them and them alone i was interested it was a question for their lives to conceive what they might personally have sustained was a horror that seemed to freeze up all the arteries of my heart i descended from the mountain it was with the greatest difficulty and not without many circuitous deviations that i proceeded so much was the surface changed and so deep and miry the swamps my terror increased as i passed near to the carcasses of the animals who had fallen victims to this convulsion of the elements i observed with inconceivable alarm that the dead or wounded bodies of some human beings were intermingled with the brute destruction i stayed not to enquire whether they were yet in a state to require assistance the idea that had taken possession of me left no room for the sentiment of general humanity a little further on i distinctly remarked the body of a woman at some distance from any habitation who appeared to be dead destroyed by the storm near her lay a female infant apparently about six years of age my attention was involuntarily arrested i thought of louisa that sweet and amiable child so like her admirable mother the figure was hers the colour of the robe corresponded to that in which i last saw her the child was lying on her face with all the impatient emotions of a father i stooped down i turned over the body that i might identify my child it was still warm life had scarcely deserted it i gazed upon the visage it was distorted with the agonies of death but enough to convince me still remained discernible it was not louisa i can scarcely recollect a period through all the strange vicissitudes of my existence to be compared with this if i had not felt what i then felt i could never have conceived it human nature is so constituted that the highest degree of anguish an anguish in which the heart stretches itself to take in the mightiness of its woe can be felt but for a few instants when the calamity we feared is already arrived or when the expectation of it is so certain as to shut out hope there seems to be a principle within us by which we look with misanthropic composure on the state to which we are reduced and the heart sullenly contracts and accommodates itself to what it most abhorred our hopes wither and our pride our self complacence all that taught us to rejoice in existence wither along with them but when hope yet struggles with despair or when the calamity abruptly announces itself then is the true contention the tempest and uproar of the soul too vast to be endured this sentiment of ineffable wretchedness i experienced when i stooped down over the body of the imaginary louisa and when i hastened to obtain the certainty which was of all things most terrible to me the termination of such a moment of horror is scarcely less memorable than its intrinsic greatness in an instant the soul recovers its balance and the thought is as if it has never been i clapped my hands in an ecstasy at once of joy and astonishment so sure did i seem to have made myself of my misfortune i quitted the body with an unburdened heart i flew towards my home that i might ascertain whether i was prematurely speaking comfort to my spirit at length i reached it i saw the happy group assembled at the door marguerite had entertained the same terrors for me with which i had myself so lately been impressed we flew into each others arms she hid her face in my neck and sobbed audibly i embraced each of the children in turn but louisa with the most heartfelt delight are you safe papa are you safe my child were echoed on every side a spectator unacquainted with what was passing in our hearts would certainly have stood astonished to see the transport with which we exulted surrounded as we were with desolation and ruin after an interval however we opened our eyes and began to ruminate upon the new condition in which we were placed marguerite and myself watched each others countenances with anxiety to discover what were likely to be the feelings of either in this terrible crisis be of good heart my love said marguerite do not suffer the accident which has happened entirely to overcome you there was a mixed compassion tenderness and anxiety in the tone of voice with which she uttered these words that was inexpressibly delightful no marguerite replied i with enthusiastic impetuosity i am not cast down i never shall be cast down again ruin is nothing to me so long as i am surrounded with you and our dear children i have for some time been a fool in the midst of every real blessing i have fashioned for myself imaginary evils but my eyes are now opened how easily is the human mind induced to forget those benefits with which we are constantly surrounded and our possession of which we regard as secure the feelings of this morning have awakened me i am now cured of my folly i have learned to value my domestic blessings as i ought having preserved them i esteem myself to have lost nothing what are gold and jewels and precious utensils mere dross and dirt the human face and the human heart reciprocations of kindness and love and all the nameless sympathies of our nature these are the only objects worth being attached to what are rank and station the homage of the multitude and the applause of fools let me judge for myself the value of a man is in his intrinsic qualities in that of which power cannot strip him and which adverse fortune cannot take away that for which he is indebted to circumstances is mere trapping and tinsel i should love these precious and ingenuous creatures before me better though in rags than the children of kings in all the pomp of ornament i am proud to be their father whatever may be my personal faults the world is my debtor for having been the occasion of their existence but they are endeared to me by a better principle than pride i love them for their qualities he that loves and is loved by a race of pure and virtuous creatures and that lives continually in the midst of them is an idiot if he does not think himself happy surrounded as i am now surrounded i feel as irremovable as the pillars of creation nothing that does not strike at their existence can affect me with terror marguerite viewed me with surprise and joy now indeed said she you are the man i took you for and the man i shall henceforth be prouder than ever to call my husband the sorrow in which you lately indulged was a luxury and we must have done with luxuries you will be our protector and our support thus saying she took me by the hand and motioned me to view with her the devastation that had been committed there was one path i had discovered in which we might proceed some way with tolerable ease the scene was terrible we were indeed beggars a whole province had been destroyed all the corn and the fruits of the earth most of the trees in many places cattle in some places men persons who had been rich in the morning saw all the produce of their fields annihilated and were unable even to guess by what process fertility was to be re established the comparatively wealthy scarcely knew how they were to obtain immediate subsistence the humbler class who always live by the expedients of the day saw nothing before them but the prospect of perishing with hunger we witnessed in one or two instances the anguish of their despair our prospect was scarcely in any respect better than theirs yet we felt differently we were more impressed with the joy of our personal escape as my error respecting the value of externals had been uncommonly great the sudden revolution of opinion i experienced was equally memorable the survey indeed that we took of the general distress somewhat saddened our hearts but the sadness it gave was that of sobriety not of dejection it was incumbent upon us to make a strict examination into the amount of our property and our immediate resources and in this office i united myself with marguerite not only with a degree of cheerfulness and application the perfect contrast of my whole conduct ever since our arrival in switzerland but which greatly exceeded any thing i had ever before exhibited in a business of this nature we found that though all our hopes of a harvest were annihilated yet we were not destitute of the instant means of subsistence the resources we possessed whether in money or provisions that were our dependence till the period when the new produce should supply their place were uninjured our implements of husbandry remained as before the land was not impoverished but had rather derived additional fertility from the effects of the storm what we had lost was chiefly the produce of our capital for one year together with a part of that capital itself in the live stock that had been destroyed this was a loss which a certain degree of care and scope in our external circumstances might easily have enabled us to supply but the principle of supply was denied us it was with considerable difficulty that all the economy of marguerite had enabled her to support our family establishment while every thing of this kind had gone on prosperously such a shock as the present we were totally disqualified to surmount it compelled us to a complete revolution of our affairs many indeed of our neighbours had scarcely any greater advantage in their private affairs than ourselves but they possessed one superiority that proved of the greatest importance in this conjuncture they were natives of the state in which they resided in the cantons of switzerland the destruction of the fruits of the earth occasioned by inclement seasons and tempests is by no means unfrequent and it is therefore customary in plentiful years to lay up corn in public magazines that the people may not perish in periods of scarcity these magazines are placed under the inspection and disposal of the magistracy and the inhabitants looked to them with confidence for the supply of their need no storm however had occurred in the memory of man so terrible and ruinous as the present and it became evident that the magazines would prove a resource too feeble for the extent of the emergency the storm had spread itself over a space of many leagues in circumference not only in the canton of soleure but in the neighbouring cantons particularly that of berne the sufferers in our own canton only amounted to scarcely less than ten thousand while the women and children for the most part remained at home the houses having in general suffered little other damage than the destruction of their windows the fathers of families repaired to the seat of government to put in their claims for national relief and these alone formed an immense troop that threatened little less than to besiege the public magazines and the magistrates an accurate investigation was entered into of the losses of each it being the purpose of government as far as its power extended not only to supply the people with the means of immediate subsistence but also by disbursements from the public treasury to recruit the stock of cattle and to assist every one to return with revived hopes and expectation to the sphere of his industry the purpose was no doubt benevolent but in the mean time the unhappy victims found in uncertainty and expectation a real and corroding anguish i advanced my claim with the rest but met with a peremptory refusal the harsh and rigorous answer i received was that they had not enough for their own people and could spare nothing to strangers upon this occasion i was compelled to feel what it was to be an alien and how different the condition in which i was now placed from that i had filled in my native country there i had lived in the midst of a people to whom the veneration of my ancestry and name seemed a part of their nature they had witnessed for several years the respectable manner in which i lived the virtues of marguerite were familiar to them and they took an interest in every thing that concerned us a sentiment that confessed us at once for kindred and patrons it was the turn of mind only which is generated by rank that had compelled us to quit their vicinity we might have continued in it if not in affluence at least enjoying the gratifications that arise from general affection and respect but here we were beheld with an eye of jealousy and distaste we had no prejudice of birth and habit in our favour indeed in the reverse of fortune which had brought us hither marguerite had been less desirous of obtruding than of withdrawing from the public eye the circumstance of our rank we were too recent inmates to have secured by any thing of a personal nature an advantageous opinion among our neighbours they saw only a miserable and distracted father of a family and a mother who in spite of the simplicity she cultivated sufficiently evinced that she had been accustomed to a more elevated situation the prepossessions of mankind are clearly unfavourable to a new comer an emigrant who has quitted his former connections and the scenes of his youth they are unavoidably impelled to believe that his taking up his abode in another country must be owing to a weak and discreditable caprice if it be not owing to something still more disadvantageous to his character the calamity therefore which we had suffered in common with most of the inhabitants of the province finally reduced us to the necessity of a second emigration the jealousy with which we were regarded daily became more visible and threatening though in consequence of the distribution made by order of the state the price of commodities was not so much increased as might have been expected we were considered as interlopers upon the portion of the natives the sellers could with difficulty be persuaded to accommodate us and the bystanders treated us with murmurs and reviling while we were deliberating what course to pursue in this emergency certain officers of government one morning entered our habitation producing an order of the senate for our immediate removal out of the territory it is of the essence of coercive regulations to expel to imprison and turn out of prison the individuals it is thought proper to control without any care as to the mischiefs they may suffer and whether they perish under or survive the evil inflicted on them we were accordingly allowed only from six in the morning till noon to prepare for our departure our guards indeed offered to permit me to remain three days to wind up my affairs upon condition that my wife and children were instantly removed into another country as a sort of hostages for my own departure this indulgence however would have been useless in the present state of the country no purchaser could be found for the little estate i possessed and if there could it must doubtless have been disposed of to great disadvantage at such an emergency i know not how we should have extricated ourselves out of these difficulties if a member of the senate who being one of my nearest neighbours had been struck with admiration of the virtues of marguerite and with compassion for my family had not paid me a visit shortly after the arrival of the officers and generously offered to take upon himself the care of my property and to advance me what money might be necessary for my emigration this offer which at any other time might have been regarded as purely a matter of course under the present circumstances when capital was so necessary for the revival of agriculture in the desolated country implied a liberal and disinterested spirit i accepted the kindness of my neighbour in both its parts but for the reimbursement of his loan referred him to the french minister to the united cantons who under all the circumstances of the case and taking my estate as security for the money advanced i thought it reasonable to believe would attend to my application chapter ix my affairs being thus far adjusted i took leave of my late habitation and set off with my wife and children the same afternoon in the evening we arrived at basle where we were permitted to remain that night and the next morning were conducted in form out at the north gate of the city where our attendants quitted us with a fresh prohibition under the severest penalties if we were found within the ensuing twelve months in any of the territories of the helvetic republic marguerite and myself had already formed our plan we began with dismissing both our servants an attendant was no longer necessary to me nor a nurse for the infant the suggestion of this measure originated in myself my temper at this time as i have already said underwent a striking change i was resolved to be happy i was resolved to be active it was hard to part with persons so long familiar to us and who appeared rather in the character of humble friends than domestics but an imperious necessity demanded it let us said i to marguerite increase and secure our happiness by diminishing our wants i will be your husbandman and your labourer you may depend upon my perseverance my education has fitted me to endure hardship and fatigue though the hardships then thought of were of a different nature you have ever delighted in active usefulness and will not i know repine at this accumulation of employment let us accommodate ourselves to our circumstances our children i perceive are fated to be peasants and will therefore be eminently benefited by the example of patience and independence we shall set before them the next object of our plan related to the choice of our future place of residence this originated with marguerite she had heard much of the beauty and richness of the country bordering on the lake of constance and she thought that while we denied ourselves expensive pleasures or rather while they were placed out of our reach there would be a propriety in our procuring for ourselves a stock of those pleasures which would cost us nothing this was a refinement beyond me and serves to evince the superiority which marguerites virtue and force of mind still retained over mine the virtue i had so recently adopted was a strenuous effort i rather resolved to be happy than could strictly be said to be happy i loved my children indeed with an unfeigned affection it was with sincerity that i professed to prefer them to all earthly possessions but vanity and ostentation were habits wrought into my soul and might be said to form part of its essence i could not but by the force of constant recollection keep them out of my wishes and hopes for the future i could not like marguerite suffer my thoughts as it were to riot and wanton in the pleasures of poverty i could only reconcile myself to my fate by a sort of gloomy firmness the tranquillity i seemed to have attained was an unnatural state of my soul to which it was necessary that i should resolutely hold myself down and from which my thoughts appeared ever upon the alert to escape bitter experience had at length taught me a hard lesson and that lesson i was determined to practise whatever pangs my resignation might cost me we proceeded without hesitation in the direction we had resolved to pursue our whole journey exceeded the space of forty leagues in extent and the expense necessarily attendant upon it our family even after its reduction consisting of no less than six persons drained our purse of a great part of the money which had been supplied to us by the benevolent senator but he had agreed to undertake the disposing of the property we were obliged to leave behind us and in the mean time if any considerable interval occurred before that was accomplished to furnish us with the sums that should be necessary for our subsistence we placed the utmost reliance upon his fidelity and dismissed from our minds all anxiety respecting the interval which our banishment had interposed between us and the resources necessary for our future settlement upon our arrival at constance we found a letter from our friend and though he transmitted to us no fresh supply the complexion of his communication was upon the whole so encouraging as to determine us with no other delay than that of four days rest from our journey to pass to the other side of the lake and explore for ourselves a situation suitable to our design the western bank of the lake with the exception only of the city of constance was part of the pays conquis of the united cantons the eastern bank was a territory dependent on the government of that city it was in this territory that we purposed fixing our residence and we trusted that our affairs would shortly be put in a train to enable us to take possession of the spot we should select thus driven once more into flight by the pressure of misfortune and compelled to exchange for a land unknown the scenes which familiarity might have endeared or tender recollections have made interesting we did not sink under the weight of our adversity this removal was not like our last switzerland was to none of us endeared like the vales of st leon i was not now goaded and tormented by conscious guilt in the degree i had then been marguerite was not afflicted by the spectacle of my misery our present change though it might be denominated a fall was light in comparison with the former the composure i had gained was new to me and had to my own mind all the gloss of novelty to my companions it proved contagious they were astonished at my serenity and drew from it an unwonted lightness of heart thus circumstanced our tour had its charms for us all and there are few passages of my life that i have felt more agreeably the lake itself is uncommonly beautiful and its environs are fertile and interesting it is surrounded with an abundance of towns villages country seats and monasteries sufficient to adorn and diversify the view but not to exclude the sweetness of a rural scenery or the grand features of nature we coasted a considerable part of the lake that we might judge in some degree previously to our landing which part of the shore promised best to yield us the object we sought the autumn was now commencing the air was liquid and sweet the foliage was rich and varied and the vine covered hills exhibited a warmth and luxuriance of colouring that no other object of nature or art is able to cope with surrounded with these objects i sat in my boat in the midst of my children and as i was but just awakened to an observation of their worth and my own happiness i viewed them with a transport that would be ill illustrated by being compared with the transport of a miser over his new recovered treasure from the bowels of the deep o poverty exclaimed i with elevated and unconquerable emotion if these are the delights that attend thee willingly will i resign the pomp of palaces and the splendour of rank to whoever shall deem them worth his acceptance henceforth i desire only to dedicate myself to the simplicity of nature and the genuine sentiments of the heart i will enjoy the beauty of scenes cultivated by other hands than mine or that are spread out before me by the author of the universe i will sit in the midst of my children and revel in the luxury of domestic affections pleasures these that may be incumbered but cannot be heightened by all that wealth has in its power to bestow wealth serves no other purpose than to deprave the soul and adulterate the fountains of genuine delight such was the spirit of exultation with which my mind was at this time filled i am sensible that it was only calculated to be transitory i might learn to be contented i was not formed to be satisfied in obscurity and a low estate thus happy and thus amused we spent two days in coasting the lake landing frequently for the purposes either of variety or enquiry and regularly passing the night on shore on the evening of the second day we were struck with the neat appearance and pleasing situation of a cottage which we discovered in our rambles about a mile and a half from the lake we found that it was to be sold and it seemed precisely to correspond with the wishes we had formed it was at a considerable distance from any populous neighbourhood the nearest town being that of merspurg the usual residence of the bishops of constance which was distant from this spot not less than three leagues the cottage was situated in a valley the hills being for the most part crowned with rich and verdant foliage their sides covered with vineyards and corn and a clear transparent rivulet murmuring along from east to west in the distance a few similar cottages discovered themselves and in front there was an opening between the hills just wide enough to show us a few sails as they floated along the now even surface of the lake we approached the cottage and found in it only one person an interesting girl of nineteen who had resided there from her birth and had been employed for the last four years in attendance upon the closing scene of her mother her mother had been dead only a few weeks and she was upon the point of removing as she told us to the house of a brother the best creature in the world who was already married and had a family of children while we were talking with her we perceived a fine boy of about eleven years of age skipping along the meadow he proved to be her nephew and hastened to say that his father and mr henry were just behind and would be with her in a few minutes we waited their arrival and it was easy to see that mr henry was by no means an indifferent object in the eyes of the beautiful orphan she had probably conditioned that he should permit her to remain single as long as she could be of any use to her mother the lovers were well satisfied that the girls brother should be taken aside that i might talk over with him the affair of the cottage we made a tour of the fields that were part of the property of the deceased and the terms of our intended purchase were easily adjusted though we had now accomplished the immediate purpose of our expedition yet as we had found unusual exhilaration and sweetness in the objects it presented to us we came to a resolution of continuing it still further and completing the circuit of the lake we were aware that it would be vain as yet to expect to receive the money requisite for completing our purchase and as no pleasure merely in the way of relaxation could be more delightful than that we were now enjoying so was it impossible that we could fill up our time in a more frugal manner than in this little voyage our gratification was not less but more perfect because it consisted of simple inartificial unbought amusements the scenes around us were refreshing and invigorating they were calculated temporarily at least to inspire gaiety and youth into decrepitude itself amidst these scenes we forgot our sorrows they were a kind of stream in which weariness and dejection plunged their limbs and came forth untired and alert they awakened in the mind all its most pleasing associations having already as we believed chosen the place of our future residence we busied ourselves in imagining all the accompaniments that would grow out of it we determined that poverty with health would not fail to be attended with its portion of pleasures the scenes of nature were all our own nor could wealth give them a more perfect or a firmer appropriation the affections and charities of habitude and consanguinity we trusted we should feel uninterrupted unincumbered with the ceremonies and trappings of life and in that rural plainness which is their genial soil after a leisurely and delightful voyage of six days we returned to constance we expected to have found on our return some further intelligence from the beneficent senator but in this we were disappointed the imagination however easily suggested to us a variety of circumstances that might have delayed the business he had undertaken and it was no forced inference to suppose that he deferred writing because he had nothing important to communicate at first therefore we suffered little uneasiness from the delay but as time proceeded and the silence of our protector continued the affair began to assume a more serious aspect the little stock we had brought with us in our exile was in a rapid progress of decay we had managed it with frugality though not at first with that anxious solicitude the necessity of which we now began to apprehend we had procured for ourselves two small and inconvenient apartments in an obscure alley of the city of constance we were in the act of meditating what steps it would be necessary to take in this unfortunate emergency when intelligence was brought us of the sudden decease of the person upon whose kindness and exertions we depended he was succeeded in his estate by his nephew a man of whom we had heard something during our residence in the neighbourhood and whose habits we understood to be diametrically the reverse of his predecessors in short he had been represented to us as illiberal morose selfish and litigious a man who having suffered in one part of his life the hardships of poverty scrupled no means honourable or otherwise of removing it to the greatest practicable distance he had already reaped the succession some weeks when we heard of the event that put him in possession of it and the letters which i had more than once addressed to our protector had probably fallen into his hands these circumstances afforded no favourable augury of the treatment we might expect from him the first thing which seemed proper was to write to him which i accordingly did i acquainted him with the nature of the transaction between myself and his uncle and signified how necessary it was that we should come to a conclusion as speedily as possible i represented to him pathetically the condition to which i was born and the opulence in which i had passed many years of my life together with the contrast afforded by the present reduced and urgent circumstances of my family i entreated him to exert his generosity and justice in behalf of an unfortunate exile whom untoward events had deprived of the power of doing justice to himself to this letter i received no answer uncertain as to the cause of my correspondents silence or even whether my letter had been received i wrote again my heart was wrung with this new adversity i was forbidden under pain of perpetual imprisonment to return to the territories of the republic and i had no friend to solicit in my behalf in constance i was utterly a stranger in switzerland my unfortunate habits of life the depression and solitude in which i had been merged deprived me of the opportunity of forming connections the deceased was the only person who had been disposed to interfere for me it was too probable that the silence of his successor was an indication of the hostility of his views i saw nothing before me but the prospect of my family perishing with want deprived of their last resource exiles and pennyless thus destitute and forlorn what could we do to what plan could we have recourse we had not so much as the means of providing ourselves with the implements of the humblest labour if we had could i under my circumstances resolve upon this could i give up the last slender pittance of my children while there was a chance of recovering it and by surrendering them to the slavery of perpetual labour devote them to the lowest degree of ignorance and degradation no i still clung to this final hope and was resolved to undertake any thing however desperate rather than part with it such were my feelings and in the new letter which i now despatched i poured out all the anguish of my soul a reply to this letter was at length vouchsafed the heir of my protector informed me that he knew nothing of the business to which i alluded that he had come into possession of the lands i described together with the other property of his late uncle and regarded himself as holding them by the same tenure that he found in the accounts of the estate a sum of money advanced to me which he might with the strictest justice regard as a debt and pursue me for it accordingly he should be liberal enough however so far to give credit to my story and to consider the sum in question as advanced upon a pledge of land in that case i might regard myself as sufficiently fortunate in having obtained even that amount at a time when but for the humanity or weakness of his uncle my estate would not have sold for a farthing meanwhile the forbearance which he proffered would he observed depend upon my conduct and be retracted if i afforded him cause for resentment he added that he despised my menaces and commands and that if i took a single step against him i should find it terminate in my utter ruin nothing could be more profligate than the style of his letter but its impotence was equal to its wickedness it was absurd to threaten to inflict ruin on a man whom ruin had already overtaken before the letter arrived i had disbursed the whole sum i brought with me from switzerland this entire annihilation of my resources seemed to steal on me unperceived finding that all reply to my importunity was either refused or deferred to an uncertain period i would willingly at all risks have sought the villain who thus obdurately devoted me and my family to destruction and have endeavoured to obtain justice in person but it was now too late before i felt the case thus desperate my finances were so far reduced as to make it impracticable for me to leave my wife and children enough to support them in my absence even if i had determined myself to set out upon this perilous expedition pennyless i resolved that if we did perish we would perish together penury was now advancing upon us with such rapid strides that the lowest and most scanty resources no longer admitted of neglect had a case thus desperate been encountered with timely attention it is not improbable that some of the various talents i had acquired in the course of my education would have furnished me with a means of subsistence not altogether plebeian or incompetent but with the uncertainty of my situation and totally unaccustomed as i was to regard my person or mind as a machine fitted for productive labour i had not looked to this question till the urgency of the case deprived me of every advantage i might otherwise have seized i was glad therefore to have recourse to menial occupation and sought employment under the gardener of the episcopal palace for whose service i was sufficiently qualified by my ten years retreat in the bordelois that i might better adapt myself to the painful necessity of my situation i previously exchanged some of my own clothes for garments more suitable to the business i now solicited it was not till i had arrived within a very few days to the end of my resources that even this expedient by a sort of accident recurred to my mind marguerite though fully aware of the urgency of the case had as she afterwards told me imposed on herself a compulsory silence fearing for the inflamed and irritated frame of my mind and aware that the course of events would ultimately lead me to a point with which she dreaded to intermeddle this was for her a trying moment my lately recovered insanity obliging her to contemplate in silence our growing distress and to wait the attack of hunger and want that threatened to destroy us with an apparent tranquillity and cheerfulness for me so entire a revolution had taken place in my sentiments that i spurned with contempt so far as related to myself that pride of rank and romantic gallantry of honour which had formerly been my idols i submitted with a sort of gloomy contentment to the situation upon which my destiny drove me i regarded it as the natural result of my former misconduct and derived a sentiment of ease and relief from thus expiating as it were with the sweat of my brow the temptations to which i had yielded had i been myself only reduced thus low or had the produce of my labour been sufficient to purchase competence for my wife and the means of instruction for my family i can safely affirm that i should have found no consequence so direct from my own degradation as the means of silencing the reproaches of conscience and reconciling me to myself but when i returned in the evening with the earnings of my days labour and found it incompetent to the procuring for those who depended on me the simplest means of subsistence then indeed my sensations were different my heart died within me i did not return after the fatigues of the day which to me who had not been accustomed to unremitted labour and who now began to feel that i was not so young as i had been at the siege of pavia were extremely trying i did not return i say to a night of repose i became a very woman when i looked forward and endeavoured to picture to myself the future situation of my family i watered my pillow with my tears often when i imagined that my whole family were asleep i gave vent to my perturbated and distracted mind in groans marguerite would sometimes overhear me and with the gentlest suggestions of her admirable mind would endeavour to soothe my thoughts to peace for the present as i have said my earnings were incompetent and we found it necessary to supply the deficiency by the sale of the few garments not in immediate use that we still possessed what then would be the case when these were gone and when in addition to this it would be necessary to purchase not only food to eat and a roof to shelter but also clothes to cover us chapter x these deficiencies i anxiously anticipated but there was another evil upon which i had not calculated that was still nearer and more overwhelming the mode of life in which i was now engaged so different from any thing to which i had been accustomed excessive fatigue together with the occasional heat of the weather the uneasiness of my mind and the sleeplessness of my nights all combined to throw me into a fever which though it did not last long had raged so furiously during the period of its continuance as to leave me in a state of the most complete debility while the disorder was upon me i was sensible of my danger and as the brilliant and consolatory prospects of life seemed for ever closed upon me i at first regarded my approaching dissolution with complacency and longed to be released from a series of woes in which i had been originally involved by my own folly this frame of mind however was of no great duration the more nearly i contemplated the idea of separation from those i loved the smaller was my resignation i was unwilling to quit those dear objects by which i still held to this mortal scene i shrunk with aversion from that barrier which separates us from all that is new mysterious and strange another train of ideas succeeded this and i began to despise myself for my impatience and cowardice it was by my vices that my family was involved in a long train of misfortunes could i shrink from partaking what i had not feared to create the greater were the adversities for which they were reserved the more ought i to desire to suffer with them i had already committed the evil in what remained it was reasonable to suppose i should prove their benefactor and not their foe it was incumbent on me to soothe and to animate them to enrich their minds with cheerfulness and courage and to set before them an example of philosophy and patience by my faculties of industry i was their principal hope and whatever we might suffer combined it was probable their sufferings would be infinitely greater if deprived of my assistance these reflections gave me energy and it seemed as if the resolute predilection i had conceived for life contributed much to my recovery one thing which strongly confirmed the change my mind underwent in this respect was a conversation that i overheard at a time when i was supposed to be completely in a state of insensibility but when though i was too much reduced to give almost any tokens of life my faculties of hearing and understanding what passed around me were entire charles came up to my bedside laid his hand upon mine as if to feel the state of the skin and with a handkerchief that was near wiped away the moisture that bedewed my face he had been fitted for many nurse like offices by the unwearied attention he had exerted towards me in the paroxysm of my insanity having finished his task he withdrew from the bed and burst into tears his mother came up to him drew him to the furthest part of the room and in a low voice began the conversation do my dear boy go down stairs and get yourself something to eat you see your papa is quiet now i am afraid that will not last long and then he will be so restless and toss about so it is dreadful to see him i will watch charles and let you know indeed mamma i cannot eat now i will by and by you must try to eat charles or else you will make yourself quite ill if you were ill too it would be more than i could support i will not be ill mamma i assure you i will not but besides that i have no stomach i cannot bear to eat when there is hardly enough for my sisters eat boy do not trouble yourself about that we shall get more when that is gone god is good and will take care of us i know that god is good but for all that one must not expect to have every thing one wishes though god is good there are dreadful misfortunes in the world and i suppose we shall have our share of them come charles though you are but a boy you are the best boy in the world you are now almost my only comfort but you will not be able to comfort me if you do not take care of yourself dear mamma do you know mamma i heard that naughty man below stairs count up last night how much rent you owed him for and swear you should not stay any longer if you did not pay him if i were a little bigger i would talk to him so that he should not dare to insult us in our distress but not being big enough i opened the door and went into the room and begged him for gods sake not to add to your distress and though he is so ugly i took hold of his hand and kissed it but it felt like iron which put me in mind of his iron heart and i cried ready to burst with mortification he did not say hardly a word he must be paid charles he shall be paid do you know mamma as soon as i left him i went to the bishops gardens and spoke to the gardener i asked him if he had heard that my papa was ill and he said he had he said too he was very sorry and wanted to know what hand we made of it for want of the wages i told him we were sadly off and the man of the house had just been affronting me about his rent but said i cannot you give me something to do to weed or to rake i can dig a little too and scatter seed he asked if i knew weeds from flowers oh that i do said i well then said he there is not much you can do but you are a good boy and i will put you on the bishops list but now mamma i have not the heart to work till i see whether papa will get well again while poor charles told his artless tale marguerite wept over him and kissed him again and again she called him the best child in the world and said that if i were but so fortunate as to recover with such a husband and such a son she should yet be the happiest of women oh my poor father exclaimed charles ever since the great hail storm i have every hour loved him better than before i thought that was impossible but he is so gentle so kind so good humoured and so patient i loved him when he was harsh and when he was out of his mind but nothing so well then as i have done since people that are kind and smile always do one good but nobodys smiles are like my fathers it makes me cry with joy sometimes when i do but think of them pray papa added he coming up to the bedside and whispering yet with a hurried and passionate accent get well do but get well and we will be so happy never was there a family so happy or so loving as we will be while he spoke thus i endeavoured to put out my hand but i could not i endeavoured to smile but i was unable my heart was in a feeble yet soothing tranquillity the accents of love i had heard dwelt upon my memory they had talked of distress but the sentiment of love was uppermost in my recollection i was too weak of frame to suffer intellectual distress no accents but those which carried balm to my spirit seemed capable of resting upon my ear from this hour i regularly grew better and as i recovered seemed to feel more and more vividly how enviable it was to be the head of a loving and harmonious family my recovery however was exceedingly slow and it was several weeks before i had so far recruited my strength as to be capable of my ordinary occupations in the mean time the pecuniary difficulties to which we were exposed hourly increased and the cheerful but insignificant labours of charles could contribute little to the support of a family the melancholy nature of our situation might perhaps have been expected to prevent the restoration of my health at first however it had not that effect the debilitated state of my animal functions led me by a sort of irresistible instinct to reject ideas and reflections which i should then have been unable to endure i saw the anxiety and affection of my family and i was comforted i saw the smiles of marguerite and i seemed insensible to the languor the saddened cheerfulness they expressed i did not perceive that while i was provided with every thing necessary in my condition my family were in want of the very bread that should sustain existence my health in the mean time improved and my perceptions became proportionably clearer symptoms of desolation and famine though as much as possible covered from my sight obtruded themselves and were remarked one day in particular i observed various tokens of this nature in silence and with that sort of bewildered understanding which at once labours for comprehension and resists belief the day closed and what i had perceived pressed upon my mind and excluded sleep now for the first time i exerted myself to recollect in a methodical way the state of my affairs for the severity of my illness had at length succeeded to banish from me all ideas and feelings but what related to the sensations it produced and to the objects around me and it was not without effort that i could once more fully call to mind the scenes in which i had been engaged the truth then by regular degrees rose completely to view and i began to be astonished that my poor wife and children had been able in any manner to get through the horrible evils to which they must have been exposed this thought i revolved in my mind for near two hours and the longer i dwelt upon it the more perturbed and restless i grew at length it became impossible for me to hold my contemplations pent up in my own bosom i turned to marguerite and asked her whether she were asleep she answered in the negative she had been remarking my restlessness and tenderly enquired respecting its cause how long said i is it since i was taken with the fever a month to morrow replied she it was of the most malignant and distressing kind while it lasted and i did not expect you to live but it has left you a fortnight and i hope reginald you find yourself getting strong again and so we are here in constance and we have left switzerland three months my love i remember very well the letter we received from monsieur grimseld has any further intelligence reached us from that quarter none none no supply of any kind has reached you my dear reginald talk of something else you will soon i hope be well our children are all alive and the calamity that has not succeeded to separate us or to diminish our circle of love even by a single member we will learn to bear let us fix our attention on the better prospects that open before us stay marguerite i have other questions to ask before you require me to bear the calamities that have overtaken us let me understand what these calamities are while we waited for intelligence from switzerland we expended the whole sum that we brought with us and i was obliged to hire myself to the episcopal gardener for bread was it not so indeed reginald you are to blame pray question me no further this was our condition some time ago and now for a month past i have been incapable of labour marguerite what have you done indeed my love i have been too anxious for you to think much of any thing else we had still some things you know that we could contrive to do without and those i have sold charles too our excellent hearted son has lately hired himself to the gardener and has every night brought us home a little though it was but little dear boy what children what a wife have i brought to destruction our rent too surely you have not been able to pay that not entirely in part i have been obliged to pay it ah i well remember how flinty hearted a wretch has got the power over us in that respect he has not turned us out of doors he threatened hard several times at last i saw it was necessary to make an effort and the day before yesterday i paid him half his demand if i could have avoided that we might have had a supply of food a little longer i intreated earnestly for a little further indulgence but it was in vain it went against the pride and independence of my soul to sue to this man but it was for you and for my children remorseless wretch then every petty resource we had is gone indeed i do not know that we have any thing more to sell i searched narrowly yesterday but i will examine again to day the poor children must have something to support them and their fare has of late been dreadfully scanty their fare what have they eaten bread nothing else for the last fortnight and yourself oh reginald it was necessary you know that i should keep myself alive but i assure you i have robbed them as little as i could horror horror marguerite what is it you dream of i see my wife and children dying of hunger and you talk to me of hope and of prospects why has this detail of miseries been concealed from me why have i been suffered with accursed and unnatural appetite to feed on the vitals of all i love reginald even selfishness itself would have taught us that it is to your recovery that we look for our future support mock me not i adjure you with senseless words you talk idly of the future while the tremendous present bars all prospect to that future we are perishing by inches we have no provision for the coming day no no something desperate something yet unthought of must be attempted i will not sit inactive and see my offspring around me die in succession no by heaven though i am starving like ugolino i am not like ugolino shut up in a dungeon the world is open its scenes are wide the resources it offers are to the bold and despairing innumerable i am a father and will show myself worthy of the name reginald torture me not by language like this think what it is to be indeed a father and make yourself that be careful of yourself complete your recovery and leave the rest to me i have conducted it thus far nor am i yet without hope eight days ago i applied to the secretary of the palace representing your case as a retainer of the bishop disabled by sickness and with a family unprovided for till yesterday i got no answer to my memorial and then he informed me that you had been so short a time in employ that nothing could be done for you but to day i will throw myself at the feet of the bishop himself who arrived last night only from the other side of the lake every word that marguerite uttered went to my heart it was not long before the dawn of the day and the truths i had heard were further confirmed to me by the organ of sight the sentiments of this night produced a total revolution in me and i was no longer the feeble convalescent that the setting sun of the preceding day had left me the film was removed from my eyes and i surveyed not the objects around me with a glassy eye and unapprehensive observation all the powers i possessed were alert and in motion to my suspicious and hurried gaze the apartment appeared stripped of its moveables and left naked a mansion in which for despair to take up his abode my children approached me i seemed to read the wan and emaciated traces of death in their countenances this perhaps was in some degree the painting of my too conscious thoughts but there needed no exaggeration to awaken torture in my bosom when thus stimulated i observed for the first time the dreadful change that had taken place in marguerite her colour was gone her cheeks were sunk her eye had the quickness and discomposure expressive of debility i took hold of her hand and found it cold emaciated and white i pressed it to my lips with agony a tear unbidden fell from my eye and rested upon it having finished my examination i took my hat and was hastening to escape into the street marguerite noted my motions and anxiously interposed to prevent my design she laid her hand on my arm gently yet in a manner full of irresistible expostulation where would you go what have you purposed do not oh do not destroy a family to whom your life your sobriety and prudence are indispensable i took her hand within both mine compose yourself my love i have been your enemy too much already to be capable now so much as in thought of adding to my guilt i need an interval for musing and determination i will return in a very short time and you shall be the confidant of my thoughts with wild and impatient spirit i repassed in idea the whole history of my life but principally i dwelt in recollection upon the marquis de damville that generous friend that munificent benefactor whose confidence i had so ill repaid damville exclaimed i you trusted to me your daughter the dearest thing you knew on earth you believed that the wretch did not live who could be unjust to so rich a pledge look down look down o best of men from the heaven to which your virtues have raised you and see of how much baseness man yes the man you disdained not to call your friend is capable but no a sight like this might well convert the heaven you dwell in to hell you trusted her to me i have robbed her you enriched her mind with the noblest endowments i have buried them in the mire of the vilest condition all her generous her unwearied exertions are fruitless by my evil genius they are blasted i have made her a mother only that she might behold her children perishing with hunger they stretch out their hands to me for the smallest portion of that inheritance which i have squandered in more than demoniac vice this this is the fruit of my misdeeds i am now draining the last dregs of that mischief of which i have so wickedly so basely been the author as i returned i met marguerite who was come from her attempt upon the bishop he had received her paper and delivered it to his secretary that very secretary who had already disappointed all her expectations from that quarter she had attempted to speak to adjure the bishop whatever he did not to deliver her over to a man by whom her hopes had been so cruelly frustrated but the tumult of the scene drowned her voice and the hurry and confusion overpowered her efforts they however drew such a degree of attention on her that in the dissentions which religious broils at that time spread in constance she was suspected of pressing thus earnestly towards the person of the bishop with no good design and in fine was rudely thrust out of the palace she had not recovered from the agitation into which she had been thrown when i met her i eagerly enquired into the cause of her apparent distress but she shook her head mournfully and was silent i easily understood where she had been and the failure of her experiment all then said i is at an end now marguerite you must give up your experiments and leave to me the cure of evils of which i only am the author i will return this instant to the garden of the palace and resume the situation i formerly occupied for gods sake reginald what is it you mean you have just acquired strength to seek the benefit of air the least exertion fatigues you at this moment the little walk you have taken has covered you with perspiration you could not dig or stoop for a quarter of an hour without being utterly exhausted marguerite i will not sit down tamely and see my family expire in many cases it is reasonable to bid a valetudinarian take care of himself but our situation is beyond that i must do something extraordinary circumstances often bring along with them extraordinary strength no man knows till the experiment what he is capable of effecting i feel at this moment no debility and i doubt not that the despair of my mind will give redoubled energy to my efforts while i spoke thus i was conscious that i had little more than the strength of a new born child but i could not endure at such a time to remain in inactivity i felt as much ashamed of the debilitated state in which my fever had left me as i could have done of the most inglorious effeminacy and cowardice of soul i determined to relieve my family or perish in the attempt if all my efforts were vain i could not better finish my career than exhausted sinking expiring under a last exertion to discharge the duties of my station we returned into the house marguerite took from a closet the last remnant of provisions we had the purchase of poor charless labour of the preceding day there was a general contest who should escape from receiving any part in the distribution charles had withdrawn himself and was not to be found julia endeavoured to abscond but was stopped by louisa and her mother she had wept so much that inanition seemed more dangerous for her than perhaps for any other of the circle no one can conceive who has not felt it how affecting a contest of this kind must appear to me sensible as i was to the danger that their virtue and generous affection were the prelude only to their common destruction i said there was a general contest who should avoid all share in the distribution but i recollect that the little marguerite two years and a half old exclaimed at first i am so hungry mamma but watching as she carefully did every thing that passed she presently laid down her bread upon the table in silence and almost untouched and being asked why she did so she replied in a tone of speaking sensibility thank you i am not hungry now this scene made an impression on my mind never to be forgotten it blasted and corrupted all the pulses of my soul a little before i had reconciled myself to poverty i had even brought myself to regard it with cheerfulness but the sentiment was now reversed i could endure it i could steel myself against its attacks but never from this hour in the wildest paroxysms of enthusiasm has it been the topic of my exultation or my panegyric no change of circumstances no inundation of wealth has had the power to obliterate from my recollection what i then saw a family perishing with hunger all that is dearest to you in the world sinking under the most dreadful of all the scourges with which this sublunary scene is ever afflicted no help near no prospect but of still accumulating distress a death the slowest yet the most certain and the most agonising that can befall us no there is nothing that has power to rend all the strings of the heart like this from this moment the whole set of my feelings was changed avarice descended and took possession of my soul haunted as i perpetually was by images of the plague of famine nothing appeared to me so valuable as wealth nothing so desirable as to be placed at the utmost possible distance from want an appetite of this kind is insatiable no distance seems sufficiently great no obstacles mountains on mountains of gold appear an inadequate security to bar from us the approach of the monster we dread while i speak of the sentiments which in the sequel were generated in my mind by what i now saw i am suspending my narrative in a crisis at which a family interesting amiable and virtuous is reduced to the lowest state of humiliation and distress they are moments like these that harden the human heart and fill us with inextinguishable hatred and contempt for our species they tear off the trappings and decoration of polished society and show it in all its hideousness the wanton eye of pampered pride pleases itself with the spectacle of cities and palaces the stately column and the swelling arch it observes at hand the busy scene where all are occupied in the various pursuits of pleasure or industry and admires the concert the wide spreading confederacy by means of which each after his mode is unconsciously promoting the objects of others cheated by the outside of things we denominate this a vast combination for general benefit the poor and the famished man contemplates the scene with other thoughts unbribed to admire and applaud he sees in it a confederacy of hostility and general oppression he sees every man pursuing his selfish ends regardless of the wants of others he sees himself contemptuously driven from the circle where the rest of his fellow citizens are busily and profitably engaged he lives in the midst of a crowd without one friend to feel an interest in his welfare he lives in the midst of plenty from the participation of which he is driven by brutal menaces and violence no man who has not been placed in his situation can imagine the sensations with which overwhelmed as he is with domestic ruin and despair he beholds the riot the prodigality the idiot ostentation the senseless expense with which he is surrounded on every side what were we to do were we to beg along the streets were we to in treat for wretched offals at rich mens doors alas this it was to be feared even if we stooped to the miserable attempt instead of satisfying wants for ever new would only prolong in the bitterness of anguish the fate for which we were reserved an unexpected relief at this time presented itself while the scanty meal i have mentioned was yet unfinished a letter was presented me inclosing under its cover a bill of one hundred crowns the letter was from bernardin the faithful servant whom we found it necessary to dismiss three months before when we quitted our residence in switzerland it informed us that as soon as he had parted from us he had set out on his return to his native town next adjacent to my paternal residence that he found his father had died a short time before and that from the sale of his effects he had reaped an inheritance to triple the amount of the sum he had now forwarded to us he had heard by accident of the death of our friend in switzerland and the character of his successor and dreaded that the consequences might prove highly injurious to us he had still some business to settle with the surviving branches of his family but that would be over in a few weeks and then if we would allow him he would return to his dear master and afford us every assistance in his power the little property that had now fallen to him would prevent him from being a burthen and he would hire a spot of land and remain near us if we refused him the consolation of returning to his former employment what a reproach was it to me that descended from one of the most illustrious families in europe the heir of an ample patrimony and receiving a still larger fortune in marriage i should by the total neglect and profligate defiance of the duties incumbent on me have reduced myself so low as to be indebted to a peasant and a menial for the means of saving my family from instant destruction this was a deep and fatal wound to the pride of my soul there was however no alternative no possibility of rejecting the supply afforded us at so eventful a moment we determined to use it for the present and to repay it with the earliest opportunity and in the following week in spite of the remonstrances of marguerite the yet feeble state of my health and the penalties annexed to the proceeding i set off for the canton of soleure determined if possible to wrest the little staff of my family from the hand that so basely detained it i passed through zurich and a part of the canton of basle without obstacle these parts of switzerland had not suffered from the calamity which had occasioned our exile in proceeding further i found it necessary to assume a disguise and to avoid large towns and frequented roads i reached at length the well known scene in which i had so lately consumed twelve months of my life in which i first began to breathe to breathe not to be refreshed from ruin beggary and exile there was no pleasing recollection annexed to this spot it was a remembrancer of shame sorrow and remorse yet such is the power of objects once familiar revisited after absence that my eye ran over them with delight i felt lightened from the weariness of the journey and found that the recollection of pains past over and subdued was capable of being made a source of gratification the mountains among which i had wandered and consumed as it were the last dregs of my insanity surrounded me the path in which i was travelling led along one of their ridges i had performed this part of my journey by night and the first gleams of day now began to streak the horizon i looked towards the cottage the distant view of which had so often in moments of the deepest despair awakened in my heart the soothings of sympathy and affection i saw that as yet it remained in its forlorn condition and had undergone no repair while the lands around which had lately experienced the superintendence of marguerite had met with more attention and began to resume the marks of culture i sighed for the return of those days and that situation which while present to me had passed unheeded and unenjoyed i repaired to the house of my late protector now the residence of monsieur grimseld he was a meagre shrivelled figure and though scarcely arrived at the middle of human life exhibited all the marks of a premature old age i disclosed myself to him and began warmly to expostulate with him upon the profligacy of his conduct he changed colour and betrayed symptoms of confusion the moment i announced myself while i pressed him with the barbarity of his conduct the dreadful effects it had already produced and the incontestible justice of my claim he stammered and began to propose terms of accommodation during this conversation we were alone after some time however a servant entered the room and the countenance of the master assumed an expression of satisfaction and confidence he eagerly seized on the occasion which presented itself and instantly changing his tone called on his servant to assist him in securing a criminal against the state i at first resisted but grimseld perceiving this applied to his bell with great vehemence and three other servants made their appearance whose employment was in the field but who had now accidentally come into the house for refreshment i had arms but i found it impracticable to effect my escape and i soon felt that by yielding to the impulse of indignation and punishing grimseld on the spot for his perfidy i might ruin but could not forward the affair in which i was engaged i was conducted to prison and the thoughts produced in me by this sudden reverse were extremely melancholy and discouraging grimseld was a man of opulence and power i was without friends or the means of procuring friends the law expressly condemned my return and what had i not to fear from law when abetted and inforced by the hand of power i might be imprisoned for ten years i might be imprisoned for life i began earnestly to wish that i had remained with my family and given up at least all present hopes of redress it would be a dreadful accumulation of all my calamities if now at last i and my children were destined to suffer perhaps to perish in a state of separation and the last consolations of the wretched those of suffering sympathising and condoling with each other were denied us full of these tragical forebodings i threw myself at first on the floor of my cell in a state little short of the most absolute despair i exclaimed upon my adverse fortune which was never weary of persecuting me i apostrophised with tender and distracted accents my wife and children from whom i now seemed to be cut off by an everlasting divorce i called upon death to put an end to these tumults and emotions of the soul which were no longer to be borne in a short time however i recovered myself procured the implements of writing and drew up in the strong and impressive language of truth a memorial to the council of the state i was next to consider how this was to reach its destination for there was some danger that it might be intercepted by the vigilance and malignity of my adversary i desired to speak with the keeper of the prison he had some recollection of me and a still more distinct one of my family he concurred with the general sentiment in a strong aversion to the character of grimseld as i pressed upon him the hardship of my case and the fatal consequences with which it might be attended i could perceive that he fully entered into the feeling with which i wished him to be impressed he blamed my rashness in returning to switzerland in defiance of the positive prohibition that had been issued but promised at all events that my paper should be delivered to the president to morrow morning i remained three days without an answer and these days were to me an eternity i anticipated every kind of misfortune i believed that law and malice had succeeded to the subversion of equity at length however i was delivered from my apprehensions and perplexity and summoned to appear before the council it was well for me perhaps that i had to do with a government so simple and moderate as that of switzerland i obtained redress it was referred to an arbitration of neighbours to set a fair price on my property and then decreed that if monsieur grimseld refused the purchase the sum should be paid me out of the coffers of the state he was also condemned in a certain fine for the fraud he had attempted to commit the affair thus put in train was soon completed and i returned with joy having effected the object of my journey to my anxious and expecting family soon after we removed to the spot we had chosen on the eastern bank of the lake where we remained for the six following years in a state of peace and tranquillity chapter xi it was in the evening of a summers day in the latter end of the year fifteen hundred and forty four that a stranger arrived at my habitation he was feeble emaciated and pale his forehead full of wrinkles and his hair and beard as white as snow care was written in his face it was easy to perceive that he had suffered much from distress of mind yet his eye was still quick and lively with a strong expression of suspiciousness and anxiety his garb which externally consisted of nothing more than a robe of russet brown with a girdle of the same was coarse threadbare and ragged he supported his tottering steps with a staff and having lost his foreteeth his speech was indistinct and difficult to be comprehended his wretched appearance excited my compassion at the same time that i could easily discern beneath all its disadvantages that he was no common beggar or rustic ruined and squalid as he appeared i thought i could perceive traces in his countenance of what had formerly been daring enterprise profound meditation and generous humanity i saw that he was much fatigued and i invited him to rest himself upon the bench before the door i set before him bread and wine and he partook of both i asked him his name and his country he told me that he was a venetian and that his name as nearly as i could collect was signor francesco zampieri he seemed however averse to speaking and he requested me to suffer him to pass the night in my habitation there was nothing singular in the request a hospitality of this sort being the practice of the neighbourhood and humanity would have prompted my compliance if i had not been still more strongly urged by an undefinable curiosity that began to spring up in my bosom i prepared for him a camp bed in a summer house at the end of my garden as soon as it was ready he desired to be left alone that he might seek in rest some relief from the fatigue he had undergone he retired early and therefore soon after daybreak the next morning i waited on him to enquire how he had rested he led me out into the fields the morning was genial and exhilarating we proceeded till we came to a retired spot which had frequently been the scene of my solitary meditations and there seated ourselves upon a bank we had been mutually silent during the walk as soon as we were seated the stranger began you are i understand a frenchman and your name the count de st leon i bowed assent st leon said he there is something in your countenance and manner that prepossesses me in your favour the only thing i have left to do in the world is to die and what i seek at present is a friend who will take care that i shall be suffered to die in peace shall i trust you will you be that friend to me i was astonished at this way of commencing his confidence in me but i did not hesitate to promise that he should not find me deficient in any thing that became a man of humanity and honour you do not i think live alone you have a wife and children i have yet none of them were at home when i arrived last night you brought yourself to the summer house every thing that was necessary for my accommodation i did so but i have a wife to whom i have been married seventeen years and with whom i have no reserves i told her of your arrival i spoke of your appearance i mentioned your name it is no matter she has not seen me my name is not zampieri i am no venetian who are you then that you shall never know it makes no part of the confidence i design to repose in you my name shall be buried with me in the grave nor shall any one who has hitherto known me know how at what time or on what spot of earth i shall terminate my existence the cloud of oblivion shall shelter me from all human curiosity what i require of you is that you pledge your honour and the faith of a man that you will never reveal to your wife your children or any human being what you may hereafter know of me and that no particular that relates to my history shall be disclosed till at least one hundred years after my decease upon these conditions i am sorry that i must decline your confidence my wife is a part of myself for the last six years at least i have had no thought in which she has not participated and these have been the most tranquil and happy years of my life my heart was formed by nature for social ties habit has confirmed their propensity and i will not now consent to any thing that shall infringe on the happiness of my soul while i spoke i could perceive that my companion grew disturbed and angry at length turning towards me a look of ineffable contempt he replied feeble and effeminate mortal you are neither a knight nor a frenchman or rather having been both you have forgotten in inglorious obscurity every thing worthy of either was ever gallant action achieved by him who was incapable of separating himself from a woman was ever a great discovery prosecuted or an important benefit conferred upon the human race by him who was incapable of standing and thinking and feeling alone under the usurping and dishonoured name of virtue you have sunk into a slavery baser than that of the enchantress alcina in vain might honour worth and immortal renown proffer their favours to him who has made himself the basest of all sublunary things the puppet of a woman the plaything of her pleasure wasting an inglorious life in the gratification of her wishes and the performance of her commands i felt that i was not wholly unmoved at this expostulation the stranger touched upon the first and foremost passions of my soul passions the operation of which had long been suspended but which were by no means extinguished in my bosom he proceeded but it is well years have passed over my head in vain and i have not learnt to distinguish a man of honour from a slave this is only one additional sorrow to those in which my life has been spent i have wandered through every region of the earth and have found only disappointment i have entered the courts of princes i have accompanied the march of armies i have pined in the putridity of dungeons i have tasted every vicissitude of splendour and meanness five times have i been led to the scaffold and with difficulty escaped a public execution hated by mankind hunted from the face of the earth pursued by every atrocious calumny without a country without a roof without a friend the addition that can be made to such misfortunes scarcely deserves a thought while he spoke curiosity resistless curiosity presented itself as a new motive in aid of the sense of shame which the stranger had just before kindled in my bosom his manner was inconceivably impressive his voice though inarticulate from age had an irresistible melody and volume of sound which awed while it won the heart his front appeared open large and commanding and though he complained his complaints seemed to be those of conscious dignity and innocence he went on farewell st leon i go and you shall see me and hear of me no more you will repent when it is too late the folly of this days determination i appear mean and insignificant in your eyes you think my secrets beneath your curiosity and my benefits not worth your acceptance know that my benefits are such as kings would barter their thrones to purchase and that my wealth exceeds the wealth of empires you are degraded from the rank you once held among mankind your children are destined to live in the inglorious condition of peasants this day you might have redeemed all your misfortunes and raised yourself to a station more illustrious than that to which you were born farewell destiny has marked out you and yours for obscurity and oblivion and you do well to reject magnificence and distinction when they proffer themselves for your acceptance stop cried i mysterious stranger grant me a moments leisure to reflect and determine he had risen to depart with a gesture of resolution and contempt at my exclamation he paused and again turned himself towards me my soul was in tumults answer me most ambiguous and impenetrable of mortals what is thy story and what the secrets the disclosure of which is pregnant with consequences so extraordinary do you recollect the conditions upon which only the disclosure can be made what can i say shall i determine to part with that which for years has constituted the only consolation of my life shall i suppress the curiosity which now torments me and reject the boon you pretend to have the power to confer i grant you the interval for reflection you demand i refuse to place further confidence in you till you have maturely examined yourself and roused all the energies of your spirit to encounter the task you undertake one word more you know not indeed you know not what a woman you exclude from your confidence she is more worthy of it than i am referring to my own experience and knowledge of the world i can safely pronounce her the first of her sex perhaps the first of human beings indulge me in this include her in your confidence and i am content be silent i have made my determination do you make yours know i would not if i could and cannot if i would repose the secrets that press upon me in more than a single bosom it was upon this condition i received the communication upon this condition only can i impart it i am resolved to die is the election of my soul a consummation for which i impatiently wait having determined therefore to withdraw myself from the powers committed to me i am at liberty to impart them upon the same condition and no other you may one day if you desire it seek the relief of confidence having thus spoken the stranger rose from his seat it was yet early morning nor was it likely we should meet any one in our walk he however employed the precaution of causing me to explore the path and to see that we should return uninterrupted we came back to the summer house the window shutters were still closed the stranger determined they should remain so when i had come to him as soon as i rose i had found the door secured nor had he admitted me till he recognised my voice and had ascertained that i was alone these precautions scarcely excited my attention at the time but after the conversation that had just passed they returned distinctly to my memory the remainder of the day which had been opened by this extraordinary scene was passed by me in great anxiety i ruminated with unceasing wonder and perturbation upon the words of the stranger shall i shut upon myself the gate of knowledge and information is it not the part of a feeble and effeminate mind to refuse instruction because he is not at liberty to communicate that instruction to another to a wife the stranger professes to be able to raise me to the utmost height of wealth and distinction shall i refuse the gift which in a former instance i forfeited but for which though contemplated as at an impracticable distance my whole soul longs if there is any thing dishonourable connected with the participation of this wealth i shall still be at liberty to refuse it there can be no crime in hearing what this man has to communicate i shall still and always be master of myself nor can i have any thing personally to fear from a man so feeble so decrepit so emaciated yet what can be the gifts worthy of acceptance of a man who while he possesses them is tired of life and desires to die or what the wealth of him who bears about him every external symptom of poverty and desolation the conversation i had just held revived in my mind the true feeling of my present situation the wounds of my soul had been lulled into temporary insensibility but they were in a state in which the slightest accident was capable of making them bleed afresh and with all their former violence i had rather steeled my mind to endure what seemed unavoidable than reconciled myself to my fate the youthful passions of my soul which my early years had written there in characters so deep were by no means effaced i could not contemplate the splendour of rank with an impartial eye i could not think of the alternative of distinction or obscurity for my children with indifference but most of all the moment i had experienced for them of hunger and impending destruction by famine had produced an indelible impression it had destroyed all romance i had almost said all dignity in my mind for ever it had snapped as by the touch of a red hot iron all the finer and more etherialised sinews of my frame it had planted the sordid love of gold in my heart there by its baneful vegetation to poison every nobler and more salubrious feeling when i returned to the house marguerite enquired of me respecting the stranger but my answers were short and embarrassed she seemed to wonder that he did not come into the house and partake of some refreshment in the midst of my family she asked whether he were indisposed and whether he did not stand in need of some assistance that she might afford him perceiving however that i was desirous of saying as little as possible respecting him she presently became silent i could see that she was hurt at my incommunicativeness yet i could not prevail upon myself to enter into an explanation of the causes of my taciturnity ours was a family of love and i could observe that the children sympathised with their mother and secretly were surprised at and lamented my reserve there would have been little in this in perhaps any other family than ours but the last six years had been spent by us in such primeval simplicity that scarcely one of us had a thought but what was known to the rest marguerite cherished my frankness and unreserve with peculiar zeal she remembered with bitterness of soul the periods in which i fostered conceptions only proper to myself periods of dreadful calamity or of rooted melancholy and sadness she could not help regarding the silence into which for the present occasion i relapsed as a portent of evil augury charles who was now sixteen years of age recollected the period of our ruined fortunes when he had been alone with me at paris and partook of his mothers feelings a trifling circumstance at this time occasioned by the little marguerite now eight years of age rendered the restraint under which i laboured more memorable and striking she had left a little book of fairy tales in which she had been reading the day before in the summer house at first she did not recollect what was become of it and employed herself in searching for it with great assiduity of a sudden however she remembered where she had read in it last and exclaiming with exultation it is in the summer house sprang forward to fetch it i detained her and told her there was a sick gentleman there that she would disturb then dear julia rejoined she be so good as to get it for me you are so quiet and careful you never disturb any body my love answered i nobody must get it for you the gentleman chooses to be alone and will not let any body come to him you shall have it after dinner ah but papa i want it now i put it away just where the naughty giant had shut up the gentleman in the dungeon who came to take away the lady i was obliged to put it away then because mamma called me to go to bed but i want so to know what will become of them you cannot think well dear marguerite i am sorry you must wait but you must learn to have patience do you know papa i walked in the garden before breakfast and so not thinking of any thing i came to the summer house and i tried to open the door but i could not i found it was locked so i thought julia was there and i knocked and called julia but nobody answered so then i knew julia was not there for i was sure she would have opened the door so i climbed upon the stump of the pear tree and tried to look in at the window but the shutters were shut and i could not get to see over the top of them and i walked all round the summer house and all the shutters were shut papa i wish you would not let a man get into the summer house who shuts all the shutters and locks the door you always used to let me go into every room i liked and do you know i think none but bad people lock and bolt themselves up so it puts mind of the giants with their drawbridges and their pitfalls i shall be quite afraid of this frightful old man this prattle of the child was nothing yet it increased the embarrassment of my situation and made the peculiarity of the case more conspicuous finding her pertinacious in insisting upon a topic that was disagreeable to me her mother called her from me and put her upon some occupation that served to divert her attention i felt like a person that was guilty of some crime and this consideration and kindness of my wife when i seemed to myself to deserve her reproach had not the power to calm my uneasiness these little occurrences appeared like the beginning of a separation of interests and estrangement of hearts i tasked myself severely i summoned the whole force of my mind that i might strictly consider what it was in which i was about to engage if this slight and casual hint of a secret is felt by both marguerite and myself with so much uneasiness and embarrassment what will be our situation if i go on to accept the strangers confidence and become the depository of an arcanum so important as he represents his to be he declares himself able to bestow upon me the highest opulence what will be the feelings of my wife and children when they see my condition suddenly changed from its present humble appearance to splendour and wealth without being able to assign the source of this extraordinary accession it is difficult to conceive a family picture more enviable that than to which i was now continually present and of which i formed a part we had been happy on the banks of the garonne and we had pictured to ourselves a plan of happiness immediately on our arrival in the city of constance but these were little and imperfect compared with what i now enjoyed in the first situation my children were infants and in the second the eldest was but ten years of age the mother was now thirty five and she had lost in my eyes at least none of her personal attractions her intellectual accomplishments were much greater than ever her understanding was matured her judgment decided her experience more comprehensive as she had a greater compass of materials to work upon her fancy was more playful her conversation richer and her reflections more amusing and profound the matron character she had acquired had had no other effect on her feelings than to render them more deep more true and magnetical her disposition was more entirely affectionate than it had been even in the first year of our cohabitation her attachment to her children was exemplary and her vigilance uninterrupted and for myself she was accustomed in all that related to our mutual love to enter into my sentiments and inclinations with so just a tone of equality and kindness that we seemed to be two bodies animated by a single soul if the mother were improved the children were still more improved in their early years we are attached to our offspring merely because they are ours and in a way that has led superficial speculators to consider the attachment less as the necessary operation of a sensible and conscious mind than as a wise provision of nature for the perpetuation of the species but as they grow up the case is different our partiality is then confirmed or diminished by qualities visible to an impartial bystander as really as to ourselves they then cease to be merely the objects of our solicitude and become our companions the partners of our sentiments and the counsellors of our undertakings such at least was my case at the present period charles who was now sixteen was manly beyond his years while the native fire of his disposition was tempered by adversity by an humble situation and by the ardour of filial and fraternal affection julia who was two years younger became daily more interesting by the mildness of her disposition and the tenderness of her sensibility louisa was only twelve but as she was extremely notable and had an uncommonly quick and accurate spirit of imitation she rendered herself exceedingly useful to her mother marguerite the plaything and amusement of the family had as i have said just completed the eighth year of her age one exquisite source of gratification when it is not a source of uneasiness to speak from my own experience which a parent finds in the society of his children is their individuality they are not puppets moved with wires and to be played on at will almost from the hour of their birth they have a will of their own to be consulted and negotiated with we may say to them as adam to the general mother of mankind but now thou wert flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone and even now thou standest before me vested in the prerogatives of sentiment and reason a living being to be regarded with attention and deference to be courted not compelled susceptible of the various catalogue of human passions capable of resentment and gratitude of indignation and love of perverseness and submission it is because thou art thus formed that i love thee i cannot be interested about objects inanimate or brute i require a somewhat that shall exercise my judgment and awaken my moral feelings it is necessary to me to approve myself and be approved by another i rejoice to stand before you at once the defendant and the judge i rejoice in the restraint to which your independent character subjects me and it will be my pride to cultivate that independence in your mind i would negotiate for your affections and confidence and not be loved by you but in proportion as i shall have done something to deserve it i could not congratulate myself upon your correspondence to my wishes if it had not been in your power to withhold it while i indulge this vein of reflection i seem again to see my family as they surrounded me in the year fifteen hundred and forty four marguerite the partner of my life charles the brother of my cares the blooming julia the sage louisa and the playful cadette of the family how richly furnished how cheerful how heart reviving appeared to me the apartment in which they were assembled i dwell upon the image with fond affection and lingering delight where are they now how has all this happiness been maliciously undermined and irrevocably destroyed to look back on it it seems like the idle fabric of a dream i awake and find myself alone were there really such persons where are they dispersed whither are they gone oh miserable solitude and desertion to which i have so long been condemned i see nothing around me but speechless walls or human faces that say as little to my heart as the walls themselves how palsied is my soul how withered my affections but i will not anticipate chapter xii i carried food to the stranger as occasion required in the course of the day he seemed indisposed to speak and we exchanged scarcely more than two or three words the next morning was the implied time to which the question of his confidence was deferred and i went to him with the full resolution of refusing it whether it were that he discerned this resolution in my countenance or that in the interval that elapsed he had formed a meaner opinion of my character and thought me unfit for the purposes he intended i should answer certain it is that he anticipated me at the same time he magnified the importance of the gifts he had to communicate he expressed himself astonished at the precipitateness of his yesterdays conduct it was not till after much trial and long probation that he could choose himself a confidant i was not at present fit for the character nor perhaps ever should be the talent he possessed was one upon which the fate of nations and of the human species might be made to depend god had given it for the best and highest purposes and the vessel in which it was deposited must be purified from the alloy of human frailty it might be abused and applied to the most atrocious designs it might blind the understanding of the wisest and corrupt the integrity of the noblest it might overturn kingdoms and change the whole order of human society into anarchy and barbarism it might render its possessor the universal plague or the universal tyrant of mankind go st leon added the stranger you are not qualified for so important a trust you are not yet purged of imbecility and weakness though you have passed through much and had considerable experience you are yet a child i had heard your history and expected to find you a different man go and learn to know yourself for what you are frivolous and insignificant worthy to have been born a peasant and not fitted to adorn the rolls of chivalry or the rank to which you were destined there was something so impressive in the rebuke and contempt of this venerable sage that made it impossible to contend with them never was there a man more singular and in whom were united greater apparent contradictions observe him in a quiet and unanimated moment you might almost take him for a common beggar a poor miserable wretch in whom life lingered and insensate stupidity reigned but when his soul was touched in any of those points on which it was most alive he rose at once and appeared a giant his voice was the voice of thunder and rolling in a rich and sublime swell it arrested and stilled while it withered all the nerves of the soul his eye beam sat upon your countenance and seemed to look through you you wished to escape from its penetrating power but you had not the strength to move i began to feel as if it were some mysterious and superior being in human form and not a mortal with whom i was concerned what a strange and contradictory being is man i had gone to the summer house this morning with a firm resolution to refuse the gifts and the communication of the stranger i felt as if lightened from a burthen which the whole preceding day had oppressed me while i formed this resolution i was cheerful and conscious of rectitude and strength of mind how cheaply we prize a gift which we imagine to be already in our power with what philosophical indifference do we turn it on every side depreciate its worth magnify its disadvantages and then pique ourselves upon the sobriety and justice of the estimate we have made thus it was with me in the present transaction but when i had received the check of the stranger and saw the proposed benefit removed to a vast and uncertain distance then it resumed all its charms then the contrast of wealth and poverty flashed full upon my soul before i had questioned the reality of the strangers pretensions and considered whether he might not be an artful impostor but now all was clearness and certainty the advantages of wealth passed in full review before my roused imagination i saw horses palaces and their furniture i saw the splendour of exhibition and the trains of attendants objects which had been for ever dear to my puerile imagination i contemplated the honour love obedience troops of friends which are so apt to attend upon wealth when disbursed with a moderate degree of dignity and munificence when i compared this with my present poverty and desertion the meanness of our appearance our daily labours the danger that an untoward accident might sink us in the deepest distress and the hopelessness that my son or his posterity should ever rise to that honour and distinction to which they had once been destined the effect was too powerful another feeling came still further in aid of this it was the humiliating impression which the stranger had left upon my mind this seemed to be his great art if in reality his conduct is to be imputed to art there is no enemy to virtue so fatal as a sense of degradation self applause is our principal support in every liberal and elevated act of virtue if this ally can be turned against us if we can be made to ascribe baseness effeminacy want of spirit and adventure to our virtuous resolutions we shall then indeed feel ourselves shaken this was precisely my situation the figure i made in my own eyes was mean i was impatient of my degradation i believed that i had shown myself uxorious and effeminate at a time that must have roused in me the spirit of a man if there had been a spark of manly spirit latent in my breast this impatience co operated with the temptations of the stranger and made me anxious to possess what he offered to my acceptance i reasoned thus with myself what excites my scruples is simply the idea of having one single secret from my wife and family this scruple is created by the singular and unprecedented confidence in which we have been accustomed to live other men have their secrets nor do they find their domestic tranquillity broken by that circumstance the merchant does not call his wife into consultation upon his ventures the statesman does not unfold to her his policy and his projects the warrior does not take her advice upon the plan of his campaign the poet does not concert with her his flights and his episodes to other men the domestic scene is the relaxation of their cares when they enter it they dismiss the business of the day and call another cause i only have concentrated in it the whole of my existence by this means i have extinguished in myself the true energy of the human character a man can never be respectable in the eyes of the world or in his own except so far as he stands by himself and is truly independent he may have friends he may have domestic connections but he must not in these connections lose his individuality nothing truly great was ever achieved that was not executed or planned in solitary seclusion but if these reasons are sufficient to prove that the plan i have lately pursued is fundamentally wrong how much more will the importance of what is proposed by the stranger plead my excuse for deviating from it how bitterly have i lamented the degradation of my family shall i not seize this opportunity of re installing them in their hereditary honours i deemed the ruin i had brought upon them irreparable shall i not embrace the occasion of atoning for my fault no man despises wealth who fully understands the advantages it confers does it not confer the means of cultivating our powers does it not open to us the career of honour which is shut against the unknown and obscure does it not conciliate the prepossessions of mankind and gain for us an indulgent and liberal construction does it not inspire us with graceful confidence and animate us to generous adventure the poor man is denied every advantage of education and wears out his life in labour and ignorance from offices of trust from opportunities of distinction he is ignominiously thrust aside and though he should sacrifice his life for the public cause he dies unhonoured and unknown if by any accident he comes into possession of those qualities which when discerned and acknowledged command the applause of mankind who will listen to him his appearance is mean and the fastidious auditor turns from him ere half his words are uttered he has no equipage and attendants no one to blow the trumpet before him and proclaim his rank how can he propose any thing that shall be worthy of attention aware of the prepossession of mankind in this respect he is alarmed and overwhelmed with confusion before he opens his lips filled with the conscience of his worth he anticipates the unmerited contempt that is prepared to oppress him and his very heart dies within him add to these circumstances the constitution of our nature the various pleasures of which it is adapted to partake and how many of these pleasures it is in the power of wealth to procure yes an object like this will sufficiently apologise for me to those for whose sake alone it was estimable in my sight it is indeed nothing but our poverty and the lowness of our station that have thus produced in us an habitual and unreserved communication of sentiments wealth would to a certain degree destroy our contact and take off the wonder that we had each our thoughts that were not put into the common stock these considerations decided my choice i was not indeed without some variations of mind and some compunction of heart for the resolution i had espoused the longer the stranger remained with me the more evident it was that there was something mysterious between us and the unreserved affection and union that had lately reigned under my roof suffered materially the effects of it the stranger had been led to my cottage in the first instance by the entire solitude in which it was placed there was nothing about which he was so solicitous as concealment the most atrocious criminal could not be more alarmed at the idea of being discovered i was unable to account for this but i was now too anxious for his stay and the promised reward not to be alert in gratifying all his wishes the most inviolable secrecy therefore was enjoined to the whole family and the younger branches of it particularly the little marguerite it was necessary to keep almost immured to prevent the danger of their reporting any thing out of the house that might be displeasing to the stranger and fatal to my expectations upon the whole my situation was eminently an uneasy one no experiment can be more precarious than that of a half confidence and nothing but the sincere affection that was entertained for me could have rendered it successful in this instance my family felt that they were trusted by me only in points where it was impossible to avoid it and that i was not therefore properly entitled to their co operation i was conscious of ingratitude in making them no return for their fidelity they kept my secret because they were solicitous to oblige me not from any conviction that they were conferring on me a benefit but on the contrary suspecting that the object as to which they were blindly assisting me would prove injurious to me as well as to themselves the health of the stranger visibly declined but this was a circumstance which he evidently regarded with complacency it was the only source of consolation of which he appeared susceptible his mind was torn with painful remembrances and agitated with terrible forebodings he abhorred solitude and yet found no consolation in society i could not be much with him my duty to my family who were principally supported by my labour was a call too imperious to be neglected even when i was with him he commonly testified no desire for conversation stay with me he was accustomed to say give me as much of your time as you can but do not talk upon these occasions he would sit sometimes with his arms folded and with the most melancholy expression imaginable he would then knit his brows wring his hands with a sadness that might have excited pity in the hardest breast or with both hands closed the one clasping the other strike himself impatiently on the forehead at other times he would rise from his seat pace the room with hurried and unquiet steps and then again throw himself on his couch in the greatest agitation his features were often convulsed with agony often have i wiped away the sweat which would suddenly burst out in large drops on his forehead at those seasons he would continually mutter words to himself the sense of which it was impossible for me to collect i could perceive however that he often repeated the names of clara henry a wife a friend a friend and then he would groan as if his heart were bursting sometimes in the midst of these recollections he would pass the back of his hand over his eyes and then looking at it shaking his head and biting his under lip exclaim with a piteous accent dry dry all the moisture of my frame is perished then as if recovering himself he would cry with a startled and terrified voice who is there st leon come to me let me feel that there is a human being near me i often call for you but i find myself alone deserted friendless friendless at times when his recollection was more complete he would say i know i tire you why should i tire you what gratification can it be to me to occasion emotions of disgust upon these occasions i endeavoured to soothe him and assured him i found pleasure in administering to his relief but he replied no no do not flatter me it is long since i have heard the voice of flattery i never loved it no i know i am precluded from ever exciting friendship or sympathy why am i not dead why do i live a burthen to myself useful to none my secret i could almost resolve should die with me but you have earned and you shall receive it the stranger was not always in this state of extreme anguish nor always indisposed to converse he had lucid intervals and could beguile the sorrow of his heart with social communication we sometimes talked of various sciences and branches of learning he appeared to be well informed in them all his observations were ingenious his language copious his illustrations fanciful and picturesque his manner bold and penetrating it was easy to observe in him the marks of a vigorous and masculine genius sometimes we discussed the events at that time going on in the world when we discoursed of events that had passed and persons that had died more than a century before the stranger often spoke of them in a manner as if he had been an eye witness and directly acquainted with the objects of our discourse this i ascribed to the vividness of his conceptions and the animation of his language he however often checked himself in this peculiarity and always carefully avoided what could lead to any thing personal to himself i described to him the scenes of my youth and related my subsequent history he on his part was invincibly silent on every circumstance of his country his family and his adventures the longer i was acquainted with him the more my curiosity grew i was restless and impatient to learn something respecting a man who thus wrapped himself up in mystery and reserve often i threw out as it were a line by which to fathom his secret i talked of various countries i mentioned different kinds of calamities and even of crimes that by some incidental allusion i might discover at unawares his country his connections or the nature of his story when any thing that offered seemed to lead to the desired point i doubled my questions and endeavoured to construct them with the skill of a crafty litigant in a court of justice there were some subjects the very mention of which gave him uneasiness and upon which he immediately silenced me but these were not of themselves enough to afford me a clue or to furnish materials out of which for me to construct the history of the stranger he did not always perceive the drift of my questions and snares but when he did he generally became loud resentful and furious there was nothing else that so completely roused his indignation st leon said he to me one day silence this inquisitive temper of yours check your rash and rude curiosity the only secret i have that can be of any importance to you you shall one day know but my country my family my adventures i have once told you and i tell you again you shall never know that knowledge can be of moment to no one and it shall never be disclosed when this heart ceases to beat that tale shall cease to have a place on the face of the earth why should my distresses and disgraces be published to any one is it not enough that they have lacerated my bosom that they have deprived me of friends that they have visited me with every adversity and every anguish that they have bowed me down to the earth that they have made thought and remembrance and life itself a burthen too heavy to be borne your present injudicious conduct if persisted in will have the effect of driving me from your roof of turning me once more upon the world upon that world that i hate upon that world whose bruises and ill treatment i feel in every fibre of my frame of exposing me again to fresh persecutions and causing me to perish miserably in a dungeon or die upon a scaffold spare me my generous host i know you are capable of generosity indeed i have endured enough to satiate the rage of malice itself you see what i suffer from the rage and tempest of my own thoughts even without the assistance of any external foe let me die in that degree of tranquillity i am able to attain i will not trouble you long at another time he addressed me in a different style you see st leon that the anguish of mind i endure is such as is ordinarily attributed to the recollection of great crimes and you have very probably conjectured that in my case it arises from the same source if you have i forgive you but i assure you that you are mistaken take from yourself that uneasiness if it has ever visited you you are not giving sanctuary to a villain i am innocent i can take no crime to my charge i have suffered more almost than man ever suffered but i have sinned little the cause of my uneasiness and prime source of all my misfortunes i dare not disclose to you be contented with the plan of my conduct i have digested my purpose i have determined where to speak and where to be silent the more i saw of this man the more strange and unaccountable appeared to me every thing that related to him why was he so poor possessing as he pretended inexhaustible wealth why was he unhappy with so great talents and genius and such various information why was he friendless being as he solemnly assured me so perfectly innocent and of consequence so respectable that he was an impostor every thing that i saw of him forbade me to believe his sorrows were too profound and excruciating for it to be possible for me to rank them among the actions that a man may play the greatness of his powers the dignity of his carriage the irresistible appearance of sincerity that sparkled in his eye and modulated his voice fully convinced me that he really was what he pretended to be i had heard of men who under the pretence of alchemy fastened themselves upon persons possessing sums of money and beguiling them with a delusive expectation of wealth reduced them to beggary and ruin one such person i had had a brief connection with during my residence in the bordelois though finding the incident by no means essential to the progress of my history i have passed it over together with many others in silence but nothing could be more unlike than that man and the person respecting whom i was now concerned in reality i possessed at that time if i may be allowed to say so a more than common insight into the characters of mankind so as to be little likely except under the tyranny of passion as in the instance of gaming to be made the prey of imposition i had studied my species as it exhibits itself in history and had mixed with it in various scenes and under dissimilar aspects i had accordingly in the transaction i have just alluded to soon detected the plans of the villain who expected to delude me but what could be the purpose of the stranger in this respect the pretended alchemist in france had obtained a certain sum of money of me and demanded more the stranger never made such a demand of me and perfectly knew that even if i had been inclined i was not able to supply him the alchemist had amused me with descriptions of various processes for the transmutation of metals had exhibited his crucibles and retorts and employed a sort of dramatic coup dil for the purpose of awakening my curiosity and stimulating my passions the stranger had simply stated in the plainest and most direct manner that it was in his power to enrich me but had been silent as to the manner of producing the wealth he promised and had abstained from every effort to intoxicate my mind i felt therefore in this instance the effect that without being able to solve the difficulties and contrarieties that hung about him i yet believed his assertions nor was the inscrutability of his history and his motives capable of shaking my confidence one day during the period of his concealment certain officers of the bishop of constance accompanied by a foreigner in a neapolitan habit came to my house and as it proved with the express purpose of searching for the man who had put himself under my protection charles and myself were at work in the fields within sight of the lake their appearance first caught the attention of charles as they approached the shore and he enquired of me respecting the habit of the foreigner which was different from any he had been accustomed to see while we were yet speaking i observed in them an intention to land within sight of my cottage this was an uncommon circumstance our privacy was rarely invaded and we lived almost as much out of the world as we should have done in the remotest island of the atlantic ocean i reasoned in my own mind upon their appearance they had little resemblance to a party of pleasure the habit of the officers of justice i was perfectly acquainted with and the suspicion of the real nature of their errand immediately darted on my thoughts without saying a word to charles on the subject i hastened with all the speed i could exert to the apartment of the stranger and acquainted him with what i had seen he concurred with me in the ideas i had formed and appeared much shocked at the intelligence there was however no time to be lost and after having for a moment given vent to an anguish which was too powerful to be suppressed he withdrew as hastily as he could from the summer house and betook himself to the woods he recommended to me to leave him telling me that he could conceal himself most effectually alone and observing that it would be necessary for me to meet the officers and endeavour as much as possible to remove their suspicions accordingly as soon as he was gone i threw open the windows of the summer house removed the shutters and took from it as effectually as i could all appearance of having served as a place of concealment this was a precaution which the stranger had on a former occasion recommended to me it fortunately happened that julia and the little marguerite were gone out together in the fields on the eastern side of my cottage otherwise infallibly the child by her innocent prattle and perhaps julia by the apprehensive sensibility of her temper would have betrayed our secret or at least have suggested to the officers a feeling as if by a longer stay and a more diligent search they might possibly succeed in the object of their expedition as it was i received them at the door and learned from their own mouths the nature of their errand of charles whom they had crossed in the fields they had simply asked whether they were right as to the name of the person who was proprietor of the cottage before them they described to me with great accuracy the appearance of the stranger and insisted that he had been an inhabitant of my cottage they told me they were well informed that the summer house in my garden had carefully been shut up for more than a month past and that some person had been concealed there i was interested in the distress of the stranger i was impressed with the dignity of his character i implicitly confided in his assertions of innocence and the unjust persecution that he suffered i was not insensible to the proposed reward the realising of which probably depended on his safety but most of all i considered my honour as pledged for the protection of the man who had thus cast himself upon my fidelity and believed that i should be everlastingly disgraced if he suffered any evil through treachery or neglect on my part i therefore answered confidently to the officers that they were misinformed and offered to conduct them over every part of my house and demesnes that they might satisfy themselves by inspection that there was no person concealed any where within my possessions i should have been better pleased openly to have defied their interrogatories and to have asked them whether allowing their suspicions to be just they were entitled to believe that i was such a villain as to betray a man who had thrown himself upon my generosity but though this conduct would have had a greater appearance of gallantry i believed it would have less of the reality as it would have strengthened their idea of my participation and increased the danger of the person i was bound to protect they accepted my offer of submitting to their search and made a strict examination of every place about my habitation in which the stranger could be concealed disappointed here they endeavoured by threats to discover whether i was able to give them any information to these i calmly answered that they had mistaken my character that though i was a poor man i had not forgotten that i was noble that they were already in possession of my spontaneous answer to their enquiries and that in no case and upon no supposition should tyranny and ill treatment extort from me what i was not in the first instance disposed to give my wife was present during this conversation and i could perceive felt an alarm for my danger that she would have been incapable of feeling for a danger to herself though i was extremely anxious that these men should be disappointed in the object of their expedition yet i did not neglect this opportunity of endeavouring to obtain satisfaction for my own curiosity i remarked at first that the neapolitan was an inquisitor and this circumstance had given additional poignancy to the uneasiness of marguerite but the accusations of which the inquisition at this time took cognisance were so numerous the ecclesiastical power continually usurping upon the civil that i was little assisted in the judgment i was desirous to frame by any inference to be deduced from this circumstance i questioned directly with an air as if it were merely in the way of conversation what was the crime of the man of whom they were in pursuit and what was the cause forcible enough to induce a neapolitan inquisitor to follow so decrepit and forlorn an individual as he described beyond the alps and almost to the banks of the danube to this he answered roughly that though he was not able to discover the object of his search he was by no means convinced that i was not his abettor and accomplice and that as to his crime that was not to be named the welfare of christendom demanding that the criminal and the memory of his offences should be buried together at the same time he warned me to consider well what i did before i exposed myself to be overwhelmed by the vengeance of the court of which he was a member to this i answered haughtily that i had already condescended to repel his suspicion and that no other man than an inquisitor would have had the stupidity or the audaciousness to question my veracity i added that i was perfectly acquainted with the nature of his court which was an object of abhorrence to the whole christian world but that he was mistaken if he supposed that the detestable nature of its proceedings would enable him to practise every sort of outrage with impunity the officers withdrew into the little inclosure in front of my cottage and i overheard them consulting whether having failed in their principal object they should carry me a prisoner along with them the firmness of my manner however had awed them and the fearlessness i expressed seemed to them to arise from a consciousness of innocence they at length departed as they came i watched them from my cottage as they descended to the shore and it was with no little pleasure that i perceived them re embark and stand off for the opposite side of the lake this spectacle for a time entirely engaged me and when i turned from the door i observed that my beloved marguerite had been in tears she endeavoured to hide this circumstance from my sight i took her affectionately by the hand and pressing her to my bosom entreated her not to make herself uneasy ah reginald said she how can i avoid being uneasy when i see you exposed to this imminent danger i thought that in forfeiting our fortune and our rank and retiring to this obscure and sequestered situation we might at least promise ourselves the blessing of the poor oblivion and security and that should have consoled me for all i have lost who is this man that is thus mysteriously hidden among us what is the guilt from the punishment of which he thus anxiously withdraws himself what can be the nature of your connection with such a man and what will be the issue of so perilous an adventure i hesitated i knew not what to answer to so earnest an anxiety i was melted at the distress and the affection of marguerite she saw my embarrassment and proceeded mistake me not my beloved said she i have no desire to pry into what you are willing to conceal forgive the perturbation which has poured itself out in these involuntary questions i repose an entire confidence in you i would sooner die than interfere with any object you have at heart go on according to the dictates of your own judgment undisturbed by me i will not doubt that you have sufficient reasons for what you communicate and what you suppress i am grieved indeed at the interruption of our obscure and unambitious tranquillity but i had resolved not to trouble you with my uneasiness and apprehensions the incident of this morning has extorted them from me but i will behave better in future this scene was extremely distressing to me my wife was oppressed with fears and i had nothing to answer her the consolations that rose up in my own mind i was prevented from communicating the more generously she confided in me the more i felt the ungracious and disagreeable nature of the concealment i practised i endeavoured however to encourage myself with the idea that the labour would not be long and the harvest would prove abundant i said in my own mind the worst is now over the business has been commenced the shock to my own family has actually occurred i must go on resolutely and shut my eyes to the temporarily displeasing circumstances that may be connected with the completing my object chapter xiii another source of uneasiness was added to the distraction my mind already endured the stranger did not appear it was in the morning that the officers of justice arrived they departed about noon and in two hours afterwards i entered the wood in search of my guest the wood was of some leagues in extent it was intersected by paths in various directions it was interspersed with caverns its growth was of all kinds in some places lofty trees that seemed to form a support for the clouds in others an underwood impenetrable alike to the feet and to the eye as i entered the wood i however conceived that the discovery of the stranger to me who was acquainted with its lurking places would be an affair of little toil his feebleness and decrepitude would not suffer him to proceed to any great distance in this i was mistaken i looked carefully on all sides i examined every recess and corner with which i was acquainted but i found no trace of the stranger the scene was so complicated and involved that even this was a labour of considerable duration at length i became satisfied that he was not in the nearer division of the wood i paused i felt at once that it was little less than a herculean task to hunt through the whole of its dimensions it would probably be of little use to call and endeavour by that means to discover his retreat i knew of no name by which he was to be recognised and if my own voice was but a slight resource to penetrate this immense labyrinth of foliage the voice of the stranger weakened by age and now probably still more enfeebled by hunger and fatigue could not be expected to make itself heard beside which as i knew not what the source of information had been to the officers who had just left me i was unwilling to expose my guest to the danger that might arise from this mode of seeking him i could not even be sure though i had seen their boat stand off from the shore that they might not afterwards land one or more of their party and be at this very moment within ear shot of me i therefore proceeded in anxiety and silence my search was no more successful in the part of the wood with which i was little acquainted than in the part with which i was most familiar i had already been engaged four hours in the task and night began to come on it shut in with heavy clouds that on all sides appeared deeply loaded with rain i now began to consider my own situation and by comparing circumstances found that i was at a great distance from my own habitation there was no direct path by which for me to return i had proceeded to the right and the left backward and forward sometimes by more open paths and sometimes forcing my way through briars and brushwood as caprice or the hope of effecting the object of my search happened to guide me it was therefore no easy matter to guess how i was to return or even now that the lowering clouds had covered the horizon with one uniform tint in which direction lay the cottage or the lake while i stood contemplating what was to be done i heard the howling of the wolves at a distance and their howl had that particular melancholy and discomfiting sound which is well known to precede a coming storm there was no time to be lost and accordingly i set out i was less anxious to be at home on my own account than for the sake of quieting the alarms of my family to whom i had already occasioned too great a portion of uneasiness i had not proceeded far before the rain descended in torrents intermingled with peals of thunder and sheets of lightning the thunder interrupted as it were from time to time with the noise of the wild beasts that inhabited the wood deafened me while the excessive and instantaneous brilliancy of the lightning occasioned me an intolerable aching in the organ of sight it rained incessantly for two hours and i found myself drenched and fatigued with the wet during this time my progress was small and i was ever and anon intercepted by the underwood and could not without repeated experiments discover the means of proceeding at length the rain subsided and seemed to give place to a gloomy and motionless calm soon after i discovered a light at a distance and advanced towards it as i approached i perceived that it proceeded from a set of banditti to the amount of fourteen or fifteen persons sitting round a fire in the mouth of a cavern i was glad to turn my steps another way and was for some time afraid that the noise i made in occasionally forcing my way through the bushes would alarm them and cost me my life i however fortunately escaped their notice this was in a part of the wood remote from the path i ought to have taken and near the road to lindau the day began to dawn before i reached my own habitation the conjecture i had made when i was unawares upon the point of falling into the hands of the banditti that the road of lindau was on the other side of their retreat was of some service to me as an indication where to find the cottage and the lake this road skirted the wood on the side nearly opposite to that by which i entered it the difficulties however i had to encounter were inconceivably great in endeavouring to preserve my line of direction after having been compelled four or five times to deviate from the line it is seldom that a traveller will find himself right in his conjecture as to the direction he is pursuing unless he has some sensible object as a sort of pole star by which to govern his route it happened in this instance that i was more fortunate than i was entitled to expect i laboured indeed till daybreak without getting out of the labyrinth that inclosed me but the sun no sooner began to lend an imperfect light than i recognised certain objects which upon some former occasions i had observed and perceived that my journey was nearly at an end i entered my cottage and found marguerite alone awake and expecting me she had been somewhat uneasy on account of my absence both from the extreme tempestuousness of the night and in consequence of the painful sensations the events of the preceding morning had introduced events with which it was almost unavoidable for her to imagine that my absence was in some way connected the period of my insanity in switzerland might indeed have accustomed her to the irregularity of my motions but a term of more than six years which had intervened had produced in her expectations and habits of a different sort i related to this admirable woman the adventures of the night and the fruitlessness of the search in which i had been engaged and this openness of communication unresembling the nature of the intercourse which had lately existed between us relieved in some degree my burthened heart and cheered the drooping spirits of marguerite she dropped some consolatory and sadly pleasing tears and her manner seemed to say though she would not suffer her tongue to give the idea words how sweet are cordiality and confidence oh do not let our situation which has deprived us of many other comforts ever again be robbed of this comfort which is alone worth all the rest though she necessarily felt the presence of the stranger as an evil the bane of our domestic peace yet it was impossible for her not to compassionate his fate and suffer some distress from his strange and abrupt disappearance after the conversation which had so eminently served as a relief to our minds marguerite left me to repose myself from the extraordinary fatigue i had undergone but my mind was too much disturbed to suffer me to sink into the arms of forgetfulness i felt something tragical in the sad destiny of my unfortunate guest it was but too probable that in his peculiarly weak state of body and with his declining health the being thus exposed for a day and a night to the effects of hunger of the inclemency of the air and the tempestuousness of the elements would put a close to his existence i was determined soon to recommence my search but how could i be sure that i should be more fortunate to day than the day before if i found him it was most likely i should find him either dead or dying the degree of intercourse that had taken place between us had made him occupy a considerable space in my thoughts the prospects he had opened to me the conduct he had induced me to adopt the painful effects and dissatisfaction of mind which had been produced by that conduct as it respected my family all combined to give me an interest in his fate i had seen his talents i had felt his ascendancy i had experienced that sort of conflict which appearances of guilt on the one hand and asseverations of innocence on the other are calculated to produce in the thoughts and emotions of a bystander he was no common man the expectations and conjectures he excited were of no ordinary sort and i felt that an army might be destroyed and a spacious plain covered with the wounded and the dying without producing greater commotion in my soul in the anxious and disturbed state of mind in which i was the thoughts flow with extraordinary rapidity it will be found attended with a strange and previously to the experiment incredible mixture of reasoning and passion of philosophising and fury i was accordingly conscious at this moment of the truth of the strangers assertion that in me he had a protector not a friend friendship is an object of a peculiar sort the smallest reserve is deadly to it i may indeed feel the emotions of a friend towards a man who in part conceals from me the thoughts of his heart but then i must be unconscious of this concealment the instant i perceive this limitation of confidence he drops into the class of ordinary men a divorce is effected between us our hearts which grew together suffer amputation the arteries are closed the blood is no longer mutually transfused and confounded i shall be conscious of all his qualities for i stand in the place of an impartial umpire i consider him as a machine capable of so much utility to myself and so much utility to other men but i do not regard him as the brother of my soul i do not feel that my life is bound up in his i do not feel as if were he to die the whole world would be at an end to me and that my happiness would be buried with him for ever in the darkness of the grave i am not conscious of those emotions which are the most exquisite and indescribable the human mind can experience and which being communicated by a sort of electrical stroke to him who is their object constitute the solace of all his cares the alleviator of all his calamities the only nectar and truest balm of human life for me he stands alone in the world having companions and associates the connections as it were of mercantile selfishness or casual jollity and good humour but no friend it was thus that i thought of the stranger he obtained from me the compassion due to a human being and the respect extorted by his qualities but nothing calculated radically to disturb the equilibrium of the mind i looked forward to his death with unruffled thoughts and an unmoistened eye there was one thing indeed that shook me more deeply the thought of losing the promised reward and of having exposed myself to the evil of an unquiet and dissatisfied mind in vain i rested but a few hours before i set out again upon the search to which the interposition of the darkness of the preceding night had put an abrupt close i had the precaution to take with me a slight provision of food and cordials believing that if i found the stranger he would at least be in the greatest need of something reviving and restorative charles earnestly intreated to assist me in the search but upon this i put a peremptory prohibition it would have been in direct contradiction to what the stranger had most solemnly required of me i had already spent several hours in anxiously tracing the wood in every direction and the period of noon was past when approaching an obscure and almost impenetrable thicket my ear was caught by a low and melancholy sound which at first i knew not to what i was to ascribe it however arrested my attention and caused me to assume an attitude of listening after the lapse of little more than a minute the same sound was repeated i now distinctly perceived that it was the groan of some creature in a very feeble and exhausted state and immediately suspected that it was the stranger i went almost round the thicket before i could discern an entrance and though i looked with the utmost care could perceive nothing that the thicket inclosed the groan was repeated a third time the long intervals between the groans gave a peculiar melancholy to the effect and each seemed so much lower than the groan before that nothing but the ear of anxious attention would have caught it at the same time that the tone conveyed an idea of stupified yet vital anguish at length i perceived the legs and something of the garb of a man it was the stranger he appeared to have crept into the thicket upon his hands and knees when i forced my way to him he seemed in the very act of expiring he was lying on his face and i raised him a little his eyes were fixed his mouth was open his lips and tongue were parched and dry i infused a few drops of a cordial into his mouth for a moment it appeared to produce no sensation but presently my patient uttered a deep and long drawn sigh i repeated my application as a principal cause of the condition in which i found him was inanition the stimulant i administered produced a powerful effect he moved his hands shuddered turned his eyes languidly upon me and having appeared to recognise me shut them hastily again i moved him slowly and softly into a freer air and bathed his temples with one of the liquids i had about me by this time he looked up and then suddenly round him with a wild and hurried air he spoke not however he was speechless in about a quarter of an hour he relapsed into convulsions in which it seemed probable he would expire they lasted a considerable time and he then sunk into a state of insensibility i thought he was dead thus circumstanced it was some relief to my humanity to have found him yet alive and to have received his parting breath but in a moment his secret and his promises recurred to me with inexpressible anguish and i inwardly reproached him for having deferred his communication so long as now to preclude its ever being made i cannot describe the keenness the burning and intolerable bitterness of my sensation keen it may well be supposed to have been from its having so instantaneously and forcibly recurred at a time when other objects seemed to press upon my senses no one who has not felt what it is to fall in a moment from hope or as i should rather say from assured possession of what his soul most loved and desired into black and interminable despair can imagine what was then the state of my mind the body of my patient slided from my nerveless arms i lifted up the eyes of rage and phrensy as if to curse the author of my being and then fell helpless and immoveable by the side of the stranger i felt him move i heard him sigh i lifted up my head and perceived stronger marks of life and sense about him than had yet displayed themselves i threw my arms about him i pressed him to my heart the emphatical gesture i used seemed to have a sort of magnetical force to rouse his dying powers with a little assistance from me he sat upright my assiduity produced wonders it fortunately happened that this thicket was but a half a mile from my habitation and indeed was one of the spots which i had searched without success the day before about the hour of sunset partly by leading and partly by supporting him i restored my guest to his former apartment he remained speechless or nearly so he vented his sensations in sighs in inward and inarticulate sounds and even when he arrived at the power of making himself understood by words it was only by monosyllables and half sentences that he conveyed to me his meaning i now gave up my time almost entirely to an assiduous attendance on the stranger every day i expected to be his last every day was more or less interspersed with symptoms that seemed to menace his instant dissolution during all this time i remained in the anxious suspense of contending hope and fear was it probable that he would ever recover strength enough to confer on me the legacy he had announced the particulars of his secret i knew not but judging from what i had heard of the pretences and pursuits of alchemy it was natural to suppose that he had a process to communicate which would require on his part considerable accuracy of recollection as well as the power of delivering himself in a methodical and orderly discourse i was fortunate enough however to perceive after a tormenting and tedious crisis that he appeared to be in a progress of convalescence and that his strength both of body and mind were recruited daily after the lapse of a fortnight from the adventure of the wood he one evening addressed me in the following manner st leon i have been to blame i have put you to a sufficient trial i have received from you every assistance and kindness that my situation demanded i have imposed on you much trouble and anxiety i have excited your expectations by announcing to you in part what it was in my power to bestow and i have finally risked the defrauding your hopes and your humanity of their just reward do me the justice however to remember that i had no presentiment of the event which has so inauspiciously come between you and your hopes fool that i was i imagined i had suffered enough and that as i had obtained a longer respite from external persecution than i almost ever experienced i should be permitted to spend the short remainder of my days uninterrupted i now however look back upon this last assault with complacency it has cut off something from the last remnant of a life to the close of which i look forward with inexpressible longing at the same time that i am still in prospect of obtaining the final wish of my heart the stealing out of the world unperceived and thus in some measure eluding the last malice of my enemies after my death i have but one injunction to leave with you the injunction of hercules to philoctetes that no inducement may move you to betray to mortal man the place in which you shall have deposited my ashes bury them in a spot which i will describe to you it is not far and is only recommended to me by its almost inaccessible situation and that once done speak of me and if possible think of me no more never on any account mention me or allude to me never describe me or relate the manner of our meeting or the adventure which has at length brought on the desired close of my existence believe me in the feeble and helpless condition in which i have spent the last fortnight your wishes and expectations have been uppermost in my mind and there is nothing i have felt with so much compunction as the danger of leaving them unsatisfied to you perhaps i at present appear to be rapidly recovering i feel the dart of death in my vitals i know i shall not live four days it is necessary therefore that i should finish without delay all that remains for me to finish i will devote this night to the arranging my thoughts and putting in order what i have to communicate that no mistake or omission may have part in a transaction so important come to me to morrow morning i will be prepared for you as soon as i heard this discourse and provided the stranger with every thing he could want during the night i withdrew my heart was big with expectation my thoughts all night were wild and tumultuous when the hour of assignation arrived i hastened along the garden to the summer house conscious that upon that hour depended all the colour of my future life since the stranger had been in his present dangerous condition the door was not bolted it was only locked the key was in my possession and remained night and day attached to my person i opened the door i panted and was breathless i immediately saw that the stranger had undergone some great alteration for the worse he had suffered a sort of paralytic affection he lifted up his face as i entered it was paler than i had ever seen it he shook his head mournfully and intimated by signs the disappointment which this morning must witness he was speechless fate fate exclaimed i in an agony of despair am i to be for ever baffled is the prize so much longed for and so ardently expected at last to escape me it is not to be imagined how much these successive endless disappointments increased my impatience and magnified in my eyes the donation i sought the whole of this and the following day the stranger remained speechless the third day in the morning he murmured many sounds but in a manner so excessively inarticulate that i was not able to understand one word in six that he said i recollected his prediction that he should die on the fourth day the fever of my soul was at its height mortal sinews and fibres could sustain no more if the stranger had died thus it is most probable that i should have thrown myself in anguish and rage upon his corpse and have expired in the same hour in the evening of the third day i visited him again he had thrown his robe around him and was sitting on the side of his couch the evening sun shot his last beams over the window shutters there were about eight inches between the shutter and the top of the window and some branches of vines with their grapes already ripe broke the uniformity of the light the side of the couch faced the west and the beams played upon the old mans countenance i had never seen it so serene the light already softened by the decline of day gave it a peculiar animation and a smile that seemed to betoken renovation and the youth of angels sat upon it he beckoned me to approach i placed myself beside him on the couch he took my hand in his and leaned his face towards me i shall never witness the light of the setting sun again were the first words he uttered i immediately perceived that he spoke more collectedly and with better articulation than at any time since the paralytic stroke still however it was no easy matter to develop his words but i wound up every faculty of my frame to catch them and assisted as i was by the habit of listening to his speech for many weeks which during the whole of that time had never been distinct i was successful enough to make out his entire discourse it continued though with various interruptions for more than half an hour he explained with wonderful accuracy the whole of his secrets and the process with which they were connected my soul was roused to the utmost stretch of attention and astonishment his secrets as i have already announced in the commencement of this history consisted of two principal particulars the art of multiplying gold and the power of living for ever the detail of these secrets i omit into that i am forbidden to enter my design in writing this narrative i have said is not to teach the art of which i am in possession but to describe the adventures it produced to me the more i listened the more my astonishment grew i looked at the old man before me i observed the wretchedness of his appearance the meanness of his attire his apparent old age his extreme feebleness the characters of approaching death that were written on his countenance after what i had just heard i surveyed these things with a sensation of novelty as if i had never remarked them in him before i said to myself is this the man that possesses mines of wealth inexhaustible and the capacity of living for ever observing that he had finished his discourse i addressed to him these words by a sort of uncontrollable impulse and with all the vehemence of unsated and insuppressible curiosity tell me i adjure you by the living god what use have you made of these extraordinary gifts and with what events has that use been attended as i spoke thus the countenance of the old man underwent a surprising change its serenity vanished his eyes rolled with an expression of agony and he answered me thus be silent st leon how often must i tell you that no single incident of my story shall ever be repeated have i no claim upon your forbearance can you be barbarous and inhuman enough to disturb my last scene with these bitter recollections i was silent this is all that is material that passed at our interview the stranger died the next day and was buried according to his instructions chapter xiv from the moment of my last interview with the stranger i was another creature my thoughts incessantly rolled upon his communications they filled me with astonishment and joy almost to bursting i was unable to contain myself i was unable to remain in any posture or any place i could scarcely command myself sufficiently to perform the last duties to his body in the manner he had directed i paced with eager step the sands of the lake i climbed the neighbouring hills and then descended with inconceivable rapidity to the vales below i traced with fierce impatience the endless mazes of the wood in which i so hardly recovered my bewildered guest the uninterruptedness and celerity of bodily motion seemed to communicate some ease to my swelling heart yet there was one thing i wanted i wanted some friendly bosom into which to pour out my feelings and thus by participation to render my transports balsamic and tolerable but this was for ever denied me no human ear must ever be astonished with the story of my endowments and my privileges i may whisper it to the woods and the waters but not in the face of man not only am i bound to suppress the knowledge of the important secret i possess but even the feelings the ruminations the visions that are for ever floating in my soul it is but a vain and frivolous distinction upon which i act when i commit to this paper my history and not the science which is its corner stone the reason why the science may not be divulged is obvious exhaustless wealth if communicated to all men would be but an exhaustless heap of pebbles and dust and nature will not admit her everlasting laws to be so abrogated as they would be by rendering the whole race of sublunary man immortal but i am bound as far as possible not only to hide my secrets but to conceal that i have any to hide senseless paper be thou at least my confidant to thee i may impart what my soul spurns the task to suppress the human mind insatiably thirsts for a confidant and a friend it is no matter that these pages shall never he surveyed by other eyes than mine they afford at least the semblance of communication and the unburthening of the mind and i will press the illusion fondly and for ever to my heart to return to the explanation of my feelings immediately after receiving possession of my grand acquisition for without that explanation the spirit and meaning of my subsequent narrative will scarcely be sufficiently apprehended happy happy happy man exclaimed i in the midst of my wanderings and reveries wealth thy power is unbounded and inconceivable all men bow down to thee the most stubborn will is by thee rendered pliant as wax all obstacles are melted down and dissolved by the ardour of thy beams the man that possesses thee finds every path level before him and every creature burning to anticipate his wishes but if these are the advantages that wealth imparts to such as possess only those scanty portions which states and nations allow to the richest how enviable must his condition be whose wealth is literally exhaustless and infinite he possesses really the blessing which priestcraft and superstition have lyingly pronounced upon the charitable he may give away the revenues of princes and not be the poorer he possesses the attribute which we are accustomed to ascribe to the creator of the universe he may say to a man be rich and he is rich he can bestow with equal facility the smallest gifts and the greatest palaces as if they were the native exhalations of the soil rise out of the earth at his bidding he holds the fate of nations and of the world in his hand he can remove forests and level mountains drain marshes extend canals turn the course of rivers and shut up the sea with doors he can assign to every individual in a nation the task he pleases can improve agriculture and establish manufactures can found schools and hospitals and infirmaries and universities he can study the genius of every man and enable every man to pursue the bent of his mind poets and philosophers will be fostered the sublimest flights of genius be produced and the most admirable discoveries effected under his auspicious patronage the whole world are his servants and he if his temper be noble and upright will be the servant of the whole world nay it cannot happen otherwise he has as few temptations to obliquity as omnipotence itself weakness and want are the parents of vice but he possesses every thing he cannot better his situation no man can come into rivalship or competition with him i thank god i have known the extremes of poverty and therefore am properly qualified to enjoy my present happiness i have felt a reverse of fortune driving me in one instance to insanity in another instance threatening to destroy me my wife and children together with the plague of hunger my heart has been racked with never dying remorse because by my guilt and folly my children have been deprived of the distinction and rank to which they were born and plunged in remediless obscurity heaven has seen my sufferings and at length has graciously said it is enough because i have endured more than man ever endured from the privation of fortune god in his justice has reserved for me this secret of the transmutation of metals i can never again fall into that wretchedness by which my understanding was subverted and my heart was broken from this part of the legacy of the stranger my mind reverted to the other i surveyed my limbs all the joints and articulations of my frame with curiosity and astonishment what exclaimed i these limbs this complicated but brittle frame shall last for ever no disease shall attack it no pain shall seize it death shall withhold from it for ever his abhorred grasp perpetual vigour perpetual activity perpetual youth shall take up their abode with me time shall generate in me no decay shall not add a wrinkle to my brow or convert a hair of my head to grey this body was formed to die this edifice to crumble into dust the principles of corruption and mortality are mixed up in every atom of my frame but for me the laws of nature are suspended the eternal wheels of the universe roll backward i am destined to be triumphant over fate and time months years cycles centuries to me all these are but as indivisible moments i shall never become old i shall always be as it were in the porch and infancy of existence no lapse of years shall subtract any thing from my future duration i was born under louis the twelfth the life of francis the first now threatens a speedy termination he will be gathered to his fathers and henry his son will succeed him but what are princes and kings and generations of men to me i shall become familiar with the rise and fall of empires in a little while the very name of france my country will perish from the face of the earth and men will dispute about the situation of paris as they dispute about the site of ancient nineveh and babylon and troy yet i shall still be young i shall take my most distant posterity by the hand i shall accompany them in their career and when they are worn out and exhausted shall shut up the tomb over them and set forward there was something however in this part of my speculation that did not entirely please me methought the race of mankind looked too insignificant in my eyes i felt a degree of uneasiness at the immeasurable distance that was put between me and the rest of my species i found myself alone in the world must i for ever live without a companion a friend any one with whom i can associate upon equal terms with whom i can have a community of sensations and feelings and hopes and desires and fears i experienced something less than a wish yet a something very capable of damping my joy that i also were subject to mortality i could have been well content to be partaker with a race of immortals but i was not satisfied to be single in this respect i was not pleased to recollect how trivial would appear to me those concerns of a few years about which the passions of men are so eagerly occupied i did not like the deadness of heart that seemed to threaten me i began to be afraid of vacancy and torpor and that my life would become too uniformly quiet nor did it sufficiently console me to recollect that as one set of friends died off the stage another race would arise to be substituted in their stead i felt that human affections and passions are not made of this transferable stuff and that we can love nothing truly unless we devote ourselves to it heart and soul and our life is as it were bound up in the object of our attachment it was worse when i recollected my wife and my children when i considered for the first time that they were now in a manner nothing to me i felt a sensation that might be said to mount to anguish how can a man attach himself to any thing when he comes to consider it as the mere plaything and amusement of the moment in this statement however i am not accurate habit is more potent than any theoretical speculation past times had attached me deeply irrevocably to all the members of my family but i felt that i should survive them all they would die one by one and leave me alone i should drop into their graves the still renewing tear of anguish in that tomb would my heart be buried never never through the countless ages of eternity should i form another attachment in the happy age of delusion happy and auspicious at least to the cultivation of the passions when i felt that i also was a mortal i was capable of a community of sentiments and a going forth of the heart but how could i an immortal hope ever hereafter to feel a serious an elevating and expansive passion for the ephemeron of an hour as the first tumult of my thoughts subsided i began as is usual with persons whose minds are turned loose in the search of visionary happiness to picture to myself more steadily and with greater minuteness the objects i would resolve early to accomplish i would in the first place return to france my adored country the residence of my ancestors whose annals they had adorned whose plains had witnessed their heroic feats and whose earth enclosed their ashes to france i was endeared by every tie that binds the human heart her language had been the prattle of my infancy her national manners and temper were twined with the fibres of my constitution and could not be rooted out i felt that every frenchman that lived was my brother banishment had only caused these prejudices to strike their tendrils deeper in my heart i knew not that i should finally limit my abode to france a man who like melchisedec is without end of life may well consider himself as being also like him without father without mother and without descent but at all events i would first fix my children who did not participate in my privileges in their native soil i would reside there myself at least till they were fully disposed of and till the admirable partner of the last seventeen years of my life had resigned her breath i would immediately repurchase the property of my ancestors which had been so distressfully resigned the exile should return from his seven years banishment in triumph and splendour i would return to the court of my old patron and friend the gallant francis and present to him my boy the future representative of my family now one year older than i had been at the field of the cloth of gold though an exile from my country i had not been an inattentive witness of her fortunes the year fifteen hundred and forty four was a remarkable and interesting year in the history of france the endless animosities of francis and the emperor had broken out with new fury about two years before in the spring of the present year the count danguien had won a battle in piedmont in which ten thousand imperialists were left dead upon the field and which might be considered as having at length effaced the defeat of pavia in the same part of the world nineteen years before the moment it had been announced that a battle was resolved on the young nobility of france with their characteristic ardour had hurried to the scene and the court of paris was in an instant as it were turned into a desert on the other hand the emperor and the king of england had concerted for the same season a formidable plan of attack against our northern frontier with an army of twenty five thousand men respectively the one on the side of champagne and the other of picardy they agreed to advance directly into the heart of the kingdom and to unite their forces in the neighbourhood of paris the last intelligence that had reached me was that chteau thierry about twenty leagues from the metropolis was in the hands of the emperor and that the inhabitants of the capital filled with consternation were seeking their safety by flight in every direction these circumstances had passed idly by me and left little impression so long as i considered myself as an obscure peasant cut off for ever from the bosom of my country but vested with the extraordinary powers now intrusted to me the case was altered i felt even a greater interest in my sovereign now pressed down with disease and calamity yet retaining the original alacrity and confidence of his soul than i had done when i saw him in all the pride of youth and all the splendour of prosperity i was anxious that charles should now enter into his service and i determined once again to assume the cuirass and the falchion that i might be the instructor of his youth and his pattern in feats of war i resolved that my shepherd boy bred in obscurity among woods and mountains should burst with sudden splendour upon his countrymen and prove in the field his noble blood and generous strain i also proposed to myself both out of sympathy for my king and to give greater clat to my sons entrance into life to replenish with my treasures the empty coffers of france and thus to furnish what at this period seemed to be the main spring upon which the fortune of war depended with the advantages i could afford him the career of charles could not fail to be rapid and illustrious and he would undoubtedly obtain the staff of constable of france the possessor of which montmorency was now in disgrace i would marry my daughters to such of the young nobility as i should find most distinguished in talents and spotless in character when by the death of her i most loved my affections should be weaned from my country and the scenes to which i had been accustomed were rendered painful and distressing i would then set out upon my travels i would travel with such splendour and profusion of expense for this though mortified in me by a reverse of many years duration continued to be the foible of my heart as should supersede the necessity of letters of recommendation and secure me a favourable reception wherever i appeared i might spend a life in a manner in every country that was fortunate enough to allure my stay spreading improvements dispensing blessings and causing all distress and calamity to vanish from before me chapter xv my mind was occupied in these and similar reveries for several weeks after the death of the stranger my wife and children had hoped after that event that i should have returned to the habits which had pervaded the last six years of my existence and which they had felt so eminently productive of gratification and delight in this hope they found themselves deceived my domestic character was for the present at least wholly destroyed i had a subject of contemplation that did not admit of a partaker and from this subject i could not withdraw my thoughts so much as for an instant i had no pleasure but in that retirement where i could be unseen and unheard by any human eye or ear if at any time i was compelled to join the domestic circle i despatched the occasion that brought me there as speedily as possible and even while i remained in it was silent and absent engrossed with my own contemplations and heedless and unobservant of every thing around me my abstraction was not however so entire as to prevent me from sometimes stealing in a sort of momentary interregnum of thought in that pause where the mind rests upon the chain already passed over and seems passively to wait for the sequel a glance at my family i looked at them without knowing what it was that i did and without the intention to notice what i saw yet even in this state of mental abstraction visible objects will sometimes succeed in making their impression i perceived that my wife and children suffered from my behaviour i remarked a general air of disconsolateness and a mild unexpostulating submission to what nevertheless the heart deeply deplored they did not presume to interrupt me they did not by prying and inquisitive speeches attempt to extort from me the secret of the alteration they saw but it was manifest they conceived some great and radical calamity had poisoned the heart of our domestic joy it was these symptoms thus remarked by me that first roused me from the inebriation of my new condition i was compelled to suspect that while i revelled in visions of future enjoyment i was inflicting severe and unmerited pains on those i loved it was necessary if i valued their happiness that i should descend from the clouds of speculation and fancy and enter upon the world of realities but here i first found a difficulty to which during the reign of my intoxication i had been utterly insensible i was rich i could raise my family as far as the power of money extended money which may in some sense be styled the empress of the world to what heights i pleased i had hitherto committed the fault so common to projectors of looking only to ultimate objects and great resting places and neglecting to consider the steps between this was an omission of high importance every thing in the world is conducted by gradual process this seems to be the great principle of harmony in the universe nothing is abrupt one thing is so blended and softened into another that it is impossible to say where the former ends and the latter begins this remark is fully applicable to the situation which was now before me yesterday i was poor to day i was possessor of treasures inexhaustible how was this alteration to be announced to dissipate the revenues of princes to purchase immense estates to launch into costly establishments are tasks to which the most vulgar mind is equal but no man stands alone in the world without all trace of what he has been and with no one near that thinks himself entitled to scrutinise his proceedings and his condition least of all was this my case i was bound to certain other persons by the most sacred obligations i could not separate myself from them i could not render myself a mere enigma in their eyes though in the language of the world the head of my family they were my natural censors and judges i was accountable to them for my conduct it was my duty paramount to all other duties to stand as a fair upright and honourable character in their estimation if these remarks be true taken in a general view they are much more so when applied to my particular case there are men who live in the midst of their families like an eastern despot surrounded with his subjects they are something too sacred to be approached their conduct is not to be reasoned upon the amount of their receipts and disbursements is not to be inspected their resources are unknown no one must say to them what dost thou or why hast thou thus conducted thyself even these persons will not escape the tax to which all men are liable they cannot kill the general spirit of enquiry the mystery in which they wrap themselves will often serve as an additional stimulus they will finally encounter the judgment and verdict of all for myself i had lived in the midst of my family upon a system of paternal and amicable commerce i had suffered too deeply from a momentary season of separation and mystery not to have been induced to renounce it decisively and for ever firm however as i had imagined my renunciation to have been i was now thrown back upon what i had most avoided i had a secret source of advantage the effects of which were to be participated by those i loved while the spring was to remain for ever unknown what i most sought upon this occasion was that my family should share my good fortune and at the same time be prevented from so much as suspecting that there was any thing mysterious connected with it to effect this i presently conceived that it would be necessary to sacrifice the sudden and instantaneous prosperity i had proposed to myself and introduce the reverse of our condition by slow and as far as possible insensible degrees one thing on which i determined preparatory to the other measures i had in view was to remove from my present habitation and take up my residence for a time in the city of constance in the cottage of the mountains it was impossible to make any material alteration in my establishment my property was of the narrowest extent nor would it be easily practicable in a country the inhabitants of which were accustomed to a humble allotment considerably to enlarge it my house was frugal if not mean and unless it were first pulled down and built over again the idea of introducing servants equipage or splendour into it would be absurd my design was not to make a long abode where i now was but as soon as my family should be sufficiently prepared for the transition to return to my native country i believed in the mean time that in the capital of the bishopric where my name was scarcely remembered by a single individual i should be more at liberty to proceed as circumstances suggested than in my present rural situation where every neighbour regarded himself as vested with a sort of inquisitorial power over all around him to account for this measure to my family i felt it incumbent on me to confess to them a certain pecuniary acquisition the story that most readily suggested itself was that of the stranger having left behind him a certain sum of which he made a donation to me this though in the plain and direct sense of the terms it were false yet in its spirit bore a certain resemblance to the truth and with that resemblance in spite of the rigid adherence to veracity that first ornament of a gentleman that most essential prerequisite to the regard and affection of others which i had hitherto maintained i was induced to content myself what could i do i was compelled to account for appearances i was forbidden by the most solemn injunctions to unfold the truth i should indeed have felt little complacence in the disclosure i should have been reluctant to announce a circumstance which as i began to feel introduced a permanent difference and separation between me and my family the sum at which i fixed the legacy of the stranger was three thousand crowns i was not inattentive to the future i should have been glad by my present account to have furnished a more ample solution for circumstances which might occur hereafter but some regard was due to probability an unknown a solitary man broken with age who arrived on foot and who declined all aid and attendance must not be represented as possessing mines of treasure it was some time before i could prevail on myself to break my story to the inhabitants of my cottage as the time approached when i was to bid an everlasting farewell to rural obscurity and a humble station they seemed to adorn themselves in new charms i was like the son of a king who had hitherto been told by his attendants that he was a mere villager and who while his youthful imagination is dazzled by the splendour that awaits him yet looks back with a wistful eye upon his mirthful sports his former companions and the simple charms of her who first obtained his guileless love i announced my acquisition and my purpose with a faltering tongue and a beating heart i could perceive that my tale produced few emotions of pleasure in those who heard it julia and her mother especially were warmly attached to their retirement and the scenes which had witnessed so many pleasurable incidents and emotions chagrin in spite of themselves made a transient abode upon their countenances but the unresisting mildness of the one and the considerate attachment of the other prevented for the present their sensations from breaking out into words the feelings however that they consigned to silence did not entirely escape the notice of the lively little marguerite she sympathised with them probably without being aware that they were sad she came towards me and with much anxiety in her enquiring face asked why we must go away from the cottage if i had got some money i might go to the town and buy sweetmeats and ribands and new clothes and a hundred more pretty things and bring them home for her part she should be better pleased to put on her finery and make her feast in the pretty old summer house now she was again permitted to go and play in it than in a palace all stuck over with emeralds and rubies her mother wiped away a tear at the innocent speech of her darling kissed her and bid her go and feed the hen and her chickens charles was the only one in whom i could observe any pleasure at my intelligence he was not as yet skilful enough to calculate the advantages that three thousand crowns could purchase but i could see joy sparkle in his eyes as i announced my intention of bidding adieu to retirement and taking up my rest in the capital of the district his veins swelled with the blood of his ancestors his mind was inured to the contemplation of their prowess already sixteen years of age he had secretly burned to go forth into the world to behold the manners of his species and to establish for himself a claim to some rank in their estimation he had pined in thought at the mediocrity of our circumstances and the apparent impossibility of emerging for he regarded the duty of contributing his labour to the subsistence of the family as the first of all obligations and the more the bent of his spirit struggled against it the more resolutely he set himself to comply the rest of the family were no sooner retired than marguerite finding in what i had just announced to all an occasion from the use of which she could not excuse herself took this opportunity of unburthening the grief which had long been accumulating in her mind st leon said she listen kindly to what i am going to say to you and assure yourself that i am actuated by no spleen resentment or ill humour but by the truest affection i perceive i have lost in your apprehension the right of advising you i am no longer the partner of your counsels i am no longer the confident of your thoughts you communicate nothing but what you cannot suppress and that you communicate to your whole family assembled heaven knows how dear to me is every individual of that family but my love for them does not hide from me what is due to myself i know that a husband who felt as a husband ought and give me leave to say as i have deserved you should feel towards me could not act as you have acted to night you must excuse my reminding you of some things which you seem to have forgotten i would not mention them if they had not been forgotten when they ought to have been remembered i have lived seventeen years with you my whole study had been your advantage and pleasure have you any thing to reproach me with point out to me if in any thing i could have added to your pleasure and have neglected it what i have done has not been the ceremonious discharge of a duty it has been the pure emanation of an attachment that knew no bounds i have passed with you through good fortune and ill fortune when we were rich i entered with my whole heart into your pleasures because they were yours when we were poor i endured every hardship without a murmur i watched by you i consoled you i reconciled you to yourself i do not mean to make a merit of all this no reginald i could not have acted otherwise if i would do me the justice to recollect that i have not been a complaining or irritable companion in all our adversities in the loss of fortune and the bitter consequences of that loss i never uttered a reproachful word what poverty sorrow hunger and famine never extorted from me you have at length wrung from my bleeding heart st leon i have known your bosom thoughts in no former instance has your affection or your confidence been alienated from me and that consoled me for all the rest but now for three months the case has been entirely altered you have during all that time been busy pensive and agitated but i have been as much a stranger to your meditations as if i had never been accustomed to be their depository you have not scrupled to inflict a wound upon me that no subsequent change will ever be able to cicatrise nor indeed do i see any likelihood of a change you announce our removal to constance what we are to do next with what views or for what purpose i am ignorant i have made my election my heart is formed for affection and must always feel an uneasy void and desolation without it if you had thus robbed me of your attachment in an early period of our intercourse i know not upon what extremity my disappointment and anguish might have driven me they are harder to bear now but i submit it is too late either for relief or remedy what remains of my powers and my strength i owe to my children i will not seduce them from their father they may be benefited by his purse or his understanding though like me they should be deprived of his affection you may be their friend when i am no more i feel that this will not last long i feel that the main link that bound me to existence cannot be snapped and thus snapped by unkindness worse than death without promising soon to put a period to my miseries i shall be your victim in death after having devoted my life to you in a way in which few women were ever devoted to their husbands but this is not what i purposed chiefly to say this is what my situation and my feelings have unwillingly wrung from me though you have injured me in the tenderest point i still recollect what you were to me i still feel deeply interested in your welfare and the fair fame you are to transmit to your children i entreat you then to reflect deeply before you proceed further you seem to me to stand upon a precipice nor do the alteration that has taken place in your manners and the revolution of your heart lead me to augur favourably of the plans you have formed what is this stranger whence came he why did he hide himself and why was he pursued by the officers of justice had he no relations was his bequest of the sum he had about him his own act and who is the witness to its deliberateness or its freedom you must not think that the world is inattentive to the actions of men or their circumstances if it were the fame we prize would be an empty bauble no sir a fair fame can only be secured by unequivocal proceedings what will what can be thought of your giving shelter to an unknown a man accused of crimes a man never beheld even by an individual of your own family and upon the strength of whose alleged bequest you are about to change the whole mode of your life nor reginald must you think me credulous enough to imagine that you have now disclosed the whole or the precise truth three thousand crowns is not a sum sufficient to account for what you propose for the long agitation of your thoughts or for the change of character you have sustained you must either be totally deprived of rational judgment or there must be something behind that you have not communicated what do you purpose in going to reside in the midst of a city foreign to the manners of a frenchman distracted with internal broils and embittered to us by the recollection of the extremities we personally suffered in it is your ambition sunk so low that it can be gratified by such a transition no you mean more than you have announced you mean something you are unwilling to declare consider that meaning well put me out of the question i am nothing and no longer desire to be any thing but do not involve yourself in indelible disgrace or entail upon your memory the curses of your children what a distress was mine who in return to so generous and noble an expostulation could impart no confidence and indulge no sincerity i felt a misery of which till this hour i had been unable to form a conception fool that i was i had imagined that when endowed with the bequests of the stranger no further evil could approach me i had in my visionary mood created castles and palaces and expatiated in the most distant futurity and here i was stopped and disappointed at the threshold in the very first step of my proceedings what i could however i did i poured forth to marguerite not the secrets of my understanding but the overpowering emotions of my soul best most adorable of women cried i how you rend my heart with the nobleness of your remonstrances never was man blessed with a partner so accomplished and exemplary as i have been do you think your merits can ever be obliterated from my memory do you think the feelings of gratitude and admiration can ever be weakened in my bosom or that the strength and singleness of my attachment can suffer decay bear me witness heaven i know no creature on the face of the earth that can enter into competition with you there is not the thing in nature that i prize in comparison i love you a thousand times better than myself and would die with joy to purchase your ease and satisfaction i can never repay the benefits you have conferred on me i can never rise to an equality with you what anguish then do you inflict upon me when you talk of becoming the victim of my unkindness believe you i can endure after having dissipated your patrimony and drawn you with me into exile after having experienced from you a tenderness such as man never in any other instance obtained from woman to entertain the idea of embittering the remainder of your life and shortening your existence i should regard myself as the most execrable of monsters i could not live under the recollection of so unheard of a guilt if you would not have me abhor myself and curse existence live confide in me and be happy oh marguerite how wretched and pitiable is my situation make some allowance for me i have a secret that i would give worlds to utter but dare not do not imagine that there is or can be any decay in my affection confide in me allow to necessity what never never could be the result of choice in all things else you shall know my inmost heart as you possess the boundless and unalterable affections of my soul marguerite was somewhat but not wholly soothed by the earnestness of my protestations she saw for the prescience of the heart is never deceived that a blow was given to the entireness of our affection from which it would never recover she felt for in truth and delicacy of sentiment she was much my superior that the reserve in which i persisted and for which i deprecated excuse might be sufficiently consistent with a vulgar attachment but would totally change the nature of ours she was aware that it related to no ordinary point that it formed the pole star of my conduct that it must present itself afresh from day to day and that in its operation it amounted to a divorce of the heart she submitted however and endeavoured to appear cheerful though she felt the worm of sorrow gnawing her vitals she was unwilling to occasion me an uneasiness it was in her power to withhold she was struck with the consistency and determination of my resistance and expostulated no more we went to constance we bade adieu to the scene of a six years happiness such as the earth has seldom witnessed i alone had occasioned some imperfection in that happiness there were times indeed when sitting in affectionate communion with my wife and surrounded by my children my sensations had been as delicious as the state of human existence ever had to boast i felt my heart expand i was conscious to the unreserved union that subsisted among us i felt myself identified with all that i loved and all for whom my heart was anxious but the curse entailed upon me from the earliest period to which my memory can reach operated even in the cottage of the lake i was not formed to enjoy a scene of pastoral simplicity ambition still haunted me an uneasiness scarcely defined in its object from time to time recurred to my mind if i thought i wanted nothing for myself i deemed a career of honour due to my children again when i regarded honour as an empty phantom and persuaded myself that all conditions of life were intrinsically equal i recollected the fearful scene where hunger and destruction had hung over us in constance and in imagination often pictured to myself that scene as on the point of being renewed the sword of the demon famine seemed to my disturbed apprehension to be suspended over us by a hair such had been the draught of bitterness that occasionally detracted from this most enviable as in retrospect i am willing to denominate it period of my existence we quitted our rural retreat and took up our abode in a prosperous mercantile city i hired commodious apartments in one of the grand squares not far from the spot where the fairs are usually held undoubtedly there was nothing in this residence very congenial to the bent of my disposition or the projects that fermented in my mind i had merely chosen it by way of interval and to soften the transition from what i had been to what i purposed to be in the multitude of irresolute thoughts with which i laboured the small distance of constance from the cottage of the lake made me feel as if the removal thither was one of the gentlest and most moderate measures to which i could have recourse i had never been less happy and at peace with myself than i was now from general society and the ordinary intercourse of acquaintance i had long been estranged and it was in vain that i endeavoured to return to habits of that sort the society which the city of constance afforded had few charms for me it had no pretensions to the politeness the elegance the learning or the genius an intercourse with which had once been familiar to me it scarcely contained within its walls any but such as were occupied in merchandise or manufacture the attention of its inhabitants were divided between these objects and the encroachments which were making upon the ancient religion by the confession of augsburg and the dogmas of calvin the majority of the inhabitants were protestants and a few years before they had expelled their bishop and the canons of their cathedral having however miscarried in a religious war into which they had entered these dignitaries had been reinstalled in their functions and emoluments the situation thus produced was an unnatural one and a storm was evidently brewing more violent than any which the city had yet sustained the gloomy temper and melancholy austerity of the reformers were as little congenial to my temper as the sordid ignorance and selfishness of the trading spirit of the community i therefore lived in a state of seclusion i endeavoured to seek amusement in such novelties and occupations as might present themselves to a person disengaged from the general vortex but if the distinguished sphere in which i had once moved disqualified me for taking an interest in these puerilities the anticipations in which i indulged of the future disqualified me still more my domestic scene too no longer afforded me the consolation and relief i had been accustomed to derive from it marguerite exerted herself to appear cheerful and contented but it was an exertion i began to fear that the arrow of disappointment had indeed struck her to the heart i was anxiously occupied in considering what i was to do next i hoped that our next step might operate to revive her gaiety and by additional splendour amuse her solicitude i began to fear that i had taken a wrong method and entered the career of a better fortune with too much caution and timidity at all events i felt that we no longer lived together as we had done there was no more opening of the heart between us no more infantine guilelessness and sincerity no more of that unapprehensive exposure of every thought of the soul that adds the purest zest to the pleasures of domestic life we stood in awe of each other each was to the other in some degree an intrusive and unwelcome spy upon what was secretly passing in the mind there may be persons who regard this as an evil very capable of being endured but they must be such as never knew the domestic joys i once experienced the fall from one of these conditions of life to the other was too bitter chapter xvi anxious to divert my thoughts from what i hoped was only a temporary evil i determined accompanied by charles to make a tour of some of the cities of germany dresden was the capital to which i was most desirous of conducting him maurice duke of saxony who held his court there and who was now only twenty three years of age was incomparably the most accomplished prince of the empire desirous as i was that my only son should fill a distinguished career i thought i could not better prepare him for the theatre of his native country than by thus initiating him beforehand in scenes of distinction and greatness he was delighted with his tour we had not proceeded many leagues from constance before indulging in the bent of my mind i laid aside the humbleness of our appearance and the obscure style in which we travelled and having procured a numerous cavalcade of horses and servants i set forward with considerable magnificence we passed through munich ratisbon and prague at munich we found the court of the elector palatine the diet of the empire was sitting at ratisbon when we arrived at that city charles had been almost entirely a stranger to every thing princely and magnificent from the time he was nine years of age and he was now exactly at that period of human life when external appearances are apt to make the strongest impression to him every thing that occurred seemed like transportation into a new world the figure we made procured us as strangers unquestioned admission into every circle we mixed with princes ourselves in garb and figure confounded with those we saw i had lived too much and too long in the most splendid society to find difficulty in resuming the unembarrassed and courtly manners which i had for years laid aside and charles might be said to see his father in a new character novelty prompted his admiration he was intoxicated with wonder his disposition had always led him to bold and adventurous conceptions nothing less than an imperious sense of duty could have restrained him from quitting our cottage and casting himself upon the world in search of honour and distinction his generous heart had beat to burst away from the obscurity of his station and it was with impatience and discontent that he looked forward to the life of a swain yet he knew not how to break through the obstacles that confined him it was therefore with transports of pleasure that he saw them vanishing as of themselves and the career of glory opening as if by enchantment to his eager steps the court of dresden was infinitely more delightful to him than the court of munich or the imperial display at ratisbon here charles saw a young prince in the flower of his age whose talents and spirit rendered him the universal object of attention and adoration he remarked in the fire of his eyes the vivacity of his gestures and the grandeur of his port something inexpressibly different from those princes of whom it is necessary that their rank should be announced to you by some extrinsic circumstance that you may not mistake them for a merchants clerk or a city magistrate the sentiment that he breathed as it were instinctively as we returned from the first time of our seeing duke maurice was at twenty three years of age may i in appearance accomplishments and spirit resemble this man here i was desirous of making a longer stay than at the cities through which we had previously passed and of procuring for my son some personal intercourse with this great ornament of the age i judged this to be the more easy as in our first visit to the palace i had perceived some french noblemen of the protestant persuasion who had resorted to the dukes court in search of employment they appeared not to know me but that was little to be wondered at considering that i had been seven years absent from my country and that the calamities by which i had been overtaken more than once during that period might be supposed to have produced a greater effect upon me than the mere lapse of years would have done among the rest i remarked gaspar de coligny who was only twenty one years of age at the time i quitted france and had then been remarked as one of the most promising young men his country had to boast his stay here was expected to be short his hopes in his own country from the greatness of his connections were of the highest class and he had only come to dresden at the earnest invitation of duke maurice who entertained an ardent affection for him my heart led me towards him policy concurred in dictating the application as if i were fortunate enough to gain his favour my son could not have a friend better qualified either to form his character or forward his advancement i wrote to coligny to announce my request to him and in a few hours after the delivery of my letter that young nobleman came in person to wait on me he informed me that he had done so because he had something of delicacy to mention which he did not choose to trust to the intermission of a third person and upon which as he hoped i could remove his scruple he did not like even to bestow the formality of putting it on paper i am a gentleman of france said coligny you will excuse my frankness i am a gentleman of france you will not wonder at the niceness of my honour mixing in society i do not pretend minutely to investigate the character of every person with whom i converse but what you ask of me obliges me to consult my understanding and enquire into facts i cannot consent to vouch for any mans character to another till i have paid some attention to the ground upon which that character rests i remember the count de st leon with pleasure and advantage at the court of my own sovereign every one admired his accomplishments his gallantry and his learning every one spoke of him with respect unfortunate circumstances as we all understood deprived you of your patrimony that is nothing to me i respect a nobleman in misfortune as much as when he is surrounded with wealth and splendour you retired into voluntary exile i heard with great grief of some subsequent calamities that have overtaken you but here in saxony i see you resuming all your former splendour and coming forward with the magnificence of a prince other of your countrymen have remarked it as well as myself and feel themselves at a loss to account for what they see excuse me count by your application to me you oblige me to speak freely i dare say you can clear up the difficulty and account for this second revolution in your fortune upon which i shall then be the first to congratulate you i cannot suspect a man with your high descent and the illustrious character you formerly maintained of any thing dishonourable but you have not sufficiently considered the account we all owe to one another and the clearness of proceeding we are obliged to maintain not only to our own hearts but in the face of the world the present occasion is i trust fortunate for you and when you have assisted me in complying with the rules by which every honourable man governs himself i shall be eager to publish your justification and render you all the service in my power i was ready to burst with astonishment and vexation during this representation of coligny i could feel my colour change from pale to red and from red to pale i could only answer with suffocation and inward rage that i was much obliged to him i would consider what he said i would acquaint him with my justification and whenever it was made he might be assured it should be an ample one i was cautious as to what i uttered i could not immediately foresee what it was eligible or what it was possible to do and i was resolved that i would not by an idle or hasty expression preclude myself in a matter of so much moment from the benefits of future deliberation if what i had just heard had come from any other person i should probably have despised it but i felt at once that gaspar de coligny might be considered in a case of this sort as the representative of all that was most honourable and illustrious in my native country finding that i was indisposed to any further communication on the subject he took a polite leave and departed i was no sooner alone than i felt myself overwhelmed with mortification and shame i had rejoiced in the bequests of the stranger because i regarded them as the means of restoring me to splendour and replacing my children in the situation to which they were entitled by their birth was that which i had regarded as the instrument of their glory to become the medium of their ignominy and disgrace i had suffered all other misfortunes but the whisper of dishonour had never been breathed against me i was a son of honour descended of a race of heroes and cradled in the lap of glory and fame when we quitted paris in the year my incomparable wife had set to sale our entire property resolved that though driven into exile we would not leave it in the power of the meanest individual to controvert the sacred attention we yielded to every just obligation since that time i had declined from the splendour of rank to the humble situation of a rustic cultivating my little property with my own hands nay i had even for a short time hired myself as a labourer in the garden of the bishop of constance but the same disdain of every thing disgraceful had followed me to my cottage and my truckle bed which i had originally learned in the halls of chivalry and the castle of my ancestors accordingly i had uniformly retained the same honourable character and spotless fame st leon the virtuous cottager had in nothing blemished the name of st leon surrounded with glory in the siege of pavia often and with pride had i pointed out this circumstance to my son adding wherever fortune calls you for whatever scenes you may be reserved remember that your father was unfortunate but that through life he never acted a deed nor conceived a thought that should stain your manly cheeks with the blush of shame i stand before you a culprit as having robbed you of your patrimony but i have preserved for you entire the inheritance of our honour this had been the first lesson imprinted upon my infant mind all other possessions i had ever held cheap and worthless in comparison with that of an illustrious name my indignation at the attack it now sustained was boundless the more i thought the more intolerable it appeared i was impatient and furious like a lion struggling in the toils i could with joy have trampled under my feet whoever aspersed me i could have wantoned in blood and defied my adversaries to mortal combat alas all my fury was useless here it was no tale whispered in the dark that i had to contend with it was the commentary of the world upon incontestable facts though a hecatomb of souls should be sacrificed at the shrine of my blasted name the facts would still remain the mystery still require to be solved coligny the virtuous coligny had made no observations on the circumstances he mentioned he merely proposed a difficulty and waited my answer i was called upon to exercise the whole of my deliberative powers as to the reply which was to be returned or the conduct to be held upon the question of coligny every thing i most valued was now at issue and a false step taken under the present circumstances could never be retrieved i had another sort of party to deal with here than when i had told marguerite the tale of the stranger and his legacy nothing would pass now but what bore an open fair and unequivocal appearance i must vent no assertion that could not bear to be sifted to the bottom and that did not fully accord with all the vouchers with which it could be collated i had written to marguerite immediately after launching into the expense with which our tour had been attended that i had received an unexpected acquisition from the death of a relation of my own family in france i knew that the story of the three thousand crowns would no longer account for the style in which i was proceeding and this fabrication suggested itself upon the spur of the moment i hated to think of the difficulties in the way of explanation in which i was involved i abhorred the system of falsehood i was driven to practise it did not occur to me at the time infatuated as i was that i should have occasion to account for this accession of wealth to any one out of my own family marguerite i well knew had no correspondence in france nor therefore any obvious means of verifying or refuting this second deception but such a story could not be told to noblemen of france without being instantly liable to be compared with known facts and eventually investigated upon the spot where the scene was laid marguerite herself i well knew had listened with incredulity to the explanation i had made and the alleged legacy of the stranger what could i expect from indifferent hearers they might not all possess her good sense and sagacity in judging but they were destitute of that personal kindness and partiality which were calculated to induce her to credit whatever i affirmed most men have a malignant pleasure in the detection of specious pretences in humbling the importunate superiority that obscures their claims and removing the rival who might otherwise acquire the prize of which they are in pursuit my mind was still torn and distracted with these contemplations when in the afternoon of the same day on which i had received the visit of coligny my attention was suddenly roused by the abrupt entrance of my son into the chamber where i was sitting he opened the door with a hurried action as he entered and having closed it impetuously after him advanced directly towards me he then stopped himself and turning from me i could perceive a rush of crimson in his face like that of a man suffocated a passion of tears succeeded that shook his frame and sufficiently proved that his feelings had sustained some extraordinary shock my whole soul was alarmed at what i saw and following him as he retired to the other side of the room in the gentlest accents i endeavoured to soothe him while i enquired with earnestness and trepidation into the cause of his grief chapter xvii he repelled me sit down sir sit down do not follow me i beg of you but sit down his manner was earnest and emphatical mechanically and without knowing what i did i obeyed his direction he came towards me i have no time added he for qualifying and form tell me am i the son of a man of honour or a villain he saw i was shocked at the unexpected rudeness of his question forgive me my father i have always been affectionate and dutiful i have ever looked up to you as my model and my oracle but i have been insulted it never was one of your lessons to teach me to bear an insult is it replied i with the sternness that the character of a father will seldom fail to inspire under such circumstances because you have been insulted that you think yourself authorised to come home and insult him to whom you owe nothing but respect and reverence stop sir before you claim my reverence you must show your title to it and wipe off the aspersions under which you at present labour insolent presumptuous boy know that i am not by you to be instructed in my duty and will not answer so rude a questioner the down as yet scarcely shades your school boys cheek and have you so forgotten the decencies of life as to scoff your father his eye brightened as i spoke you are right sir it gives me pleasure to see your blood rise in return to my passion your accent is the accent of innocence but indeed the more innocent and noble you shall prove yourself the more readily will you forgive my indignation i cannot tell my temper does not fit me to bear the rudeness of a son nor do i think that such behaviour as this can be any credit to you whatever may have been the provocation tell me however what is the insult that has thus deeply shaken you i went this afternoon to the tennis court near the river and played several games with the young count luitmann while we were playing came in the chevalier dupont my countryman the insolence of his nature is a subject of general remark and he has though i know not for what reason conceived a particular animosity to me a trifling dispute arose between us we gradually warmed he threatened to turn me out of the court i resented the insult and he passionately answered that the son of an adventurer and a sharper had no business there and he would take care i should never be admitted again i attempted to strike him but was prevented and presently learned that the sudden and unexplained way in which we have emerged from poverty was the ground of his aspersion as i gained time and reflected more distinctly upon what was alleged i felt that personal violence could never remove an accusation of this sort i saw too though intoxicated as i had idly been with the unwonted splendour to which i was introduced i had not adverted to it at the time that the case was of a nature that required explanation i had been accustomed to reverence and an implicit faith in the wisdom and rectitude of my parents and therefore encountered in silent submission the revolution of our fortune but this neutrality will suffice no longer to you sir i resort for explanation send me back to the insolent youth and his companions with a plain and unanswerable tale that may put to silence for ever these brutal scoffs and reproaches let it be seen this night which of the two has most fully merited to be thrust out of honourable society i trust i have not so demeaned myself but that our mutual companions will join to compel this unmannered boor to retract his aspersions charles you are too warm and impetuous too warm sir when i hear my father loaded with the foulest appellations you are young and ill qualified to terminate in the proper way a business of this serious aspect leave it to me excuse me my father though the names i have repeated were bestowed upon you it was against me that the insult was employed i must return immediately and obtain justice this is a moment that must in some degree fix my character for fortitude and determination and i cannot withdraw from the duty it imposes only tell me what i have to say furnish me with a direct and unambiguous explanation of what dupont has objected to us and i undertake for the rest i see my son that you are moved and i will trust you he seized my hand he gazed earnestly in my face he seemed prepared to devour every word i should utter gaspar de coligny the flower of the french nobility has been with me this morning he has stated to me in an ingenuous and friendly way the same difficulty with which dupont has so brutally taunted you i was meditating and arranging my answer but now when you entered the room as i uttered these words charles let go my hand and withdrew his eyes with evident tokens of disappointment and chagrin he paused for a few moments and then resumed why do you tell me of meditation and arrangement why did you send away coligny unanswered or why baffle and evade the earnestness of my enquiries i know not all the sources of wealth but i cannot doubt that the medium through which wealth has honourably flowed may without effort and premeditation easily be explained a just and a brave man acts fearlessly and with explicitness he does not shun but court the scrutiny of mankind he lives in the face of day and the whole world confesses the clearness of his spirit and the rectitude of his conduct sir i have just set my foot on the threshold of life there is one lesson you have taught me which i swear never to forget to hold life and all its pleasures cheap in comparison with an honourable fame my soul burns with the love of distinction i am impatient to burst away from the goal and commence the illustrious career i feel that i have a hand and a heart capable of executing the purposes that my soul conceives uninured to dishonour or to any thing that should control the passion of my bosom think sir what are my emotions at what has just occurred i was bred in obscurity and a humble station i owed this disadvantage you tell me to your error i forgave you i was content i felt that it was incumbent on me by my sword and my own exertions to hew my way to distinction you have since exchanged the lowness of our situation for riches and splendour at this revolution i felt no displeasure i was well satisfied to start upon more advantageous terms in the race i determined to run but sir whence came these riches riches and poverty are comparatively indifferent to me but i was not born to be a mark for shame to point her finger at a little while ago you were poor you were the author of your own poverty you dissipated your paternal estate did i reproach you no you were poor but not dishonoured i attended your couch in sickness i exerted my manual labour to support you in affliction i honoured you for your affection to my mother i listened with transport to the history of your youth i was convinced i should never blush to call reginald de st leon my father i believed that lessons of honour so impressive as those you instilled into my infant mind could never flow but from an honourable spirit oh if there is any thing equivocal or ignoble in the riches we have displayed restore me instantly restore me to unblemished and virtuous poverty i was astonished at the firmness and manliness of spirit that charles upon this occasion discovered i could scarcely believe that these were the thoughts and words of a youth under seventeen years of age i felt that every thing illustrious and excellent might be augured of one who at these immature years manifested so lofty and generous a soul i could have pressed him in my arms have indulged my emotions in sobs and tears of transport and congratulated myself that i was father to so worthy a son but his temper and manners awed and held me at a distance this was one consequence of the legacies of the stranger charles said i your virtues extort my confidence for the world a tale must be prepared that shall serve to elude its curiosity and its malice but to you i confess there is a mystery annexed to the acquisition of this wealth that can never be explained he stood aghast at my words am i to believe my ears a tale prepared a mystery never to be explained i adjure you by all that you love and all that you hold sacred his voice was drowned in a sudden gush of tears with an action of earnestness and deprecation he took hold of my hand no sir no artful tale no disguise no hypocrisy as he spoke his voice suddenly changed his accent became clear and determined will you consent this very hour to quit the court of dresden and to resign fully and without reserve this accursed wealth for the acquisition of which you refuse to account whence replied i have you the insolence to make such a proposal no i will not then i swear by the omnipresent and eternal god you shall never see or hear of me more i perceived that this was no time for the assertion of paternal authority i saw that the poor boy was strangely and deeply moved and i endeavoured to soothe him i felt that the whole course of his education had inspired him with an uncontrollable and independent spirit and that it was too late to endeavour to repress it my dear charles said i what is come to you when i listen to a language like this from your lips i scarcely know you for my son this impertinent dupont has put you quite beside yourself another time we will talk over the matter calmly and depend upon it every thing shall be made out to your satisfaction do not imagine sir that my self possession is not perfect and complete i know what i do and my resolution is unalterable if you have any explanation to give give it now if you will yield to my proposal declare your assent and i am again your son but to bear the insults of my fellows unanswered or to live beneath the consciousness of an artful and fictitious tale no consideration on earth shall induce me i love you sir i cannot forget your lessons or your virtues i love my mother and my sisters no words can tell how dearly and how much but my resolution is taken i separate myself from you all and for ever nothing in my mind can come in competition with a life of unblemished honour and are you such a novice as to need the being told that honour is a prize altogether out of the reach of an unknown and desolate wanderer such as you propose to become my wealth boy is unlimited and can buy silence from the malicious and shouts and applause from all the world a golden key unlocks the career of glory which the mean and the pennyless are never allowed to enter i am not such a novice as not to have heard the language of vice though i never expected to hear it from a father poverty with integrity shall content me the restless eagerness of my spirit is so great that i will trust to its suggestions and hope to surmount the obstacles of external appearance if i am disappointed in this and destined to perish unheard of and unremembered at least i will escape reproach i will neither be charged with the deeds nor give utterance to the maxims of dishonour charles replied i be not the calumniator of your father i swear to you by every thing that is sacred and you know my integrity never did the breath of falsehood pollute these lips he passionately interrupted me did the stranger bequeath you three thousand crowns have you lately received an unexpected acquisition by the death of a near relation in france i was silent this was not a moment for trifling and equivocation oh my father how is your character changed and subverted you say true for sixteen years i never heard a breath of falsehood from your lips i trusted you as i would the oracles of eternal truth but it is past a few short months have polluted and defaced a whole life of integrity in how many obscurities and fabulous inconsistencies have you entangled yourself nor is it the least of the calamities under which my heart sickens at this moment that i am reduced to hold language like this to a father what misery was mine to hear myself thus arraigned by my own son and to be unable to utter one word in reply to his accusations to be thus triumphed over by a stripling and to feel the most cruel degradation in the manifestation of an excellence that ought to have swelled my heart with gratulation and transport i had recollected my habitual feelings for near forty years of existence i had dropped from my memory my recent disgrace and dared to appeal to my acknowledged veracity when this retort from my son came to plunge me tenfold deeper in a sea of shame he proceeded i am no longer your son i am compelled to disclaim all affinity with you but this is not all by your dishonour you have cut me off from the whole line of my ancestors i cannot claim affinity with them without acknowledging my relation to you you have extinguished abruptly an illustrious house the sun of st leon is set for ever standing as i do a candidate for honourable fame i must henceforth stand by myself as if a man could be author of his own existence and must expect no aid no favour no prepossession from any earthly consideration save what i am and what i shall perform my son replied i you cut me to the heart such is the virtue you display that i must confess myself never to have been worthy of you and i begin to fear i am now less worthy of you than ever yet you must suffer me to finish what i was about to say when you so passionately interrupted me i swear then by every thing that is sacred that i am innocent whatever interpretation the world may put upon my sudden wealth there is no shadow of dishonesty or guilt connected with its acquisition the circumstances of the story are such that they must never be disclosed i am bound to secrecy by the most inviolable obligations and this has led me to utter a forged and inconsistent tale but my conscience has nothing with which to reproach me if then charles my son once my friend my best and dearest consolation i pressed his hand and my voice faltered as i spoke if you are resolute to separate yourself from me at least take this recollection with you wherever you go whatever may be my external estimation i am not the slave of vice your father is not a villain alas my father rejoined charles mournfully what am i to believe what secret can be involved in so strange a reverse of fortune that is not dishonourable you have given utterance to different fictions on the subject fictions that you now confess to be such how am i to be convinced that what you say at this moment is not dictated more by a regard for my tranquillity than by the simplicity of conscious truth if i believe you i am afraid my credit will be the offspring rather of inclination than of probability and indeed if i believe you what avails it the world will not believe your character is blasted your honour is destroyed and unless i separate myself from you and disown your name i shall be involved in the same disgrace saying thus he left me and in about half an hour returned his return i had not foreseen i had made no use of his absence my mind was overcome my understanding was stupified by a situation and events i had so little expected i had stood unmoved leaning against the wall from the instant of his departure i seemed rooted to the spot incapable of calling up my fortitude or arranging my ideas my eyes had rolled my brow was knit i had bit my lips and my tongue with agony from time to time i had muttered a few words my son my son wealth wealth my wife my son but they were incoherent and without meaning charles re entered the apartment where the preceding conversation had passed and the noise he made in entering roused me he had his hat in his hand which he threw from him and exclaimed with an accent of dejection and anguish my father farewell cruel cruel boy can you persist in your harsh and calamitous resolution if you have no affection for me yet think of your mother and your sisters seek not sir to turn me from my purpose the struggle against it in my own bosom has been sufficiently severe but it must be executed his voice as he spoke was inward stifled and broken with the weight of his feelings then farewell i replied yet take with you some provision for your long and perilous adventure name the sum you will accept and whatever is its amount it shall instantly be yours i will have nothing it is this wealth with whose splendour i was at first child enough to be dazzled that has destroyed us my fingers shall not be contaminated with an atom of it what is to be my fate as yet i know not but i am young and strong and enterprising and courageous the lessons of honour and nobility live in my bosom though my instructor is lost his instructions shall not be vain once more farewell from my heart i thank you for your protestations of innocence never will i part with this last consolation to believe them i have recollected the manner in which they were uttered it was the manner of truth if there be any evidence of a contrary tendency that i will forget though to the world i shall be without father and without relatives i will still retain this sacred consolation for my hours of retirement and solitude that my ancestors were honourable and my father in spite of all presumptions to the contrary was innocent how hard it is to quit for ever a family of love and affection as ours has been bear witness for me how deeply i sympathised with you at paris in switzerland in constance though now you dissolve the tie between us yet till now never had a son greater reason for gratitude to a father you and my mother have made me what i am and that i may preserve what you have made me i now cast myself upon an untried world the recollection of what i found you in the past period of my life shall be for ever cherished in my memory i quit my mother and my sisters without leave taking or adieu it will be a fruitless and painful addition to what each party must learn to bear dear excellent peerless protector and companions of my early years my wishes are yours my prayers shall for ever be poured out for you you sir who rob them of a son and a brother be careful to make up to them a loss which i doubt not they will account grievous i can do nothing for them i can throw myself into the arms of poverty it is my duty but in doing so i must separate myself from them assuredly innocent and worthy of more and greater benefits than i could ever confer on them farewell saying this he threw himself into my arms and i felt the agonies of a parting embrace chapter xviii for some time i could not believe him departed when i retired to rest i felt the want of charles to press my hand and wish me refreshing slumbers and i passed on sad and solitary to my chamber when i came next morning into the breakfasting room charles was not there to greet me with looks of affection and duty and the gilding and ornaments of the apartment were to me no less disconsolate than the damps and sootiness of a dungeon i hoped he would return i knew how tenderly he was attached to his mother and his sisters i was fully convinced that the affection for me which had been the perpetual habit of his mind could not be entirely eradicated from his heart i mentioned him not in my letters to constance the pen lingered my hand trembled when i thought of him i could neither pretend that he was with me nor announce the catastrophe of his absence but i opened the letters of marguerite with still increasing impatience finding that he did not return to me i hoped that some alteration of the extraordinary resolution he had formed would lead him to constance in vain i hoped there reached me by no conveyance from no quarter tidings of my son how surprising an event a youth not seventeen years of age forming and executing in the same instant the purpose of flying from his parents and his family deserting all his hopes all his attachments all his fortune refusing the smallest particle of assistance or provision in his entrance upon the wide scene of the world oh charles exclaimed i you are indeed an extraordinary and admirable youth but are you fortified against all the temptations of the world and all its hardships do your tender years qualify you to struggle with its unkindness its indifference and its insults in how few quarters is merit ever treated with the attention and benevolence it deserves how often is it reduced to tremble with indignation at the scoffs and brutality to which it is exposed and at the sight of folly and vice exalted in its stead and appointed its despot and its master my son my son what will be your fate is your unseasoned frame reserved to perish by hunger in barren deserts and beneath inclement skies will you not in some hour of bitter disappointment and unpitied loneliness lay yourself down in despair and die will you not be made the slave of some capricious tyrant for bread generous as is your nature will it be eternally proof against reiterated temptation upon what a world are you turned adrift a world of which you know as little as the poor affrighted soul of a dying man knows when launching into the mysterious impenetrable abyss of eternity unnatural father to have reduced my only son to this cruel alternative i should with a less aching and agonising heart have accompanied his senseless remains to the grave dreadful as that parting is there at least the anxious mind of the survivor has rest there are no thoughts and devices in the silence of the tomb there all our prospects end and we are no longer sensible to pain to persecution to insult and to agony but charles thus departed wandering on the face of the globe without protector adviser or resource no lapse of years can put a close upon my anxiety for him if i am in ease and prosperity i cannot relish them for my exposed and living son may be at that moment in the depth of misery if i am myself oppressed and suffering the thought of what may be his fate will form a dreadful addition to all my other calamities what am i to say of him upon my return to constance if he had died this was a natural casualty and whatever grief it might occasion time no doubt would mollify and abate it but what account can now be rendered of him to his disconsolate mother and terrified sisters how can i lift up my head in their presence or meet the glance of their reproachful eyes the idea had occurred to me in the instant of charless departure and immediately after his exit of detaining or bringing him back by force he was by his extreme youth according to the maxims of the world still in a state of guardianship and unqualified to be the chooser of his own actions but to this mode of proceeding however deeply i felt the catastrophe which had taken place i could never consent it was in utter hostility to the lessons of chivalry and honour with which i had been familiarised from my earliest infancy there might be cases in which this restraint laid by a father upon his child would be salutary but the idea which had occasioned the secession of charles was decisive in this instance what right had i to chain him to dishonour the whole bent of his education had been to impress him with the feelings by which he was now actuated if i detained him for a short time was there any vigilance on earth that could finally prevent him from executing a purpose upon which his whole soul was resolved or suppose there were must not the consequence be to break his spirit to deprive him of all manliness and energy and to render him the mere drooping and soulless shadow of that conspicuous hero i had been anxious to make him it might be said indeed that this was the determination of a boy formed in an hour and that if i detained him only long enough for deliberation and revisal he would of his own accord retract so desperate a project but i felt that it was a resolution formed to endure and was built upon principles that could not change so long as an atom of his mind remained no i was rather disposed to say however grievous was the wound he inflicted on me go my son act upon the dictates of your choice as i have acted on mine i admire your resolution though i cannot imitate it your purpose is lofty and godlike and he that harbours it was not born to be a slave be free and may every power propitious to generosity and virtue smooth your path through life and smile upon your desires the anguish i felt for having lost my son and in this painful and reproachful manner was not diminished to me either by society or amusement i dared not go out of my house i saw no one but my own attendants i had not the courage to meet the aspect of a human creature i knew not how far persons in dresden might have heard the injurious reports which occasioned the flight of my son or even have been acquainted with the nature of that flight i had promised to see coligny again but alas the affair which had at first led me to wish to see him was now at an end i had no heart to seek him nor indeed did i know what story i was to tell him or how i was to remove the suspicions he had urged against me the machine of human life though constituted of a thousand parts is in all its parts regularly and systematically connected nor is it easy to insert an additional member the spuriousness of which an accurate observation will not readily detect how was i to assign a source of my wealth different from the true which would not be liable to investigation and when investigated would not be seen to be counterfeit this indeed is the prime source of individual security in human affairs that whatever any man does may be subjected to examination and whatever does not admit of being satisfactorily accounted for exposes him whom it concerns to the most injurious suspicions this law of our nature so salutary in its general operation was the first source of all my misfortunes i began now seriously to consider what judgment i was to pass upon the bequests of the stranger were they to be regarded as a benefit or a misfortune ought they to be classed with the poisoned robe of nessus which being sent as a token of affection was found in the experiment to eat into the flesh and burn up the vitals of him that wore it should i from this instant reject their use and returning to the modes of life established among my fellow men content myself with the affection of those with whom i had intercourse though poverty and hardships mingled with the balm the experiment i had made of these extraordinary gifts was a short one but how contrary were all the results i had arrived at from those i looked for when the stranger had appeared six months before at the cottage of the lake he had found me a poor man indeed but rich in the confidence and happy in the security and content of every member of my family i lived in the bosom of nature surrounded with the luxuriance of its gifts and the sublimity of its features which the romantic elevation of my soul particularly fitted me to relish in my domestic scene i beheld the golden age renewed the simplicity of pastoral life without its grossness a situation remote from cities and courts from traffic and hypocrisy yet not unadorned with taste imagination and knowledge never was a family more united in sentiments and affection now all this beauteous scene was defaced all was silence suspicion and reserve the one party dared not be ingenuous and the other felt that all the paradise of attachment was dwindled to an empty name no questions were asked for no honest answer was given or expected though corporeally we might sit in the same apartment in mind a gulf wide impassable and tremendous gaped between us my wife pined in speechless grief and it was to be feared had sustained a mortal blow my son my only son a youth of such promise that i would not have exchanged him for empires had disappeared and as he had solemnly protested for ever my heart was childless my bosom was bereaved of its dearest hope it was for him principally that i had accepted that i had rejoiced in the gifts of the stranger my darling vision was to see him clothed in the harness surrounded with the insignia of a hero there was nothing i so earnestly desired as that his merits graced with the favours of fortune might cause him to stand confessed the first subject of france a situation more enviable than that of its monarch since he who holds it is raised by deeds and the other only by birth and if less respected by interested courtiers is certain to be more honoured by the impartial voice of history but if i felt thus desolate and heartbroken for the loss of my son what would be the sentiments of his mother more susceptible to feel and in her present weakness of spirits less vigorous to bear than myself when the dreadful tidings should be communicated to her yet i could not resolve to renounce donations which i had so dearly appropriated i held it to be a base and cowardly to surrender gifts so invaluable upon so insufficient an experiment he i thought must be a man of ignoble and grovelling spirit who could easily be prevailed on to part with unbounded wealth and immortal life i had but just entered the vast field that was opened to me it was of the nature of all great undertakings to be attended with difficulties and obstacles in the commencement to present a face calculated to discourage the man that is infirm of purpose but it became my descent my character and pretensions to show myself serene in the midst of storms perseverance and constancy are the virtues of a man affairs of this extensive compass often prove in the issue the reverse of what they seemed in the outset the tempest might be expected to disperse difficulties to unravel themselves and unlooked for concurrences to arise all opposition and hostile appearance give way before him who goes calmly onward and scorns to be dismayed chapter xix it was thus that i spurred myself to persist in the path upon which i had entered having remained some time at dresden flattering myself with the hope that charles might yet join me before i quitted that city i began to think of once more turning my steps towards the residence of my family this was no cheerful thought but upon what was i to determine i had a wife whom i ardently loved and three daughters the darlings of my heart because i had lost a beloved son was i to estrange myself from these i already felt most painfully the detachment and widowhood to which i was reduced and i clung with imperious affection to what remained of my race the meeting i purposed must be a melancholy one but in the sorrows of the heart there is a purer and nobler gratification than in the most tumultuous pleasures where affection is silent i looked forward indeed to scenes of endless variety and attraction but in the mean time what seemed first to demand my attention was the beloved circle i had left behind in the city of constance i retraced upon the present occasion the route i had lately pursued with my son how different were now my sensations my heart was then indeed painfully impressed with the variance and dissolution of confidence that had arisen between me and his mother it was perhaps principally for the sake of banishing this impression that i had had recourse to the splendour of equipage and attendance which was first assumed upon the journey from constance to dresden nor frivolous as this expedient may appear in the unattractive dispassionateness of narrative had it been by any means weak of effect at the time it was employed when charles was once mounted on his proud and impatient steed and decorated in rich and costly attire i felt as it were the sluggishness of my imagination roused i surveyed his shape and his countenance with inexpressible complacence and already anticipated the period when he was to become the favourite of his sovereign and his countrys pride now i returned with the same retinue but the place that had been occupied by my son was empty i sought him with frantic and restless gaze i figured him to my disturbed and furious imagination till the sensations and phantoms of my brain became intolerable i raved and imprecated curses on myself i endeavoured to divert my thoughts by observing the scenes that passed before me they talked to me of charles they had been pointed out by each to each and had been the subject of our mutual comment though charles was endowed with a high relish for the beauties of nature and in our little retreat on the borders of the lake had lived in the midst of them he had seen little of the variety of her features and the journey we made through the heart of germany had furnished him with continual food for admiration and delight nor did the scenes i beheld merely remind me of the sensations they produced in charles they led me through a wider field i recollected long conversations and digressive excursions which had been started by the impression they made i recollected many passages and occurrences to which they had not the slightest reference but which having arisen while they constituted the visible scene were forcibly revived by its re appearance thus from various causes my lost and lamented son was not a moment out of my thoughts during the journey while i continued at dresden i seemed daily to expect his return but no sooner did i quit that city than despair took possession of my heart thus anxious and distressed i arrived at prague and soon after at ratisbon i travelled slowly because though i was desirous of returning to constance i anticipated my arrival there with little complacence as i drew nearer to my family i felt more distinctly the impossibility of presenting myself before them without first endeavouring to take off the shock they would sustain at seeing me return without my son i therefore resolved to send forward a servant from ratisbon whom i directed to make all practicable speed as i designed to wait for an answer he should bring me at the city of munich to attempt to write to marguerite on this subject was a severe trial to me the whole however that i proposed to myself was to remove the surprise which would be occasioned by seeing me alone and to anticipate questions that it would be impossible for me to hear without anguish of mind and perturbation of countenance i therefore took care to express myself in such terms as should lead marguerite to believe that i had voluntarily left her son in saxony and that in no very long time he would rejoin his family i trusted to subsequent events to unfold the painful catastrophe and could not prevail on myself to shock her maternal feelings so much as i must necessarily do if i informed her of the whole at once charles had not been mentioned but in ordinary terms and the accustomed language of affection in the letters i had recently received from constance and i was therefore convinced that he had neither gone to that place nor had conveyed thither any account of his proceedings the answer i received from marguerite by my messenger was as follows your absence has been long and critical and the welfare of your daughters seems to require that we should rejoin each other as speedily as may be whether we should meet here or at any other place you must determine it is however right i should inform you that during your absence rumour has been busy with your reputation what the extent or importance of the ill reports circulated of you may be i am scarcely competent to judge we have lived in uniform privacy and it is natural to suppose that the portion of censure that has reached us is but a small part of what really exists the mode in which you have proceeded and the extraordinary figure you have made in a progress through germany have given weight to these insinuations but it is not my intention to comment on what you have done you appear to design that i should understand you have left my son behind you in saxony poor charles i had a letter from him three weeks ago in which he informs me of what has happened and apologises in the most pathetic terms for any seeming want of regard to me in his conduct at the very moment that his heart bleeds for my fate i did not think it necessary to communicate this circumstance to you i have done with complaining now that i have fallen into the worst and most unlooked for misfortunes i have a gratification that i do not choose to part with in shutting up my sorrows in my own breast oh charles my son my idol what is become of you for what calamities are you reserved he tells me it is necessary that i should never see or hear of him again never i his mother reginald there are some wounds that we may endeavour to forgive but they leave a sentiment in the heart the demonstrations of which may perhaps be restrained but which it is not in nature wholly to subdue if i did but know where to find or to write to my poor boy i would take my girls with me and partake his honest and honourable poverty and never again join the shadow of him who was my husband forgive me reginald i did not intend to say this if i should prove unable to control the impatience of my grief do not inflict the punishment of my offence on your innocent daughters as to your fiction of voluntarily leaving him behind for further improvement it corresponds with every thing you have lately attempted to make me believe i no longer expect truth from you for seventeen years i had a husband well well i ought not perhaps to repine i have had my share of the happiness which the present life is calculated to afford reginald i have not long to live when i tell you this i am not giving way to melancholy presentiment i will exert myself for the benefit of my girls they will have a grievous loss in me and for their sake i will live as long as i can but i feel that you have struck me to the heart my nights are sleepless my flesh is wasted my appetite is entirely gone you will presently be able to judge whether i am deceiving myself the prospect for these poor creatures who are at present all my care is a dismal one i know not for what they are reserved but i can hope for nothing good when i am dead remember and be a father to them i ask nothing for myself i have no longer any concern with life but if my dying request can have weight with you make up to them the duty you have broken to me by all out past loves by the cordiality and confidence in which we have so long lived by the singleness and sincerity of our affection by the pure delights so seldom experienced in married life that have attended our union i conjure you listen to me and obey me in this if i were deeply distressed for the loss of my son if i looked forward with a mingled sensation of eagerness and alarm to the approaching interview with my family it may easily be imagined that this letter formed a heavy addition to my mental anguish i confess i thought it a cruel one marguerite might well suppose that the departure of charles was a circumstance i must strongly feel and she should not have thus aggravated the recent wounds of paternal grief some allowance however was to be made for a mother when we are ourselves racked with intolerable pain that certainly is not the time at which we can rationally be expected to exert the nicest and most vigilant consideration for another add to which she was innocent of the calamities she suffered and could not but know that i was their sole author but whatever may be decided as to the propriety of the letter its effect upon my mind was eminently salutary i instantly determined on the conduct it became me to pursue i lost not a moment from dresden to munich i had advanced with slow and unwilling steps from munich to constance i proceeded as rapidly as the modes of travelling and the nature of the roads would permit i left my retinue at the gates of the town and flew instantly to the apartments of my family i hastened up stairs and as i entered the sitting room i saw the first and most exemplary of matrons surrounded by her blooming daughters i instantly perceived a great alteration in her appearance her look was dejected her form emaciated her countenance sickly and pale she lifted up her eyes as i entered but immediately dropped them again without any discernible expression either of congratulation or resentment i embraced my children with undescribable emotion i said within myself the love and affection i had reserved for charles shall be divided among you and added to the share you each possess of my heart having saluted them in turn i addressed myself to marguerite telling her that i must have some conversation with her instantly my manner was earnest she led the way into another apartment i felt my heart overflowing at my tongue i am come to you cried i a repenting prodigal take me and mould me at your pleasure she looked up she was struck with the honest fervour of my expression she answered in almost forgotten terms and with a peculiar fulness of meaning my husband it seemed as if the best years and the best emotions of our life were suddenly renewed most adorable of women i continued do you think i can bear that you should die and i your murderer no man in any age or climate of the world ever owed so much to a human creature as i owe to you no woman was ever so ardently loved no woman ever so much deserved to be loved if you were to die i should never know peace again if you were to die the victim of any miscalculation of mine i should be the blackest of criminals reginald replied she i am afraid i have been wrong i am afraid i have written harshly to you you have a feeling heart and i have been too severe forgive me it was the effect of love affection cannot view with a tranquil eye the faults of the object beloved let them be forgotten let the last six months be blotted from our memory be as though they had never existed she looked at me her look seemed to say though she would not give the sentiment words that can never be the loss of charles and certain other calamities of that period are irretrievable i resign myself into your hands i have been guilty i have had secrets meditations engendered and shut up in my own bosom but it shall be so no more the tide of affection kept back from its natural channel now flows with double impetuousness never did i love you not when you first came a virgin to my arms not on the banks of the garonne not in the cottage of the lake so fervently so entirely as i love you now be my director do with me as you please i have never been either wise or virtuous but when i have been implicitly guided by you i have wealth i am forbidden by the most solemn obligations to discover the source of that wealth this only i may not communicate in all things else govern me despotically shall i resign it all shall i return to the cottage of the lake shall i go a houseless and helpless wanderer to the farthest quarter of the globe speak the word only and it shall be done i prefer your affection your cordial regard in the most obscure and meanest retreat to all that wealth can purchase or kings can give reginald i thank you i acknowledge in your present language and earnestness the object of my first and only love this return to your true character gives me all the pleasure i am now capable of receiving but it is too late my son is lost that cannot be retrieved your reputation is blasted i am sorry you are returned hither constance is in arms against you and i will not answer for the consequence for myself i grieve to tell you so i am ashamed of my weakness but my heart is broken i loved you so entirely that i was not able to bear any suspension of our confidence i had passed with you through all other misfortunes and the firmness of my temper was not shaken for this one misfortune that seemed the entire dissolution of our attachment i was not prepared i feel every morning as i rise the warnings of my decease my nights are sleepless my appetite is gone from me oh marguerite talk not thus distract me not with the most fatal of images our confidence shall return all the causes of your malady shall be removed with the causes the symptoms depend on it will disappear your youth your tranquillity your happiness shall be renewed oh no you shall not die we will yet live to love and peace flatter not yourself with vain hopes my love i feel something wrong within me which is rapidly wearing my body to decay reconcile your mind to what very soon must happen prepare yourself for being the only parent to your remaining offspring i have composed my spirit and calmly wait my fate you have now administered to me the only consolation i aspired to by this return to your true character which affords me a sanguine hope that you will faithfully discharge the duty to your offspring which when i am gone will be doubly urgent on you i was grieved to see that the mind of marguerite was so deeply impressed with the notion that she had but a short time to live i could not bear to imagine for a moment that her prognostic was just the thought seemed capable of driving me to distraction i however conceived that the best thing that could be done for the present was to turn the conversation to some other topic well well my love i answered there are some things that are immediately pressing direct me direct a husband so amply convinced of your discretion what i am to do at present shall i instantly annihilate all that has made this unfortunate breach between us shall i resign my wealth from whatever source derived whither shall we go shall we return to the cottage of the lake shall we retreat into some distant part of the world how can you expect me said marguerite faintly smiling to advise you respecting the disposal of a wealth of the amount of which i am uninformed and the source of which is invisible but i guess your secret the stranger who died your guest was in possession of the philosophers stone and he has bequeathed to you his discovery i have heard of this art though i confess i was not much inclined to credit it i do not ask you to confirm my conjecture i do not wish that you should violate my engagements into which you have entered but upon putting circumstances together which i have been inevitably compelled to do i apprehend it can be nothing else i am astonished that a conjecture so obvious should have offered itself to my mind so late if your wealth is of any other nature ample as it apparently is it is a natural question to ask to whom is it to be resigned the ordinary wealth of the world is something real and substantial and can neither be created nor dissipated with a breath but if your wealth be of the kind i have named let me ask is it possible to resign it a secret is a thing with which we may choose whether we will become acquainted but once known we cannot become unacquainted with it at pleasure your wealth upon my supposition will always be at your beck and it is perhaps beyond the strength of human nature to refuse under some circumstances at least in some emergencies to use the wealth which is within our reach it has been our mutual misfortune that such an engine has been put into your hands it has been your fault to make an indiscreet use of it gladly would i return to the tranquil and unsuspected poverty of the cottage of the lake but that is impossible you have lost your son you have lost your honest fame the life of your marguerite is undermined and perishing if it were possible for us to return to our former situation and our former peace still my reginald forgive me if i say i doubt the inflexibleness of your resolution the gift of unbounded wealth if you possess it and with wealth apparently at least distinction and greatness is too powerful a temptation nor though i should trust your resistance could i be pleased in a husband with the possession of these extraordinary powers it sets too great a distance between the parties it destroys that communion of spirit which is the soul of the marriage tie a consort should be a human being and an equal but to this equality and simple humanity it is no longer in your power to return circumstanced then as we now are the marriage union you must allow me to say irreparably dissolved your son lost your fair fame destroyed your orphan daughters to be provided for i know not if i should advise you to forget the prerogative that has been bought for you at so dreadful a price beside if i am not mistaken there are great trials in reserve for you i am afraid your present situation is extremely critical i am afraid the suspicions you have excited will cost you dear at all events i believe it to be but a necessary precaution that we should fly from constance i have nothing therefore to recommend to you on the subject of wealth but discretion i shall not long live to be your adviser i shall always regard the donation you have received you cannot wonder that i should so regard it as one of the most fearful calamities to which a human being can be exposed if you had used your prerogative with discretion you might perhaps though i confess i do not see how have escaped the obloquy of the world into your domestic scene where the interest is more lively and the watch upon you more unremitted it must have introduced alienation and distrust as it is i see you surrounded with dangers of a thousand denominations police has its eyes upon you superstition will regard you as the familiar of demons avarice will turn upon you a regard of jealousy and insatiable appetite if i could recover from the weakness that at present besets me and continue to live i foresee more and severer trials both at home and abroad than any i have yet sustained and i am almost thankful to that providence which has decreed to take me away from the evil to come one thing further let me add i will speak it not in the character of a censor but a friend it must ever be right and useful that a man should be undeceived in any erroneous estimate he may make of himself i have loved you much i found in you many good qualities my imagination decorated you in the virtues that you had not but you have removed the veil an adept and an alchemist is a low character when i married you i supposed myself united to a nobleman a knight and a soldier a man who would have revolted with disdain from every thing that was poor spirited and base i lived with you long and happily i saw faults i saw imbecilities i did not see them with indifference but i endeavoured and with a degree of success to forget and to forgive them they did not contaminate and corrupt the vitals of honour at length you have completely reversed the scene for a soldier you present me with a projector and a chemist a cold blooded mortal raking in the ashes of a crucible for a selfish and solitary advantage here is an end of all genuine dignity and the truest generosity of soul you cannot be ingenuous for all your dealings are secrecy and darkness you cannot have a friend for the mortal lives not that can sympathise with your thoughts and emotions a generous spirit reginald delights to live upon equal terms with his associates and fellows he would disdain when offered to him excessive and clandestine advantages equality is the soul of real and cordial society a man of rank indeed does not live upon equal terms with the whole of his species but his heart also can exult for he has his equals how unhappy the wretch the monster rather let me say who is without an equal who looks through the world and in the world cannot find a brother who is endowed with attributes which no living being participates with him and who is therefore cut off for ever from all cordiality and confidence can never unbend himself but lives the solitary joyless tenant of a prison the materials of which are emeralds and rubies how unhappy this wretch how weak and ignoble the man that voluntarily accepts these laws of existence in the advice of marguerite i saw that sound wisdom and discernment by which in all the periods of our connection she had been so eminently characterised with her views of the future i was not disposed to accord i regarded them as obscured and discoloured by the unfortunate state of her health i could not indeed refuse to believe that the prerogative i had received had been the parent of much domestic unhappiness willingly would i have resigned all that i had derived from the stranger to be replaced in the situation in which his pernicious legacies had found me he had robbed me of my son he had destroyed my domestic peace he had undermined the tranquillity and health of the partner of my life these calamities pressed with a heavy and intolerable weight at my heart but if as marguerite affirmed they were irretrievable or if they could once be removed and the domestic advantages i had heretofore enjoyed be restored i was not disposed to fear those external mischiefs which marguerite so feelingly predicted i could not believe that i should have such a league of foreign enemies to encounter nor could i easily image to myself any external evils which it was not in the power of gold to remedy these considerations i urged to my beloved partner and by enforcing them endeavoured to remove those gloomy apprehensions from the prevalence of which i feared much injury to her health there was another circumstance i was led particularly to insist on i mean the nature of the secret intrusted to me i admire your discernment and ingenuity marguerite said i in your conjecture respecting the source of my wealth i admire your delicacy in not pressing me to decide upon the truth of your conjecture this only i must be permitted to say on that subject it is a secret and you will perceive that the same reasons whatever they are which make that secret obligatory on me require that it should be respected by you the same evils that my own indiscretion may draw on me i shall be equally exposed to by any error or miscalculation of yours i have therefore most earnestly and solemnly to conjure you whatever misfortunes may hereafter befall me in whatever perilous situation i may be involved that you will never utter a syllable on this subject and that as i am the selected depository of this secret and alone know with certainty what is its nature you will trust our prosperity in this point to me marguerite engaged to conduct herself as i desired the night which succeeded this explanation was particularly soothing and grateful to me i was relieved from a great and oppressive burthen i was conscious of that particular species of pleasure which arises from the resolute discharge of an heroic duty the peace i felt within shed its gay and reviving beams upon all around me reconciled to myself i was filled with sanguine and agreeable visions of the future my mind obstinately rejected all dark and hateful presages i had intrusted myself and the direction of my conduct as far as it was possible to that better pilot under whose guidance if i had not avoided the rocks and quicksands of life i had at least escaped with little comparative injury i felt therefore as if my domestic enjoyments were restored and the pleasures of my better years were about to run over again their auspicious career not so marguerite she was mild gentle and soothing displeasure and resentment towards me were banished from her mind she endeavoured to conquer her melancholy and to forget the wounds that had been so fatal to her hopes but her endeavours were fruitless a fixed dejection clung to her heart nor could the generous sweetness that pervaded her manners hide from me entirely what was passing in her bosom during this interval we had talked over the plan of our future operations marguerite was exceedingly urgent with me to quit constance nor did i though not impressed with her presentiments feel any reluctance to that change of scene which i believed would materially contribute to the serenity of her mind and the restoration of her health we determined on some of the cities of italy as the next place of our residence and fixed if possible to set out some time in the next day or the day after the plan of proceeding to france which had lately been a favourite with me was a favourite no longer that had been the project of cheerful and wanton prosperity it had had for its object the re establishment of my family honours and the elevation of my son now my son was lost my wife was oppressed with languor and disease my house was overwhelmed with sorrow this was no time for wantonness and triumph if i could ever hope to resume the plans my frolic fancy had sketched an interval at least of soberer hue must first be suffered to elapse my mind at this time sustained a revolution sufficiently remarkable but of which the urgency of events that immediately succeeded prevented me from ever ascertaining whether it would have proved temporary or permanent when i first received the donation of the stranger my thoughts as i have already said were in a state of enthusiastic transport and amidst the golden visions in which my fancy revelled i became in a considerable degree alienated from domestic sentiments and pleasures if i still loved my wife and children it was the love of habit rather than sympathy more an anxiety for their prosperous success in the world than an earnest craving for their presence and intercourse this state of intoxication and rapture had now subsided the events of the few last weeks had sobered my thoughts having lost my son and being threatened with the loss of his mother i was roused to a sense of their value the influx of wealth and supernatural gifts had grown familiar to my mind and now only occupied the back ground of the picture i was once more a man and i hoped to partake of the privileges and advantages of a man the fate reserved for these hopes will speedily be seen some readers will perhaps ask me why anxious as i was for the life of marguerite and visible as was the decline of her health i did not administer to her of the elixir of immortality which was one of my peculiar endowments such readers i have only to remind that the pivot upon which the history i am composing turns is a mystery if they will not accept of my communication upon my own terms they must lay aside my book i am engaged in relating the incidents of my life i have no intention to furnish the remotest hint respecting the science of which i am the depository that science affords abundant reasons why the elixir in question might not or rather could not be imbibed by any other than an adept chapter xx the morning after my return to my family as i sat surrounded with my girls and endeavouring to make myself their playmate and companion certain officers of justice belonging to the supreme tribunal of the city entered my apartment they were sent as they informed me to conduct me to prison my blood at this intelligence mounted into my face to prison cried i wherefore what have i done i am no citizen of your state what is the charge against me lead me not to prison lead me to your chief magistrate you will be called up for examination when his honour is at leisure to hear you in the mean time you must go to prison do those who sent you know that i am a native and a gentleman of france they will be made to repent this insolence upon what pretence do they dare to act thus you will please not to talk of insolence to us if you do not demean yourself quietly silence fellow answered i fiercely lead the way by this time the children astonished at a scene so alarming and unintelligible to them began to express their terror in various ways julia who was ready to faint occupied the attention of her mother the little marguerite clung round my knees and expressed her emotions by shrieks and cries to see her father about to be torn from her by four strangers the peculiarity of whose garb of office aggravated the rudeness of their countenances and the peremptoriness of their behaviour was a spectacle which the affectionateness of her nature was unable to endure i will go with you presently said i to the officers see how you have terrified the children nay sir if you will behave civilly and make it worth our while we do not desire to hurry you i was stung with the brutal assurance with which they thus set the liberty of a few moments at a price to me but i checked my impatience i felt that it would be both foolish and degrading to enter into contention with such wretches i turned from them proudly and took my child in my arms i will not be long gone my love said i these people have made a mistake and i shall soon be able to rectify it i fancy not muttered one of them surlily they shall not take you away papa that they shall not i will hold you and will not let you go you are a good girl marguerite but i know best what is proper and you must not think to control me the men will not do me any harm child they dare not perhaps i shall be back to dinner and mamma will then tell me how good you have been as i spoke she looked steadfastly in my face and then flinging her arms round my neck cried good by papa and burst into a flood of tears i embraced the other children and their mother and saying to the latter significantly fear nothing you know i have nothing to fear departed with my conductors the way to the citadel lay through the market place the scene was already crowded and i had the mortification to be led along as a criminal in the midst of a thousand gazing eyes and enquiring tongues new as every thing connected with my present situation was to me i had not anticipated this vexation i was stung with shame and impatience to my dungeon said i to my conductors sternly if you had shown yourself better humoured cried the most brutal of them we would have led you round by the back way the master of the prison was somewhat less a savage than his officers he knew my person and had heard of my wealth does monsieur choose the best apartment said he any where that i can be alone answered i hastily he hesitated a moment i looked in his face oh yes you will be paid he bowed and showed me to a room i shut the door as he retired what had happened to me was of little importance in itself the impertinence of bailiffs and thief takers is of no more real moment than the stinging of a gnat but i was so utterly unacquainted with scenes of this nature the pride of rank that swelled within me made every appearance of restraint galling to my sense from the instant i was able to write man no one except in the voluntary compact of military service had ever said to me go there or do this and now was i to be directed by the very refuse of the species was i to learn the prudence of not replying to their insults was i to purchase at a stipulated price their patience and forbearance i request the reader to pardon me for troubling him with my noviciate feelings i soon learned to understand the world the world of a prison better but what was of more importance i was apprehended as a criminal i had been dragged a prisoner of justice through the streets of constance i was by and by to be subjected to the interrogatories of the municipal tribunal i could scarcely credit my senses that such an indignity had happened to the blood of st leon it is true i was innocent i was conscious whatever might be my imprudences and offences towards my own family that i had done nothing to merit the animadversion of public justice but this was of no consequence nothing in my opinion could wipe away the disgrace of being interrogated examined of having for an instant imputed to me the possibility of being a criminal i writhed under this dishonour and felt it as a severer attack than the question which was comparatively of ceremony and etiquette that had oppressed me in my residence at dresden the next day when i was brought up for examination i had expected to be the complainant in demanding redress for the injury i had sustained but i was mistaken i entered the room haughtily and with the air of a man that felt himself aggrieved of this however the magistrate took no notice do you know sir said i that i am a citizen and a gentleman of france are you acquainted with the treatment i have experienced have you lent your authority to that treatment wait a few minutes replied he with an imperious tone and i shall be at leisure to attend to you i was silent after the interval of nearly a quarter of an hour he resumed you call yourself the count de st leon i do perhaps sir you are uninformed of the purity with which justice is administered in the city within whose jurisdiction you now stand our state is a small one and its magistrates are therefore enabled to discharge the office of a parent not only to its proper citizens but to all strangers that place themselves under its protection i remember sir that seven years ago i and my wife and four children sick and unfriended were upon the point of perishing with hunger within the walls of this city the fact i mentioned was wholly foreign to the point with which i was at present concerned but the parading arrogance of the man brought it forcibly to my memory and wrung it from my lips monsieur le comte replied he you are petulant it is not the office of a state to feed the souls it contains it could not do that without making them slaves its proper concern is to maintain them in that security and freedom of action which may best enable them to support themselves i suppressed the emotions which the tone of this speech excited i was unwilling to enter into contention with a man whom i regarded as inexpressibly my inferior is it cried i sternly a part of the justice you boast of to drag a man of rank and a stranger from his home without any intimation of the cause of his being so treated and then instead of investigating immediately the charge against him to send him to prison unheard i disdain to mention the behaviour of your officers those things naturally grow out of the abuses practised by their superiors the mode of our proceeding replied he depends upon the seriousness of the crime imputed if a man of distinction labours under a slight accusation only we then treat him with all proper forbearance and respect but when he is suspected of a crime of more than ordinary magnitude that alters the case the man who has ceased to respect himself must look for no respect from others i was for a moment thunderstruck and speechless at length fiercely i cried produce my accusers that is not the mode of proceeding in constance i have certain questions to propound to you when you have answered them we shall see what is to be done next carry me before the prince bishop of your city if i am to be examined further let it be by your sovereign the prince bishop moved by the state of our affairs in matters of religion has been prevailed on to delegate his juridical authority i am the person to whom the cognisance of your business belongs and at certain times aided by my assessors have the power of life and death within this city you have had every indulgence to which you are entitled and it will be your wisdom to be no further refractory propose your questions a person apparently greatly advanced in years arrived in the autumn of last year at a miserable farm you at that time cultivated called the cottage of the lake it is to him that my questions will principally relate i stood aghast the words of the magistrate were most unwelcome sounds i remembered that the stranger had said to me when i am once buried speak of me and if possible think of me no more i replied with eagerness and alarm of that person i have nothing to say spare your questions i have no answer to return you what was his name i know not his country i cannot inform you it is understood that he died or in some manner disappeared while under your protection yet in the registers of the church there is no notice of that event if he died no application was made for the rites of religion to him dying or to his body when his spirit had deserted it you are required to answer what became of him or his remains i have already told you that from me you will obtain no information one question more sir seven years ago you tell me you and your family were perishing with hunger soon after you removed from obscure lodgings in this city to the cottage of the lake and seemed to be laudably employed in earning for yourself a scanty livelihood with the labour of your hands but within the last six months the scene is wholly changed you appear to have suddenly grown rich and here and in other parts of germany have actually disbursed considerable sums whence comes this change the train of questions thus proposed to me impelled me to a serious reply monsieur le juge said i i am a stranger a native of france and a man of rank in my own country i have paid your state the compliment of choosing it for my residence i have expended my industry i expend my wealth among you i have comported myself as a peaceable inhabitant no action of my life has brought scandal upon your state or disturbed the peace and tranquillity of your affairs i cannot collect from any thing you have said that i have any accuser or that any charge has been alleged against me till that happens i cannot fall under your animadversion i am a man of generous birth and honourable sentiments to myself and my own conscience only am i accountable for my expenditure and my income i disdain to answer to any tribunal on earth an enquiry of this sort and now sir in conclusion what i demand of you is first my liberty and secondly an ample reparation for the interruption i have sustained and the insults to which i have causelessly been exposed you are mistaken sir said the magistrate what you mention may be the rule of administering justice in some states they may decide if they think proper that some open act apparently of a criminal description must be alleged against a man before he can become an object of animadversion to the state but in constance as i have already told you the government assumes to act the part of a parent to its subjects i sit here not merely to investigate and examine definite acts but as a censor morum and i should violate the oath of my office if i did not lend a vigilant attention to the behaviour and conduct of every one within my jurisdiction the city of constance requires that nothing immoral licentious or of suspicious character shall be transacted within its walls your proceedings have escaped notice too long much longer than they would have done but for your late absence in cases where what is committed is merely immoral or licentious we content ourselves with sending the offender out of our walls but your case is of a complicated nature it has scandalised all the inhabitants of our virtuous and religious city unless you answer my enquiries and give a clear and satisfactory account of your wealth i am bound to believe that there is something in the business that will not bear the light the coincidence of times obliges me to connect the disappearance of your guest and the sudden growth of your fortune this connection gives rise to the most alarming suspicions i have therefore to inform you that unless you honourably clear up these suspicions by the most ample communication my duty directs me to remand you to prison and to assure you that you will not be liberated thence till you have satisfied the whole of my interrogatories think deliberately answered i of your decision before you form it your prisons i despise but i will not suffer my reputation and my honour to be trifled with i came before you willingly though i could easily have avoided doing so because i was eager to clear my fame i expected accusers and i knew i could confound accusation but what is this that you call justice you put together circumstances in your own mind you form conjectures and then without information accuser or oath without the semblance of guilt you condemn me to prison and expect to extort from me confession in defect of articles of charge i disdain to answer the only return a man of honour should make to loose conjectures and random calumnies is silence i am descended from a race of heroes knights of the cross and champions of france and their blood has not degenerated in my veins i feel myself animated by the soul of honour and incapable of crime i know my innocence and i rest upon it with confidence your vulgar citizens habituated to none but the groveling notions of traffic and barter are not the peers of st leon nor able to comprehend the views and sentiments by which he is guided you are mighty well spoken monsieur st leon replied the magistrate and your words are big and sounding but we know that the devil can assume the form of an angel and that the most infamous and profligate character can pronounce with emphasis sentiments of the purest virtue you are pleased to decide that the presumptions against you are nothing but calumnies is it nothing that having received a stranger and retained him with you for months you endeavoured to conceal this fact and never suffered him to be seen by a human creature is his final disappearance nothing is it nothing that supposing him to be dead as he probably is you denied to his remains the rites of funeral and refuse to tell what is become of the body is it nothing that upon the death of this stranger you who were before in a state almost of penury suddenly appear to be possessed of unbounded riches where is the will of this stranger in what archives have you deposited the declaration of his wealth let me tell you sir that these presumptions which you call nothing form a body of circumstantial evidence that in many countries would have led you to the scaffold as a murderer but the laws of constance which you audaciously revile are the mildest in the universe here we never put a man to death but on his own confession we simply condemn him to perpetual imprisonment or until he makes a declaration of his guilt you refuse to declare the name or country of the man whom you are suspected of murdering and then have the assurance to boast that no private accuser rises against you no sir we know there can be no private accuser where the connections of the party can be successfully concealed but shall this concealment which is an aggravation of the murder prove its security in conclusion you boast of your blood and heroic sentiments and rail at our citizens as shopkeepers and merchants let me tell you sir shopkeepers and merchants though we are we should scorn to conduct ourselves in the obscure and suspicious manner that you have done and now i have taken the trouble to refute your flimsy pretences which it was wholly unnecessary for me to do i have done with you you know your destination unless you are prepared immediately to give a satisfactory account of yourself and your proceedings finding it impossible to make on this man the impression i desired i declined entering into further parley and telling him that i should convey a representation of my case to my native sovereign and did not doubt soon to make him feel the rashness of his proceeding i withdrew in the custody of the officers who had conducted me to the scene of audience i was i confess struck with the coincidence of circumstances which the magistrate had placed in a fight equally unexpected and forcible and which i now saw calculated to subject me to the most injurious suspicions i was not disposed in the smallest degree to yield to the attack but i felt a desire to act deliberately and with caution the whole of what i had heard was utterly unforeseen and it was with peculiar anguish that i became aware of this new consequence of the strangers pernicious donation this was a consequence that no resignation no abjuration of his bequests could cure and that must be stood up to with manly courage if any hope were entertained of averting it chapter xxi the appearance of wealth that accompanied me had by this time made its impression upon my keepers and one of them now informed me that monsieur monluc an agent of the court of france who was making a tour of several of the german states by order of his sovereign had arrived the night before at the city of constance there was no representative of my country regularly resident here and i immediately felt the presence of monluc to be the most fortunate event that could have occurred for effecting my honourable deliverance selfishness and avarice it may be thought would rather have impelled the persons who had me in custody to conceal from me a circumstance calculated to deprive them of an advantageous prey but in those groveling souls from whom riches never fail to extort homage however strange it may seem the homage often appears disinterested they pay it by a sort of irresistible instinct and admiring what they covet at an awful distance with difficulty assume the courage to pollute their worship with ideas of calculation and gain i immediately addressed a memorial to this gallant soldier with whose person indeed i was unacquainted but the fame of whose spirit and enterprise had not failed to have reached me i represented to him that i was a frenchman of family and distinction that i had been seized upon and was retained in prison by the magistrates here without accuser or the hope of a trial that i had not been guilty of the shadow of a crime and that i knew the benignity and courage of my sovereign would never permit a subject of france to languish under calumny and oppression in a foreign country i added that he would do an acceptable service to king francis to whom i had the honour to be known by interfering in my favour and therefore entreated him to obtain for me immediate justice and deliverance monluc returned me an answer by the bearer of my memorial assuring me that he would lose no time in enquiring into the merits of my case and that i might depend upon receiving every assistance from him that a man of honour could desire the warmth and frankness of this answer filled me with hope for there was no deliverance from my present situation that i could contemplate with satisfaction but such a one as should be accompanied with reparation and clat three days however elapsed before i heard again from the french envoy on the morning of the fourth he announced his intention of visiting me and about an hour after arrived at the prison his appearance was striking he was tall slender and well made with a freedom of carriage not derived from the polish of courts but which appeared to flow from the manliness and active energies of his mind his hair and complexion were dark the former though he was still young rather scantily shaded a high and ample forehead his features were expressive of the sanguine and adust temper of his mind and though his eye was animated his countenance as he entered struck me as particularly solemn you are the count de st leon said he i am you sent me a memorial a few days ago complaining of the tribunal of this city i am afraid sir i can do nothing for you my countenance fell as he spoke i gasped for breath i had conceived a most favourable anticipation as he entered and my disappointment was particularly cruel i had said in my heart this is the very man to rescue my injured fame i see sir you are disappointed resumed he i have not given up the affair if i had this visit which i design as a mark of attention would be an insult the moment i received your memorial i paid the utmost regard to it if the affair had been as you represented it i know i could not do any thing more acceptable to my sovereign than interfere in your behalf i have spent the whole interval in investigating the case i have seen the magistrate who committed you i have visited the spot where your crime is alleged to have been perpetrated i have had an interview with your wife well sir cried i alarmed and impatient well sir and the result appearances are uncommonly strong against you they can scarcely he stronger but you have a right to be heard it is for the sake of discharging that last act of justice that you see me this morning great god exclaimed i overwhelmed with chagrin is if possible that my countryman the man to whom i was proud and happy to appeal the gallant monluc should believe me a murderer i swear by every thing that is sacred by the blood of him that died for me on the cross and by my eternal salvation that i am as innocent as the child unborn i am glad to hear you express yourself with this emphasis and fervour i cannot but say that to my own feelings it has great weight but i must not suffer myself as a man and still less in the public capacity in which i stand to be overcome and confounded by your asseverations there is a connected and most unfavourable story against you this it is incumbent on you to clear up and you say you have seen my wife i was distracted and overwhelmed by monlucs way of putting the question i was divided between my anxiety to be justified and the solemn mystery of the affair to which his enquiries led and i probably spoke thus from an unconscious desire to gain time yes that is another presumption in your favour madame de st leon is perhaps the most striking and extraordinary woman i ever saw of the husband of such a woman especially when he appears to be the object of her attachment i should be always inclined to think well madame de st leon pleaded for you with earnestness and affection but amidst all her ardour i could perceive that she felt there was something mysterious and unpleasant in the affair that she was unable to develope as monluc spoke i saw that i had failed in one of the main anchors of my hope i thought that no one could have talked with my beloved marguerite and have left her with the opinion that i was a murderer how did this happen was she lukewarm and unfaithful in my vindication what she continued my countryman i could see was not only unable to explain but did not fully understand it is you alone can clear the concealment of the stranger his disappearance what became of the body and your own sudden transition from poverty to wealth i was by this time fully sensible of the nature of my situation i summoned my fortitude i felt that i had no longer any hope but in the dignity of innocence you call on me for explanation replied i can you not conceive gallant monluc that i may be able to resolve your doubts and yet that i will not explanation is not the business of a man of honour he cannot stoop to it he will win the applause and approbation of mankind if won in silence he will hold on the even course of a generous spirit and turn neither to the right nor to the left to court the suffrage or deprecate the condemnation of a giddy multitude such my brave countryman have been the maxims of my past life such will be the maxims of my future i admire answered monluc at least the gallantry of these sentiments though i may be inclined to doubt their prudence but if such is your determination permit me to say you have no concern with me he who resolutely withholds explanation must arm himself with patience and either wait the operation of time or rest satisfied with the consciousness of his innocence and is that all will there not be some noble spirits who separating themselves from the herd will judge of him by what they feel in their own breasts and be drawn to him with an irresistible impulse was it not natural that i should expect monluc to be one of these it would be hard indeed if he who disdains to temporise with popularity and to vindicate himself from the ungenerous constructions of sordid minds should not by that very proceeding secure the friendship and sympathy of those whose friendship it will be most grateful to him to possess the friends of an innocent man whom a combination of circumstances has exposed to the most painful suspicions must always be few he can scarcely expect the acquittal and sympathy of a stranger i must know i must have felt and observed in a man a thousand virtues before i can be entitled to treat accumulated presumptions against him as nothing and thus then are to end my hopes in monluc he does not feel that i am innocent he does not recognise in me the countenance the voice the turn of thought of a brother a man no less incapable than himself of every thing disgraceful and ignominious be it so i will as you advise me rest upon the consciousness of my innocence a frenchman the descendant of illustrious ancestors long an exile long the victim of adversity but at all times conscious of the purity of my sentiments and the integrity of my conduct i will not suffer myself to be overwhelmed with this last desertion this ultimate refusal of justice count de st leon your appeal is full of energy in whatever way i decide it will leave an unpleasant sensation in my breast let us suppose that as a private man i could take you to my arms and dismiss every unfavourable appearance from my mind you must remember that i am here in a public character and that only in a public character am i capable of affording you assistance thus situated i am bound to resist the impulses of a romantic and irregular confidence and to do nothing of which i shall not be able to render a clear and intelligible account let us not part thus it is not the vindication of your character to the world with which we are at present concerned it is only necessary that you should furnish a sufficient ground to justify me to myself for interfering in your behalf explain to me the particulars of your case in confidence if you will but fully and without reserve i will not abuse your confidence i will make no use of your communication but such as you shall yourself approve only enable me to have a reason for acting that is not merely capable of being felt but that i may know is in its own nature capable of being stated to another it is upon me that you call to take certain measures you must enable me to judge of their propriety you are mistaken when you suppose the appearances against you to be slight it is not a slight circumstance that you profess to be ignorant of or have refused to disclose the country the connections and even the name of the stranger whom you so anxiously concealed the disappearance of his body is still more extraordinary what intelligible motive except a guilty one can i assign for that but your sudden wealth immediately after this disappearance is especially material it is a broad and glaring fact that men cannot shut their eyes on if they would the chain and combination of events that proceeds systematically from link to link is the criterion of guilt and the protector of reputation your case as it now stands is scarcely to be termed equivocal upon the supposition of your criminality all is plain and easy to be accounted for upon any other supposition it appears an inscrutable mystery place but the balance even present to me an exposition of these facts that shall make your innocence not less probable than your guilt and as i feel myself interested for you and your family and as the presumption when matters are doubtful ought always to be on the favourable side i consent to be your friend how unfortunate i exclaimed am i doomed to be your proposal is liberal and generous but i must refuse it my story is an unhappy one particulars have been reposed in my fidelity which i am not at liberty to communicate but which if communicated you would not regard as dishonourable i may be made the martyr of infamy and the abhorrence of my species i can endure adversity and anguish i can die but that which you demand from me never can be confided to any mortal ear as you please rejoined monluc the secrets of a dead man to be preserved after his death and that to the ruin of him who is their depository must i believe be villanous secrets and the secret of a villain no one is bound to observe you must further give me leave to tell you that whatever a high strained sense of honour might dictate in that point the fortune you possess is your own affair and to dissipate or not the mystery which hangs upon that is wholly at your discretion but i have already advanced as far perhaps further than circumstances or propriety could justify and there can now be no more parley between us monluc cried i i submit however harsh your decision is as towards me however painful and unfortunate its consequences i will admit it to be that which duty prescribes to you i struggle i contend no further one thing only i would willingly obtain of you that you would interpose your influence to obtain for me the society and intercourse of my family the transaction of this day will then be remembered by me with respect towards you and a melancholy regret that i could not entitle myself to your esteem i shall recollect with pleasure that i owe something to the generosity of monluc incredible pertinacity exclaimed my visitor with a voice of perplexity and astonishment what am i to conceive of you under what appearance shall i consider you in the records of my memory your silence is the indication of guilt and in that indication i ought to acquiesce yet the fortitude of your manner and something i know not what of emotion that your manner produces in my own bosom would fain persuade me you are innocent why will you leave me a prey to this contention of thought if all men constituted as i am were to feel in you as it were the magnetism of innocence shame the simple inference of understanding and the general sense of mankind would oblige them to treat you as guilty what i can however be assured i will cheerfully do for you i cannot deliver you from prison but i will not fail to obtain the mitigation you ask farewell such was the issue of my interview with monluc it was clear that my reputation was wounded beyond the power of remedy while the question had only been of a magistrate haughty supercilious insolent and unfeeling i flattered myself that the harshness of the conclusions that were drawn might be ascribed to the depravity of his character but monluc was the reverse of this man he was not less generous and heroic than the magistrate was gross and illiberal his desire to relieve me was not less apparent than the magistrates eagerness to oppress yet his conclusion was the same and was felt by me so much the more bitterly in proportion to the humanity the kindness the intrepidity and the virtue of the man from whom it flowed virtue and vice barbarism and refinement were equally engaged in the concert against me and there was no chance i should triumph in a contention with so many enemies i might now be said to have reached the end of my adventure i had closed one grand experiment upon the donation of the stranger what had it produced to me not one atom of the benefits i anticipated not a particle of those advantages which a little while ago had made the intoxications of my waking dreams its fruits had been distasteful and loathsome whether i looked to my person my family or my fame i had felt in all the miserable effects of this treacherous and delusive gift my person was shut up in prison and i was now to make an experiment whether by clandestine and secret proceedings wealth could restore to me the liberty of which wealth had deprived me my family was blasted my wife was struck to the heart and no mortal skill could restore the wound she had suffered my son was gone unaided into voluntary exile that he might shun the contagion of my follies what was i to do with the poor remains of my house forlorn dejected and wretched the wound my good name had received was of the most decisive species when i first encountered contumely at dresden and was called on for explanation by coligny the difficulties of my condition struck anguish to my soul but what were they compared with what had now overtaken me i was charged with robbery and murder with every thing that combines the whole species against the perpetrator and determines them without sense of compunction to extirpate him from the face of the earth perhaps it was only by the courtesy of the laws of this state that i was permitted my choice between an ignominious death and perpetual imprisonment i might possibly indeed escape from my confinement i might pass into a distant country i might be fortunate enough to cut off all connection between my past and my future life and thus enter upon a new career but this to a man of honourable mind is a miserable expedient with what feelings does he recollect that there is a spot where his name is abhorred where a story is told against him to excite the wonder of the ignorant and the torpid feelings of the sluggish soul a story to darken with new infamy the records of guilt and to infect the imagination of the solitary man with nameless horrors to be the theme of such a tale is no common evil no matter how far the man to whom it relates shall remove from the detested spot the spot itself with all its chain of circumstances will often recur the voices that repulsed and humbled him will ring in his ear the degraded figure he made will rise for ever fresh to his imagination he cannot ascend to any free and lofty sentiment he cannot attain the healthful tone of unblemished virtue wherever he goes he carries the arrow of disgrace in his bosom and when he would erect his head on high it reminds him of the past and stings him to the heart if the consciousness of all this would have been painful to any other man what was it to me who had been brought up from my infancy in the opinion that fame was the first of all human possessions and to whom honour and an unimpeached integrity had ever been more necessary than my daily food or than the life which that food supported what would i not have given could i have returned to the situation in which the inauspicious arrival of the stranger had found me but that was impossible if all that i had recently passed through could but have proved a dream if i could have awakened and freed myself from the phantoms of this horrible vision how happy beyond all names of happiness should i by such an event have been made what a lesson would it have taught me of the emptiness and futility of human wishes what a sovereign contempt would it have impressed upon me for wealth and all its train of ostentation how profound a feeling of contentment with humble circumstances and a narrow station would it have produced in my mind alas the conception of those advantages and that peace was the illusion and not the evils i had sustained and from which i could not escape chapter xxii meanwhile it was necessary that i should make the best of the present circumstances my heart was wounded my spirit was in a manner broken but not so utterly withered and destroyed as to make me rest supine in perpetual imprisonment i felt with equal conviction and pungency that my character and my happiness had sustained the deepest injuries but i felt it incumbent on me to collect and improve the fragments that remained for some days indeed after the conference with monluc i was sunk in the deepest dejection but as that dejection subsided i began to turn a steady attention upon the future i recollected that an eternal and inexhaustible gift deserved to be made the subject of more than one experiment before a decision was formed upon its merits i shall become wiser said i as i go forward experience however bitter will teach me sagacity and discrimination my next experiment shall be made with more prudence and a soberer gradation i will remove to some distant country where the disadvantages of my past adventures shall not follow me i will take a new name i shall then enjoy the benefit of a tyro just entering a scene to all the personages of which he is wholly unknown i shall be like a serpent that has stripped its tarnished and wrinkled skin and comes forth in all the gloss and sleekness of youth surely in an unknown land with the prejudice of wealth in my favour and no prejudices against me i shall know how to conduct myself so as to obtain honour and respect it is impossible that inexhaustible wealth and immortal youth gifts so earnestly coveted by every creature that lives gifts which if i were known to possess my whole species from the mere impulses of envy would probably combine to murder me as not able to endure the sight of one so elevated above his brethren it is impossible that such gifts should not be pregnant with variety of joy marguerite greatly contributed to raise me from the dejection into which my imprisonment and the conference of monluc had sunk me she was my better genius i had been so accustomed to receive consolation from her lips in the most trying circumstances that now the very sound of her voice was able to smooth my wrinkled brow and calm my agitated spirit i listened as to the sound of an angelic lyre i was all ear i drank in the accents of her tongue and in the dear delight my cares were hushed and my sorrows at an end she talked to me of her daughters whom she represented as about to have no protector but their father she urged me to watch over them and to take such steps as should most conduce to their future virtue and happiness she pointed out the practicability of escape and recommended to me to fly to some distant country the dreams of future prosperity from the gifts of the stranger were not hers they were all my own it was inexpressibly affecting at this time to receive consolation from her who had no consolation in her own breast who had bid farewell to all the gay attractions of the world and talked familiarly of her death as a thing certain to happen in no very long time she had lost the purest gratifications of the domestic scene she had lost her son her heart was broken yet with her dying accents she sought to dispel retrospect and inspire cheerfulness in the breast of her husband the reader may perhaps imagine that i was something too sanguine when surrounded with jailors and all the precautions of a prison i planned the nature and scene of my next residence exactly as if i had been a person at large but i took it for granted that the power of money i possessed would easily unlock to me the gates of my captivity i believed that upon the lowest calculation personal liberty was clearly included among the gifts of the stranger impressed with this opinion i fixed upon a negro a servant of the prison and who had the keys of my apartment as the subject of my pecuniary experiment the idea of applying to him had perhaps first occurred to me from the mere circumstance of my seeing him more frequently than any other attendant of the prison when i thought further of the matter i judged from the meanness of his rank and his apparent poverty that i could not have chosen better so far as related to the sum to be paid as the price of my liberty it was indeed indifferent to me whether it were large or small i had however suffered so much from the inconsiderate lavishing of wealth that i had no inclination on the present occasion to make ostentation of more than was necessary but what was of most importance to me i was desirous that my first experiment should be a successful one though not unaware of the power of gold i conceived that among persons of middling rank and easier circumstances there might be varieties of disposition and i might be mistaken in my choice some might have the whim of integrity or might place a sturdy sort of pride in showing that they were content with what they had and were too high for a bribe there might be persons who though of plebeian rank might value reputation as much as ever i had done and be of opinion that no advance of station could compensate for the name or the consciousness of dishonour these distinctions may seem an idle and superfluous refinement when it is considered that i had the power of raising my bribe to the level of any mans honesty or pride be it as great as it might and it may be thought that my offer might be so increased as to be too dazzling for mortal firmness to resist be that as it will i am merely stating the reflections that passed through my mind not entering into their vindication taking the first opportunity then of accosting this man when he was alone with me i addressed him thus my good friend are not you poor yes sir would not you readily do me a kindness if my master give me leave i will you mistake me would you be my friend i do not know what you mean sir i have been used to call the man i love my friend if you mean that you know i cannot choose whether i will be a mans friend it comes of itself can i not make you my friend that is make me love you i was surprised at the propriety of his answers i am unable at this distance of time to recall the defects of his language and i disdain the mimic toil of inventing a jargon for him suitable to the lowness of his condition the sense of what he said i faithfully report i had before been struck with a certain correctness of thinking in him but i now examined his countenance more attentively than i had ever before done and thought i could distinctly trace in it the indications of a sound understanding and an excellent heart i do not know sir continued he if i see that you are a good man i believe i shall love you but if it happened that you were good and generous to me i am sure i should love you very much you are very poor so they tell me i never had more than a shilling or two at a time in my life it is a very sad thing to be poor why yes so i have heard sir but for my own part i am always merry and gay my good fellow i will make you rich thank you sir but what good will that do me you are a servant i will make you a master of servants now that i should not like at all i am merry because i am light hearted if i had money and property to take care of and servants to direct i am afraid they would make me grave and suspicious and in every respect unlike what you see me is it possible you should be pleased with your present situation under the orders of one man in a house and obliged to play the tyrant to the rest why as you say sir there may be more agreeable situations than the life of a jail but as to being under orders i have no objection to that i never knew any other condition and therefore i am contented it is not pleasant indeed to have a master who is always scolding and dissatisfied but the gentleman i serve at present is reasonable i know how to content him and when i have done that he leaves me to please myself you offer me money now sir that is not what i call being generous i count nothing for much except when a man shows me has bowels and convinces me that he thinks justice due even to a negro i dare say however you designed it for generosity and expected something from me in return tell me what it is you want and whatever i can do with propriety you may depend on it i will do you approve of a mans being deprived of his liberty will you please to tell me what you mean by liberty you offered me just now what you called liberty and independence and i am content to be a servant would you be pleased instead of being a turnkey to have the key turned on yourself that i should not i understand the disagreeableness of that well enough for when i first entered this place it was as a prisoner if then my good fellow you were convinced that i was a man disposed to be generous to you in your own way and to deserve your attachment and love surely you would not refuse to deliver me from a situation which you have yourself felt to be so disagreeable and calamitous i understand you now sir i have already a master with whom i am satisfied and i do not wish to change my service when i was a prisoner he found out that i was innocent he got me cleared and gave me employment i am put here for the express purpose of seeing the prisoners in safe custody that is the contract between me and my master when i took the keys by that action i pledged myself to be faithful to my trust and the nobleness of my masters behaviour to me in removing me from being a prisoner to be a free servant is a double bond upon my fidelity i would sooner consent to be torn limb from limb than fail in what is expected from me you may be generous to a harmless stranger you have most reason to be generous to a man you love but if you would heap benefits upon me merely because i proved myself a villain i can only say it would be disgraceful to be the object of your favour thus saying he quitted me and withdrew from further parley the conversation in which we had engaged though i had had considerable experience in the world was altogether new to me and overwhelmed me with astonishment i found in this trial that the power of money was subject to limitations of which previously i had not been in the slightest degree aware i thought that nothing but the most extraordinary degree of resolution and self denial could enable a man to resist its enticements and i had even been told though i did not believe that every man had his price and a bribe capable of indefinite augmentation must be in all cases victorious yet here was a poor creature utterly exempt from its operation he had no sense of those attractions which so often degrade the best and convert virtue into the most shameless profligacy it cost him no effort to be honest and he uttered sentiments that would have given lustre to the most heroic character without any consciousness of their greatness what i had seen led me also to reflect on another singularity i discerned in him in the midst of the admirable i had almost said the sublime integrity he discovered for is it not a criterion of the sublime to be great without an effort he was destitute of knowledge of intellectual cultivation and all those exquisite sensations that most distinguish the man from the brute he passed on quietly in the road of ordinary life and thought not of the ambition to be wise or great to be honoured by thousands or a benefactor to ages yet unborn kings might have confessed their inferiority to this man but is he to be regarded as the model of what a human creature should be wished to be oh no but the most memorable feeling impressed upon me by this conversation was a conviction of what i had been backward to confess that knaves were the persons to whose assistance and concert i must look and that i must be upon my guard against an honest man no one was qualified to be my coadjutor till he had proved himself unworthy of all just and honourable society the friend i must seek was a man whose very soul melted at a bribe whom money would seduce to perpetrate whatever his judgment most abhorred honour and integrity in the most refined and the rudest state monluc and the negro both refused it is impossible to conceive a sensation more painful and humiliating than was this conviction to my mind i was not long at leisure for these reflections in a few minutes the master of the prison entered my apartment and with him the negro whom i had endeavoured to prevail on to assist in restoring me to liberty the master began to reproach me in very harsh terms for attempting to seduce his servant from his duty and asked me what sort of enjoyment or satisfaction a man could have in life if he could not depend upon the people he put into his employment to this i answered with sternness that i should hold no debate about right and wrong with a jailor that he might depend upon it i would leave no stone unturned to set myself free and what was more that i would be free and that for his part it was his business to keep me if he could but not to insult me i therefore insisted upon his quitting the room what use replied the fellow do you think now there is in putting yourself in a passion if i have not a right to speak to you i know what i have a right to do put you in the strong room and load you with irons i turned my back upon him and how came you said i to the negro to go and betray me i should have expected better things of you if you refused to serve me at least you needed not have endeavoured to hurt me i did nothing but my duty sir i have no wish to hurt you but it is my business not merely to take care of my masters interests myself but to see that they are not injured by any body else if he was not put on his guard you might have been more successful with the next turnkey you endeavoured to bribe you will find it more to your interest monsieur interposed the jailor to talk to me than to my servant you are determined to be free you say if that is the case and it is to happen who has so good a right to benefit by your resolution as i have my eyes were opened in a moment i saw that the knave whose rigour and sternness could not hold out against the warmth of a bribe the friend of whose assistance i was in want stood before me i do not wonder proceeded he that you preferred applying to one of my servants their honesty must be expected to be had at a cheaper market but for my part i am determined that no man shall ever pass these walls without my being the richer if then your escape is a thing that must happen let us see what you can afford to give me for it dear master interposed the negro you surely will not listen to the gentlemans offer when i refused to betray my trust it is impossible you should consent to betray yours hold your tongue blockhead said the other do not you see that monsieur is determined to escape i know he is rich though you have refused a bribe i am sure that all your fellows will not the thing will happen sooner or later in spite of every thing i can do and there can be no harm in my helping to bring about what it is impossible i should prevent a morality like this seems exactly in its place in the breast of a jailor we had already made some progress in adjusting the terms of our contract when the keeper of the prison interposed but monsieur you will please to remark that this is an affair which will be attended with difficulty whatever passes between you and me must be a secret your escape will be a thing open and notorious and you must have a confederate that i may not bear the blame of it you must therefore take my black here along with you that his flight may cause all the blame to fall upon him o pray master said the negro do not part with me i love you and will do any thing in the world if you will let me stay you saved my life for aught i know and made a man of me again you cannot think what good it does me to serve a master that has been so kind to me get you gone replied his owner you are of no use to me you are not fit for a jail you are so simple i cannot tell what to do with you indeed i do not like to go with this gentleman it will break my heart he said he would be generous and kind to me if i turned a villain i shall never be able and shall never desire to earn his kindness but you rewarded me because i was innocent he said he would make a master of me and i am better as i am i had much rather be a servant the difficulties of this poor fellow were soon silenced by the peremptoriness of his master the jailor told him that he would do him a great service by thus giving his master an opportunity of representing him as the traitor and with this consideration the negro dried his tears and with a reluctant heart consented to accompany me thus were his exemplary fidelity and affection rewarded so little do some men seem capable of feeling the value of attachment the character of the master was a singular one the meanness and mercenariness of his spirit were unredeemed by a single virtue he was avarice personified but he had found or imagined an interest in taking this negro who had been want only thrown into prison by a former tyrant for his servant and this the poor fellow in the simplicity of his heart had mistaken for an act of exalted generosity his avarice had swallowed up all his other passions and his servants had neither impatience nor insolence to encounter from him weighed therefore in the balance of the negros experience he appeared a miracle of mildness and benevolence our bargain was at length concluded and the next time marguerite came to visit me i announced to her the success of my negotiation before we parted we sent for the jailor and discussed with him the road i should take my purpose was to pass into italy and marguerite undertook by midnight to have every thing prepared to convey us to the foot of the mountains this point being adjusted the keeper of the prison left us and tenderly embracing marguerite i besought her to congratulate me upon the recovery of my liberty she had heard however of the infamous nature of the charge against me and though she yielded it no credit i could easily perceive that it rendered yet heavier the depression under which she laboured she returned my embrace the tears stole down her cheeks but she was silent i endeavoured to divert her thoughts and re animate her spirits by hinting at the new scenes before us and the distant country to which we were about to remove but in vain i will not reproach you reginald said she i will not desert my duty while i have power to perform it you may depend upon my doing every thing i am able both for the children and yourself she left me in a very melancholy frame of mind i had not expected to see her thus languid and disconsolate and upon the eve of my liberation i felt it like caprice incomparable woman she was incapable of giving intentional pain but with her exquisitely susceptible mind she was unable to support the dreadful reverse in which i had involved her or even at times to assume the gestures of cheerfulness and tranquillity gestures that at the best but ill disguised the grief within i was busily reflecting on what had just occurred when the keeper of the prison re entered my apartment i am come monsieur said he to take my leave of you as i do not at all intend to lose my place it is not proper that i should see you any more you understand me two days had already elapsed since the conclusion of our contract and i had provided myself for this and such other demands as seemed likely to be immediately impending i should have preferred indeed to have delayed this payment till the moment of my departure but what the jailor suggested appeared reasonable and i could not assign even to my own mind any cause why i should be reluctant to comply with it i paid to this wretch the price of his villany i now began to count the hours and eagerly to anticipate the arrival of midnight though the moment of my liberty was so near i yet contemplated with unspeakable loathing the scene of my confinement which was associated with the deepest disgrace and the blackest charges that are incident to a human creature i felt as if in proportion as i removed from the hated spot i should at least shake off a part of the burthen that oppressed me and grow comparatively young again time was far from moving indeed with the rapidity my impatience required but the hour of appointment at last was near and i expected every moment the faithful negro to appear and announce to me my freedom the cathedral bell now sounded twelve i heard the noise of steps along the gallery and presently a key was applied to the door of my apartment it opened and three persons whom i knew for servants of the prison entered come sir said one of them you must follow me where is my friend the negro said i ask no questions speak never a word but come it was strange that the master of the prison whose temper was so full of anxiety and caution should unnecessarily trust three of his people who might easily have been kept ignorant of this hazardous secret this circumstance however did not strike me at first so strongly as it ought to have done i had perfect confidence in his fidelity to his profligate bargain and expected every moment to meet the negro who was to be my guide my conductors led me by a way which i soon perceived did not lead to the ordinary entrance of the prison where are we going said i hold your tongue or you will spoil all replied one of them roughly i bethought me that there might be an objection to the dismissing me by the public gate i recollected to have heard that there were several subterranean outlets to the citadel i judged from the words i had just heard that my conductors were acquainted with the plan that had been formed and for all these reasons i proceeded with tolerable ease and security i was not much longer however permitted to doubt i was conducted to one of the dungeons of the prison and told that there i was to remain at first i remonstrated loudly and told them that i had been promised my liberty and not a treatment like this we know that sir replied they and that is the reason you are brought here it is our business to teach you that the greatest offence that can be committed by a man in prison is to attempt to escape the shock and surprise that so unexpected an issue to my adventure produced rendered me outrageous i was no longer able to control my fury and without knowing what i proposed i knocked down two of my attendants before they had an opportunity to secure me and rushed up the flight of steps by which we had descended the third however contrived to intercept me and while we struggled the other two came to his assistance they loaded me with fetters and chained me to the wall i was then left in utter darkness i felt myself sore with the bruises i had received in the contest but what was infinitely worse i found the expectations of freedom i had so confidently entertained baffled and disappointed marguerite and my children were at this moment waiting for me to join them they would probably wait hour after hour in vain to what cause would they attribute my failing of my appointment to what cause was i myself to attribute my miscarriage my hopes in this instance had been in the utmost degree sanguine what was i to count upon for the future was money useless in every instance in which mankind agreed to think its power unquestionable what was the source of the present catastrophe and the harsh treatment i endured was the keeper of the prison discovered and dismissed from his office had the negro gone and given information against him i formed a thousand conjectures as to what might have happened but i was unable to rest in any i had remained about twelve hours in this situation full of angry and disconsolate thoughts when the principal jailor entered my dungeon i looked at him with astonishment the cloud vanished from my understanding and i began to comprehend the solution of the enigma are you at large cried i with indignation why then am i here you are here by my orders execrable villain said i did you not promise me my freedom have you not received the price of it how dare you show yourself in my presence as i spoke i shook my chains i clenched my fists i trembled with resentment and rage if you are not perfectly quiet and reasonable said he i shall leave you to your fate and return no more nothing is more singular in a state of great mental effervescence than the rapidity with which our ideas succeed each other at such times we seem to think more in minutes than at other times in hours i felt how miserable a slave a man is the moment he falls completely into the power of another the wretch who stood before me was more vacant of human affections than any one i ever saw yet i was his creature to be moulded as he pleased a thousand injuries he could inflict upon me for which neither the institutions of society nor the extraordinary endowments i derived from the stranger could afford a remedy he might so torture my mind and baffle my wishes as to kill in me every spark of lofty adventure and generous pride my liberty might for aught i knew be for years at his disposal i felt however that my best course was to regard him with contempt and use him as i would a spade or a file to execute my purposes without suffering him to awaken my passions i immediately grew more calm and he perceived the revolution of my sentiments you seem to wonder continued he that i did not keep my engagement with you i pride myself upon being superior to the prejudices by which other men are frightened like children with a bugbear i have therefore no rule but my interest and i did not see how my interest bound me to keep my engagement with you and what became of the countess i neither know nor care i suppose she stayed all night under the walls i knew she durst not disturb the prison i felt i had still emotions to suppress i curbed my tongue but they showed themselves in my eyes how do you intend to dispose of me keep you in close custody i have got your thousand pounds the next thing for me to take care of is that i do not lose my place and for what purpose do you come to me now why to tell you a secret i have not quite determined what conduct to pursue and therefore i came here that i might have a better opportunity of judging are you not afraid that i should inform the government how you have cheated me you inform have not i got you under lock and key i warrant you i will take care what goes out of these walls to the government the countess has a licence to visit me what care i for that i can keep her at bay as long as i will she will not easily go to the government and she is not such a fool as not to know that to lodge a complaint against me is not the way to procure the liberty of a man condemned to perpetual imprisonment i can at any time trump up a story of your attempting to corrupt the turnkeys and be sure when i do i will not want for proofs that will cover any thing i can do to annoy you and answer any accusation you can make against me do you think that the word of a jailor will not be taken before that of the murderer he has in custody i can bring your own servants as witnesses three of whom assaulted me last night dunce do you think i trusted them with my secret they have nothing to tell and apprehend nothing but a plot between you and my black who has been put into the penitentiary for his offence he is my only confident and i trust him because his stupidity answers to me for his faith suppose i were to double the bribe for which you sold me my liberty what security should i have that you would abide by your bargain oh if you were to do that it would alter the case might you not then detain the money and defy me as you have done now suppose that a thing which might happen can you help yourself can you do better i saw there was no remedy and i was constrained to allow the success of this twofold perfidy it was with an ill grace and an attempt at sullenness and indifference that the jailor accepted my proposal the second thousand however had irresistible charms and in spite of himself the sensation that made his heart dance relaxed his muscles and played about his mouth he was puzzled what to think of me the facility with which i produced the sums he demanded with less apparent effort than they might have come from a duke or a sovereign prince startled and staggered him he had still his qualms and evidently doubted whether he should not raise his price a third time i saw no safety but in pertinacity and firmness and had the good fortune ultimately to check his doubtful half formed experiments i was led by the accidents which have just been related into further and deeper reflections on the power of money as well as on the nature of the situation in which i found myself placed by the legacy of the stranger my present experiment had been made upon a subject apparently the most favourable that could have been devised upon a man whose breast the love of gold occupied without a rival yet with this man i very hardly succeeded i was not indeed so blinded by the present dejection of my spirit and sickness of my heart as to imagine that i had not a secure game with this base minded wretch if i consented to play it i had only to enlarge my bribe to change it from the limited sum of two thousand pounds to the more brilliant offer of two thousand per annum and no doubt i might have led him with me to the extremity of the globe however he might have demurred however he might have doubted however curiosity whetted even to agony by the goadings of avarice might have prompted him to an incessant enquiry within himself as to the solution of my character and my powers his grasping spirit would infallibly have chained his tongue and been surety for his fidelity but i could not yet prevail upon myself to endow such groveling and noxious propensities with so rich a reward i considered in the language of the stranger that the talent i possessed was of the most momentous nature and bestowed by the governor of the universe for the highest purposes and i should have held myself unjustifiable in enriching by its means however urgent the necessity might appear the most worthless of mankind the sentiments of my tyrant varied every hour he was fickle anxious and undetermined harassed with the double fear of losing the sum already obtained and of not securing the whole of what was capable of being acquired he parted with me at last with all the pangs of a lover who witnesses the ceremony of his mistresss taking the monastic veil and being sundered from him for ever i was his fortunatuss purse and this was the last day he was to enjoy the use of it i was to him as the buried treasure of some long forgotten hoarder and he feared he should quit his digging before he had carried off every thing that the field concealed at length however he began to apprehend that he had urged the refinement of an unprincipled avarice as far as it would go and therefore in a few days the negro being already discharged from his penance he suffered us to escape together chapter xxiii having rejoined the remainder of my family we set out together for the plains of italy my first interview with marguerite after my return from dresden had been melancholy but our situation was now such as to give additional anguish to her serious thoughts she had then regarded me as ambiguous mysterious and impenetrable qualities from which the frankness of her nature spontaneously revolted she saw in me the destroyer of her son the idol of her heart she believed me an alchymist a character which she viewed as base degrading and insensible she had heard that rumour had been busy with my fame but now she saw in me a man of blasted reputation arraigned and imprisoned for robbery and murder she did not credit these imputations but did the ingenuous and noble minded marguerite de damville ever think to find herself allied to a being thus loaded with the worlds abhorrence that she should be compelled to honour with the sacred name of husband a fugitive a prison breaker and an outlaw if i had suffered these things in the defence of my children my religion or my country the case would have been widely different if while encountering the contempt of men i had carried within me the glorious feeling that what they regarded as my disgrace was indeed my immortal honour marguerite de damville beyond all women was prepared to despise their senseless blame and proudly to demand her share in such a dishonour i know there are men who will listen with fretful impatience to a detail of such sorrows as hers and who will cry out if we must be distressed give us more substantial and genuine sources of distress they will regard the dejection of marguerite as an idle wilfulness of grief better entitled to aversion than to sympathy and will tell me that nothing but the most deplorable blindness could have prevented her from discerning the happiness of her condition that she had the world before her a rich a brave and an enterprising husband with a lovely family of children that they could move from country to country and from climate to climate carrying with them the means of luxury indulgence homage and usefulness to such moralisers i write not for those who are incapable of sympathising with the delicate sensations of marguerite i am as little qualified to enter into their feelings as they into mine in the sequel of the story however it is not impossible they may meet with their gratification i am hastening to events corporeal and palpable i and my family did wander from country to country and from climate to climate with what resulting success will speedily be seen our destination at the present moment led us through the territory of the grisons and over a limb of the rhetian alps to como milan piacenza parma and pisa in the neighbourhood of which latter city we resolved to take up our immediate residence in this passage we met with few adventures that merit to be recorded in my history one however seems entitled to a place both as it tends to display the singular worth of a dumb and unpretending brute and as it is in some sort connected with the fortunes i encountered in the pisan territory it occurred in our journey over the alps one evening in the wildest and most desolate part of the mountain after having lodged my family in an inn i wandered forth to take a survey of the neighbouring scenery it was moonlight our travel of the day had been short and had left on me no impression of fatigue while the romantic appearance of every thing around tempted me to extend my excursion further than i had originally purposed stories of robberies and murders in the vicinity had been repeated to us and marguerite had employed the precaution of desiring hector such was the name which the caprice of his former masters had bestowed on my faithful negro to follow my steps and hold me in sight no anticipations of danger however disturbed my contemplations i resigned myself as all my life i had been accustomed to do to the impressions of the moment and sought to shut out memory and the world from all my thoughts the scene was inexpressibly beautiful the silence was uninterrupted and awful the splendour of the moon gave a sober and silvery tint to every thing by which its light was caught soft white clouds were scattered in the deep azure of the sky the shades were of a blackness and profundity that could not be surpassed every thing was calculated to soothe and subdue the mind to inspire a grand and expansive tranquillity the enthusiasm it spoke occupied every channel of my heart i stood still it seemed as if motion would have jarred and broken the spell that seized me i yielded with eager transport to the sentiment that shrowded and enveloped me in its ample embrace i had remained motionless for above half an hour when a sudden and eager sound burst upon my ear it seemed to be the shriek of some human creature in distress it was repeated several times my first impulse was to fly to the spot from which the sound appeared to proceed meanwhile hector came up to me and endeavoured to detain me by violence his first principle was obedience to every just and lawful command and the errand upon which he was commissioned was to preserve me from the approach of danger he represented to me the stories of banditti we had recently heard he told me that we should too probably fall in with a numerous party of these desperadoes against whom all our efforts either for ourselves or for those i was desirous to succour would be nugatory what would become of my children what would become of his mistress if my rashness were succeeded by a fatal event while he was thus speaking and exerting himself to detain me the cries ceased i believed they were those of a person assassinated i conceived that i should be the vilest of poltroons if i suffered any consideration to prevent me from endeavouring to afford to this unfortunate the relief in my power i had not advanced far before i perceived coming towards us in the same direction from which the sound had reached my ear a dog entirely black and of uncommon stature and strength he was alone having caught sight of us he increased his pace and had no sooner reached the spot on which we stood than he seized the flap of my coat and pulled it with considerable violence i was somewhat alarmed at his size and action the latter of which i apprehended to have a hostile design and having shaken him off i put myself in a posture of defence with a cane that i carried in my hand undeterred however by my gesture he returned to the attack only pulling with something less exertion of strength than he had done before more accurate attention convinced me that he had no intention to injure me and i withheld the action of hector who had raised his hand to strike in defence of his master i suffered him to guide me and after a considerable circuit which the nature of the road obliged us to take he led me to a spot where i found a man lying on the ground and weltering in his blood but with no person near to whom to impute the violence he had sustained his blood flowed copiously from two or three different wounds one of them in particular near his left breast and my first care was to stop the effusion for this purpose we stripped him of his clothes and tore his linen into bandages when we found him he was insensible but the anguish of binding his wounds revived him a little though only enough to extort from him sighs and groans this accomplished i dismissed hector to the inn to procure something in the nature of a litter by which he might more easily be conveyed within reach of effectual assistance i was now left for six hours with no other companions than the wounded gentleman and his dog upon the very spot upon which he had just before sustained so ferocious a treatment probably from the hands of banditti they might every moment be expected to return this was no agreeable notion to a person circumstanced as i was i was compelled to feel that a man possessed of boundless and illimitable wealth and of the power of repelling old age and disease did not in these advantages possess every thing notwithstanding the disappointments and mortifications i had sustained i was yet attached to life and though the bequests of the stranger had hitherto produced to me nothing but evil i still looked with almost puerile eagerness and beating of heart for the time when i might spread out the whole extent of my treasures without parsimony or the dread of reverse during the interval which i employed in these reflections the wounded man was for the most part in a state of insensibility and constantly speechless i expected his death every moment and i perceived as i thought with certainty that there was no hope of his recovery while we had dressed his wounds the dog had watched our motions with the most restless attention and now that it was over he came and licked my hands and laid himself down at my feet the least motion however so much as a rustling among the leaves startled him he rose looked round and seemed to enquire into the cause of the disturbance but he abstained from barking and every kind of noise whether it were that he was conscious of the advantage of quiet to a person in his masters condition or that he had the sense to know in the situation in which we were placed that whatever produced alarm might eventually expose us to undiscovered danger it was broad daylight before hector re appeared and several other persons in his company hector was not of a temper to have receded from any thing he undertook and the authority of marguerite had in this instance seconded his remonstrances with the surly and inactive peasants of the place i had at this time only one other male servant but when hector returned he brought with him a crazy kind of litter and a recruit of four mountaineers the wounded man still lived and was conveyed alive to the place at which i had taken up my lodging he survived three days and during the whole of that period the dog could neither be moved by force nor prevailed on by entreaties to quit the apartment of his master before his death my unfortunate guest recovered the power of speech he told me that his name was andrea filosanto and which struck me as somewhat extraordinary that he was of pisa the very place at which i purposed to take up my abode he had a brother resident in that city and had himself been about to marry a very beautiful and accomplished young lady an heiress of the house of carracciuoli in pisa previously to his marriage he resolved to make a visit to his mother who had espoused to her second husband a french nobleman of languedoc he had travelled accompanied only by one servant contrary to the persuasions both of his brother and the family of his intended bride but that servant though he had been a very short time in his employment was active ingenious and obliging and had established himself strongly in the favour of his master signor filosanto had taken with him a sum of money the produce of one years income of the dower of his mother and it was but too probable that the richness of the charge he bore had been fatal to the life of the bearer his servant had disappeared from his side not a quarter of an hour before his being attacked by the banditti and various concurring circumstances seemed to fix on this servant the accusation of being an accomplice with the murderers having heard from the unfortunate sufferer the tale of treachery of his human attendant i related to him the extraordinary example of fidelity and attachment shown by his dog the master was struck with the story i told and called the dog to him upon his bed the poor animal first leaped up upon the foot of the bed and then warily and with great caution crawled to his masters face filosanto embraced the dog who by his manner showed himself fully sensible of the purport of the action that very evening having requested me to convey his remains to the tomb of his ancestors at pisa the master expired the dog in dumb and constant grief watched by the corpse and followed the vehicle in which it was conveyed to pisa after the funeral he made the choice from which he could not be diverted of living with me and not with the brother and relations of his master to whom he was almost wholly a stranger but who would gladly have received him one of the advantages i derived from this adventure was the friendship and protection of the filosanti and carracciuoli two of the most powerful families in pisa i have not yet finished the history of my dog a few months after our establishment in the pisan territory the valet of the deceased had the audacity to appear in that city he believed himself to be entirely unknown there his master having taken him into his service during his residence as a student in the university of bologna and having ordered him previously to his projected tour into france to stay behind and settle his debts and other affairs at that place he found however an adversary in pisa that in all his anticipations had never occurred to his thoughts the dog saw him at a distance in the street ran towards him with incredible swiftness and fell upon him with savage violence and ferocity the man was not extricated from his grip till he had been severely and dangerously wounded thus assailed all the terrors of superstition and an accusing conscience seized on this devoted villain he owned who he was and confessed that he had made one among the assassins and plunderers of his master visible probably to the dog though unseen by the unfortunate filosanto he declared that he knew not what motive had brought him to pisa that he seemed to himself under the guidance of an impulse which he had not power to resist and that he rejoiced that providence had thus conducted him to the expiation of his guilt he was brought to his trial and suffered death for his crime charon such was the name by which my dog was distinguished showed himself in all his actions worthy of the character for attachment and sagacity which he had in these instances acquired he was therefore the favourite of my whole family and particularly of hector but his own partiality was with the nicest discrimination reserved for me the ruling passion of his preceding master had been the sports of the field and his leading singularity an uncommon familiarity and friendship towards his brute attendants by this conduct he had won the affections and perhaps awakened the understanding and virtues of the faithful charon i own my weakness i could not resist the assiduities and regard of this generous brute and though i had never before conceived any extraordinary partiality for creatures of his species his sagacity and nobleness of nature took a strong hold of my affection i admired his form and agility as he bounded and gamboled before me upon the plain in the midst of his gayest frolics he was all attention and the least sign i made him would instantly divert his exertions to a different pursuit he was accustomed to salute me with honest undesigning homage every morning as i came from my chamber and i should have missed his presence with heaviness of heart upon this plain and homely occasion he was the associate of my solitary walks and my companion when pensive meditations induced me to withdraw from all human society i became accustomed at such periods to observe him by my side and should have felt that all was not right if he were not there i was interested in his health his well being and his enjoyments and if any calamity befell him was prepared to feel it more severely than a wise man is sometimes willing to confess it would scarcely be necessary to add to this simple history of my faithful charon the circumstance of his having saved the life of a beautiful little boy of ten years old who had unluckily slipped into the arno and whom he seized by his garments and drew to the shore had it not some connection with what i shall speedily have occasion to relate chapter xxiv to return to the thread of my narrative which in stating these particulars i have in some points anticipated i sat down as i have already said in the environs of the city of pisa marguerite as well as myself had a powerful attachment to the retirement of rural life and i judged it equally eligible for the health and intellectual improvement of my daughters i accordingly purchased a small domain delightfully situated but of simple appearance on the banks of the arno here i proposed to remain during the indisposition of my wife which i flattered myself retirement tranquillity attention and kindness would in no long time be able to cure to this object i resolved to devote my exertions well did she merit this return from me who had restored me in the guilty ruin of my fortunes and raised me from the abyss of insanity odious and detestable in the utmost degree should i have appeared in my own eyes if i could have neglected any means i was able to devise to heal a mischief of which my own precipitation selfishness and folly were the only causes every little continual nameless care i exerted was as a drop of healing balm to the burning fever and remorse of my conscience nothing indeed could eradicate my distemper i felt the ever living worm of perpetrated guilt gnawing at my heart but my solicitudes for marguerite at least during the moments they were in action mitigated my anguish and this transitory relief however insignificant it may appear in the eyes of others i cherished beyond the wealth of kingdoms marguerite and myself appeared at this time to have changed characters she was languid indisposed in body and mind her thoughts gloomy her hopes blasted her wishes bankrupt still however she maintained her superiority to what i had been in a similar condition she endeavoured to make the best of what yet remained to her though she declined the vain attempt of forgetting what she had lost she hung over her daughters with inexpressible endearment she consoled them she reasoned with them she endeavoured to steel their minds for whatever ill might be yet in store she cultivated their understandings she breathed into them mingled sentiments of resignation and energy there was in her conversation with them a striking tone of celestial and divine her eloquence was copious her manner rich unaffected and flowing her speech simple free from exaggeration and turbulence but mild affectionate and winning it sank deep into the hearts of her hearers and seemed to give a new turn to their tempers and disposition it rendered the character of julia at once more distinctive and yet more chastised it inspired an unwonted mildness and sensibility to that of louisa and rendered the cadette of the family unusually grave thoughtful and sedate but upon me were devolved the more active occupations of our establishment marguerite had formerly been i was now the steward every kind of superintendence from which the distinction of sex did not unavoidably exclude me was resigned to me by the lovely victim of my indiscretions marguerite had been my nurse i was now ambitious to be hers i made myself the schoolmaster of my children marguerite confined her communications to general topics and the culture of the heart i initiated them in music drawing geography several different languages of europe and in every accomplishment that i believed would be really ornamental or improving to them i might it is true have hired different masters to instruct them in each of these branches and it is not impossible that they might then have been better taught though i was myself no incompetent preceptor but i had an honest artifice for my guide in the plan i adopted i was desirous of removing out of the sight of my wife every thing that might remind her of the fatal legacy the effects of which she was induced so bitterly to deplore in some particulars i may affirm of myself that i was now a better and a kinder husband than i had been in the days of our gayest prosperity or the scene of our infant loves i studied with assiduity the temper of marguerite i watched her looks i endeavoured to anticipate her every wish i meditated with care the plan of life which her simple and feeling heart if solely consulted would have led her originally to have chosen and i copied out in the whole arrangement of our household the idea painted in my mind far from us were now the ostentation and pomp of the family chteau on the banks of the garonne we lived now not to awaken admiration and envy in the bosom of guests and spectators we lived for ourselves every thing was elegant every thing was tasteful but not an article found its place in our residence that did not rest its claim to be there upon a plea of usefulness though by the nature of my situation i was superior to all restraint from a consideration of expense yet our competent board and orderly habitation approached nearer in their appearance to the honest plainness of a rustic than to the sumptuousness of hereditary nobility a table set out with striking propriety and neatness was preferred to the richness of plate and the splendour of porcelain and lustres i was anxious that marguerite should forget the change of our situation and the extent of my resources the objects of my present pursuit were obscurity and content that marguerite might forget my acquisition i was studious to appear to have forgotten it myself if a stranger had entered our habitation and surveyed our economy he would have judged that our revenues amounted to a decent competence and that we disbursed them with a judicious discretion nothing was to be seen that would have betrayed the possessor of the powder of projection we had no guests we cultivated no acquaintance we were formed to suffice to each other within our little circle and but for the importunate recurrence of disquieting reflections we should have done so to look at the exterior of our household it might have been thought that we had arrived at that sweet forgetfulness of anxious care that delicious leisure and unbroken retreat which have in all ages been the theme of panegyric to poets and philosophers but it was not so our reciprocal relations were changed and the hope of the house of st leon was no longer in the midst of us to cheer to enlighten and to warm our bosoms a life of leisure is often an active and a busy life the grand i might almost say the single object of present attention to me was the restoration of the health and tranquillity of marguerite for that i watched with unwearied assiduity subordinate to this occupation were the different arts and accomplishments in which i instructed my daughters yet neither the former nor the latter of these engagements filled up all the time of a mind so restless and rapid as mine was intervals occurred in which my attentions to marguerite would have been not soothing but troublesome and in which i could no longer impart a lesson to my daughters without relaxing and weakening the spring of progression in their minds these intervals i sometimes dedicated to chemistry and the operations of natural magic the more effectually to hide these pursuits from the eye of marguerite i occupied unknown to her a sort of grotto buried almost from human observation in a hollow on the banks of the river and which was connected by a winding path and a concealed subterranean passage with the garden of my own habitation the secrets of the stranger had given me a particular relish for this kind of pursuit there are habits of the mind and modes of occupying the attention in which when once we have engaged there seems a sort of physical impossibility of ever withdrawing ourselves this was my case in the present instance my habit was of no long standing but no reading of my story no mere power of language and words can enable a bystander to imagine how deep it was sunk into my heart how inextricably it was twisted with all the fibres of my bosom that he may in some degree enter into my situation i entreat the reader to consider what are the most imperious passions of the human mind they have rudely been described to be wealth power and pleasurable sensation how alluring to every one of us are the visionary conceptions of the mind respecting these most potent excitements but mine were no visions i had grasped them in my hand and known their reality i had felt that the wealth of the whole world was at my disposal and that i held my life by a tenure independent and imperial these are not of the class of conceptions that fade and perish from the mind we cannot wake from them as from a dream and forget that ever such things were they had changed the whole constitution of my nature it would have required a miracle greater than all the consecrated legends of our church record to have restored me to what i formerly was if then i could have resolved never henceforth to use the gifts i had received i yet firmly believe that i never could have refrained from the composition and decomposition of simples and from experiments on the nature of substances chemical and metallic i was however far from having formed any such resolution as that i have named my present forbearance to bring forth the secret treasure of my powers was purely an accommodation to the unhappy condition of my wife and i felt it as a meritorious exertion thus to postpone the use of the faculties i possessed in the mean time the amusement i sought that i regarded as properly and entirely my own consisted in these experiments while i was busied with my crucible i was able more vividly to present to myself my seeming superiority to the rest of my species i used the employments of my grotto as a sort of starting post from which to set forth in a series of intoxicating reveries not to mention that to improve in the facility of my secret operations might become a valuable subsidiary to the pursuits of my future life i took occasionally as my companion at these periods the negro of the prison of constance i found him sufficiently adapted for my purpose his innocence and implicit obedience to whomever he served rendering me secure that he would anticipate nothing that he would conjecture nothing that he would rest in what he saw that i might almost exhibit my whole process under his eye without once awakening the busy fiend of curiosity in a mind to which science had never unveiled her charms he was formed to be a pure passive machine in the hands of his employer only with this singular difference from the lifeless machine of the engineer or mechanical inventor that he was susceptible of attachment and affection as well as of a certain species of contentment and a certain species of goodness and virtue a feature of my individual character which has already frequently presented itself to the attention of the reader is the love of admiration and spontaneous deference i am at this moment ashamed of my vices and my follies but it must be recollected in the first place that they are human and in the second that i am writing not their vindication but their history in the midst of my experiments and chemical lucubrations i could not help sometimes ostentatiously exhibiting to hector the wonders of my art and those extraordinary effects which have in all ages drawn upon the more eminent operators of natural magic the reproach of being necromancers and conjurers this i did partly perhaps that my attendant might learn to look up to me with a kind of nameless respect and awe but partly also that i might divert myself with the simplicity of his nature and the gaping and motionless astonishment with which he viewed my performances if i had not done this or digressed into idle and ostentatious experiments he would otherwise have seen enough in the operations in which his assistance if not absolutely necessary was extremely convenient to have induced a person so void of the meanest european information to regard me as assisted by and in league with invisible powers the prejudice against me with which this poor fellow had been impressed at the commencement of our intercourse did not long hold out in his ingenuous mind against the more favourable sentiments which my present situation and mode of living were calculated to inspire the specimens he had hitherto seen of european society were of the most unfavourable kind his first master was a wretch of brutal disposition ferocious and insolent disdaining to reason himself and impatient of remonstrance in others this man had exercised the temper of his humble and honest attendant with every variety of savage caprice and having tired the restlessness of his own gloomy tyranny without being able to exhaust the modest and unexampled patience of his servant had finished by throwing him into gaol upon a wanton and groundless charge of dishonesty this which was intended as a further exercise of tyranny deserved to be hailed by the poor sufferer as a period of jubilee and deliverance his innocence as i have already related was speedily recognised by his new task master who accordingly exerted himself to obtain justice for the friendless victim and from a reputed thief proposed to elevate him to the rank of a turnkey hector had neither kindred nor patron to assist him the outcast of a gaol he must again have entered the world with a blasted character thus circumstanced and influenced beside by gratitude to the unlooked for liberality of his deliverer he willingly accepted the situation proposed to him with his new master who not less unprincipled was less tyrannical than his predecessor the humbleness of his hopes taught him to be contented yet in the bosom of the gaoler all his fidelity and regard could not enable him to detect one positive virtue and within the walls of the prison there had existed nothing that could by any possibility cherish and refresh the human heart the scene presented to hectors observation in our little retreat on the banks of the arno was of a very different nature to his frank and affectionate spirit it appeared a perfect paradise he had yet scarcely been acquainted with any but the refuse of mankind from the infection of whose vices his unapprehensive and invincible simplicity had been his only safeguard and he was now suddenly introduced to the presence and intercourse of the most perfect of her sex he loved her as a benefactor and he worshipped her as a god there is no receipt for begetting affection in others so infallible as a warm and susceptible heart hector accordingly soon became in a remarkable degree the favourite of my daughters his temper was naturally cheerful and gay and warmed by their encouragement it became a thousand times more so when he had completed the occupations of the day the lightness of his spirit would prompt him to sing and dance for ever he exhibited the whole circle of his sportive games for their amusement the infantine innocence of his understanding remarkably adapted him to be the butt of their little waggeries and mischiefs whatever tricks were played upon him were however tempered by the forbearance and regard his worth demanded while the obstreperous cheerfulness with which he would second their mirth when most ignorant of its occasion gave uncommon zest to the amusement and furnished eternal provocation to the prolonging and varying its features let not the fastidious reader complain of the inconsistency of this part of my picture or censure the levity of my daughters i am not writing a tragedy but a history sad grief and melancholy cannot and ought not for ever to reign in the human face or the human heart no daughters ever loved a mother more entirely more fervently than marguerite was loved by her children they were unwearied in their attention to her often was their pillow watered with tears occasioned by the sad presentiment of the loss they were destined to sustain but the human mind particularly in the season of youth has an unconquerable principle of elasticity in its frame the bow cannot be kept for ever on the stretch and when the whole soul appears to be bent down by calamity to the grave it will often surprisingly recover its vigour and renew its strength the ingenuous nature of these poor girls led them indeed occasionally to reproach themselves with these moments of cheerfulness as with a crime but it was no crime none but the uncharitably rigorous and morose will charge it upon them as a crime it interfered with no duty it diminished no affection it had no tendency to harden their hearts it was a tax they paid to the imperfectness of our nature it was a tribute of gratitude to that god who while he deals out to us the most terrible calamities fails not to mix with the copious draught some solitary drops of beneficence julia alone whose temper was constitutionally serious and soft entered little into these sports of which her youngest sister was the eternal leader and untired partaker yet even upon the grave countenance of julia they would sometimes provoke an unwilling smile which upon her countenance sat with uncommon lustre the hilarity and loveliness which hector found in the midst of my family instigated and increased the attachment he began to feel for myself he could not believe that the father of such daughters and the chosen husband of such a consort could be destitute of a title to be loved he reasoned in his own way upon the attempt i had made to corrupt his fidelity an attack which he never thoroughly digested i have reason to believe that his attendance upon my chemical processes and the wonders i occasionally showed to excite his astonishment did not tend to elevate me in his good opinion but he could not avoid witnessing in me many of the virtues of a good husband and a good father and these so new to his observation strongly impressed him in my favour the regularity of my habits and the mildness of my carriage were also calculated to win his affection and esteem never had the poor fellows affections been so forcibly called out as they were in his new situation and he would cheerfully have stretched out his neck to the assassins knife to have warded off impending evil from the meanest of us prosperity and ease have often been found the parents of wishes and inclinations unfelt before adversity is the season of sober thought calls home the erratic mind and teaches us to be cheaply satisfied but the man who has many gratifications is apt to wander in imagination from daily and familiar joys and confidently to reach after things yet untried such was the situation of hector hector was in love our sweet and simple mansion was distant scarcely more than two hundred yards from a characteristic italian village the maid of a little albergo in this place had caught his inexperienced heart he had been invited by some peasants to a moonlight festivity on the lawn of the albergo and though i should have been better pleased that my servants should decline this sort of amusement i could not have the heart to deny him it was so far as i knew the first and the last time that hector had ever resorted to it but i was deceived hector had proved the gayest and most amusing of the whole circle his cheerfulness was inexhaustible and his mirth in the utmost degree harmless and good humoured he had played a thousand antics and danced with an agility that knew no end in a word the accomplishments of hector in spite of the jetty hue that stained his face had won the heart or roused the coquetry of the plump and rosy bar maid the overtures she made and the lures she threw out were too glaring to escape the notice even of the modest hector he felt himself flattered such is human nature at suddenly becoming an object of admiration and preference to a woman whom his imagination stimulated by her visible partiality attired in a hundred charms he owned himself hers in all fair and honest fealty to the worlds end love taught hector a lesson which he had never learned before in nature he was frank and as far as fidelity to his master permitted it wore his heart as naked as his face love taught him dissimulation a vulgar footman or clown is as forward as the most empty beau in boasting of the triumphs he has gained over the female heart and in sacrificing the reputation of those who have loved him at the shrine of his vanity not such was hector he shut up his new sensations and reveries as a sacred deposit in his bosom nature worked within him and he would have been ashamed to speak and distressed to hear of emotions now felt till now never experienced his artless and ingenuous temper in this one particular assumed the guise of cunning never did he tell his love in the ear of any indifferent auditor assiduously did he avoid pronouncing even the name of her to whom he was attached in any other case he would have announced to me his inclinations and previously demanded my leave of absence for his excursions but love seemed to him imperiously to command privacy and he employed every imaginable precaution to prevent me and all human beings from knowing whither he went or that he was absent at all in one of his visits to his fair donzella he happened incautiously to drop some very remote hint of the scenes in which he had just been engaged with me in my secret grotto the curiosity of the girl was strongly roused she questioned him further he started and was terrified to recollect what he had said i had strictly enjoined him secrecy towards every member of my family my precaution had extended no further for as i have said i scarcely knew that he had the most casual intercourse with any person beyond my own roof but hector naturally dreaded that what i was so earnest to conceal from every one in my house he would be highly to blame to communicate to a stranger he therefore peremptorily refused and with many signs of distress to say another word on the subject the donzella piqued at his resistance had recourse to female arts she was cruel she uttered words of sharp displeasure and disdain she knew that a person who refused her such a trifle could not have an atom of regard for her she commanded him never to see her more unsuccessful in these expedients she had recourse to expedients of a different sort she wept she called him base false hearted and unkind she saw he was determined to be the death of her she was seized with strong fits of sobbing and hysterical affection in the midst of all this he was as unmoved as a rock of marble he interpreted every thing that passed in its most literal form he felt more severely her unkindness and sympathised more truly in her distress than perhaps any human creature would have done but no further could she gain upon him the confidence of his master was in question and he would sooner have died upon the rack than run the slightest risk of betraying it from these arts she descended to arts more congenial to the habits of her life she summoned all her skill to perplex him with cunning and insidious questions from her questions he ought to have fled but of this hector was incapable he was distressed by her severity he grieved for the unintentional pain he had caused her all these circumstances melted his heart and he could not resolve upon any thing that was not considerate and respectful towards her as the framing of artful questions was the strong hold of the donzella and she might have challenged in this article the most hoary practitioner of the quibbling bar so it was exactly the weakest side upon which poor hector could be attacked his simplicity yielded him up a defenceless prey to the assailant least of all human undertakings was he capable of detecting the various faces of a doubtful question and of guarding himself against the traps of an insidious foe it was not till the fourth interview from hectors original hint that the donzella had recourse to this species of attack and she did not withdraw her forces till she had extorted from him all he knew when hector found that all his guards were baffled and put to flight he had then recourse to the only expedient that remained conjuring her by every thing sacred and every thing tremendous not to betray a trust she had so ungenerously obtained from him she readily promised every thing he desired soothed by her compliance he determined not to mention to me the lapse of which he had been guilty it would in his opinion have been little less than treason to suspect his dulcinea of indiscretion or frailty in the breast of this miracle of nature was not his loyalty as secure as it could be even in his own why then should he betray the secret of his love which had never yet been confided even to the senseless air why should he subject himself to the inconceivable anguish and confusion of owning where my interests or where my wishes were concerned that he had been found tripping and imperfect why should he inflict a pain or cause in me a fear which he knew and he only could know was groundless thus it happened that i had one more confident of what i purposed should be secret than i was myself in the smallest degree advertised of the consequences of this indiscretion of my servant were not slow in rendering themselves visible the donzella was by no means so scrupulous or delicate in her sentiments as my humble but faithful attendant as she had given her company to hector she had had an opportunity of observing in him such integrity and goodness of heart as could not fail to extort the esteem of any human being she really honoured him she was unwilling to give him any cause of uneasiness but she had another lover perhaps she had more the laws of chastity she regarded as prejudices and believed they were never formed for persons in her situation in society she was of opinion that the more lovers she had provided she satisfied them all the more completely did she improve the talents with which heaven had endowed her few women have any secrets for the man they admit to their embraces in an hour of amorous dalliance she communicated to agostino the ostler all that she knew of the conjurations and spells of monsieur boismorand such was the name i had assumed upon my entrance into italy her communication was probably attended with cautions imitated from those with which hector had so industriously loaded the donzella in the preceding example perhaps the illustrissimo agostino had another mistress with whom he thought it would be unjust to practise greater reserves than the donzella had done with him be that as it will the rumours which were whispered to my prejudice speedily got air and it may be were repeated with the greater avidity on account of the mystery that attended them and the injunctions of secrecy with which they were accompanied chapter xxv italy may be considered as the very focus and parent of superstitious credulity the materials which hector had furnished after all the interrogations of the donzella were slight compared with the superstructure which was presently erected on them my grotto was said to be the appropriated haunt where a thousand devils held their infernal sabbath the terrified imagination of the rustics listening with a temper horribly distracted between curiosity and alarm created to itself fictitious howlings and shrieks and saw pale and sulphureous flames dancing upon the surface of the stream poor hector was early the victim of their cruel and untamed ignorance they believed that the peculiarity of his complexion rendered him a singularly agreeable intercessor between me and my infernal familiars the colour of charon was similar to that of my confidential attendant and he like hector fell under the calumnious misconstructions of the affrighted villagers conspicuously noble affectionate and useful as he was the jaundiced eye of superstition metamorphosed him into a devil the storms of thunder and lightning to which the climate in which i resided is particularly subject acquired new terror from the ill fame which now pursued the name of monsieur boismorand at those times the shapeless form of monsters vomiting smoke and flames were visible to the neighbourhood sometimes scudding along the blue tops of the distant hills and at others with audaciousness incredible brushing even at the elbow of the almost lifeless clowns and dairy maids and then suddenly dissolving into air their place no longer marked but by the noisome and deadly stench they left behind all the misfortunes of the district were imputed to me the mortality of cattle the convulsions and death of children and the pale and lingering decay of persons recently advanced to an age of puberty innocent and blameless was my conduct to all around us often was i forward and eager for the relief of the poor and afflicted never was i the author of the slightest inconvenience or prejudice to any yet nothing merely human could be hated in the degree in which i was hated few were daring and intrepid enough to repeat the very name i bore and when it was inadvertently pronounced it produced through the whole extent of the astonished circle an involuntary and supernatural shudder agostino the first lover who had made an impression on the heart of hectors donzella was as i afterwards found a fellow of a gloomy and ferocious disposition a true italian spadaccino determined that none should perpetrate an affront against him with impunity but should expiate in some refined and cruel vengeance the levity by which they had been so unfortunate as to give birth to his hatred he by no means relished or approved the liberal and good humoured sentiments of the donzella often had they inflicted on him the darkest torments of jealousy nor had he failed at least in one preceding instance to make his rival the victim of his resentment the donzella however went on in her career she was light of heart gay in temper and careless of consequences she had always hitherto succeeded by playful blandishments or more serious demonstrations of contrition in mollifying the temper of her brute and every pardon she received operated with her as a new permission to offend she did not sufficiently consider that she was thus continually raising to a higher pitch the frenzy of his malice hector in the mean time was utterly unconscious and ignorant of the perilous situation in which he stood while to the apprehension of agostino the giving him a negro for a rival whom his pride regarded as belonging to an inferior species of beings and his devout ignorance likened to the leader of the infernal squadrons was the last and most intolerable insult his malice was ingenious and subtle he disdained the vulgar revenge of stabbing his antagonist in the dark and supposing that his enmity could be gorged by a blow when the venom of his nature was thoroughly put in motion nothing could restore it to quietness and tranquillity but some mighty stroke to excite the wonder of every bystander and that should leave behind it a track of desolation never to be filled up again and erased he heard therefore with unsated appetite and eager joy the tale of necromancy and infernal machination repeated to him from hector by the donzella the impression which the narrative produced upon him was a mixed sentiment of transport at the apprehension of such an instrument of vengeance and of palpitating hatred superstition teaching him to believe and to view with abhorrence that which he desired to render tenfold more an object of faith and aversion to his neighbours he struck an auspicious and august alliance between his revenge and his religion his religion exciting him to exterminate that the destruction of which would produce inexpressible gratification to his revenge the darkness of his spirit led him to proceed with double caution and vigilance in his correspondence with the donzella he discovered nothing to her of the dark project which was engendering in his mind and only betrayed so much of his superstitious feelings and fears as by giving new emotion might stimulate her to gratify his curiosity and her own by a detection of further particulars he was assiduous in the underhand and sinister propagation of the tale to which he did not fail to give his own colouring and affix his own feelings he was desirous that the train should be laid in silence and that the explosion he designed should be free from all pre signification of the event thus an individual of whose animosity i had no apprehension and the meanness of whose appearance would probably have made me neglect all precaution against him gave method and direction to an evil of which however upon a review i am not inclined to doubt i should have been the victim if the enmity and industry of this individual had been wholly withdrawn the mischief was long in preparation before i received in any way the slightest intimation of the predicament in which i stood the first circumstance at all calculated to excite alarm in my mind was the singular manner in which i found myself regarded if i entered any of the neighbouring villages or met the rustics and their dames as i strayed along the roads or the fields they fled my approach deserted the streets and carefully shut themselves up in their houses till i had passed where it was impossible to avoid me they bowed themselves to the earth in the most submissive guise before me while the most lively terror was painted in their countenances dreading lest they should excite the resentment of a tremendous and inexorable foe these tokens however were far from inspiring me with a conception of the truth they perplexed they astonished they distressed me sore as i was with my recent afflictions my mind was but too fully prepared for anticipations of evil i had suffered from suspicions i had suffered from calumnious imputations i had suffered from the malignant effects of popular rumour had i yielded my confidence to any person but such a one as hector it is probable my suspicions would have turned on that side but my reliance on him was not less than that which alexander the great yielded to philip the physician i knew his rectitude his simplicity his fidelity and the singleness of his heart and i could not harbour the shadow of a doubt respecting him my reliance was of that entire and perfect sort which did not express itself by a recollection of the physical possibility and an acquittal founded in deliberation but by a total vacancy of doubt or of retrospect that way directed just such as the state of my mind would have appeared if the thing had been naturally impossible i was not however ignorant and raw enough to be deceived by the exterior of homage i have described i sufficiently knew that what i beheld was the offspring of hatred to feel ones self hated is in all instances a painful and humiliating state of the human mind to me it was especially so i was not formed to retaliate this species of injury i could not hate in my turn i was formed to love i could not look upon my species with dark and gloomy contemplations i was prompt to admire their virtues and perhaps even too prompt to extenuate their errors it may i believe be laid down as a rule that they who cannot hate can least endure to be made objects of hatred fettered however as i now was by the tenderest consideration for the health and tranquillity of marguerite i thought it best to temporise and submit in silence my principal anxiety was to hide these symptoms from the notice of my family this i could not completely effect some of them were too glaring and obtrusive entirely to escape the observation of my daughters in their walks but the filial forbearance they felt towards their mother led them implicitly and without any concerted plan to concur with me in my exertions for her quiet the animosity of agostino was restless and inextinguishable his plans did not terminate in exciting against me a secret and covered abhorrence they aimed at nothing less than my utter destruction the next exertion of the conspiracy which was engendering against me was of a tragical nature it happened one night after all my family was retired to rest and i was myself sunk into a slumber that i was suddenly alarmed at the report of a musket which seemed to be fired almost under the window of my chamber this was a very singular circumstance and calculated to convey an impression of danger i leaped from my bed and ran to the window the night was extremely dark and every thing seemed perfectly quiet presently i discerned a glimmering light like that of a lantern which however appeared to be gradually retiring to a greater distance i was not thus satisfied but determined to hasten down stairs and investigate the cause of the disturbance marguerite who had heard the firing of the musket as well as myself now called me to her and entreated me not to expose myself to unnecessary danger in compliance with her remonstrances i promised though unwillingly not to go out into the court or upon the lawn but to content myself with examining the state of every part of the house when i came to the staircase and the hall i found that the alarm had communicated to almost every person in the family who presently assembled round me we patroled the house but found every thing in the situation in which it had been left and nowhere any appearance of violence i opened several of the windows but all was darkness and silence having thus far satisfied myself i listened with a degree of amusement to the conjectures and sage remarks of several of the servants a rank of society who may usually be found to derive a degree of enjoyment from incidents of this sort which for the moment strikingly tend to level all artificial distinctions and confer on every one the liberty of uttering his reflections without apprehension or constraint i did not however feel myself entirely easy the circumstance which had just occurred combined with the forebodings which had lately impressed me had filled me with undefinable terror and alarm hector would willingly have gone over the grounds contiguous to the house to see if he could discover any thing that related to or could explain the incident but i had promised marguerite that i would search no further and the temper of my mind would not suffer me to expose another to a danger which i abstained from encountering in my own person it was more than an hour before the conclave in which we were assembled broke up and every one retired fatigued with attention and prepared to fall into the soundest sleep my dreams were uneasy and disturbed my mind was in a tumult of imaginary calamities and i passed the greater part of the night in a state of singular anxiety in the morning i was scarcely sunk into a refreshing slumber before i was suddenly roused from sleep by a repetition of shrieks of astonishment and distress i put on my clothes as quickly as i could and hastened towards the spot from which the sounds appeared to proceed the first object i beheld was the little boy of ten years old whom charon had a short time before dragged out of the river stretched along upon the lifeless body of this faithful and generous animal the musket the report of which had alarmed us the night before had no doubt been aimed against charon and the greater part of its contents appeared to be lodged in his body as no further sound had succeeded the firing he had probably been killed on the spot he was at a small distance from the house near a private footpath where he had been found in the morning by the lad whose life he had recently preserved the poor boy had not at first understood what had happened to his benefactor but only thought him asleep and prompted by affection for the generous creature had quietly sat down by him till he should awake he had not sat long however before he discerned about him the marks of blood he put his hand to the wound the animal stirred not he passed to his head he saw his eyes fiery and starting and his lips distorted he endeavoured to awake him as one would awake a human being to whom some mischief had happened of which he was not aware all his efforts were fruitless he found his body motionless and his joints stiff in death the apprehension of what had occurred then suddenly flashed on his mind he burst out into shrieks of astonishment and anguish hector was the first person who caught the sound and hastened to the spot i immediately followed the poor negro who in the innocence of his heart was uninitiated in the proud distinctions by which civilised man is taught to place so vast a barrier between the human nature and the brute was struck speechless with sorrow and amazement he recognised the dead being before him for his fellow creature he recollected in him his friend his companion his intimate acquaintance between whom and himself there had for some time passed an uninterrupted reciprocation of acts of kindness and assistance a morose and fastidious reader perhaps will ask me why i lay so great a stress upon so petty and insignificant an incident as the death of a dog it might have been little to other persons it was not little to us let the reader recollect his ingenuity in procuring aid for his dying master his gratitude to the person by whom that aid was afforded and his unconquerable antipathy to his masters murderer these are not common traits there are many men whose premature fate has been the most unrelentingly avenged that in moral and useful qualities could not have stood the comparison with my generous charon it surely was no common cause for regret that a creature who had distinguished himself by a conduct so peculiarly admirable should have encountered so premature and unmerited a fate his conduct the reader may in some degree comprehend and appreciate but i should in vain attempt to delineate those admirable qualities in this faithful domestic which do not fall within the province of narrative and which to have justly appreciated you must have been personally and familiarly acquainted with him beside ours was a family of love as we were affectionately attached to each other so we never admitted a servant under our roof who did not prove himself by his conduct utterly unworthy to whom we did not extend a share of that friendship and affection which seemed to be the right of every one that dwelt in our family feeling does not stay to calculate with weights and a balance the importance and magnitude of every object that excites it it flows impetuously from the heart without consulting the cooler responses of the understanding there was another circumstance which rendered the catastrophe of this generous animal of great moment to us it was a clear proof that there was somewhere a strong animosity at work against his master it was impossible he could himself have provoked his fate never was a creature more gentle and inoffensive though his bulk was great and his strength uncommon the energies he possessed were always employed in acts of justice and beneficence never in acts of aggression but if a hatred were at work so busy and fierce as to prompt an action like this how were we to estimate it what was its source and whither did it tend these were very interesting and serious considerations we however dwelt for some time longer in the centre of general antipathy and abhorrence without being able in the smallest degree to explain to ourselves what we saw as we knew not in what we had offended we were unable to atone for our fault or even to guard ourselves against the repetition of it nor were we by any means prepared to comprehend the extent of our danger happily marguerite whose health was now in a rapid decline was least exposed to the observation of this new mischief though she felt enough of it to confirm her in the sentiment that she had nothing fortunate and happy to look forward to in the small remainder of her existence there was indeed one idea perpetually present to her which rendered the impression of ordinary occurrences extremely feeble upon her mind charles charles wandering alone in the world unknowing and unknown without a friend a relative a counsellor or a protector without money and without a name this melancholy image followed her wherever she went haunted her nightly in her dreams attended her in all her occupations filled all her intervals of leisure and though she laid it down as a law to herself never to repeat his beloved name in my presence she could think of nothing else chapter xxvi it was no long time after the death of charon that hector came home one evening in a state of the most violent anxiety and trepidation he burst upon me in my study where i was sitting alone buried in one of those deep reveries which especially since the legacy of the stranger had been among the most frequent habits of my mind his perturbation was such as to render it impossible for him to impose on himself the smallest degree of caution and restraint the noise he made in entering the apartment startled me i looked up and perceived his features swelled his face bruised and his garments disfigured with blood for heavens sake hector exclaimed i what is the matter he answered not he advanced towards the upper end of the room he took down a pistol one of those which i always kept loaded in my apartment he came towards me he fell upon his knees he tendered the pistol to my acceptance hector cried i what am i to understand what is the meaning of this kill me dear master for christs sake i entreat you to kill me i took the pistol from his hand it pointed towards the floor and will you not kill me in a mournful accent exclaimed he what have you done that deserves that i should kill you kill me only kill me pray kill me he spread out his hands towards me with a gesture of intreaty hector what means this agitation what has happened you terrify me beyond expression must i speak replied he must i be the accuser of my guilty self he burst into an agony of tears would i were dead would i had been torn into a thousand pieces before this had happened indeed sir i am innocent i thought no harm indeed it is not my fault what have you done whence come these bruises and this wound it is all my fault it is all my doing nobody else why will you not kill me hector i cannot bear this uncertainty recollect yourself be pacified and tell your story will you forgive me forgive you what what have you done to deserve my anger no no i do not wish to be forgiven i only wish you to abhor to detest to curse and to kill me this is beyond all patience i never loved any body but you and my mistress and my dear young ladies i never did any body else the least atom of mischief and now my folly will be the ruin of you all pardon me sir i will torment you no longer i will get the better of myself and tell you all that has happened he then informed me though with many breaks and passionate interruptions of what he had just discovered my evil repute as a necromancer the many strange and terrible stories that were circulated of me the antipathy universally entertained against me the active ferociousness with which this antipathy was accompanied and the consequences that he feared would result he ascribed the whole to his own imprudence and to the particulars which the superior cunning of the donzella in spite of his invincible refusal to acquaint her with a single circumstance had wrung from him hector had collected several of these particulars accidentally from a neighbouring rustic and had been vehement in my defence while they were eager in debate others had joined them but hector had found them all opponents not one a supporter irritated with the contest and the opprobrious language heaped upon himself and his master hector had been provoked to strike the most insolent of the disputants immediately several had fallen upon him at once and it was owing to the uncommon strength and dexterity he possessed that he had escaped alive out of their hands beside innumerable blows with fist foot and stick he had received two or three stabs in different parts of the body from the knives with which the italian is too much accustomed to assail his adversary it was easy to see that the gallant and generous defence of hector had considerably augmented the danger of my situation they dismissed him with a thousand execrations against both him and myself and vows that they would signalise their vengeance by setting fire to my house having related his story hector concluded with again earnestly conjuring me to kill him that so he might expiate the imprudence and folly by which he had made himself the author of my calamity the excessiveness of the poor fellows distress excited me to employ every effort to pacify his mind hector said i you have been very imprudent but i foresee no such consequences as your terrified imagination has led you to forebode the idle threats of clowns in the midst of their brawls are entitled to little regard i am not so weak and infirm of soul as to be moved from my tranquillity by their senseless prate i entertain no doubt of your fidelity and affection i am not angry with you the fault you have been guilty of arose from no defect of vigilance or attachment you did what you could and where you failed it was only in that to which your powers were not commensurate you have done well and wisely now in acquainting me with particulars and the whole extent of the danger doubt not but i will employ such precautions and be so awake to my situation as to forestall the possibility of mischief thus i endeavoured to assuage honest hectors perturbation but with no adequate effect he hung his head in sorrow and refused to be comforted shame and terror assailed him together and he knew not how to support their united pressure he intreated me not to lull myself in fancied security and fall blindfold on my ruin he entreated me not to forgive him my clemency and forbearance served only to make him regard with greater horror the crime of which he had been guilty if however i refused to punish him and by penance or death to lighten the remorse that hung upon his heart he would at least devote himself in opposition to the evil he had created and die rather than it should touch a hair of our heads this idea he seemed to view with some complacency but the pleasure it gave was a glimmering and momentary light he could not remain in any place for an instant he wrung his hands with anguish and exhibited every feature of the deepest despair i examined his bruises and wounds the latter of which though attended with a copious effusion of blood did not appear to be dangerous i warned him to be guilty of no further indiscretion to betray nothing of what had happened to any one of my family and to engage in no further controversies and broils in my vindication though i endeavoured to make light of what i heard in compassion to the distress of my servant yet when i came to reconsider the subject in solitude it by no means appeared to me in a light and trivial point of view one part of hectors story had related to the death of charon who i now found had owed his fate to the superstition of my uncultivated neighbours i had always entertained a formidable idea of the character of an italian populace whom i regarded as more suspicious sanguinary and violent than any other race of men in the world i deplored my fate that exposed me to their rage i deplored my folly that had admitted any confidant into my individual pursuits though my confidence had been so limited and its receiver so trustworthy that i could not have imagined any evil would have resulted i determined that i would not expose myself to the risk of such sinister consequences as in my opinion might in my present situation easily overtake me i grieved for the tender health and the doubtful state of mind of my beloved marguerite which alone opposed themselves to the adoption of an immediate change of scene in the state of her health i had been grievously disappointed i had looked for amendment i found decay the decay however was gradual almost imperceptible from time to time i had even flattered myself that the progress was in an opposite direction but the delusion was soon banished another difficulty arose in addition to the rest marguerite appeared pregnant a circumstance that now first presented itself after a cessation of ten years the morning after the accident and disclosure of hector i went to pisa determined to consult with the marchese filosanto elder brother of the unfortunate andrea who was probably more accurately acquainted with the italian character than myself and understood the shades of that character as they were modified in the particular territory in which i resided the marchese was a man universally admired for subtlety of reasoning vigorousness of comprehension and refinement of taste in the structure of his mind he was scarcely an italian he had resided several years in england and was the intimate friend of henry howard earl of surrey who some time after fell a victim to the jealous tyranny of his native sovereign king henry the eighth the marchese was frank generous and disinterested and possessed more fully the affections of every one within the circle of his friendship than any other man i ever knew he was of a sanguine temper always contemplating the world on its brightest side and from the generosity of his own heart incapable of crediting a distant danger or of discerning the storm in the embryo cloud where it was silently engendering in the conference we held i was influenced too implicitly by my consciousness of his integrity and the gigantic powers of his mind and did not sufficiently advert to those peculiarities in his temper which i have now described the external facts with which the narrative of hector had furnished me i fully detailed to him as to my particular pursuits i contented myself with stating that i indulged freely in the study of chemistry and was of those persons ordinarily accounted visionaries who amused themselves with the expectation of finding the philosophers stone having heard my story to an end the marchese ridiculed my apprehensions he saw nothing in the facts that alarmed me but a cowardly superstition whose utmost flight reached no higher than the shooting a dog and a squabble between a boisterous rustic and a servant too acutely sensitive for the reputation of his master he assured me that the days of such superstition as i contemplated were long since past and that his countrymen less deserved the imputation than any others as living at the very centre and source of catholic imposition they saw deeper into the mystery and were not exposed to the advantage which distance possesses for augmenting our reverence he expatiated with great eloquence on the vice of a suspicious temper a spirit of alarm and continual apprehension like the jealousy of lovers he said made the meat it fed on it brooded over plots that had no existence but in the wanderings of a disturbed imagination it was continually interrupting the quiet of its owner and the tranquillity of society and for the sake of avoiding imaginary evils often plunged into such as were real he advised me to go home and be contented he recommended to me to clear up the clouds of my mind and cultivate a light heart a cheerful temper and a generous confidence in the honest sympathies of mankind in fine he bade me continue my pursuits avoid clat and trust in his sagacity that no ill consequences would ensue the remonstrances of the marchese filosanto led me to suspect that i had been idly credulous i had too easily participated the feelings and apprehensions of a poor uninstructed negro and had suffered the secret griefs that brooded in my heart to discolour my perceptions and aggravate the features of circumstances in themselves trifling or indifferent i began to be half ashamed of the gloominess of my conceptions i could not alas follow the advice of the marchese as to the cheerfulness of my heart but i could exert myself to prevent my present melancholy from disfiguring to me every thing i saw the influence exercised over my conceptions by persons of eminent intellect has always been great not that the judgment i formed of the powers of my own mind was peculiarly humble but i reasoned thus perhaps the person i consult is as well informed in the subject under consideration as i am in that case his decision is as fully entitled to attention as my own and thus without cowardly self contempt on my part the general balance of the argument was materially altered perhaps without being on the whole my superior he may be more competent to this particular question in either case my idea of its merits became perceptibly modified i never listened to the sentiments of a man of talents when they differed from my own unless where he was evidently visionary and irrational without being shaken as to the credit due to my own view of the subject such then was the effect produced on me by the marcheses expostulation i shook off my apprehensions and laughed at my fears i was ashamed of the want of gallantry that had possessed me when i meditated flight from so trivial a menace i concluded that dangers particularly such as arise from the irrational passions of a capricious multitude were increased when symptoms of apprehension discovered themselves and abated when received with neglect or repelled with a magnanimous serenity chapter xxvii meanwhile the unrelenting agostino was fixed in his purpose and incessant in his machinations he believed that the destructive mine was now sufficiently prepared and that he might proceed in all surety to the ultimate explosion he apprehended that he had advanced too far to retract that the death of charon and the assault upon hector were calculated sufficiently to announce what was to follow and that it would be injudicious and idle to grant me much respite for reflection the passions of his associates were wrought up to a frenzy of horror and needed only a bold and artful director to urge them to any point of fury and destruction implicitly as i had confided in the decision of the marchese i had speedily reason to know that it was the dictate of too sanguine and presumptuous a spirit on my return from his palace and on several subsequent occasions i found the manners of the populace altered respecting me they no longer viewed me with a sort of reverential awe or fled my approach they insulted me with their eyes they muttered curses upon me in a voice sufficiently audible to be understood they broke forth in gestures of abhorrence and derision they regarded me with looks of ferocious hatred and when i had passed them their murmurs gradually swelled into shouts of triumphant contumely these symptoms however were progressive each day became more odious and intolerable than the last they who have never been placed in a situation like mine will never be able to do justice to my grievance they will perhaps say that the calamity i now endured was a trifling one and that a weak mind only can be elevated by the acclamations and huzzas of the multitude or depressed by their hisses and scorn i did not and i could not feel it so there is no pleasure more congenial to the human heart than the approbation and affection of our fellows i call heaven to witness that i could mount the scaffold surrounded with an innumerable multitude to applaud my fortitude and to feel as it were on their own neck the blow that ended me and count it a festival but i cannot bear to be surrounded with tokens of abhorrence and scorn i cannot bear to look round me through an extended circle and see the impatience of despite in every face man was not born to live alone he is linked to his brethren by a thousand ties and when those ties are broken he ceases from all genuine existence their complacence is a food more invigorating than ambrosia their aversion is a torment worse than that of the damned while i write i seem again to hear resounding in my ears the hootings and clamours of these infatuated peasants when heard indeed they went to my heart and sat there colder than the aspics venom they rose to my throat with a sensation bitterer than wormwood they unstrung all my muscles and nerves i could not stay i could not fly i wished myself buried deep in the centre of the earth i felt something worse more revolting more opposite to all the prejudices and propensities of the soul than annihilation i have known in various situations and conditions of human life what it was to be distressed to be dejected to be miserable but never in any other situation have i felt a misery so concentrated so gnawing and insufferable i began however like the critics i am figuring to myself to despise the pusillanimity of my submission and to believe that if i would only make a stand and turn round upon my enemy i should subdue him this resolution i could with difficulty have taken in the moment of attack it was formed in an interval of retrospect and reflection having formed it the contempt i should have felt for myself would have been too exquisite if i had failed to put it in execution i was not long at a loss for an opportunity in one of my walks i found myself pursued by a numerous populace with a peculiar degree of inveteracy i yielded for some time till i came to a place that appeared convenient for the purpose of haranguing them it was a bench placed upon a rising ground and sheltered behind by a thicket which had been erected for the purpose of commanding a neighbouring prospect i stopped i stepped upon the bench i waved my hand towards the multitude they perceived my purpose with some degree of confusion and surprise they drew nearer do not listen to him do not hear a word he has to say cried some of them oh hear him hear him exclaimed others i obtained an audience what is the cause said i of all this hatred and persecution because you are a wizard a necromancer a dealer in the black art because you are in league with hell and have sold yourself to the devil answered twenty voices at once hear me replied i and i will convince you of my innocence but hear me in silence and do not interrupt me for myself i have no belief in the existence of such an art this remark produced a general groan why should i have sold myself to the foe of mankind what could he give me that should compensate me for consigning myself over to him for ever hereafter the power of exhibiting strange and extraordinary tricks what a pitiful recompence but if i had bought this power at so dear a price should i hide it should i not take every opportunity of exciting your reverence and astonishment who has seen me perform any wonderful feat i live quietly among you and give no cause of offence to any i live retired in the midst of my family i form no party or connections i do not intrude into any of your affairs political or private i do not even enter into conferences with any of you unless induced by the apparent occasion of doing some good and benevolent action quit then this ungenerous persecution do not turn the fury of your resentment upon a harmless stranger you are italians the most polished and ingenious people on the face of the earth the most glorious monuments of art in building in statuary and in painting are to be found in the midst of you ancient italy governed the world by her arms modern italy governs the world through the medium of that pure and sublime religion of which providence has graciously made her the repository do not stain the glory of this character show yourselves worthy of the honour with which your name is heard in every corner of the habitable world while i was yet speaking a large clot of mud reached me and struck me on the face and the upper part of my breast i calmly endeavoured to free myself from its effects with my handkerchief and looking round me demanded in the sacred spirit of conscious innocence how have i deserved this treatment thus far i had been heard with a doubtful sentiment of murmur and approbation and i began to feel that i was rather gaining ground upon my audience but this new insult seemed to turn the tide of popular impression in an instant villain renegado accursed of god i heard from every side did not you bewitch my cow did not you enchant my child have not you killed my daughter down with him exterminate him do not suffer him to live i continued my efforts to be heard it was a critical moment a last experiment upon the power of firmness and innocence to control the madness of infuriated superstition it was in vain i was deafened with the noise that assailed me it was no longer shouts and clamours of disapprobation it was the roaring of tigers and the shriek of cannibals sticks stones and every kind of missile weapon that offered itself fell in showers around me it seemed a sort of miracle that i escaped instant destruction i eluded their pursuit after some time i ventured to return to my own house i had in the interval terrified myself with the idea that having missed my person they might have hurried thither and executed some terrible vengeance on my helpless family i found them however in safety the mob had for this time contented itself to disperse without further mischief as soon as it was dark i hastened to pisa and related what had just occurred to my friend the marchese he was surprised but he still adhered to his opinion he had never supposed he told me that a noisy and clamorous mob was a proper subject upon which to make experiment of the energy of truth and he laughed at my attempt to reason them out of their superstition but they meant nothing by all that had passed it was the mere foam and fury of a moment poured out with vehemence and then dissipated in air a certain set of politicians had for their particular ends represented a mob as a terrific and formidable engine alas they were rather to be pitied than condemned there was no malice in their hearts they were in reality a mere material machine led on without reflection and when they had committed a momentary ravage astonished themselves the most at the injury they had perpetrated they were as light and variable as a feather driven with every breath and nothing could argue greater obliquity of intellect than to suppose because they were in a certain temper and sentiment to day that they would be found in a similar temper and sentiment to morrow the marchese however wished he said to relieve me from the apprehension of this imaginary danger and therefore offered me the whole suite of his servants for the defence of my house he added that among his friends and retainers in the city of pisa he did not doubt in an hours time to be able to raise a troop of four hundred men and whatever power of that sort he possessed he assured me was wholly at my service i was not convinced by the marcheses arguments but i declined his offer i could not bear to think that blood should be spilled and the lives of these poor ignorant wretches sacrificed for the preservation of a thing so worthless in my eyes as the local property i possessed i therefore told the marchese that i might perhaps wait yet a day or two longer before i formed my resolution but that the instant i saw one fresh symptom of the hostility of the villagers i was determined to take my family with me and remove far beyond the reach both of their terrors and their hatred i staid two hours with the marchese and then set out to my own house the way i took was by a private road open only to the neighbouring gentry but of which my servant carried the key it led along the higher ground and commanded a view of the common highway considerably before i reached my own habitation i was struck with the appearance of persons passing in considerable numbers and in a tumultuous manner along the public road some of them were armed with clubs and others with torches their march however led not towards my house but in an opposite direction i mended my pace terrified with a sort of vague apprehension of what might have happened though i did not disguise to myself that what i saw was not precisely that which i might have expected to see if they had been returned from demolishing my property and burning my house when i arrived i found indeed that no mischief had been actually committed but that i was indebted for the preservation of my house and perhaps for the lives of my wife and children to the sagacity and presence of mind of bernardin the servant of my early years my residence had been the object against which the march of the populace had been directed bernardin perceiving their intentions had with great difficulty prevailed upon hector to keep out of sight nothing could be more adverse to the feelings and inclination of my faithful negro but bernardin having convinced him that his appearance would only exasperate the rage of the assailants and that perhaps every thing of importance to his masters service and happiness depended at present upon his concealment hector yielded to his representations this accomplished bernardin next assembled the gardener and one or two labourers in my employment who happened to be at hand and having furnished them with fire arms stationed them at different windows in the front of the house with these preparations when the mob arrived he resolutely told them that he would fire on the first person that attempted to break in they were staggered furious as they appeared the moment before this threat held them in awe they paraded two or three times round the house clattering their arms and pouring out vehement execrations and then withdrew solemnly promising that they would return the following night and level the house with the ground i no longer yielded the smallest degree of credit to the unsuspicious and confiding philosophy of the marchese filosanto i sent off my wife and children before daybreak for lucca determined to take shipping at the first convenient port and pass over into spain i was little solicitous for reasons with which the reader is already acquainted about my property and moveables i had no motive to induce me to fetter and clog my retreat at this hour of peril and terror with a single article of rarity and price my furniture indeed was not splendid but it was handsome and valuable and the indifference with which i resigned the whole to the mercy of chance was a matter of some surprise to the persons around me my servants offered to defend my possessions at the peril of their lives but i peremptorily forbade it i would not even consent to their taking away certain articles by way of appropriating them to their personal use i believed that if i admitted a single act of that sort i should find it no easy matter to set limits to their avidity and as i had determined to take none of my present servants with me the negro and bernardin excepted i feared that the apparent possession of a single article that had been mine might hereafter mark its proprietor a victim to the senseless rage of blindfold superstition i could easily make up to these honest and faithful dependants the injury they might sustain from the seeming severity of this order i determined to shut up my house with all its present contents as joshua the captain of the jews drew a line of separation round the profane possessions of achan and to leave the villagers if so it seemed good to them to make of the whole a burnt offering to propitiate the wrath of their avenging divinity the directions i issued being unhesitating and peremptory met with a ready submission from all my other domestics hector only the mild and complying hector of whom obedience had hitherto appeared to constitute the very soul met my commands with a resolute refusal the present distressed appearance of my fortunes seemed to have worked the poor fellows mind to a paroxysm of insanity he considered himself as the sole author of my calamity he reviled himself in the bitterest terms of compunction and abhorrence the language which the agony of his soul forced from his lips was such as could not fail to impress upon my other servants a conviction of the justice of the imputations that were now brought against us this however was of little importance i must at all events have been contented to leave behind me in my present neighbourhood a name loaded with the execrations of religious fanaticism hector imprecated upon himself a thousand curses if so long as he continued to live the populace should lay hands upon a straw of my property he would not move so much as an inch from the defence of my house he would either by preserving it expiate in some degree the mischief in which he had involved me or fall and be crushed to death in the midst of its ruins arguments and expostulations were useless here his mind was worked up to too high a tone to be susceptible of the patience necessary for hearing or understanding any reasoning that was addressed to him authority itself was of no avail for the first and the last time he threw off the character of a servant and appeared obstinate self willed and ungovernable it was only by direct violence that he could be forced from the spot i gave him in charge with the most strict orders not to suffer him to escape from their custody to two of his fellows this business being despatched i went at the invitation of the marchese to a small cottage he possessed at no great distance from my own house its situation was so private and retired that few persons knew or could perceive that there was any building on the spot here therefore i could remain in the most perfect safety i felt myself unaccountably impelled to stay and witness the catastrophe of the tragedy i should not have been satisfied to continue in uncertainty as to what it would prove after all that had passed like the marchese i should have been apt to accuse myself of cowardice and a mind soured and degenerate if the mob had not put their threats in execution the marchese himself was well pleased with my determination in this respect he was not yet convinced that i had not painted to myself a danger which had no adequate counterpart in the world of realities i had not long to wait the night had no sooner spread an even coloured and almost impervious veil over the world than the marchese as if moved by a secret impulse to witness what he yet refused to believe came to me at the cottage he had scarcely arrived when he heard the confused murmurs and turbulence of the populace for we were near enough to distinguish almost every thing as they did not meet with the defence of the preceding evening the work they had undertaken was presently despatched we saw the flames ascend we recognised the shouts of infernal joy with which they witnessed the catastrophe when the marchese beheld what till seen he would never admit to be possible he burst out into a sort of transport of misanthropy he exclaimed that no innocence and no merit could defend a man from the unrelenting antipathy of his fellows he saw that there was a principle in the human mind destined to be eternally at war with improvement and science no sooner did a man devote himself to the pursuit of discoveries which if ascertained would prove the highest benefit to his species than his whole species became armed against him the midnight oil was held to be the signal of infernal machinations the paleness of study and the furrows of thought were adjudged to be the tokens of diabolical alliance he saw in the transactions of that night a pledge of the eternal triumph of ignorance over wisdom above all he regretted that his countrymen his dear italians should for ever blot their honour and their character by such savage outrages though myself the principal sufferer i was obliged to perform the part of the comforter and consoler and endeavour to calm the transport of agony that seized upon the susceptible filosanto he was astonished shocked and beside himself i viewed the whole with the gloomy firmness of a desperate resolution the worst event of this detested evening remains yet unrecorded even now i tremble while i attempt to commit the story to my harmless paper so far as related to the mere destruction of my property i looked on with a philosophical indifference i had no reason and i disdained to regret the loss of that which i had it in my power to repair in a moment i thought i had taken care that no human life should be risqued upon this critical occasion but i was mistaken i learned the next morning with anguish inexpressible that hector the negro of the prison of constance was no more he had eluded the vigilance of his keepers no sooner was he at liberty then he hastened unknown to every one to die as he had declared he would in the defence of my house the mob had burst into the house they seized him alive they dragged him out in the midst of them they insulted over him as the special favourite of the infernal king they inflicted on him every species of mockery and of torture they killed him joint by joint and limb by limb the pen drops from my lifeless hand what right had i to make this man the victim of my idle and unhallowed pursuits what has the art and multiplication of gold in it that should compensate the destruction of so ingenuous so simple hearted so noble a creature if i had myself fallen into the hands of the populace it had been well i was a criminal worthy of every retribution they could inflict upon me some men perhaps will ask why i lamented so bitterly over so uncultivated and uninformed an individual as this negro there was however something so truly tragical in the fate to which this creature in his generosity and remorse devoted himself that i believe for the moment i felt a sharper pang in it than in the strange and extraordinary loss of my only son or perhaps in the premature death of my beloved marguerite chapter xxviii before the dawn of the succeeding morning i turned my face towards lucca i beheld the last cloud of mingling smoke and flame ascend from the ashes of my villa the blaze sunk its materials were nearly consumed and it yielded an uncertain and fitful light only when i withdrew from being any longer the melancholy and heart wounded spectator of the ruin i took an everlasting leave of the marchese i had been introduced to him under a friendly aspect as the man who had had courage to perform the last offices of humanity to his unfortunate brother and he had conceived a warm affection for me the painful nature of the catastrophe he had witnessed melted his heart and he earnestly pressed me to draw upon him for any supplies i wanted or rather to receive from him a sum equivalent to the damage the superstition of his countrymen had inflicted on me this i positively refused but i found it impossible to silence his importunity till i submitted to the duplicity of promising that if i found myself reduced to any necessity i would not fail to apply to him it was in the very moment of our separation that intelligence was brought me of the fate of hector the reader may imagine with how heavy a heart i set out on my journey lucca is about seventeen miles from the city of pisa from the place where i had spent the greater part of this memorable night it was twenty the marchese made me promise to take a serpentine and circuitous route the more completely to elude the possibility of future danger an adventure occurred to me in this passage with the relation of which i will not interrupt my narrative which prevented me from arriving at lucca till the noon of the following day suffice it to say that it was of such a nature that impatient as i was under my present extraordinary circumstances to rejoin my family i should have held myself destitute of every atom of humanity if i had not submitted to this short delay short as it was i found when i reached lucca that my evil genius had been busy to accumulate for me new misfortunes marguerite and her daughters were wholly unknown in this place and the intelligence of the pisan riot having reached lucca in the course of the day it was related to my wife as to a hearer unconcerned with all its horrid circumstances and the calamitous fate of our generous hector by the hostess of the inn the rapidity of events during the last part of our residence in the pisan territory was such as to have obliged me to say little of the effect they produced upon marguerite but the reader can scarcely be so inadvertent and unreflecting as not easily to imagine to himself that she felt them in the highest degree painful and overwhelming this last blow was too much marguerite had been some months pregnant she was immediately seized with the pains of labour and delivered of a dead child the first intelligence communicated to me upon my arrival was that my wife was dying lucca however did not witness the period of her existence after having continued for several days upon the very extremity as it were between life and death she grew perceptibly better and in a week more though in a very feeble state it became apparent that her case was not a rapid one we agreed to proceed upon our spanish voyage it appeared not improbable that the sea air might be found beneficial and the experiment was warmly recommended by her physicians they were not however aware of the whole extent of her disorder during the voyage her crisis returned with such malignant symptoms as scarcely to permit us the hope she would reach the land alive we debarked at barcelona on the th of april we had no sooner taken up our abode in this city than fully aware of the state of her disease she assembled her daughters and poured forth to them without restraint that flood of affection that ardent spirit of love by which she was distinguished and elevated above every creature that lived her mind was clear her intellectual powers were complete and entire the enthusiasm with which she now expressed herself was not of that inconsiderate nature which should tend to make them feel with greater acuteness the loss they were about to sustain it was bright unclouded and serene it was the eloquence as of a disembodied spirit freed from the perturbation and alloy of human passions she reminded them that they were sisters and exhorted each to fulfil the duties of a sister and a mother to the other two if wise and good they would be happy in each other and their little association would be a school preparing them for the more genuine and venerable duties for which nature had destined them her views of all human things were altered by her present situation on the brink of the grave our reserves and misunderstandings had wrung her heart but she forgave me things which had lately appeared of the highest magnitude and moment faded in the distance and mingled with the vulgar crowd of human concerns which was now retiring from her view she must again return she said to life before she could again feel the passions and the interests of this petty scene for the sake of her daughters she had lately desired to live she was now reconciled and content to die she had formed the chain and link of connection between me and my girls perhaps it was better that we should burst our fetters and be free on the fourth day after our arrival at barcelona marguerite expired there is nothing in the vast variety of objects which this wretched world presents to our view so dreadful and distressing as the sight of one we have loved but who is now no more i saw these eyes beheld the lifeless corse of marguerite great god of heaven what is man and of what are we made within that petty frame resided for years all that we worship for there resided all that we know and can conceive of excellence that heart is now still within the whole extent of that frame there exists no thought no feeling no virtue it remains no longer but to mock my sense and scoff at my sorrow to rend my bosom with a woe complicated matchless and inexpressible the cheek is pale and livid the eyes are sunk and circled with blackness corruption and ruin have already seized their prey and turned it into horror draw for heavens sake draw the pall over those lifeless features bury bury them deep in the bowels of the earth let not my imagination follow them into the chambers of the grave and dwell amidst pestilential damps and all the series of destruction let me recollect all that marguerite was as she lived her numerous accomplishments her unparalleled virtues ay in all the magnitude and wealth of their detail for that is a divine and celestial madness but let me not recollect her as i saw her on the bier lest i become raving and blaspheme i have no power to talk of the situation in which i was now placed and the reader must therefore explain it for himself if he can i never loved but once i never loved but marguerite all other affection is stillness and ice compared with this this is the great crisis of my history the gap between life and death the gulf that cut me off for ever from every thing that deserves the name of human such was the legacy of the stranger my son an exile myself publicly arraigned as a murderer the unmerited and tragical death of hector the premature and self deriving loss of the better half of my soul who would have believed that this envenomed gift would in less than two years have thus dreadfully changed the face of my affairs and destroyed every thing that composed the happiness of my life after some delay in this wretched and ill omened town of barcelona such it has ever since appeared to my thoughts we proceeded to madrid the reader will give me credit when i tell him that however eager i had lately felt to exhibit my magnificence and my wealth i had no such eagerness now i speak no more of the character of marguerite i attempt not to compose her panegyric the story of her life is the best record of her virtues her defects if defects she had drew their pedigree from rectitude of sentiment and perception from the most generous sensibility from a heart pervaded and leavened with tenderness a simple stone in the western aisle of the great church at barcelona records her personal and her family name with this single addition the preserver of her family in poverty and ruin the victim of her disconsolate and repentant husbands unhallowed wealth but dismissing for ever and henceforth consigning to unviolated silence her excellencies could i avoid feeling that i could never again form a similar or indeed any real union so long as i existed being now indeed more than forty years of age having spent near twenty of that forty in a most enviable wedlock and being blessed with a sufficiently numerous offspring it may be thought perhaps i might be contented but without discussing the propriety of such a maxim as it relates to the species in general it must be recollected in my case that my youth was to be recommenced by a perpetual series of renewals i never gave credit to that axiom of a sickly sensibility that it is a sacrilege in him who has been engaged in one cordial and happy union ever to turn his thoughts to another much more reasonable than this is the indian doctrine that the survivor ought to leap into the flames and perish upon the funeral pyre of the deceased while we live it is one of our most imperious duties to seek our happiness he that dedicates his days to an endless sorrow is the worst and most degraded of suicides it is an important question in the economy of human life up to what age we should allow ourselves to contract engagements to a wife and a probable offspring but separately from this consideration i should hold that in many cases he who entered into a second marriage by that action yielded a pure and honourable homage to the manes of the first but from genuine marriage i was henceforth for ever debarred an immortal can form no true and real attachment to the insect of an hour mourning a depressing and speechless regret was yet the inmate of our house grief does not commonly lay a strong and invincible hold of us in the morning of our days and though the temper of julia was perhaps at her age the most tender and susceptible i ever knew even she who was now in her seventeenth year reaped the benefit of that elasticity which in early life is the portion of humanity nothing material occurred to us in the first three months of our residence in madrid it was impossible for any one to be surrounded with a more lovely and blooming family than i was yet from happiness i was immeasurably distant exclusively of my recent and in every sense irreparable loss my mind was full of dark and gloomy forebodings i feared not for myself but i had an unconquerable alarm and apprehension for my children my youngest was but ten years of age the eldest was not seventeen sweet tender blossoms that the cruelty and hardness of mankind might so easily blight and that required a concurrence of favourable circumstances to ripen into all they were capable of becoming when i recollected what had happened in the course of the last two years i could not flatter myself that our misfortunes were at an end or that i had not to speak moderately many fierce trials yet to encounter i seemed like the far famed tree of java to be destined to shelter only to destroy and to prove a deadly poison to whatever sought its refuge under my protecting branches in this melancholy frame of mind the last words of my adored marguerite passed and repassed ten thousand times through my recollection she had formed the chain and link of connection between me and my girls perhaps it was better that we should burst our fetters and be free whatever she had said was sacred to the present temper of my imagination her last behest i would have died to execute the idea contained in the sentence i have just repeated was ambiguous and obscure rather hinted than expressed but was it worthy of the less attention because its author with her usual gentleness and sweetness had modestly suggested an advice instead which she was well entitled to have done of prescribing a will i determined to part with my children that i might no longer be to them a source of corroding misery and affliction i believed that the cloud that now oppressed me was transitory i seemed pursued for the present by a malignant genius but a man endowed as i was with unbounded wealth and immortal vigour cannot easily be reduced to despair when the tide of my prosperity should unfold its rich and ample current i might easily communicate of its bounty to my daughters if i parted with them now i did not lose them as i had perhaps lost their brother for ever i could turn to a particular point and say there lies my soul i could cast my eye upon a projection of the globe and put my finger upon their residence wherever i wandered whether i were plunged in a dungeon or mounted a throne my heart like the mariners needle would tremble towards that point as its cynosure i had still something to love something to pant for something to dream about and be happy having ruminated insatiably upon the last expressions of marguerite having formed my commentary and fixed my predilection i recollected a person then a young woman upon my paternal estate for whom my wife had conceived a remarkable friendship she was the daughter of a peasant her birth had been low and her education confined but she had taste she had discretion she had integrity i think i may add she had genius as marguerite had discovered her merits and distinguished her from her equals she had been of great use to this extraordinary rustic in unfolding her mind and guiding her propensities this was not so much a matter of deliberate and meditated purpose in la dame du seigneur it rose out of the circumstances of their situation they were almost of an age and marguerite frequently invited her to be the associate of her studies and amusements mariana that was her name did not perhaps resemble my wife considerably in her features but her stature was the same her complexion and the colour of her hair the similarity in carriage and gesture mariana having never had an opportunity of contemplating the accomplishments she admired in any one but madame de st leon was still more striking there were points indeed in which no human creature could compare with marguerite the expressive and flexible tone of her voice and those cadences which sprung from and communicated to every susceptible hearer the divinest sensibility one of the unhappy consequences of our exile from the bordelois was the misfortunes of mariana her father had fallen to decay to relieve his distress she had contracted a marriage not of sentiment and predilection but with a man who had promised her that her father should never come to want this marriage had been unhappy the husband was a prodigal and a profligate a period of seven years however delivered her from her egyptian bondage she had but lately become a widow and the prudence and integrity of her conduct had rendered this alliance which to many women would have proved a rock of destruction an additional source of honour and respect mariana at the death of her husband had no children she had buried her father she was consequently entirely alone it was this woman i fixed upon as the protector of my daughters i was better pleased with the meanness of her extraction than i should have been with one of the high born descendants of the houses of st leon or damville had it been my fortune to have had in the female line any near relations on either side my daughters were no longer children they were singularly prudent considerate and unimpeachable in their conduct and propensities they wanted a protector in the eye of the world it was desirable for them that they should have an adviser but i should have been grieved and mortified to give them a dictator i wrote to mariana chabot communicating my project and requesting her to give us the meeting at st lizier on the frontiers of france she was delighted with the office i tendered to her acceptance and readily consented to every thing i required i conducted my daughters to the place of rendezvous without imparting to them the design by which i was actuated i believed that they would of their own motion conceive a partiality for the friend of their mother i was not deceived in my prognostic the meeting was an interesting one the eyes of mariana overflowed at meeting after so long an interval the husband and progeny of the dearest and most revered friend she had ever known the mourning we wore reminded her how lately her incomparable patroness had been committed to the grave my girls were struck with the resemblance of mariana to their mother accident had prevented us from cultivating almost any intimate connections out of our own family from the period of our exile my girls had therefore never met with a person who approached in any degree so near their mother in accomplishments in skill in turn of thinking and opinion mariana came up to my warmest hopes as a protector and companion for my children her unhappy marriage by concentrating her thoughts and expectations in herself had perhaps rendered her more exemplary in carriage and more elevated in sentiment than she would ever have been without it at st lizier i passed myself for monsieur valmier the guardian of the orphan heiresses of st leon it fortunately happened that my paternal estate was at this time upon sale i determined to become the purchaser and to settle my girls in the scene of their nativity i procured an agent and despatched him with an ample commission for that purpose having adjusted this point i resolved to make a tour with my daughters through languedoc dauphin and the provinces usually known by the denomination of the south of france i wished to familiarise them to the society of madame chabot and to assist them in discerning her merits under a variety of points of view i asked them whether they would not be delighted to obtain her as a companion who might assist and conduct them in such points as only a woman of understanding and experience is competent to they every one of them listened to the idea with pleasure at length i received the information that the purchase of st leon was completed and i proceeded to the critical disclosure that my daughters were on the point of being separated from their father they listened to the communication with astonishment and terror they had entered successively into the feelings of their deceased mother and i am well persuaded felt a less ardent attachment to my person than they had done at the cottage of the lake of constance but culpable and criminal as i had been i was not destitute of every virtue and they could not extinguish in themselves the respect they had so long entertained for me habit has a resistless empire over the human mind and when we reflect with how much reluctance we consent to the removal of a tree or a hedge to the sight of which we have been accustomed it will not be wondered at that my daughters could not calmly think of so complete a separation from their father the impression of their mothers death was yet green and to lose me was to become orphans a second time but i had fully meditated my plan and was peremptory that i might withhold from them no advantage it was in my power to confer i gave them bernardin for their superintending bailiff and steward of their property our parting was not less painful and melancholy than its occasion was extraordinary and its mode uncommon it took place at the town of montauban i saw my dear children set forward on their journey and i knew not that i should ever behold them more i was determined never again to see them to their injury and i could not take to myself the consolation on such a day in such a month or even after such a lapse of years i will again have the joy to embrace them in a little while they were out of sight and i was alone the reader will perhaps agree with me that no man had more exquisitely enjoyed the dearest ties of society than i had and that perhaps few men were ever better formed to enjoy them this complete and dreadful separation this stroke that seemed to cut me off abruptly from every thing most valuable that the earth contains was not the result of any of the ordinary necessities of human life still less was it the dictate of alienation or indifference no it was the pure effect of love of a love so strong complete and uncontrollable as inflexibly to refuse every thing that could be injurious to its objects i own i could not thus have parted with marguerite her idea was mingled with the vital springs of my existence and scarcely any power less resistless than death could have made me consent to pass an entire day without her society but then it is to be considered that my daughters were in the morning of life their hopes were untarnished their prospects not obscured by a single cloud and that the crime would probably have been greater obstinately to have made them the partners of my misfortunes and disgrace there are persons who will regard this passage in my history as culpable and the testimony of a cold and unsusceptible heart i contemplate it even at this distance of time as the noblest and most virtuous effort of my life and a thousand circumstances have occurred since to induce me to congratulate myself that i had the courage to achieve my purpose chapter xxix nineteen years had now elapsed from the day that had witnessed my union with marguerite de damville in all that time i had never been alone alone in a certain sense indeed i had stood at paris in the period that had led to my exile and at soleure in that which immediately succeeded it in each case i was solitary and my solitude was unhappy but my unhappiness was then in a certain sense spontaneous my solitude was a luxury in which i felt myself impelled to indulge he that has experienced both will readily acknowledge the extreme difference between the misery we embrace and the misery from which we shrink with abhorrence and loathing i relinquished in the former instances my dearest connections my proper post and situation but i felt that i could return to the one and resume the other at pleasure i repeat it therefore then i had not been alone and now i was alone the same motive which in this instance made me cut myself off from my daughters that i might not be the cause of their misery forbad me to be the parent of a future offspring upon whom i might entail similar misfortune tell me then was i not alone i recollected the words of the stranger wrung from him by the excess of his misery at the summer house of the lake alone alone friendless friendless i began to penetrate the enigma of his history i fixed my daughters with an ample revenue in the chteau of st leon i re purchased for them all my paternal property i waited some time at montauban to hear of the event of my project and their final settlement i learned with pleasure that they found their situation peaceful easy and reputable i enjoined them that they should speak and think of me as dead i led them to suppose when i left montauban that i should set out upon an extensive tour that i should traverse the indus and the ganges and penetrate into the furthest extremities of the east how uncommon how pitiable a fate i became prematurely dead to my country and my race because i was destined never to die the first sensation i derived from their prosperity as i have already said was pleasure my second was that which the devil might have felt when he entered paradise for the seduction of our first parents i contemplated with some degree of malignant envy a happiness of which it was little probable i should ever partake let me not be censured for this let any man put himself in my situation and say whether the pleasure he feels at contemplating the separated happiness of those he loves be not a mingled sensation with heavy heart i sought again the road of madrid though my spirits underwent an extreme depression i determined not to desert myself or the advantages i had purchased at so inestimable a price i exerted myself to shake off my lethargy and rouse the faculties of my soul i refused to give way to omens of evil portent and resolved to see what might yet be made of my endowments there is no misfortune that has not in it some slight mixture of good my being now alone and detached from every relative tie left me at liberty to pursue my projects with a bolder enterprise the mistake of which i accused myself in the former instance was the entering too precipitately into the exercise of the gifts of the stranger before i had properly measured my strength and investigated the use and application of my tools i had suffered sufficiently from the past uncertainty and irresoluteness of my march i determined as far as human precaution could secure its ends to encounter no more misfortunes to subject myself to no further miscarriages but to take care that henceforth the tide of my pursuits should move smoothly onward i dedicated the six months immediately succeeding my separation from my daughters to the joint contemplation of morals and natural philosophy i was resolved to ascertain the simplest mode of manufacturing wealth the wisest methods for lulling the suspicions and controlling the passions of mankind and the true science of the use of riches alas i had in the sequel frequent occasions to confess that though i had fortuitously entered into possession of the leading secrets of natural magic i was a mere tyro in the science of man at least in the degree in which the exercise of these secrets required the possession of it nothing material occurred to interrupt the occupations of the winter my apathy intellectual activity palsy of the heart went evenly forward i made no acquaintance i was a mere spectator of the busy scenes that passed around me i was resolved not to entangle myself with rashly formed connections and it will commonly be found that he whose contemplations are principally employed upon some secret and guarded hoard of reflection has little propensity to communicate upon idle and indifferent matters a slight incident indeed disturbed me for a few days during this interval but it passed away and for the present i thought of it no more during the festival of christmas it happened that i felt an inclination to be the spectator of a celebrated bull fight that was exhibited before the emperor and his court for the most part i was studious of privacy i therefore felt the less scruple in indulging this unusual caprice at the commencement of the spectacle i was attentive only to the exhibition i was delighted with the form and beauty of the animals with the freedom and grandeur of their motion with the terrible energy of their assault and repulse it was not long however before my eye was transiently caught by an individual who sat in a gallery at no great distance and who seemed to view me attentively his figure bespoke some degree of refinement but his eye was fiery malicious and savage presently however i turned again towards the area and thought of him no more some time after by mere accident i looked towards the same gallery and observed this man still in an attitude to examine me it seemed as if he had not removed his eyes from me during the whole interval this was repeated three or four times without knowing why i became anxious and uneasy i had a confused feeling that i had seen the man before but whether in france switzerland or italy i could not tell i experienced that sort of disagreeable sensation from looking at his face which arises in the mind from an association of the object present with some mischief or suffering that was contemporary with its being perceived in a preceding instance i am now persuaded that this man was one of the multitude to whom i had addressed myself from the bench on the hill a short time before my flight from pisa and that he was among the most eager to interrupt and molest me but he was apparently a spaniard by birth and i could not at this time develope the mystery that hung about his features finding that i could neither rid myself of his curious and watchful observation nor of the disturbance it gave me i withdrew from the gallery where i had hitherto been sitting and removed to another gallery on the opposite side of the area about half an hour after looking accidentally round i saw this very man at my elbow i then accosted him with the enquiry do you know me sir to which he immediately returned with a pure castilian accent no seor he then began to be more reserved in his attention to me without however entirely withdrawing it as soon as the entertainment was over i went away and saw no more of my spaniard i began to tax myself with pusillanimity in suffering so insignificant an incident to disturb me a few days after however i suddenly lighted upon him in the street he was talking to three or four of his countrymen and in the progress of his discourse frequently pointed to me i could now perceive something particularly hostile and ferocious in his countenance the first impulse i felt was that i would no longer suffer the unquietness and anxiety the sight of him produced in me but would go up to him and force him to an explanation i believed however that in the temper he indicated this could not be done without involving myself in a quarrel and i thought it wiser to endeavour to conquer in silence an unreasonable sensation i therefore passed on he immediately broke from his company and attempted to follow me this i determined not to endure i laid my hand on my sword with a peremptory look and waved to him to desist his countenance then assumed an air of diabolical malignity he shook his head furiously and turned down another street a strange sort of animosity this between two persons utter strangers to each other and which had as yet not deigned to express itself by a word but such is the world we hate we know not why we are ready to cut each others throats because we do not like the turn of a feature or the adjustment of a sword knot prejudice party difference of countries difference of religions and a thousand wild chimeras of fanaticism or superstition are continually arming us against a man of whose virtues and qualities we are ignorant and into whose benevolent or evil intentions we disdain to enquire i saw this spaniard but once more it was as i was on the point of entering the house a part of which i occupied i was particularly mortified at this circumstance it was plain the man entertained for whatever reason a determined animosity against me and i was grieved to furnish him with that advantage for injuring me which consisted in being acquainted with the place of my residence i would have turned away and gone down the street but i had too fully marked my design of entering the house before i reconnoitered my enemy the displeasure i felt was so unaccountably great that it was with difficulty my courage got the better of it and i determined not to change the place of my abode in a short time however as i have already said i thought of this incident no more that it should have disturbed and unhinged me in the degree that it had done even for a moment was a thing i could not account for had the calamities in which the legacy of the stranger involved me converted me in so short a time from a knight and a soldier into a character of that morbid timidity as to tremble at every shadow or is there in some human countenances a fascination a sort of mysterious sympathy and presentiment that makes us cower and quail whenever we meet their eye beams several weeks now passed away and i had nearly forgotten all the circumstances of this seemingly foolish story when in a little excursion i chanced to make from madrid to a place about twelve miles distant i was overtaken upon the road by a cavalier of respectable appearance who presently took occasion to enter into conversation with me he explained to me several of the objects that presented themselves on either side told the names of the different nobility and grandees who occupied the villas we saw and sometimes entered into the particulars of their history i at first gave little encouragement to this communicative traveller but there was something so polite in his manner and intelligent in his discourse that i could not prevail upon myself to treat him with rudeness or disrespect after having talked for some time upon indifferent topics he led to the general state of literature in europe few subjects could appear less dangerous than this as there were few upon which i felt myself better qualified to converse by degrees i threw off some of my original reserve and i found my companion well informed and ingenious lively in his manner and pertinent in his remarks by this time the unknown having discovered that i had only come from madrid for a days relaxation invited himself to dine with me at my inn i departed from my established system of conduct on this occasion and admitted his overture after dinner he gave me some account of himself and his family and seemed to expect from me a similar explicitness i was less pleased with him in this particular than i had been with his frank and undesigning conversation on the road strictly speaking however the expectation implied was only a breach of politeness i had no reason to suppose that he foresaw it to be particularly offensive to me observing my backwardness he immediately changed the subject presently he remarked that by my physiognomy and accent he perceived i was a frenchman and asked me if i had known cornelius agrippa who died about twelve years before at grenoble i answered in the negative the unknown then entered into a warm eulogium of the talents of agrippa inveighed against the illiberal treatment he had experienced in consequence of his supposed proficiency in magic and spoke with great asperity of the priests and inquisitors who had been his persecutors i became attentive watchful and suspicious he went on to expatiate upon the praises of the art magic which nothing he said but the jealousy of churchmen had brought into disrepute affirmed that it had been treated with respect and counted illustrious by the ancients in the instance of pythagoras apollonius tyaneus and others and expressed a great desire to become a student of the art himself this kind of discourse made me repent that i had been drawn in so far as to sit down with this unknown and admit him as my companion of the day during the whole time he was the principal speaker sometimes he paused with a seeming desire to hear my sentiments but i had now formed my resolution and gave him no encouragement presently after i called for my horse i should have observed that his servant who followed him engaged in conversation with mine at the same time that the dialogue began between their masters seeing me about to depart the unknown motioned as if to accompany me upon this i became serious seor caballero said i i have now had the pleasure of your company to dinner i am going home and have the honour to bid you farewell it is neither my disposition nor the habit of the grave and dignified nation among whom i at present reside to form permanent acquaintances upon casual rencounters you will not therefore think i violate the hospitality for which i am indebted to them if i intimate to you my desire to return alone all this i said with the grave and formal tone becoming a spaniard and the unknown had nothing to reply it was evident however that my dryness chagrined him and he even muttered words of resentment between his teeth i could observe now a degree of hostility and fury in his countenance which remarkably contrasted with the pliancy and obligingness of his preceding demeanour i took no notice however of these circumstances and rode away i have since had sufficient reasons to convince me that these two persons whose story but for that explanation may appear to the reader exceedingly frivolous were the one an informer and the other a spy of the holy inquisition the man who had seen me at pisa had his imagination terrified and his superstition set in arms by all that he had heard of me in that place and thought he could not perform a more meritorious work than by giving intelligence to the fathers what sort of person had taken refuge in the metropolis of this most catholic kingdom it was with this view he had watched me and at length by an accident he deemed peculiarly fortunate lodged me in my proper habitation having given in his denunciation my travelling companion was next fastened on me by the contrivance and zeal of the fathers inquisitors he was a familiar of the holy office and it is well known that persons of the fairest prospects and most polite education in spain are led by their religious impressions to place a pride in performing menial and even perfidious offices in the service of the inquisition the kind of dishonour i put upon him in parting though of a nature he could not openly resent i fear conspired with his zeal for gods and the churchs honour to induce him to relate a story concerning me more modelled by the bitterness of his personal feelings than distinguished by a regard to truth such was the snare woven and drawing close round me on all sides for my destruction i was made uneasy by the rencounter of the traveller but by no means aware of the whole extent of the mischief that impended over me when i came to retrace point by point the discourse he had held i could not conceive that the turn it had taken originated in accident i perceived with no little grief of heart and concern that i was known it was however necessary that i should reflect maturely upon the conduct to be pursued by me i ought not gratuitously to expose myself to danger but then on the other hand it is a point of general wisdom and was particularly incumbent in my extraordinary circumstances not to suffer vigilance to degenerate into restless anxiety it would be easy for me if i were not strictly on my guard continually to find food for suspicion and to surround myself with imaginary plots and dangers this was a vice that i was willing enough to pity in others but there was no character that i more cordially disdained for myself there was none more pointedly in opposition to that gallant generous confiding spirit which had distinguished those military heroes of my native soil who had been the exclusive object of my earliest admiration and whom in my present dejected and deserted situation i still desired to resemble when i came to reflect i easily perceived that this vice was particularly allied to a life of solitude and that he who is cut off from the genuine and happy connections of husband father and friend is of all men most liable in their absence to conjure up for himself the unnatural intercourses and reciprocations of hostility it was thus that i artificially reconciled myself to my situation and obstinately closed my eyes upon those equivocal demonstrations of danger which from time to time were presented to my view chapter xxx such was the state of my mind when it happened one gloomy evening in the latter end of march that my valet announced to me three gentlemen who were come to visit me it was strange i had no visitors i indulged no relaxation but that of the street and of public places do you know who they are said i i accidentally looked up and saw paleness and terror written in his countenance he had not however time to reply before they burst into the room they were alguazils of the inquisition they told me their errand was to conduct me to the holy office i submitted and accompanied them it was already dark they put me into a litter with the curtains drawn and then arranged themselves in silence one on each side while one brought up the rear i was taken by surprise nothing could be further from my expectation than such an event as we passed along i ruminated with myself on the line of conduct it was incumbent on me to pursue to make an immediate experiment of the fidelity of my guides was a doubtful attempt if for want of time and the opportunity of a tranquil hearing i miscarried with them the trial would be converted into evidence against me if i succeeded i had then to escape out of spain in the centre of which i now was from the hostility of a tribunal which was said to surpass all the tribunals on the face of the earth in activity and vigilance i knew of nothing that the fathers of the inquisition could have against me i had lived in the most entire seclusion and i could defy any one to report a single action of mine since i had entered spain to my prejudice i had been wholly occupied with melancholy reflections on the past and solitary inventions and devices which i purposed to bring forward for the future i determined not to live for ever the slave of fear i believed that the best method for defeating a danger in many cases was undauntedly to encounter it and i did not imagine that i could have a more favourable opportunity for that purpose than the present i had heard much indeed of the terrors of the inquisition but a generous and liberal spirit lends no very attentive ear to horrors the trite and vulgar rumour of which only has reached him i disdained to be blown down with a breath i believed that the inquisition itself would not venture to proceed criminally against a man against whom nothing criminal had been alleged in every event i believed it would never be too late to have recourse to my peculiar prerogatives upon entering the prison of the inquisition i was first conducted to a solitary cell it is not my intention to treat of those particulars of the holy office which are already to be found in innumerable publications i have no pleasure in reviving the images of this sojourn of horrors i know it is unreasonable to despise a man for the miseries and wretchedness he has endured but i know that such is the human heart and i will not expose myself to be scoffed at and trampled upon for my misfortunes i found myself under the necessity while in the inquisition of submitting to that most profligate of all impositions an oath of secrecy as to what i had seen and what i had suffered and whatever may be the strict morality of such an obligation i will not ambitiously thrust myself forward in violation of it i will restrict the story i have to relate to the peculiarities that characterised my case and enter as little as possible into the general policy of this frontier intrenchment of the christian faith when i was brought up to be interrogated i was assailed with innumerable questions the obvious purport of which was as much as possible to extort from me evidence of every kind that might be injurious to my cause the object of the inquisition is to defend our holy mother the church from whatever might defile her sanctity and whiteness every thing that calls into question the truth of her doctrines that pollutes and turns from their original purpose any of her ordinances or that implies commerce and league with the invisible enemy of saints it is its peculiar province to investigate the fathers are therefore particularly cautious that they may not by confining their questions too much to a single object preclude themselves from the chance of discovering danger under all the forms it may assume it is presumed that he who is a corrupt member of the church of christ in one point is unsound and unfaithful in others the inquisitor who examined me first demanded whether i were informed for what cause i was brought before that tribunal whether i did not find myself able to conjecture the nature of my offence whether i did not know the sort of crimes for which men were detained in that prison he then desired me to recollect myself and consider whether i were not conscious of offence against the holy catholic church whether i had never asserted or maintained any doctrines contrary to what mother church asserts and maintains whether i had never to my knowledge defiled any of the ordinances of god or applied things sacred to unholy and profane purposes whether i had never invocated the devil whether i had never held any commerce or entered into any league with the enemy of saints whether i had never performed or sought to perform preternatural and miraculous acts by unholy means whether i had never vexed or sought to vex those against whom i had enmity by secret and forbidden arts whether i had never resided in countries the inhabitants of which were heretics and whether i had never listened to their discourses and arguments whether when i inhabited such countries i had never assisted at the celebration of divine ordinances performed by heretics or in a form which holy church disapproves or condemns finding that he could gain nothing upon me by these general interrogatories the inquisitor next descended to particulars he enquired concerning the incidents of my pisan story which having first assured myself from the train of his questions that some representation of that unfortunate affair had reached his ear i willingly related to the same extent that i had previously done to the marchese filosanto he then proceeded to a great number of questions the source of which is to be traced to the commonly received notions respecting sorcerers and necromancers they were so artfully contrived and so large in their scope that it was not easy to guess whether they related to any particular accusation alleged against me or were formed entirely on general principles yet some of them were so minute so connected and arranged so perfectly in series that i could not but believe they were an echo of the calumnies invented against me at pisa of which however as i had never collected any regular and detailed account i could not accurately trace the influence on the present occasion the inquisitor demanded of me whether i had never seen or held conversation with any supernatural being or the spirit of a man departed whether i had never practised diabolical arts to raise the dead whether i had never had a familiar in the form of some insect domestic animal or reptile he was particularly subtle and copious in his questions respecting the history of my unfortunate dog endeavouring to surprise me in some slip or contradiction in what i affirmed on the subject he asked whether i had never assumed a form different from my real one either a different age and appearance or a different species of animal whether i had never by the agency of my demon inflicted sickness convulsion fits or death whether i had never caused the mortality of cattle whether i had not the power of being in two places at once whether i had never been seen riding through the air whether i had never been wounded in my absence by a blow aimed at my astral spirit or apparition whether i had never possessed books of conjuration or the art magic whether it had never happened to me that an indifferent person indiscreetly perusing a spell or incantation in my possession had been maimed or killed by the spirits he had undesignedly evoked a further object particularly pursued in my interrogatory was the detection of my property and the questions constructed for this purpose were uncommonly artful and multiplied the inquisitor told me that the holy office was by the nature of its institution the guardian and administrator of every person that fell under its animadversion shut up he said as i must be during the pendency of my cause and separated from the rest of mankind i was wholly incapable of superintending my worldly affairs which unless they were properly looked into might in the interval be materially injured i ought therefore implicitly and without reserve to refer myself in this point to the care of the fathers if my innocence were established as he hoped and earnestly prayed to the mother of god and the saints of jesus might ultimately happen i should find the holy office a faithful and qualified steward if on the contrary i should be proved a heretic and an alien to the most high i ought then to rejoice in the beneficent interference of the fathers who by dedicating my wealth to consecrated purposes would mitigate in the eye of the just judge of heaven and earth the duration or fierceness of my punishments in a future world the inquisitor had apparently heard various reports of my riches and was inexpressibly chagrined that he should be found so unskilful a member of his profession as not to be able to extort from me a full confession on that head after having employed every artifice of menace and terror after having endeavoured to soothe and cajole me by blandishments and persuasion and finding all his expedients fruitless he poured upon me the full storm of his indignation he said it was apparent that i was dealing disingenuously and fraudulently with the delegated guardians of religion it was impossible that the expenditure i was well known more or less to have incurred could be supported without considerable funds and my evident duplicity and concealment in this point must be regarded as a full confirmation of every crime my accusers had alleged against me in the course of my examinations the inquisitor who questioned me gave himself the trouble of entering into a full vindication of the tribunal of which he was a member he said that every thing that was valuable to mankind not only in a future state but also in the present depended upon preserving in full vigour and strength the sacred institutions of the christian faith and that those who were endowed with powers sufficient for that purpose would be in the highest degree inexcusable in the sight of god if they did not vigilantly and inflexibly maintain the exertion of those powers it was an egregious mistake of self willed and opinionated men to suppose that the maintenance of our holy religion was sufficiently provided for by the clearness of its evidence it was no less dangerous to pretend that the stability and duration of the church of christ might be confided to the providence of god providence acts by human means and it was presumptuous for those who neglected the means to trust that they should nevertheless see the end adequately secured why had providence thought proper to generate an alliance between church and state and to place the powers and authority of human society in the hands of the adherents of the christian faith magistrates and governments were thus made the vicars of heaven and great would be their condemnation if they neglected the trust reposed in them the great adversary of mankind was incessantly watchful for the destruction of souls and while he spread abroad his delusions it was folly to imagine that evidence alone was powerful enough to counteract them what judges were the great mass of mankind of the integrity and validity of evidence the jest of the scorner was ever at hand to turn into ridicule the most sacred mysteries the opposers of our holy faith were indefatigable in their industry and as anxious in their exertions to deprive their fellow men of every comfort and hope as if infidelity which was the curse of the human species were the greatest blessing that could be conferred on them the devil was a hard task master and granted no vacation night or day to those who enlisted themselves in the support of his cause it might answer well enough the purpose of the vain glorious theorist to suppose that man was a rational animal but they who had regarded human society with an observing eye knew that it was otherwise delusion would ever be too hard for evidence and the grossest falsehoods prove victorious over the most sacred truths if what was illiberally and maliciously styled persecution were not brought in aid of the cause of religion the passions of mankind were on the side of falsehood man unrestrained by law was a wild ferocious and most pernicious beast and were it not for the wholesome curb of authority would speedily throw off all ties and limitations human and divine nothing could more clearly prove that the heretical followers of luther and calvin who had lately sprung up for the plague of mankind whatever they might pretend were in reality the determined enemies of all revelation than their continual demand that the cause should be tried by discussion and that every man should be defended in the exercise of his private judgment they could not but know every man not totally robbed of all power of discernment must know that if this demand were once granted it would prove a blow at the root of every sentiment of religion the inquisition therefore was the most salutary institution that had ever been devised and the future welfare of mankind wholly depended upon the maintenance of its powers and its maxims by a moderate and judicious exhibition of terror it superseded the necessity of innumerable punishments the inquisition was not capricious and uncertain in its policy it acted under the direction of immutable laws it held a tender but a firm rein upon the extravagances and madness of mankind nothing was more notorious than that a regular and systematical proceeding was both more effectual and more generous than one that was fickle he defied the whole history of the world to produce an example of so merciful a tribunal the great end of its policy was the reclaiming of sinners and the multiplication of penitents who after a gentle and salutary discipline were again by holy church received into her bosom and even when they delivered the finally impenitent to the flames it was to the flames of a purifying fire which by destroying the flesh redeemed or diminished the punishments of a future world he knew that an outcry had been artfully raised against the proceedings of the holy office but it was easy to see that its enemies under the pretence of compassion for its victims concealed an inveterate animosity against property religion and civil society the anabaptists had thrown off the mask and discovered their true designs and the rest were only more plausible and specious in proportion as they were more timid the present was the most important crisis that ever occurred in the history of the world there was a spirit at work that aimed at dissolving all the bonds of civil society and converting mankind into beasts and savages who had not heard of the levellers millenarians and fifth monarchy men who under the specious guise of disinterestedness and an universal love of mankind had nothing in view but the most sacrilegious and unprincipled depredations it was true that the preachers of these doctrines were utterly contemptible both for numbers and talent but it would be found a short sighted policy to overlook these desperate assailants on account of the poorness and meanness of their qualifications for his own part he did not hesitate to say that human society would owe its preservation if it were preserved to the merciful yet vigorous proceedings of the court of inquisition the misrepresentations that were invidiously made of the present firm and vigilant system of policy would be heard for a day and then universally abandoned posterity he was well assured would do full justice to the sagacity and soundness of the conduct of this calumniated and much injured institution the reader will forgive me if the panegyric thus elaborately pronounced by the inquisitor who examined me upon the court of which he was a member had not all the weight with my mind at the moment i heard it which he will probably ascribe to it in the calmness of the closet it is so difficult to be impartial in our own cause the candid mind will no doubt make a large allowance for the unhappy situation in which i now stood and the bitter and galling thoughts that preyed upon my memory but if i am chargeable with temporary injustice in the judgment i then passed on the arguments of the inquisitor i flatter myself that i have been able after the interval that has elapsed to give a true and adequate statement of them beside these reasonings on the necessity of a wholesome restraint on the privileges of speaking and writing the father in another of my examinations condescended to delineate to me the mysteries of the world of spirits he reminded me that in the first grand rebellion upon record that of the fallen angels of which he considered the present defection under luther and calvin as in some measure a counterpart a third of the host of heaven had been thrust out of the celestial mansions these accursed spirits had since been permitted to pursue their machinations on the face of our earth the devil like a roaring lion goeth about seeking whom he may devour the oracles of the heathens the temptations of job and of our saviour and the demoniacs of sacred writ were examples of the extensive power which heaven had thought fit to allow him men of a sceptical and feeble understanding had been tempted to doubt whether this was consistent with the wisdom and goodness of god but though it was in vain for us to pretend to fathom the depth of the divine mysteries there were certain reasons that were sufficiently obvious to every ingenuous mind there were persons in all ages of the world who like the sadducees in the time of our blessed saviour were inclined to affirm that there was no resurrection neither angel nor spirit and god permitted the lying wonders of infernal agents the more completely to confound the unbelief of his enemies he who witnessed the wonderful operations of witchcraft or saw the ghost of a man departed could not doubt of the interference of invisible agents in the concerns of our nether world and if there were devils and apparitions it would be to the last degree unreasonable to deny the existence of god or the miracles of christ these were to be received as the grounds of the divine permission of sorcerers necromancers and witches but the rules of the divine conduct were not to constitute the rules of ours he might permit the agency of invisible malice because he saw things upon an unlimited scale his judgments were infallible and he could say to beelzebub himself thus far shalt thou go and no further those to whose care was intrusted the welfare of mankind here or hereafter were bound as far as possible to oppose themselves to the empire of satan his power was given him only for a time and if not strictly restrained of god and the powers ordained of god it would over run every thing and replunge all this beautiful scene of creation in its original chaos there was an endless and eternal war between god and the devil and the governors of the church were heavens field officers and pioneers for carrying it on of all the crimes he added to which the depravity of human nature had given birth the most astonishing and the most horrible was that of diabolical commerce that human creatures should be so far infatuated as to enter into league with the declared enemy of souls and for the possession of a short lived and precarious power to sign away their spirits to eternal damnation was so extraordinary as to have been wholly unworthy of credit were it not supported by evidence as strong and irresistible as that of the miracles of jesus christ himself the persons who thus voluntarily made themselves accursed before god deserved to be regarded with alienation and horror by the whole human race every man that saw them was bound by his baptismal engagements to destroy them and whoever administered to them the smallest portion of food drink or comfort thereby rendered himself a party to their guilt the inquisition especially had declared against this race of men eternal war and considered their crime as more complicated audacious and pestilential than any other branch of heresy having for his own part no doubt that i was one of these noxious and enormous reprobates he exhorted me to make a voluntary confession of my evil deeds and by submitting readily to the tortures and punishments of this world endeavour to free myself if it were yet possible from those of the world to come these discourses of the inquisitor were variously interspersed through the three examinations to which i was subjected a short time after i became an inhabitant of the holy house on my part i endeavoured to the best of my power to repel the imputations cast upon me to establish my innocence and to confound the severity of my oppressors i told the inquisitor whatever might be the force of his arguments respecting heresy and dealings with the devil they were nothing to me i was no lutheran no anabaptist no necromancer no underminer of the faith of others or ally of the prince of the infernal regions i proudly and earnestly demanded to be confronted with my accusers i asked my examiner in his turn what sort of justice that was which pretended to proceed capitally against its prisoners upon secret and unavowed accusations he endeavoured to stop me he told me that i was not brought there to arraign the methods and practices of their court that it did not become a prisoner put upon his defence to insult his judges that this contumacy could not be regarded but as an aggravation of my guilt and that i was bound strictly and simply to answer the interrogatories that were proposed to me the rebuke of the inquisitor was unavailing my spirit was wrought to too high a pitch to be thus restrained i was too firmly resolved to give the utmost force of mind and truth to the topics of my just defence it is the practice of the inquisition for the prisoner to sit during his examination i started upon my feet the mode of your proceeding cried i is the mockery of a trial from your fatal bar no man can go forth acquitted how is a story to be refuted when hardly and with difficulty you suffer your prisoner to collect the slightest fragments of it if i would detect a calumny is it not requisite that i should be acquainted with its history and know its authors and propagators then i may perhaps be able to confound their forgeries to show the groundlessness of their allegations to expose the baseness of their purposes and the profligacy of their characters i am informed of nothing yet i am bid first to be my own accuser and then to answer the accusations of others it is only by following a falsehood through all its doublings that it can be effectually destroyed you bid me unravel a web and will not suffer me to touch it with one of my fingers the defence of the purest innocence is often difficult sometimes impossible against the artfulness of a malicious tale or the fortuitous concurrence of unfavourable appearances but you strip innocence of those consecrated weapons by which only it can be defended give to an accusation the particulars with which what really happens must always be attended give to it the circumstances of place and of time lay aside the ambiguity and generalities in which you shelter yourselves and then perhaps then only it can be victoriously repelled you ask me a thousand various and artfully constructed questions what sort of a man do you imagine me to be i am not a fool that i should be inveigled i am not a boy that i should be menaced into confessions cease your base and unprincipled arts i will furnish no materials against myself if you know anything against me avow it propose it and i will answer think not to patch up a miserable accusation out of the words which inadvertence or weariness may cause me to utter shame on your institution may infamy overtake the system of your proceedings that religion which is supported by such means is viler than atheism that civilisation which has its basis in despotism is more worthless and hateful than the state of savages running wild in their woods do you not perceive that the language i am now holding to you is the exclusive privilege of conscious innocence the indignation i express is no artificial rage studiously contrived to overbear accusation you have it as it flows spontaneously to my tongue warm from the promptings of an honest heart if i could have consulted a friend it is probable he would have dissuaded me from my present demeanour as impolitic if i were governed by the dictates of an ordinary prudence i should have displayed less ardour less resentment but i am willing to try whether shame cannot yet be lighted up even in the cheek of an inquisitor the father who examined me having in vain endeavoured to check the current of my invective changed his manner and assumed a tone diametrically the reverse of mine he professed that he felt much compassion and interest for my misfortune and should deem himself happy if he could be the instrument of my deliverance the language i had uttered was highly indecorous and such as seemed in itself to call for a rigorous penance but he should not think himself worthy the name of a man if he did not make suitable allowance for the bitter and extravagant sentiments that would occasionally find their way into the mind of one in my unfortunate situation so circumstanced men would often mistake their friends for their enemies i regarded the inquisition as my enemy it was in reality my firm and disinterested friend zealously watchful for my body my soul and my estate other courts had other maxims of proceeding because their motives of action were different and it was but just that they should furnish their prisoners with a defence against their frailty but the breast of an inquisitor was accessible to no sentiment but that of love a burning love of god love of the church love of the prisoner who might be wrongfully accused love of the penitent whom he reconciled to our common mother the church love even of the incorrigible heretic whose body he burned for the good of his soul the inquisitor did not discover to the prisoner the evidence adduced against him that was between god and the inquisitors conscience but the suppression which was thus practised rendered him doubly scrupulous and sceptical as to the evidence he received he sifted it with a severity that the prisoner would in vain endeavour to imitate and the rules of evidence in that court were so guarded punctilious and minute as to render any mistake in its proceedings altogether impossible for a man to be once a prisoner of the court of inquisition by a salutary prejudice which prevailed through the catholic world rendered him for ever infamous this was another cause of the extreme wariness and caution with which that court was accustomed to proceed they first listened to the accuser who was obliged to give in his information on oath they then instituted a secret enquiry against the party accused and till they had collected abundant ground for their proceeding they did not venture to touch a hair of his head they elaborately classed all the different degrees of evidence into half proof full proof proof less than half and proof less than full when these things were duly considered it would appear certain that no court that had at any time existed on earth had ever been so tender in its proceedings so pure in its incitements and so every way superior to the attacks of calumny and malice as the court of inquisition with respect to myself in particular he said they had not apprehended me and put me upon my defence without previously assembling a large body of miscellaneous and circumstantial evidence the evidence they had drawn from myself was negative only but it was strong the obscurity that hung about my person who i was and whence i came and the obscurity that hung about my fortune a great visible expenditure in spain or in italy and no visible means these were not the signatures and tokens of innocence they tended strongly to confirm the accusation under which i laboured yet so tender was the inquisition in its proceeding and so chary of its reputation that upon these accumulated proofs and presumptions they were not prepared to pronounce against me they would hear me again and again they would give me time to recollect myself and for this purpose they would order for me a coarse and scanty fare and a solitary cell i might depend upon it my contumacy should be overcome the fundamental principle of their proceedings was borrowed from that humane and compassionate maxim of the old roman law de vita hominis nulla cunctatio est longa and i should accordingly find them free from all precipitation and impatience and ready to indulge me with a residence however long in their prisons till my case had been sifted to the bottom chapter xxxi the indulgence thus ostentatiously proclaimed by the father inquisitor was not exactly to my taste finding that all the energy of mind i could apply to my defence was vain i determined to have recourse to a different mode of proceeding i received three admonitions as they call them the substance of which i have already recited in the course of the first ten days of my confinement and i then for some time heard of the inquisitor no more i understood that it was frequently the practice after three admonitions not to bring up the prisoner for further hearing during a whole year and it appeared sufficiently probable from the last words addressed to me by my judge that this policy was intended to be employed in my case without further delay therefore i resolved to recur to the expedient in the use of which my power was unbounded and by a brilliant offer at once to subdue the scruples and secure the fidelity of the person or persons upon whom my safe custody might be found to depend all that was necessary was to convince the party to whom i should propose the assisting me of the reality of my powers and then to put carte blanche into his hands or rather to ascertain at once the extent of his hopes and demands and by a spirited and peremptory conduct to yield them all in the period which immediately previous to my present imprisonment i had devoted to the meditation of my future plans and the review of my past i had severely accused myself of half measures and had determined to abjure all hesitation and irresoluteness for the time to come it is not indeed to be wondered at that possessing a power so utterly remote from common ideas and conceptions and which speaking from experience i do not hesitate to affirm no mere effort of imagination is adequate to represent i should have acted below the prerogatives and demands of my situation this mistake i would make no more i would overwhelm opposition by the splendour of my proceedings and confound scruples by the dignity and princely magnificence of my appearance unshackled as i was with connections and risking no ones happiness but my own i proposed to compel the human species to view me from an awful distance and to oblige every one that approached me to feel his inferiority it would be to the last degree disgraceful and contemptible in me being raised so far above my peers in my privileges if i were to fall below the ordinary standard of a gallant man in the decision and firmness of my system of conduct decision and firmness were the principles to be exercised by me now dignity and magnificence must await their turn hereafter it was not long before i embraced an opportunity of speaking to the man who waited on me with my daily allotment of provisions and i designed as shortly as possible to proceed to that species of argument in which i principally confided to engage him in my cause but he did not suffer me to utter a sentence before with a very expressive gesture he interrupted me i had remarked already the silence which seemed for ever to pervade this dismal abode but i had not ascribed importance enough to this circumstance to suppose that it could materially interfere with the project i had formed i now perceived the countenance of my attendant to be overspread with terror and alarm he put his hand upon my mouth and by his attitude seemed earnestly to insist upon my conforming to the rules of the prison i was not however to be thus diverted from my purpose i seized his hands and began again to pursue the discourse i had meditated this proceeding on my part induced him to break the silence he had hitherto preserved he told me that if i did not instantly set him at liberty he would alarm the prison i loosed his hands i then by every gesture i could devise endeavoured to prevail on him to approach me to suffer me to confer with him in the lowest whisper and assured him that he should have no reason to repent his compliance i might as well have addressed myself to the walls that inclosed me he would not stay an instant he would yield in nothing he burst from me abruptly and closing the door of my cell left me in solitude and darkness in the evening of the day of this attempt the keeper of the prison entered my apartment when he appeared i began to flatter myself that in this man i should find a better subject for my purpose than in the poor turnkey who had given me so unfavourable a prognostic of my success i lost no time in saying to him that i had something important to communicate but he peremptorily commanded me to be silent and listen to what he was about to say to me he told me that i had already been complained against for speech and i was now repeating my offence he advised me to ponder well the consequences of what i was doing the orders of the inquisition were rigorous and inflexible the cells were not so substantially separated but that a voice might be heard from one to the other yet it had happened more than once that a husband and wife a father and child had for years been lodged next to each other without the smallest suspicion on either part of the proximity of their situation he was astonished at the pertinacity of my behaviour there was no government on the face of the earth he would venture to say that had subjects more obedient more dutiful and exemplary than the holy inquisition not a murmur was ever heard not a discontent ever expressed all was humbleness thankfulness and gratitude he recommended to me to conform myself to my situation and let him hear no further complaints of me he had no sooner finished his harangue than he left me as abruptly as his servant had done it is not possible to impart any adequate image of the inflexibility of his features or the stern composure of his demeanour i now saw my situation in a different point of view bribery was of no use where all intercourse was denied great god into what position was i got in the midst of a great and populous city at this time perhaps the metropolis of the world i heard occasionally from beyond the limits of my prison the hum of busy throngs or the shouts of a tumultuous populace yet i was myself in the deepest solitude like the wretched mariners i have somewhere read of shipwrecked upon a desert shore i might remain encaged till i lost all recollection of european language and all acquaintance with the sound of my own voice a jailor from time to time entered my apartment but to me he was simply a moving and breathing statue his features never moulded into the expression of a meaning nor his mouth opened for the utterance of a sound from the first i had been struck with the extreme and death like silence that characterised the place of my confinement but my mind was occupied with other thoughts and i had not adverted to the cause of the phenomenon i had then felt little inclination to the converse of a jailor my natural disposition was somewhat singular for a frenchman and inclined to taciturnity i had resolved to make a fair and ample trial of the power of a just defence where my innocence was so complete and i was entirely disengaged from those unfavourable appearances which had constituted my misfortune at constance and i even rejoiced that a silence which i regarded as casual and individual delivered me from all fear of impertinence in my attendant with how different a temper do we contemplate an incident which we persuade ourselves continues to operate only because we want inclination to remove it and an incident which is violently imposed and to which with the utmost exertion of our strength we cannot succeed to impart the slightest shock the external object is the same its picture in the intellectual sensorium how unlike what a profound and inconceivable refinement in the art of tyranny is this silence the jailor might well tell me that beneath his roofs there was neither complaint nor murmur that the very soul of its inhabitants was subdued and that they suffered the most unheard of oppressions without astonishment or indignation this is the peculiar prerogative of despotism it produces many symptoms of the same general appearance as those which are derived from liberty and justice there are no remonstrances there is no impatience or violence there is a calm a fatal and accursed tranquillity that pervades the whole the spectator enters and for a time misinterprets every object he sees he perceives human bodies standing or moving around him and it is with the utmost surprise if he has leisure and opportunity to observe a little further that he finds at last the things he sees to be the mere shades of men cold inert glaring bodies which the heaven born soul has long since deserted wonderful i hesitate not to affirm is the genuine and direct power of such a situation as that in which i was now placed upon the human imagination what was it then to me to whom speech was not merely one of those things misnamed indulgences misnamed luxuries upon which the desirableness and the health of human existence depend but who had looked to it as the only and the assured means of my rescue from this scene of horrors i intreat the reader to pardon me when i confess that the operation of the discovery i made was so overwhelming and apparently desperate that it was some weeks i might say months before my mind recovered its wonted bias and activity it was towards the close of the period i have named that a new incident concurring with that familiarity which serves in some measure to disarm every mischief of its sting restored and re awakened my mind i had vegetated now for some time if the metaphor can with propriety be applied to existence in a noxious and empoisoned air by which all vegetation would have been undermined and which the vital principle in man is scarcely competent to surmount and in all this period had encountered nothing from without nor received any intimation that could in the slightest degree interrupt the progressive destruction and waste of the soul one day at the customary hour of my being attended by my warder i was surprised to see him bring with him a visiter to my cell the unknown was a man with grey hairs and a silver beard though once tall he now stooped considerably and supported himself with a staff his dress was simple and neat and his whole appearance prepossessing a sweet serenity was diffused over his countenance yet there were occasionally a fire and a contemplative grasp of thought expressed in his eyes which sufficiently proved to me that his serenity was not the result of vacancy all this i discerned by the faint and uncertain light of a small lamp which the warder had brought with him and placed upon my table the introduction was performed in silence and the warder left us alone the unknown beckoned me to be seated for the first emotion of surprise at the entrance of a stranger had caused me to start on my feet and opening a folding stool he had received from my attendant he placed himself beside me he then addressed me in a low voice and told me that the humanity of the fathers of the inquisition had given him permission to visit me and that if i would be so obliging in conformity to the regulations of the prison as to lower my voice to the standard of his we were at liberty to confer together he hoped the conference would be some relief to my solitude if not lead to my complete liberation he then unfolded to me his story he told me that he like myself had been committed to the prisons of the inquisition upon an accusation of sorcery having advanced thus far he stopped he talked miscellaneously and digressively of wizards and their familiars of possessions and demons of charms spells talismans and incantations even of the elixir vit and the philosophers stone sometimes in the progress of this discourse i could perceive him observing me with the utmost narrowness as if he would dive into my soul and again particularly when he caught a glance of suspicion in my eye with infinite address changing his attitude and tone and assuming a surprising air of ingenuousness and gaiety in a word he was a consummate actor it was evident whether his designs were hostile or friendly that his purpose was to make himself master of my secret i asked him whether the accusation of sorcery which had been preferred against him were well founded or a calumny he evaded that question and was only influenced by it to talk more copiously and fluently on other topics with the apparent design of making me forget the enquiry i had made he avoided anticipation lest he should miscalculate and take wrong ground in my affair and though superficially he seemed communicative i found that he scarcely told me respecting himself any one thing definite and clear he celebrated the clemency of the fathers of the inquisition he said they seemed to regard themselves as the adoptive parents of those they held in their custody and were anxious solely for the restoration of souls in their exterior they were austere and had unfortunately contracted a forbidding manner but he had soon found upon a closer inspection of their character that the only way to deal successfully with them was to repose in them a perfect confidence this panegyric was not resorted to till he had exhausted the various topics by which he had hoped himself to extort my secret from me i asked him whether the effect of his reposing confidence had been an abjuration of sorcery and reconciliation to the church but this question experienced the fate of every other that i addressed to him he only told me generally that he had every reason to be satisfied with and to speak well of the treatment he had experienced in the house of the inquisition he possessed or rather as i believed affected a character of thoughtless garrulity and loquacity well adapted to cover the strange deviations and abrupt transitions that marked his discourse it was certainly singularly contrasted with that close and penetrating air which from time to time i remarked in him the reader may deem it surprising and unaccountable but certain it is i took uncommon delight in this mans company i pressed him earnestly to repeat his visits and would scarcely suffer him to depart till he had promised to come to me again the next day or the day after yet i looked on him as my mortal enemy and had no doubt that he was one of the infamous wretches employed by the policy of the inquisition and well known beneath those hated roofs by the appellation of moscas various reasons may be assigned for my conduct in this particular let it first be remembered that i was alone and for months had not heard the sound of my own voice no incident marked my days no object arrested my attention a dull heavy pestilential soul depressing monotony formed the history of my life if in this situation i had been visited by a mouse or a rat i should indefatigably have sought to get within reach of it i should have put it to my bosom and have felt with exultation the beat of an animal pulse the warmth of animal life pressing responsively on my heart with what eager appetite i should have mixed in scenes of calamity and cruelty intolerable to any other eye glad for myself that even upon such terms i could escape the frostbound winter of the soul how i should have rejoiced like king richard of england to see four grim and death dealing assassins enter my cell like him to struggle and wrestle and contend with my murderers though as in his case wounds and a fatal end should be the result thus feeling then it is little wonderful that i should have hailed with pleasure the visit of the mosca but this was not all while i conferred with or rather listened to my visiter that pride and self complacency which i suspect to be the main or at least the indispensable ingredient of all our pleasures revived in my heart i believed that he was set upon me by these insatiable bloodsuckers of the inquisition that he might ensnare me with his questions and treacherously inveigle me to the faggot and the stake i felt a last lambent intimation of pride within me when my heart whispered me this man shall not attain his ends i secretly defied his arts and amused myself with baffling his most cunning devices i had now some one with whom to measure myself the comparison i own for a descendant of the counts of st leon was a humble one but it is not permitted a prisoner in the jails of the inquisition to be fastidious in his pleasures this man i played with at my ease and laughed at his stratagems i therefore felt that i was his superior and which was a sensation i had not lately been accustomed to that i was somebody these feelings recommended to me his visits but what was much more material i looked further and proposed an ultimate end to this occurrence let it be recollected what was my unhappiness when i found myself if i may be allowed the expression suddenly deprived of speech and then it will easily be understood how sincerely i rejoiced to have this faculty restored to me speech as i have already said i had regarded as the only and assured means of my deliverance from this scene of horrors i therefore doubted not that from this miserable tool of my oppressors i would obtain my enlargement i stood firmly on my guard i permitted him to run out the whole length of his own project without interruption by this delay i should better understand his character and finally seize it with a more decisive grasp thus purposing i allowed three or four visits to pass before i opened to the mosca my own proposal i designed unexpectedly to turn the tables upon him to surprise and finish with him at once i knew not that all this precaution was necessary but i played for too deep a stake not to be anxious to omit nothing which hereafter in retrospect i might reproach myself that i had omitted the time was at length come at which i judged it convenient to execute what i had planned in my mind i began with an attempt to mortify and humble my guest in his own eyes that he might lose the pride to make the smallest resistance to my proposal do you think my good sir cried i that i have not perfectly understood your intentions all this while you have pretended to be my friend and to come to me for my good i know that every secret i reposed in your fidelity every word that i might unguardedly have dropped every look and gesture that could have been interpreted to my disadvantage would have been instantly reported to the fathers of the inquisition why what a poor and miserable fool must you have imagined me to be how came you into my cell had you a secret key by which you found your way hither unknown could you ever have come into my apartment if you had not been employed you fawn upon me and are the tame and passive agent of my merciless destroyers shame on such base and perfidious proceedings is this religion that you should flatter and cajole and lie to a man purely that you may have the gratification at last of burning him alive if you or your masters can make out any thing to my disadvantage let them make it out in the way of fair and open trial by the production of direct evidence and calling on me for my defence they style themselves the champions of christendom and ornaments of our holy faith they pretend to an extraordinary degree of sanctity and would have all men bow down in mute reverence and astonishment at their godliness and yet they have recourse to means so base that the most profligate and abandoned tyrant upon record would have disdained to employ them but base as are the judges and assessors of the court in whose prison i stand even they scorn the meanness of the perfidious task in which you have engaged the vehemence i put into the suppressed and under tone with which i delivered these reproaches seemed to produce no emotion in my guest he dropped his staff upon his shoulder he meekly folded his arms upon his bosom and answered that he had long since learned to bear every contumely for the cause of god and the redeemer they were heaven directed chastisements which his manifold sins and iniquities had amply deserved hypocrite replied i would you make me believe that a conscientious motive can prompt such conduct as yours can mould your features into a treacherous expression of kindness and fill your mouth with lies and deceptions innumerable no proceedings rejoined he with an unaltered air are base that god and his church prescribe i take up the cross with cheerfulness and glory in my shame the more ignominious in the eyes of an unregenerate world is my conduct the more entire and implicit does it prove my obedience to be my heart swelled within me as he talked i could lend no attention to such despicable cant and was ashamed to see the most profligate conduct assuming to itself the pretensions to an extraordinary degree of sanctity and disinterestedness come come said i dissembler i know that nothing could buy a man to so loathsome an office but money you are some galley slave some wretch who by your complicated crimes have forfeited your life to the community and are now permitted to earn a miserable existence by lying in wait for the unfortunate and engaging in arts at which humanity shudders i take you upon your own terms you are the man i want assist me to escape go with me to some safer and less cruel country i will reward you to the extent of your wishes give me your hand an estate of six thousand pistoles per annum without further condition waits your acceptance i invoke all the powers sacred to truth and punishers of deceit to witness that i have ability to make good the whole of what i promise while i spoke i could perceive an extraordinary revolution taking place in my guest the meekness and tranquillity of his countenance subsided his eye became animated and alive i hailed the auspicious omen i urged my proposal with all the impetuosity i could exert and all the arguments i could devise at length i paused i looked again at the countenance of the mosca i was less pleased than before the expression did not seem to be that of assent and congratulation it was rather of horror and alarm st jago and all the saints and angels of heaven protect me exclaimed he what do i hear a full confession of guilt and art thou then the confederate of the prince of the powers of darkness if we were not here in the holy house of inquisition i should die at this moment with fear that the roof would fall and crush us together i should expect hell to swallow me alive for being found in thy unhallowed society he trembled with every expression of the sincerest terror and aversion thy money perish with thee thou second elymas like him full of all subtlety and mischief child of the devil enemy of all righteousness blasted be thy offers have i for this devoted myself to the service of god assiduously sought out the basest and vilest offices of that service and loaded myself with ignominy here that i might obtain a crown of glory hereafter and am i now to be assaulted with the worst of satans temptations even so lord if such be thy will oh poor miserable deluded victim of the arch deceiver of mankind what has the devil done for thee he has persuaded thee that thou art rich and thou wantest every joy and every necessary of life he has promised to be thy friend and he brings thee to the faggot and flames in this world as an earnest of thy eternal damnation hereafter my visiter had no sooner thus poured out the tumult and agitation of his soul than he left me abruptly and i saw him no more such was the event of my attempt to bribe the officers of the inquisition in my first experiment i could not even obtain a hearing in what followed my proposals were rejected with all the transports of religious abhorrence what i offered indeed however dazzling in the statement had not in fact the nature of a temptation he to whom i addressed it gave no credit to my assertions he thought that i was the mere drivelling dupe of him he called the arch deceiver of mankind or that my money when possessed would soon change its figure and from seeming pieces of solid coin be converted into pieces of horn or of shells even if he had not apprehended such a metamorphosis he would yet have regarded every doubloon he received as the price of his continual adversity here and damnation hereafter i gained nothing favourable for my situation by the trial i had made but i added a new chapter to my knowledge of human nature i found that to be a knave it was not necessary to be an infidel i corrected the too hasty conclusion which i had adopted with the rest of my contemporaries that he whose conduct was infamous must inevitably be destitute of religious impressions and belief and i became satisfied that a man while he practised every vice that can disgrace human nature might imagine he was doing god service enough of the interior of the prison of the inquisition i remained a tenant of this wretched mansion twelve years though the wretch who had been placed upon me as a spy was from my proposal to him satisfied of my guilt his superiors were not so they found nothing in what he reported definitive as to the nature of my unlawful practices and they could extort from me no further confession they therefore adhered to their favourite maxim to avoid the precipitate mistakes of other tribunals and to allow their prisoner full time to develop his guilt or as they pretended to establish his innocence perhaps too the temper of the prince who now filled the spanish throne contributed to my safety they could not content themselves with a less punishment for so obstinate and incorrigible a heretic than that of the flames but during the reign of the emperor charles this species of punishment for heresy was rarely inflicted and only one or two contumacious at intervals were delivered over to the executioner at a time the institution whose victim i had become looked for a richer and more abundant harvest from the well known piety and zeal of his successor i pass over the rest of the years of my tedious imprisonment they had in them a sad and death like uniformity what surprising or agreeable adventures can be expected from a man closed up within the four walls of a dungeon yet it is not altogether the uniformity of this period that determines me not to dwell upon and expand it twelve years cannot pass in the life of man without many memorable incidents and occurrences he that should be buried alive in the deepest cavern of the earth if he were not an idiot or incapable of the task of narration and could subsist twelve years in that situation could tell of things that occurred to him that might fill the busy man of the world with thoughts and speculation almost to bursting i might unfold the secrets of my prison house but that i will not i refuse the consequences of that story both to my readers and myself i have no inclination to drive the most delicate or susceptible of my readers mad with horrors i could convince such if such there are who suppose my faculties were altogether benumbed or dead that it was not so i did indeed pass days perhaps weeks in a condition of that sort but at other times my mind was roused and became busy restless impatient and inventive there was no mode of escape that i did not ruminate upon or attempt not to mention that though my body was restrained my mind occasionally soared to the furthest regions of the empyrean or plunged into the deepest of the recesses in which nature conceals her operations all systems of philosophising became familiar to me i revolved every different fable that has been constructed respecting the invisible powers that superintend the events of the boundless universe and i fearlessly traced out and developed the boldest conjectures and assertions of demonism or atheism as the humour of the moment led me i derived misery or consolation from each of these systems in their turn but memory bitter memory unperceived by its lord is seizing my pen and running away with my narrative enough enough of the interior of the prison of the inquisition chapter xxxii philip the second king of spain succeeded to the throne of that monarchy about the close of the year but his affairs in england and the netherlands long withheld him from visiting his beloved country and he did not reach its shores after a seven years absence till the twenty ninth of august it may be thought that a public event of this sort could be little interesting to me a forgotten prisoner immured in the dungeons of the inquisition the fact was otherwise the king was desirous of distinguishing his arrival on his native soil by some splendid exhibition or memorable event that should at once express his piety to god and conduce to the felicity of his people and he could think of nothing that so signally united these characters as an auto de f the lutheran heresy which in the course of forty years had spread its poison so widely in the different countries of europe had not failed to scatter a few of its noxious seeds even in this the purest and most catholic of all its divisions but philip had early proclaimed his hostility against this innovation and prostrating himself before the image of his saviour had earnestly besought the divine majesty that he might never suffer himself to be or to be called the lord of those in any corner of the globe who should deny him the lord previously to his arrival in spain directions had been given and arrangements made respecting the pious and solemn exhibition he demanded formerly those who by the fathers of the inquisition had been delivered over to the secular arm had been executed in the different places where their crimes had been committed or their trials been held but now it was proposed that all those throughout the kingdom who were found properly qualified to satisfy by their deaths the sublime taste of the royal saint should be divided into two troops and sent the one to seville long the capital of an illustrious monarchy and the other to valladolid which had the honour to be the birthplace of the present sovereign the troop destined to feed the flames at seville was composed of fifty persons many of them distinguished for their rank their talents or their virtues the troop to be escorted to valladolid of which i was a member amounted only to thirty but to compensate this deficiency philip himself had signified his gracious intention to be present together with the heir apparent and his whole court at that exhibition the spanish nation rejoicing in the approach of a monarch who was born among them whose manners and temper happily accorded with theirs and whom they believed about to fix his perpetual residence in their land expected him with all the longings of the most ardent attachment we the unhappy victims of pious and inquisitorial tyranny also expected him our hearts did not pant with a less beating quickness though our anxiety arose from emotions of a different nature valladolid is distant from the metropolis eighty four miles we had already been some weeks prepared for this journey and piously directed to hold ourselves in readiness to take our part in the solemn national sacrifice we waited however to receive a previous notice of the day on which the monarch would enter the place of his birth since so great was his royal zeal for the cause of religion and civil society that he would not consent to be absent from any part of the spectacle and accordingly it was not allowed us to enter the scene of our final destination till the king of spain and the indies should be already on the spot and prepared to receive us the auto da f performed at seville had the precedence of ours it took place on the twenty fourth of september and we were indulged with an accurate account of it and were present at a public reading of the record of the act in the chapel of our prison previously to our removal from the metropolis i will not enter into a minute detail of the scene of this reading though the recollection will never be effaced from my memory of the persons present who were destined to suffer capital punishment eight were women four of them were taken from a single family being a grandmother a mother and two daughters of the noble house of alcala they had all been beautiful of person and of a graceful figure the youngest of the daughters was in the nineteenth year of her age their crime together with that of the majority of their fellow sufferers was obstinate and impenitent lutheranism the seats of the women were separated from the rest and fronted with a close lattice the men were twenty two in number and their appearance was truly impressive their persons were neglected and their figures emaciated their eyes were sunk and ghastly and their complexions of a sallow and death like white most of them were crippled by their long confinement and the severities they had endured and were supported to their seats upon an elevated scaffolding with benches raised one above another by two apparators one on each side of the condemned heretic god of mercy and benevolence is it possible that this scene should be regarded as thy triumph and the execution destined to follow as a sacrifice acceptable in thy sight if these papers of mine are ever produced to light may it not happen that they shall first be read by a distant posterity who will refuse to believe that their fathers were ever mad enough to subject each other to so horrible a treatment merely because they were unable to adopt each others opinions oh no human affairs like the waves of the ocean are merely in a state of ebb and flow there is nothing new under the sun two centuries perhaps after philip the second shall be gathered to his ancestors he died in men shall learn over again to persecute each other for conscience sake other anabaptists or levellers shall furnish pretexts for new persecutions other inquisitors shall arise in the most enlightened tracts of europe and professors from their chair sheltering their intolerance under the great names of aristotle and cicero shall instruct their scholars that a heterodox doctrine is the worst of crimes and that the philanthropy and purity of heart in which it is maintained only render its defenders the more worthy to be extirpated what were the ideas and reflections of my fellows seated on the benches above below and on either side of me i am unable to affirm my own could not fail to be pungent and distressing i understood continually more and more of the mysterious and unuttered history of the stranger who died in the summer house of the lake of constance i found that i was only acting over again what he had experienced before me his legacies had served to involve me in the bitterest and most unheard of miseries but were wholly destitute of ability to rescue from the evils themselves created unbounded wealth i found to have no power to bribe the dastard slaves of religious bigotry and the elixir of immortality though it could cure disease and put to flight the approaches of age was impotent to repel the fervour of devouring flames i might have been happy i was happy when the stranger found me i might have lived to a virtuous and venerable old age and have died in the arms of my posterity the stranger had given me wealth and i was now poorer than the peasant who wanders amidst polar snows the stranger had given me immortality and in a few days i was to expire in excruciating tortures he found me tranquil contented in the midst of simple yet inestimable pleasures he breathed into me the restless sentiment of ambition and it was that sentiment which at length had placed me on high in the chapel of the prison of the catholic inquisition our progress to valladolid was slow and solemn and occupied a space of no less than four days on the evening of the fourth day we approached that city the king and his court came out to meet us he saluted the inquisitor general with all the demonstrations of the deepest submission and humility and then having yielded him the place of honour turned round his horse and accompanied us to valladolid the cavalcade that attended the king broke into two files and received us in the midst of them the whole city seemed to empty itself on this memorable occasion and the multitudes that crowded along the road and were scattered in the neighbouring fields were innumerable the day was now closed and the procession went forward amidst the light of a thousand torches we the condemned of the inquisition had been conducted from the metropolis upon tumbrils but as we arrived at the gates of valladolid we were commanded for the greater humiliation to alight and proceed on foot to the place of our confinement as many as could not walk without assistance being supported by the attendants we were neither chained nor bound the practice of the inquisition being to deliver the condemned upon such occasions into the hands of two sureties each who placed their charge in the middle between them and men of the most respectable characters were accustomed from religious motives to sue for this melancholy office dejected and despairing i entered the streets of the city no object present to the eyes of my mind but that of my approaching execution the crowd was vast the confusion inexpressible as we passed by the end of a narrow lane the horse of one of the guards who rode exactly in a line with me plunged and reared in a violent manner and at length threw his rider upon the pavement others of the horse guards attempted to catch the bridle of the enraged animal they rushed against each other several of the crowd were thrown down and trampled under the horses feet the shrieks of these and the loud cries and exclamations of the bystanders mingled in confused and discordant chorus no sound no object could be distinguished from the excess of the tumult a sudden thought darted into my mind where all an instant before had been relaxation and despair two or three of the horses pushed forward in a particular direction a moment after they resiled with equal violence and left a wide but transitory gap my project was no sooner conceived than executed weak as i had just now felt myself a supernatural tide of strength seemed to come over me i sprung away with all imaginable impetuosity and rushed down the lane i have just mentioned every one amidst the confusion was attentive to his personal safety and several minutes elapsed before i was missed chapter xxxiii in the lane every thing was silent and the darkness was extreme man woman and child were gone out to view the procession for some time i could scarcely distinguish a single object the doors and windows were all closed i now chanced to come to an open door within i saw no one but an old man who was busy over some metallic work at a chafing dish of fire i had no room for choice i expected every moment to hear the myrmidons of the inquisition at my heels i rushed in i impetuously closed the door and bolted it i then seized the old man by the collar of his shirt with a determined grasp and swore vehemently that i would annihilate him that instant if he did not consent to afford me assistance though for some time i had perhaps been feebler than he the terror that now drove me on rendered me comparatively a giant he intreated me to permit him to breathe and promised to do whatever i should desire i looked round the apartment and saw a rapier hanging against the wall of which i instantly proceeded to make myself master while i was doing this my involuntary host who was extremely terrified at my procedure nimbly attempted to slip by me and rush into the street with difficulty i caught hold of his arm and pulling him back put the point of my rapier to his breast solemnly assuring him that no consideration on earth should save him from my fury if he attempted to escape a second time he immediately dropped on his knees and with the most piteous accents intreated me to spare his life i told him that i was no robber that i did not intend him the slightest harm and that if he would implicitly yield to my direction he might assure himself he never should have reason to repent his compliance by this declaration the terrors of the old man were somewhat appeased i took the opportunity of this calm to go to the street door which i instantly locked and put the key in my bosom nothing but the most fortunate concurrence of circumstances could have thus forwarded my escape the rearing of the horse of the life guardsman was purely accidental the concourse and press of the crowd from all sides could alone have rendered this circumstance of any magnitude the gap which was made by the pushing forwards and resiling of the horses continued barely long enough for me to spring through and closed again in an instant it is astonishing that the thought of escape should have thus suddenly darted into my mind which but a moment before was in a state of dejection equally incompatible with activity and with hope that in the lane down which i rushed i should have met no human creature and that the first open door i saw should lead to the residence of a decrepid old man who appeared to be its single inhabitant were occurrences equally extraordinary yet seem to have been both indispensable to my safety one point more concurred with this fortunate train and assisted to still the palpitations of my beating heart i perceived by certain indications in the countenance of my host that he was by parentage a jew i presently concluded that he was what in spain they denominate a new christian for that otherwise he would not have been allowed to reside at large in a spanish city but upon that supposition i did not believe that christianity was very deeply mingled up in him with the vital principle the converts of the inquisition are not conspicuous for their sincerity now then for the first time i thought in the course of twelve years i had opportunity to communicate with a man whose soul was not enslaved to the blood thirsty superstition of this devoted country all i had seen during the period of my confinement were hyenas tigers and crocodiles they were not men i had no sooner soothed my host into a temper to listen to my story than i told him with all imaginable frankness whence i came and to what i had been destined the mention of sorcery however and preternatural practices i suppressed for i suspected that persons of all religions entertained an equal horror against these i suffered him to imagine that the allegation against me had been the crime of heresy all sects of the christian superstition might be supposed equally obnoxious or acceptable to a jew i emphatically appealed to the persecutions which had been so long directed against the religion of his ancestors and observed how disgraceful it would be in him to assist the operation of a principle the effects of which his fathers had so deeply deplored and so perfectly abhorred i assured him that i would bring him into no danger and that all i asked was the protection of a few hours i would leave him in the course of the following day and he should hear of me no more i reminded him that the danger he had to fear was in betraying not in protecting me the inquisition looked upon every new christian with an eye of the severest jealousy and the mere fact if known that i had taken refuge in his house would infallibly subject him to the purgation of a temporary imprisonment in their dungeons it would be in vain for him to affirm that he had no choice in what had occurred he was without a witness to confirm his relation and the assertions of a man born of jewish parents never obtained credit in the court of the inquisition i added with solemn asseverations that the moment i set foot beyond the territory of spain i would remit to him the sum of six hundred pistoles as an acknowledgment for his kindness during the whole of my discourse i watched his countenance with the utmost minuteness it gradually relaxed from the terror which had at first appeared in it to expressions of compassion and complacence i saw nothing that ought to alarm me when it was his turn to speak he earnestly assured me that he took a warm interest in my story and would cheerfully perform every thing i required he was happy that my favourable stars had led me to his habitation and would rejoice to the latest hour of his existence if they rendered him instrumental in preserving the life of a human being from so deplorable a catastrophe while i talked to him i easily perceived that the arguments i used which produced the most sensible effect upon his features were those of the dangers arising to him from betraying me and the reward of six hundred pistoles which i promised him in the event of my success his motives however were blended together in his mind and he had no sooner formed a determination grounded perhaps upon the meanest considerations than he became eloquent in a panegyric of his own benevolence by which he was not i believe more anxious to impose upon me than to put the change upon himself i considered all that he said his gestures and the very tones of his voice with eager anxiety the terror of the inquisition penetrated to the marrow in my bones and the fate awarded against me by that court became inexpressibly more horrible to my thoughts now that i saw the probability of escaping it every thing that i observed in the jew was apparently fair plausible and encouraging but nothing had power to quell the agitations of my apprehensive soul we were still engaged in discussing the topics i have mentioned when i was suddenly alarmed by the noise of some one stirring in the inner apartment i had looked into this room and had perceived nothing but the bed upon which the old man nightly reposed himself i sprung up however at the sound and perceiving that the door had a bolt on the outside i eagerly fastened it i then turned to mordecai such previously to his conversion had been the name of my host wretch said i did not you assure me that there was no one but yourself in the house oh cried mordecai it is my child it is my child she went into the inner apartment and has fallen asleep on the bed beware i answered the slightest falsehood more shall instantly be expiated in your blood i call abraham to witness rejoined the once more terrified jew it is my child only my child tell me cried i with severity of accent how old is this child only five years said mordecai my dear leah died when her babe was no more than a year old and though we had several children this single one has survived her speak to your child let me hear her voice he spoke to her and she answered father i want to come out i was satisfied it was the voice of a little girl i turned to the jew take care said i how you deceive me now is there no other person in that room he imprecated a curse on himself if there were i opened the door with caution and the little girl came forward as soon as i saw her i seized her with a rapid motion and retired back to a chair man said i you have trifled with me too rashly you have not considered what i am escaped from and what i have to fear from this moment this child shall be the pledge of my safety i will not part with her an instant as long as i remain in your house and with this rapier in my hand i will pierce her to the heart the moment i am led to imagine that i am no longer in safety the jew trembled at my resolution the emotions of a father worked in his features and glistened in his eye at least let me kiss her said he be it so replied i one embrace and then till the dawn of the coming day she remains with me i released my hold the child rushed to her father and he caught her in his arms my dear leah cried mordecai now a sainted spirit in the bosom of our father abraham i call god to witness between us that if all my caution and vigilance can prevent it not a hair of this child shall be injured stranger you little know by how strong a motive you have now engaged me to your cause we poor jews hunted on the face of the earth the abhorrence and execration of mankind have nothing but family affections to support us under our multiplied disgraces and family affections are entwined with our existence the fondest and best loved part of ourselves the god of abraham bless you my child now sir speak what is it you require of me i told the jew that i must have a suit of clothes conformable to the appearance of a spanish cavalier and certain medical ingredients that i named to him together with his chafing dish of coals to prepare them and that done i would then impose on him no further trouble having received his instructions he immediately set out to procure what i demanded he took with him the key of the house and as soon as he was gone i retired with the child into the inner apartment and fastened the door at first i applied myself to tranquillise the child who had been somewhat alarmed at what she had heard and seen this was no very difficult task she presently left me to amuse herself with some playthings that lay scattered in a corner of the apartment my heart was now comparatively at ease i saw the powerful hold i had on the fidelity of the jew and firmly persuaded myself that i had no treachery to fear on his part thus circumstanced the exertion and activity with which i had lately been imbued left me and i insensibly sunk into a sort of slumber the night was now far advanced and i was still reclined insensible upon mordecais bed when suddenly a jargon of various sounds seemed from all sides to assail me my mind was confused i heard something but seemed wholly unconscious what i was and where i wanted to escape from the disturbance but it continued and even increased at length i was forced to command my attention and the first thing i perceived was a beating at the door of the chamber the little girl was come to the bedside and endeavouring to shake me sir sir she cried in an eager accent my father wants to come in and i cannot slip the bolt of the door by slow degrees i began to comprehend my situation and to recollect what had happened immediately before i felt greatly alarmed i feared by the disturbance that mordecai had not returned alone i essayed to speak my organs refused their office i endeavoured to move my limbs felt palsied and absolutely lifeless i experienced a sinking and sickness of heart that seemed to be the immediate precursor of death by listening occasionally to the discourse which the father and the daughter began to hold with each other i became satisfied that mordecai was without a companion i endeavoured to make the little girl understand that i was incapable of rising from the bed and having at length succeeded she communicated the information to her father with considerable trouble he loosened the door at its hinges and entered the room i found myself in the extremest degree feeble and languid the jew however assiduously administered to me of cordials he had in his possession and by degrees i felt myself considerably restored now for the first time i was at leisure to attend to the state of my strength and my health my confinement in the inquisition and the treatment i had experienced had before rendered me feeble and almost helpless but these appeared to be circumstances scarcely worthy of attention in the situation in which i was then placed the impulse i felt in the midst of the confusion in the grand street of valladolid produced in me an energy and power of exertion which nothing but the actual experience of the fact could have persuaded me was possible this energy once begun appeared to have the faculty of prolonging itself and i did not relapse into imbecility till the occasion seemed to be exhausted which called for my exertion i examined myself by a mirror with which mordecai furnished me i found my hair as white as snow and my face ploughed with a thousand furrows i was now fifty four an age which with moderate exercise and a vigorous constitution often appears like the prime of human existence but whoever had looked upon me in my present condition would not have hesitated to affirm that i had reached the eightieth year of my age i examined with dispassionate remark the state of my intellect i was persuaded that it had subsided into childishness my mind had been as much cribbed and immured as my body i was the mere shadow of a man of no more power and worth than that which a magic lantern produces upon a wall these are thy works superstition this the genuine and proper operation of what is called christianity let the reader judge of what i had passed through and known within those cursed walls by the effects i have already refused i continue to refuse to tell what i suffered and how those effects were produced enough of compassion enough of complaint i will confine myself as far as i am able to simple history being recovered as far as the cordials and attention of mordecai were capable of recovering me i desired for the remainder of the night to be alone except that i was still resolved to retain the little jewess as the pledge of my safety i was greatly obliged to my host for the punctuality he had already displayed he had found considerable difficulty in procuring the articles of which i stood in need owing partly to the lateness of the hour and partly to the presence of the king and the general hurry and confusion which had been produced by the solemn entry of the inquisition his efforts too to recover me from the languor and lethargy into which i had sunk had a character of generosity and perhaps i ought now to have trusted him without a hostage but my heart was too earnestly bent upon accomplishing its present object to afford harbour to the punctilios of delicacy the same earnestness caused me to insist upon mordecais repairing the injury which the hinges of the door had sustained and i was careful to satisfy myself that every thing was restored to a state of perfect security i was now once again alone the little girl who had been unusually disturbed and roused at an unseasonable hour sunk into a profound sleep i heard the noise which mordecai made in undressing himself and composing his limbs upon a mattrass which he had dragged for the present occasion into the front room and spread before the hearth i soon found by the hardness of his breathing that he also was asleep i unfolded the papers he had brought me they consisted of various medical ingredients i had directed him to procure there were also two or three vials containing syrups and essences i had near me a pair of scales with which to weigh my ingredients a vessel of water the chafing dish of my host in which the fire was nearly extinguished and a small taper with some charcoal to relight the fire in case of necessity while i was occupied in surveying these articles and arranging my materials a sort of torpor came suddenly over me so as to allow me no time for resistance i sunk upon the bed i remained thus for about half an hour seemingly without the power of collecting my thoughts at length i started felt alarmed and applied my utmost force of mind to rouse my exertions while i drove or attempted to drive my animal spirits from limb to limb and from part to part as if to enquire into the general condition of my frame i became convinced that i was dying let not the reader be surprised at this twelve years imprisonment in a narrow and unwholesome cell may well account for so sudden a catastrophe strange and paradoxical as it may seem i believe it will be found in the experiment that the calm and security which succeed to great internal injuries are more dangerous than the pangs and hardships that went before i was now thoroughly alarmed i applied myself with all vigilance and expedition to the compounding my materials the fire was gone out the taper was glimmering in the socket to swallow the julep when i had prepared it seemed to be the last effort of which my organs and muscles were capable it was the elixir of immortality exactly made up according to the prescription of the stranger whether from the potency of the medicine or the effect of imagination i felt revived the moment i had swallowed it i placed myself deliberately in mordecais bed and drew over me the bed clothes i fell asleep almost instantly i believe my first sleep was perfectly sound and insensible but in no long time i was visited with the pleasantest dreams imaginable nothing was distinct nothing was attended with the consciousness of my former identity but every thing was gay cheerful invigorating and delicious i wandered amidst verdant lawns and flower enamelled gardens i was saluted with the singing of a thousand birds and the murmuring of a thousand fountains kids fawns and lambs frisked and gamboled before me at a distance through an opening in the trees i discerned nymphs and their swains dancing a variety of antic measures i advanced towards them they approached towards me fifes oboes recorders and instruments of a hundred names commenced a cheerful and melodious concert myself and the dancers now were met they placed me in the midst of them they began a choral song the motion of their limbs conformed to their numbers i was the theme of the general chaunt they ascribed to me the beauty of apollo the strength of hercules the invention of mercury and the youth of bacchus my sleep was not long in a few hours i awakened with difficulty i recognised the objects about me and recollected where i had been it seemed to me that my heart had never beat so vigorously nor my spirits flowed so gay i was all elasticity and life i could scarcely hold myself quiet i felt impelled to bound and leap like a kid upon the mountains i perceived that my little jewess was still asleep she had been unusually fatigued the night before i know not whether mordecais hour of rising were come if it were he was careful not to disturb his guest i put on the garments he had prepared i gazed upon the mirror he had left in my apartment i can recollect no sensation in the course of my life so unexpected and surprising as what i felt at that moment the evening before i had seen my hair white and my face ploughed with furrows i looked fourscore what i beheld now was totally different yet altogether familiar it was myself myself as i had appeared on the day of my marriage with marguerite de damville the eyes the mouth the hair the complexion every circumstance point by point the same i leaped a gulf of thirty two years i waked from a dream troublesome and distressful beyond all description but it vanished like the shades of night upon the burst of a glorious morning in july and left not a trace behind i knew not how to take away my eyes from the mirror before me i soon began to consider that if it were astonishing to me that through all the regions of my countenance i could discover no trace of what i had been the night before it would be still more astonishing to my host this sort of sensation i had not the smallest ambition to produce one of the advantages of the metamorphosis i had sustained consisted in its tendency in the eyes of all that saw me to cut off every species of connection between my present and my former self it fortunately happened that the room in which i slept being constructed upon the model of many others in spain had a stair at the further end with a trap door in the ceiling for the purpose of enabling the inhabitant to ascend on the roof in the cool of the day the roofs were flat and so constructed that there was little difficulty in passing along them from house to house from one end of the street to the other i availed myself of the opportunity and took leave of the residence of my land host in a way perfectly unceremonious determined however speedily to transmit to him the reward i had promised it may easily be believed that mordecai was not less rejoiced at the absence of a guest whom the vigilance of the inquisition rendered an uncommonly dangerous one than i was to quit his habitation i closed the trap after me and clambered from roof to roof to a considerable distance at length i encountered the occasion of an open window and fortunately descended unseen by any human being into the street having with difficulty succeeded on this occasion of public solemnity in engaging an apartment in one of the hotels of valladolid i sent into it as soon as i was able a chest containing every necessary of apparel and particularly a suit of clothes i then changed my dress and threw the clothes which mordecai had provided into the chest i had purchased as long as they continued safely locked up and the key in my possession no faculty possessed by any human creature could detect my identity and expose me afresh to my former jailors the only peril under which i had before laboured was from mordecai who if he had seen me in the garments he had procured might have recognised them and though a peril from this source came barely within the limits of possibility it was easily avoided and i therefore chose to avoid it i passed the whole of this day in a species of enjoyment which as it has no parallel in the ordinary transactions of mankind so are there no terms in the received languages of the world that are adequate to the description of it it has often been a subject of melancholy and complaint among mortals that while the whole vegetable system contains in it a principle of perpetual renewal man alone the ornament and lord of the universe man knows no return to youth when the sun declines in the west the flowers droop and fold up their frail and delicate leaves but soon the eyelids of the morn are again opened and again they rejoice in his invigorating beams upon the approach of winter the beech the ash and the monarch oak scatter their withered foliage over the plains but spring reappears and nakedness is no longer their reproach and they clothe themselves anew in their leafy honours with what a melancholy sensation does the old man survey his decaying limbs to me he cries there is no second morning and no returning spring my head pressed down with years shall never again erect itself in conscious manhood these hoary locks shall no more be adorned with the auburn of glossy youth my weather beaten trunk shall at no time clothe itself with a smoother rind a recruited marrow shall never fill these bones nor a more vigorous sap circulate through my unstrung limbs i recollect what i was in the prime of manhood with vain regrets the memory answers no other end than to torment and upbraid me the useless wish of the old man the object of his hopeless sigh was mine common and every day blessings have little value in the eye of their possessor the young man squanders the endowments of youth and knows not to prize them if the young man had once been old if the old man could again be young then and then only they would justly estimate their wealth the springy limb the bounding frame the vigour that sets fatigue at defiance and revels in pleasures unexhausted would then by the near and conscious comparison of feebleness and lassitude the drooping limb the aching head and the frame decayed in all its senses be well understood such was my situation yesterday i was fourscore to day i was twenty yesterday i was a prisoner crippled in every articulation to day i was a citizen of the world capable of all its delights to morrow i was destined to have been dragged to the stake with ignominy and to suffer intolerable anguish amidst the shouts and huzzas of an unfeeling populace to morrow i was at liberty to employ as i pleased to choose the theatre upon which it should be spent and the gratifications that should be crowded into it what was most material my mind was grown young with my body weary of eternal struggle i had lately resigned the contest and sunk under the ill fortune that relentlessly pursued me now i felt within me a superfluity of vigour i panted for something to contend with and something to conquer my senses unfolded themselves to all the curiosity of remark my thoughts seemed capable of industry unwearied and investigation the most constant and invincible ambition revived in my bosom i longed for new engagements and new relations i desired to perform something that i might myself regard with complacence and that i might see the world start at and applaud i determined for reasons that i shall presently have occasion to unfold that my first visit should be to my daughters at my paternal estate of st leon i proposed to spend two or three days in preparations for this journey by mere accident by a most censurable heedlessness i became in some degree a spectator of the auto da f in which i was destined to have been a victim unawares i had become entangled in the crowd and could with difficulty escape or even prevent my being carried nearer the centre of the scene i saw the galleries and accommodations that had been erected for the spectators i saw the windows and roofs of the houses crowded with beholders the shrieks of the sufferers i could not hear they were drowned in the infernal exultations of the multitude but what was worst of all i discerned some of the condemned fixed as they were upon small boards near the top of stakes about four yards high and therefore greatly above the heads of the assembly while the flames abundantly fed with faggots and dry fuel climbed aloft and seemed eager to embrace their victims as i have already said there were thirty of these death devoted frames and if my eye did not count them all my fancy well supplied what sense was unable to discover the impression i felt at that moment was horrible beyond all conception i exerted my new found strength and pushed out of the press with irresistible vigour if at that instant i could have felt exultation even in the consciousness of my own safety i should regard myself as the most execrable of monsters chapter xxxiv the first employment in which i purposed to engage my new found liberty and youth was a visit to my daughters i now carried a disguise perpetually about with me that would render my journey incapable of proving injurious to them my daughters were all that remained if indeed they still remained of my once idolised family for twelve years i had continued totally ignorant of their fortune and even of their existence part of the plan i had adopted for their advantage necessarily precluded me from all correspondence or communication with them or any one near them that might satisfy and tranquillise the anxieties of a father if it had been otherwise deprived as i had been of the common benefits of light and air and cast out from the society of mankind i could have obtained no intelligence of their welfare in visiting i determined not to make myself known to them yet notwithstanding the greatness of this disadvantage i felt that one of the most exquisite gratifications the earth could afford me was to behold my children what a multitude of adventures and incidents might they not have encountered in the space of twelve years imagination and affection dwell impatiently on the interval nor can any thing quiet the conjectures of him that loves short of the most complete information what a difference must twelve years have produced in the very persons and figures of creatures so young with what mingled and exquisite emotions does the father contemplate his daughter whom he left a child grown up into a woman he sees her with astonishment and rapture displaying maturer beauties discovering in her countenance new traces of knowledge and sentiment and in her gesture and manners a character finished matronly and sedate the very circumstance that i should visit them unknown and converse intimately with them without being discovered while it cut me off from many pure and ingenuous pleasures added in some respects a new relish to the indulgence for it gave it a character singular and perhaps unprecedented in the history of mankind i anticipated with eager transport the hour at which i should revisit the place of my birth wander amidst the shades where my careless infancy had strayed recognise objects made sacred to my heart by associations with my venerable mother and my adorable wife now illumined with the presence of my children and steal a joy unsuspected and unknown to which the very secrecy with which it was ravished would give a tenfold gust i embraced the nearest route by pampeluna and the pyrenees to the banks of the garonne one particular pleasure that i reaped during this tour which the climate and scenery might alone have rendered delightful consisted in the youthful sensation with which every thing i saw was enjoyed every one who can call to mind the amusements of his childhood will be conscious that during that period all his senses were in a tone adapted to convey the most exquisite gratification this is not merely as is vulgarly supposed the result of the novelty and freshness with which at that time every thing strikes us the extremities of the nerves are in a state of the most delicate susceptibility upon which no touch however slight and evanescent is lost and which makes us upon every occasion favourable to enjoyment gasp and tremble with the pleasure we imbibe we feel it thrilling through every pulse and communicating its tone to every part our attention is engrossed by a single object or if we are sensible to accompanying incidents it spreads over them an animating sunshine and totally varies their appearance and hue age on the contrary imperceptibly brings along with it callosity and sluggishness of sensation our gratifications are coldly relished and our desires feebly awakened such is the difference in our perception of delicious fruits of fragrant smells of smooth and glossy surfaces of the vividness of colour and the heavenly sweetness of sound if this be a just account i leave the reader to imagine how i enjoyed my tour from valladolid to the beautiful and romantic retirement of st leon there was however one sentiment with which i was at this time impressed that i shall find it difficult to make the reader understand in the extent in which i felt it and that formed a powerful drawback upon the pleasures i have just described a short time ago i had been old now i was young i had quaffed of the elixir of immortality the revolution this had produced in my sentiments was not less memorable than that which it had effected in my corporeal lineaments and my mental elasticity it is so different a thing to conceive a proposition theoretically and to experience it in practice the case is parallel to that of the expectation which an ordinary christian entertains of eternal bliss it is an article in his creed he repeats it every night when he lies down and every morning when he rises he would be both offended and surprised if you told him he was not persuaded of it and yet how faint and indistinct a picture it produces in his intellectual retina the affairs of the world strike him with all the force of vision to them he cannot make himself a stranger and a pilgrim he cannot transfer all his affections to the mere creature of his imagination engendered in solitude and nurtured by enthusiasm heaven how different must have been the feelings of the celebrated apostle who had been taken up into the third heaven and had beheld the new jerusalem with all its jaspers its chrysolites its emeralds and its sapphires my situation was similar to this i had long known as far as reflection could assure me of it that i possessed the elixir of immortality but never till now had i felt the julep tingling in my veins and known the effects of it in every joint and articulation of my frame i before believed i now felt that i was immortal the consequence of this intimate persuasion was not without its portion of melancholy i still bore the figure and lineaments of a human creature but i knew that i was not what i seemed there was a greater distance between me and the best constructed and most consummate of the human species than there is between him and an ant or a muskito crushed by the first accidental tread or consumed by the first spark wafted by the wind i can no longer cheat my fancy i know that i am alone the creature does not exist with whom i have any common language or any genuine sympathies society is a bitter and galling mockery to my heart it only shows in more glaring colours my desolate condition the nearer i attempt to draw any of the nominal ties of our nature the more they start and shrink from my grasp from this moment i could not shake off the terrible impression of my loneliness no not for an hour often does this impression induce me to regard my immortality with loathing indescribable often do i wish to shelter myself from it in the sweet oblivion of the grave from this hour i had no passions no interests no affections my heart has never expanded with one natural emotion i have never delivered myself up to the repose of one genuine amusement if at any time i have had a glimpse of pleasure it has irritated only to deceive it has increased the appetite while it displayed in stronger colours my impotence to gratify it what is worse every added year has still subtracted something from the little poignancy and relish which the bowl of human life continued to retain i have the power of assuming a youthful and glossy appearance whenever i think proper but this is only a bitter mockery of the furrows ploughed in my heart in so much of my adventures as remains for me to describe i feel that i shall be obliged to employ the established terms of human description i cannot interrupt the history of my sensations by a recital of those pangs by which they have been every moment interrupted the terms i must use may delude the reader into an imagination that i still participate of enjoyment and of hope be it so they may cheat the reader they cannot cheat myself previously to my arrival in the vicinity of the garonne i equipped myself in the habit of an armenian and assumed the character of a merchant travelling from country to country for the sale of his commodities it was in the close of a wintry day in the bleak and cheerless month of december that i first viewed from a distance the turrets of st leon i procured myself accommodations for the night in the adjoining village being now after so long an absence within reach of the residence of these lovely treasures i sought without any direct consciousness of the sentiment to delay our interview when i entered the little auberge sheltered under a small plantation of olives i dreaded to hear the repetition of my family name i longed most fervently to be informed of the welfare of my daughters yet i could have died sooner than utter a single question on the subject i found that that ardent love which had urged me with rapid steps from valladolid to st leon gradually as the distance grew little changed from an impetuous vehemence to hear of and to see them to fearful awe struck motionless anxiety their light and airy figures as i last saw them at montauban in danced before the eyes of my imagination what casualties what calamities might not have overtaken them since i was afraid almost to breathe lest i should dissolve the unreal scene that played around me how did i know that i did not indulge this cheerful imagination for the last time again and again in the course of the evening i felt as if i could have wasted ages in this auberge and the neighbouring fields still believing that my daughters inhabited yonder towers still hovering round their fancied residence but never daring to utter their name lest it should be found the prelude to some fatal intelligence how rich and refined a repast in some cases is uncertainty it had the power to impart to these precious pledges a share of that immortality of which i was the destined monopolist why had i not the courage never to overpass the limit at which i was now arrived and wherever i afterwards wandered on the various surface of the globe still to be able to repeat to myself the complacent whisper i have visited my daughters in their separated abode and my visit was productive of none but agreeable sensations my passions were too much afloat to suffer me really to rest in this patient contemplative gratification before the mornings dawn i walked forth and turned my eyes towards the castle i loitered from bank to bank and from point to point daylight slowly broke in upon me but all was silent and quiet in my paternal chteau the family is not yet stirring said i to myself i turned my steps to the spot where the ashes of my mother were mingled with their parent earth the time that had intervened since her decease the various fortunes and impressions i had experienced had somewhat obliterated the vividness of her picture in my memory and deadened the tremblingness of sensation with which i once thought of her yet enough was left to make it an interesting moment to me when i kneeled at her tomb why oh why as it had been with my great forefathers was it not a moment of exultation to me when i thus feelingly saluted the shade of a parent he that exults in such an hour must feel that he has illustrated his birth and honoured his progenitors i had done nothing of this i was an exile on the face of the earth had acquired no trophies and accumulated no fame i had none to honour none even to know me i had no family i had no friend these bitter recollections started up in array before me and cut me to the heart the spirit of my mother frowned upon her son and i returned along the path by which i came disgraced and disconsolate i am now said i in a fit temper to learn intelligence of my daughters if they have been unhappy to hear it will not make me more forlorn if they have been fortunate that knowledge and that alone may revive my courage i hastened towards the avenue i looked into the thickets and winding paths as i passed they communicated to me mingled pictures of my own boyish days and of the amusements of the present inhabitants i told the nature of my pretended traffic to the servants of the house and proposed an exhibition of my commodities i was admitted as i desired to the apartment of their mistresses i saw two young ladies who appeared to be respectively about twenty eight and twenty four years of age and whom without much difficulty i recognised for my daughters louisa and marguerite their situation and their ages identified them and when afterwards i came to peruse their features attentively i could easily discover traits of the amiable young woman and the playful child they had been when last we parted i found them employed upon a piece of embroidery a comely and respectable looking young woman a servant was sewing in another part of the room every thing about the ladies bespoke the ease of their circumstances and the propriety of their sentiments both had on an elegant morning habit both had an air of sedateness and sobriety that to my apprehension told that they had not lived unchastened by misfortune they each slightly looked up as i was ushered into the apartment they saluted me with a graceful and condescending bend of the head such as we are accustomed to use to an inferior whom we are willing to put at his ease what were my sensations a father disguised and unknown in the presence of his children i attempted to stand as is usual for a tradesman when he waits on his customers at their own house i attempted to speak my tongue refused its office my legs tottered as if sustaining an unusual weight louisa observed me and desired me to be seated i had no power of choice i accepted her civility no sooner was i seated than in spite of myself a flood of tears gushed from my eyes she was astonished she begged to know if i were indisposed she requested me to make use of every assistance the house could afford i now found my speech i apologised for my behaviour said i had felt suddenly ill but that the tears i shed would prove the most effectual relief to me my appearance it may be proper to mention was not that of a vulgar pedlar it was tall graceful and ingenuous with a certain air of refinement and politeness my armenian dress though formed of uncostly materials was such as to display my person to considerable advantage both the young ladies showed themselves interested in the symptoms of my distress after a few minutes internal struggle i rose made an excuse for the abruptness of my departure and requested permission to repeat my visit in the afternoon when i should have something not unimportant to communicate to them i had seen two of my daughters i had been satisfied that they still existed i had witnessed their exterior health and beauty as i withdrew i laid my hand upon my heart and congratulated myself thus far said i it is well i felt relieved from part of the weight that lay there with my right hand i struck upon my forehead but oh where cried i is my other daughter the thought came over me with the force of a demonstration she is dead a servant was attending me to the door i requested to speak to the housekeeper i was introduced to mariana chabot she was struck with my appearance as i believe my daughters had been as if my features were those of some person with whom she was intimately acquainted she would probably have mistaken me for my own son but that i looked considerably too young i intreated her to pardon my curiosity but i assured her i had a particular reason to interest myself in the family of monsieur st leon and i therefore requested that she would have the goodness to inform me of their affairs as far as she could with propriety communicate them to a person who was not so happy as to be in the catalogue of their acquaintance i told her that i had just seen two of her ladies but that i had understood there had been three and i particularly desired some information as to the young lady who had not made her appearance in the parlour my presentiment was true the impression that smote me when i left the parlour was her funeral knell my beloved julia was dead she had been dead four years if it had not been for the agitation of my mind when i visited the tomb of my venerable parent i should have discovered her monument near that of her grandmother that would have been too overwhelming a mode of learning the painful intelligence i was glad at least to have escaped that in this and some subsequent conversations i held with this respectable matron i learned a variety of particulars respecting my daughters madame chabot expressed herself sorry that she had nothing pleasing to communicate her young ladies had been pursued by a train of misfortunes though heaven knew they had merited every happiness a few years after they had been settled at st leon julia had been addressed by a lover in every sense worthy of her he was rich noble of a gallant spirit of a cultivated understanding and a truly kind and affectionate heart their attachment had been long and tried habit and experience of each others virtues had caused it to take a deep root the father of the young man had destined him to marry the daughter of a duke and peer of the kingdom but finding his affections unalterably fixed he had at length yielded and sanctioned their mutual passion with his consent every thing was now prepared for the nuptials a day was fixed and the appointed time was fast approaching just at this juncture the father changed his mind and became more obstinate and inexorable than ever a report had begun to be circulated that monsieur st leon the father of the young ladies was still alive madame chabot expressed her fear that this report had originated in some indiscretion of bernardin who however had always proved himself a most zealous and faithful servant and who had since paid the debt of nature be that as it might the father of the lover of julia was found no longer accessible to expostulation or entreaty he was of an avaricious disposition and he regarded the fortune of the young lady which would otherwise have been considerable as entirely alienated and annihilated by this flaw in the title but what was more material it by no means accorded with his ideas of nobility and honour that the father in law of his only son should be a fugitive and a wanderer with whose residence no one was acquainted and of whom no one could tell whether he were living or dead the manner in which the ladies had entered into the repossession of their paternal estate when minutely investigated was thought to have something in it of an ambiguous and unpleasant nature it was well known that monsieur st leon had left the country in consequence of his having ruined himself by the vice of gaming surely said some it is a little mysterious how his children came after an interval of nine years to be able to repurchase all he ever possessed in short the more the old vicomte was reasoned with the more furious he grew at length he made use of the power which the government of france vests in the father of a family and shut up his son in one of the royal prisons this was a fatal blow both to the chevalier and his mistress disappointed in the object of his warmest affections maltreated and disgraced by the severity of a father his health sensibly declined nothing however could shake the inflexibility of the vicomte he would release his son upon no other terms than a renunciation of his love terms which the sense of dignity and honour in the young gentleman equally with his passion forbade him to accept to all representations of the necessity of granting liberty to his son if he would not make himself answerable for his death the vicomte sternly replied that he preferred his dying to the idea of his connecting himself with a family of dishonour it was not till a few weeks before he expired that the father had consented to his release from prison and had removed him to one of his castles in a remote province but the malady of the chevalier was found incurable the vital principles of the system were fatally deranged the lover died and the consequences of this unhappy affair had put a premature close to the existence of the unfortunate julia madame chabot added that the circumstance of this story having become a subject of public animadversion it had had a most unfavourable effect on the prospects of the surviving sisters they bore their situation with dignity but they could not but feel the unhappy coincidence which cut them off from the happiest condition of human life an honourable and well assorted settlement in marriage while madame chabot related to me the tragical history of julia i felt convulsed with passion and more than once burst into an agony of tears fatal legacy atrocious secrets of medicine and chemistry every day opened to my astonished and terrified sight a wider prospect of their wasteful effects a common degree of penetration might have shown me that secrets of this character cut off their possessor from the dearest ties of human existence and render him a solitary cold self centered individual his heart no longer able to pour itself into the bosom of a mistress or a friend his bosom no longer qualified to receive upon equal terms the overflowing of a kindred heart but no mere exercise of imagination nothing short of the actual experience through which i had passed could have adequately represented the mischiefs of a thousand various names that issued from this pandoras box this extract of a universal panacea i regarded myself as the murderer of these two lovers than whom i concluded from my personal observation of the one and all that i heard of the other two purer and more affectionate beings more singularly qualified to form each others happiness had never existed i felt as truly haunted with the ghosts of those i had murdered as nero or caligula might have been my wife my son my faithful negro and now in addition to these the tender julia and her unalterable admirer i possessed the gift of immortal life but i looked on myself as a monster that did not deserve to exist it is with difficulty that i shall be able to make the reader understand how much more severe the impression of this last catastrophe was made to me by the place and time in which i received the intelligence we are creatures of sensation our worst calamities derive as much of their pungency from the accessories by which they are accompanied as they do from their intrinsic evil if i had heard this story at any other period i am persuaded its effects would not have been half so painful the idea of my daughters was faded in my sensorium and whatever related to them though really felt and felt like a father would have been felt with a less overpowering interest but now i had journeyed from valladolid to the garonne to behold them i had surveyed the castle they inhabited i had viewed the garden which they arranged with their hands i had entered the parlour which they adorned with their presence all this controlled the operation of absence and of distance i felt at this moment as if i had been accustomed to see them every day and to regard them as inseparable from my existence i experienced as it were the united effect of familiarity and novelty i felt the melancholy fate of julia with all the keenness of an inmate and all the surprise of a long absent traveller the very metamorphosis i had undergone gave new poignancy to my distress madame chabot tortured me deliberately and at leisure without the slightest consciousness of what she was doing she believed she was pouring a tale of persons unknown into the ears of a native of the other hemisphere at the moment that she was calling up in arms the strongest and most excruciating feelings of a father for his child i on the other hand had the most violent struggle with myself while i endeavoured to suppress the appearances of an emotion which to the person who witnessed them must have been for ever unaccountable as it was and in spite of all my efforts madame chabot betrayed no little amazement at the agitation with which i listened to a story in which as she apprehended i could have no personal interest what i heard from madame chabot suggested to me a conduct which i resolved to adopt under the present circumstances in my next interview i told louisa that i would now account to her for emotions which at the time they occurred must have appeared somewhat extraordinary i owned that i had been acquainted with her father i said that i had first met with him in a journey in which i was then engaged through the province of mesopotamia that i had received from him though a stranger a singular obligation that a sincere friendship between us had been the result of this event that he died about two years since that i had attended him in his last moments that he had charged me with his dying recommendations and requests and that my present journey into france had principally been instigated by a desire to visit his children i then delivered into her hands various letters and papers which i had counterfeited chiefly with the intention of supplying my daughters with legal evidence of the decease of their father louisa listened to what i related with those marks of affection and sorrow which are inseparable from the habits of a well constituted mind the emotion she discovered led me farther than i first intended i was urged by an irresistible impulse to practise beyond what the occasion demanded upon the feelings of her virtuous mind i know not whether this is to be considered as a vain refinement and a criminal curiosity but i think every generous spirit will excuse me when it is recollected that this covert and imperfect proceeding was all that was left me to soothe the impatient cravings of a fathers heart from time to time i reminded her of particulars that it was scarcely possible any one but her father should know i conjured up past scenes i made all the revolutions of her youth pass successively in review before her i touched all the pulses of her soul sometimes she was fixed in mute astonishment at the exactness of my information and was ready to do me homage as some aerial genius who condescended to clothe himself in this earthly figure at other times astonishment was swallowed up in feeling her soul dissolved in tenderness and she appeared ready to faint into my arms it is scarcely possible to depict the pleasurable sensations i drew from these intercourses i know not whether they were entirely innocent but this i know that in me they produced a sentiment of innocence and a sentiment of paradise i felt sometimes as if i could have wasted ages in this sort of gratification as the executor of their father my daughters received me with every mark of respect but after having already protracted my visit to them for the space of many days i felt that i should be guilty of something alike hostile to their decorum and reputation if i did not speedily bring it to a termination i was a person unknown and almost without a name nor could it be proper for a young woman to continue to receive the visits of a person of her own age and a different sex upon the intimate and confidential footing upon which my visits were paid except in the case of him whom she intends to make her husband to considerations of this sort i was obliged to sacrifice the gratifications in which i had lately been indulging my principal concern at st leon from the time in which madame chabot had communicated to me the real nature of my daughters situation was to remove those disadvantages in which my destiny and my errors had involved them it would therefore have been the extreme of inconsistency in me while i was healing one mischief to prepare for them another it is not indeed probable that i should long have been contented for myself with this anomalous and neutral situation in which i more resembled a piece of furniture endowed with the faculty of noting the sensations of those around me than the member of any human society it was high time as i thought even in this point of view that i should put an end to the inglorious scene should appear in some real character and engage in some real undertaking influenced by these considerations i now quitted the residence of my daughters i had satisfied the longing curiosity of a father had seen their situation had witnessed their beauty their accomplishments and their virtues if i had been afflicted at hearing of the premature fate of my eldest daughter if i had been agonised by the reflection that i might justly regard myself as her murderer who was so fitted to suffer this anguish as myself the outcast of my species what right had i to expect to be happy in my own person or prosperous in any of my relations the guilty cause of all this mischief it was but suitable that it should be brought home to my own bosom that it should tear and distract my own brain add to this i was not without a hope that my journey would not be found useless to the survivors by furnishing to them the proper documents to certify the death of their father i flattered myself that i had cut them off more effectually than before from all connection with my unpropitious destiny and had placed them nearly upon a footing with the other noble and unmarried heiresses of their native country i have nothing further to relate in regard to these two amiable and excellent sisters from the time that i quitted st leon upon this occasion to the time in which i am now writing the opportunity of making further enquiries respecting them has not occurred to me if ever it does occur i have only this one wish to entertain which if granted will i am sure satisfy my fondest hopes may i find they have been as happy as they so well deserve to be the parting between me and my daughters was not an unaffecting one on my part whose bosom was fraught with a thousand tender feelings to which i could give no language and of which those whom they principally concerned had not the slightest suspicion it could not be unaffecting nor did louisa and her younger sister look with an indifferent eye upon the bearer of the last sentiments of their father the witness of his death the executor of his will there was something in the features of my countenance a peculiar sort of conformation a family resemblance to themselves which it is probable they did not advert to but which i am persuaded wrought within them to the full extent of the mysterious sympathies of our nature i pretended to have been the familiar confident of their father i told them of things at which they started and almost blushed to think that any one beyond the circuit of their dearest relations should have been privy in the hour of our separation they shed many tears and embraced me with a warmth that might have well become sisters to a brother yet shall i confess my weakness a weakness in which i do not apprehend myself to be singular it happens to few men to witness the manner in which the story of their own deaths is received if it did i believe we all of us have enough of vanity and personal feeling however sincere a grief might show itself in the demeanour of survivors to find it falling short of our appetites and demand this i know i was myself a party to this unreasonableness my daughters received the intelligence of my death with a decorum and sensibility which in the eyes of every impartial spectator would have reflected honour on their characters a sensibility beyond what could have been imagined in daughters who now had not seen their father for twelve years yet it was an unpleasing reflection to me thus to have occasion to gauge their love and to say this is the exact measure of their affection i remained in this part of the world long enough to see my children consoled and myself forgotten self importance of man upon how slight a basis do thy gigantic erections repose chapter xxxv from st leon i proceeded to the kingdom of hungary to complete this journey i must pass through near twenty degrees of longitude but that was a trivial consideration what i most desired was to gain a new situation and enter upon an untried scene i had determined in my next experiment upon the endowments of the stranger to make no half formed efforts and to suffer no mischiefs that drew their source from my own irresolution i determined as i have said to forestall all opposition by my firmness and to silence all objectors by the display of a more than princely magnificence i thought it therefore eligible to remove to a scene where no encounter with any one i had ever known might abash me and no relation of any adventure i had ever met should follow me the change of my figure it is true would render an encounter of this sort of little moment to my liberty or my reputation but i was a new man and i was desirous to engross and to feel the benefits that attend upon novelty there was another motive however secretly working at my heart of a grander and more exalted cast that made me prefer hungary to all the countries of the earth hungary had been now for upwards of a century the great frontier of the christian world the theatre upon which the followers of mahomet contended against the followers of jesus for destruction and for empire my mind had from time to time brooded over this picture in the solitude and forlornness of my dungeon i ruminated on all the calamities of hungary from the battle of warna in to the battle of mohacz in in both of which this generous nation had unsuccessfully achieved prodigies of valour and even by their defeats had protracted the date of their own independence and co operated for the defence of the population and arts of europe against a barbarous and blood delighting foe my thoughts dwelt with rapturous admiration upon the exploits of the heroic huniades and his greater son in the course of my many coloured experience i had seen something of war and was not totally unacquainted with its never failing consequences meditating as i had done in the dungeons of the inquisition if ever i recovered my personal liberty and my freedom of action a journey into hungary my imagination had grown familiar with captured towns and smoking villages with the gallant soldier stretched lifeless on the plain and the defenceless mother and her offspring brutally insulted and massacred with fields laid waste and a people lifting up their hands for bread determined as i was to open at once all the stores of my wealth i thought i could not find a nobler scene for its display i resolved to pour the entire stream of my riches like a mighty river to fertilise these wasted plains and revive their fainting inhabitants thus proceeding should i not have a right to expect to find myself guarded by the faithful love of a people who would be indebted to my beneficence for every breath they drew this was the proper scene in which for the possessor of the philosophers stone to take up his abode he who could feel his ambition satisfied in a more straitened field would by so doing prove himself unworthy of the mighty blessing nothing occurred to me in my journey of importance enough to obtain a place in this history when i arrived i found the condition of the inhabitants even more wretched than the lawlessness of my imagination had represented it in the battle of mohacz the last of the line of their native sovereigns together with the flower of his nobility had fallen a victim to the merciless plague of war what survived of eminent persons in the state assembled soon after in national diet and elected as they had been accustomed to do one of the most illustrious among themselves to preside over the councils and to conduct the battles of their country but the princes of the house of austria ever on the watch for the aggrandisement of their family seized the opportunity of their disastrous situation to enslave the hungarians to their sceptre charles the fifth caused his brother ferdinand whose consort was only sister to the deceased monarch to advance his claim to the vacant throne and to enter the country with an imperial army the native and elected sovereign found himself in the weakened condition of his realm unable to resist the austrian arms and was finally driven to the desperate expedient of calling in the turk to his assistance from this time for now upwards of thirty years the kingdom had been a prey to two foreign invaders alternately taking and retaking her most considerable towns and distributing with the strictest impartiality the miseries of war to her devoted inhabitants solyman the magnificent the present ottoman emperor in no long time threw off the mask and like his rival ferdinand professed to fight only for the enlargement of his own dominions while the claims the liberties the constitution and the prosperity of hungary were alike trodden under foot in the protracted and sanguinary struggle at the period at which i entered this unfortunate realm the turk was in possession of buda gran temeswar and many of the most considerable cities and ferdinand who had now succeeded charles in the imperial dignity had been obliged to withdraw the seat of the national government from the first of these towns the ancient metropolis to the comparatively insignificant city of presburg the war between the two parties had more than once been interrupted not indeed by the more stable accommodations of a treaty of peace but by a truce variously concluded for the terms of six or of eight years short as was the period assigned to the suspension of arms it was never suffered to reach its natural termination but after the interval of one or two summers hostilities did not fail to break out again with aggravated symptoms of resentment and animosity the warfare that was now carried on had more in it of passion than vigour it was of little moment to the interest of either of the princes under whose banners it was conducted but it was not on that account the less but rather the more vexatious and distressing to the hungarian people it obeyed no rule it operated in every direction no place no province no town neither the church nor the palace neither the cottage nor the castle could assure safety to those who sought its protection a flying party which was to day in the west would almost the next day make its appearance in the eastern extremity of the kingdom arts were neglected civilisation was destroyed the stern and haughty baron free from restraint would sally from his castle sometimes in pursuit of plunder sometimes of private resentment and revenge the starving peasantry gladly enlisted in the band of a ferocious partisan for bread the gangs of robbers which the vigilant policy of better times had almost annihilated rose again in importance and swelled into regiments and while they assumed at pleasure the denomination of adherents to ferdinand or to solyman perpetrated every species of excess with impunity when a reflecting spectator surveys a country in a condition like this he is tempted to wonder that the inhabitants still retain the courage to bestow on their fields any sort of cultivation and that the licensed or the unlicensed robber still finds something over which to extend the fangs of his rapacity i had not long passed the gates of vienna before i began to observe the symptoms of that which i had come from the pyrenees and the garonne to visit the farther i advanced the more melancholy was the scene i beheld the country in some places entirely deserted villages laid in ashes cities reduced to the dimensions and insignificance of villages fields fertilised or made rank with the manure of human blood the roads broken up the erections of human ingenuity almost obliterated mills thrown down rivers choked up and rendered stagnant a few solitary plots of cultivation scattered amidst the mighty waste the inhabitants i saw appeared terrified sickly dejected and despairing there was scarcely one who earlier or later had not lost a father or a brother whose wife had not been made the victim of brutal lust or who had not seen his children butchered before his face persons of the more opulent classes could not travel the country in safety without being armed and associated in companies and caravans i was myself obliged to obtain the protection of parties of soldiers who from time to time happened to be marching in the route i pursued the savage neglect into which every thing was declining produced in repeated instances a contagious air and pestilential diseases while dearth and famine unrelentingly haunted the steps of those whom the sword and the pestilence had spared such is war such are the evils nations willingly plunge into or are compelled to endure to pamper the senseless luxury or pride of a ferdinand and a solyman i proceeded as i had originally determined to do to buda the metropolis of the kingdom it was in the hands of the turk it was of little importance to me whether the monarch of the soil were a mahometan or a christian my mind was engrossed by considerations of a very different magnitude i came to relieve and assist to the utmost of my power the inhabitants of the country in the extremity of their distress i had not proceeded thus far without bestowing a certain strictness of reflection on the subject i easily saw that if i would confer a substantial benefit on this unfortunate nation i had scarcely any other means for the purpose than that of reviving among them a spirit of industry i was aware that in the strictness of the term money was not wealth that it could be neither eaten nor drunk that it would not of itself either clothe the naked or shelter the houseless and that it was unable but by a circuitous operation to increase the quantity of provisions or commodities that the country afforded it was my business therefore not to proceed idly in the distribution of gold but to meditate seriously my plan of operations i fixed myself in a spacious and beautiful mansion in the capital this in the present distressed and depopulated condition of hungary it was not difficult to procure the house i selected had for centuries been the principal residence of the illustrious family of ragotski but the present representative of that family after having seen his sons one after another killed in the battles of his country and his estates ruined by military depredation had found himself compelled to fly in his old age and had taken refuge with a distant branch of the same house in the great duchy of lithuania it was not necessary for me to proceed to any great extent in the first instance in the manufacture of my wealth i had every facility for adding to my store from time to time as circumstances should demand i determined to open my operations with the article of building there was sufficient need of it one half of the houses through most of the districts of lower or western hungary in particular were ruined and untenantable i did not begin with erecting palaces i felt that the first claimants in the present emergency were the peasant and the cultivator i was more desirous that the rustic than the prince should be well lodged and accommodated provided with the means of rest after fatigue and secured against the invasion of ungenial seasons my reasons for beginning with building were these it was my purpose to stimulate and revive the industry of the nation i was desirous of doing this with the least practicable violence upon the inclinations and freedom of the inhabitants had i required of those to whom i addressed myself that they should fertilise the earth the seeds with which it should be impregnated might be wanting i should have a nice balance to adjust between what was necessary for immediate subsistence and what might be applied as the basis of future a point better left to its spontaneous level i might be impeded and controlled by a thousand circumstances and at every step but the materials of building are to be found in every country no seasons can impair no malignity of man can annihilate them wherever there are quarries there is stone wherever there is clay there are the means of manufacturing bricks i was anxious to leave the rest of the great process of human accommodation to its course while i employed labourers and paid them their wages there would be in the mildest and most salutary mode a continual influx of money into the market the increase of the precious metals would give new alacrity to the operations of traffic the buyers would come forward with double confidence the venders would be eager to meet the activity and spirit of the demand ardour and hope would revisit the human mind and the industry i created and the accommodations of one kind at least to which i gave birth would inoculate the other departments of the community with a similar industry i came into hungary in the spring of the season was favourable to seeding and cultivation i seemed to enter on my undertaking with the happiest auspices some time however must necessarily elapse between the period of impregnating the soil and that of the future harvest though i laid it down therefore as a law to myself to commit the least practicable violence upon the genuine action of human society in pursuit of the means of subsistence i thought proper in a certain degree to engage in the importation of corn from poland silesia and other neighbouring countries this seemed an eligible measure if it were only that i might show others the way and excite them by my example i procured agents i extended my concerns in various directions over the navigable rivers i formed magazines it would have been contrary to the genius of my undertaking either to make a gratuitous distribution of what i purchased or to sell it at such low prices as to drive other speculators whose spirit of enterprise might happily co operate with mine out of the market however indifferent i might feel to the receipt of pecuniary compensation it was necessary that in the concerns of barter and trade i should assume the exterior of a merchant nor did i wholly confine my exertions within the occupations of an architect and a corn dealer these or rather the former of the two i regarded as my true and genuine province but i did not so far enslave myself to my own maxims as to negative in all instances the direct demands of want i was not anxious to convert a nation or an army of men into my personal adherents and retainers i was rather desirous to avoid this as a dangerous source of obloquy i did not therefore always decline by pretended loans to assist other men to employ labourers as well as myself to act upon their own designs and prosecute their own fortune the cries of the poor man the widow and the orphan were sometimes too importunate and too well justified by their unquestionable necessities to allow me to withhold from them my alms in a few instances i conveyed my supplies anonymously to persons whose dignity of birth or whose proud independence would have been too grievously wounded if they had known their benefactor i was cautious and apprehensive as to the direct dispensing of money but not entirely bent against it i regarded it as a precarious but in some cases a necessary interference the impulse which by these various measures i was fortunate enough to generate seemed to have the effect so far at least as the sphere of my activity extended to revive the almost expiring life of the country dejection and hopeless indolence when i commenced my operations were written in every face the miserable inhabitants crawled along the roads or the street their hands idly relaxed by their side and their slow and painful steps scarcely supporting their lifeless trunk when my plan became known and i had already in a few instances reduced my maxims into practice it was as if the mellow and spirit stirring blast of a trumpet had wakened their sleeping souls their eyes lightened with intelligence the tear of anguish was wiped from their faded cheeks the smile of hope slowly expelled and faintly succeeded to the bitter expression of despair busy and active thoughts gave new motion to their limbs and quickness to their steps the labourer was seen hastening from place to place the sound of the hammer the saw and the various tools of the workman was to be heard from every side the conduct i pursued necessarily fixed upon me a considerable portion of public attention i was a foreigner destitute of connections and having no previous acquaintance with any individual in the country i was in appearance a mere boy a young man in all the flower and bloom of adolescence and who must be supposed to have just entered into possession of his patrimony these things tended to increase the public wonder and to render the mystery of my proceedings more perplexing and obscure in the age of genial warmth and melting softness i did not appear accessible to those passions which haunt the days and too often undermine the virtues of youth youth is the season of benevolence but benevolence is rarely as seemed to be my case the only fruit that youth is found to produce there was a maturity and a justness of adaptation in my plans not less foreign from what those who surrounded me would have expected me to display the apparent disinterestedness and modesty of my proceedings were not lost upon the spectators the consequence of all this was that the sieur de chatillon such was the name i at this time assumed was regarded as a phenomenon which could not be too much admired or too loudly extolled wherever i appeared the people followed me with their gratitude and blessings ballads were written in my praise the very children were taught with their infant tongues to lisp the virtues of the saviour of hungary my doors were besieged my steps were watched i could move no where without public observation i was importuned with petitions without end yet if any petitioner showed himself presumptuous and intrusive the whole multitude of bystanders was ready to repress his indiscretion and teach him the respect that was due to their generous benefactor who never refused any thing but what it would be improper and injurious to grant such was the treatment i experienced in buda and the neighbouring districts whether i looked within or without i was equally presented with incitements to self approbation i sent forth labour accompanied with her best and loveliest companions plenty and health congratulation and contentment to scatter blessings through the land i felt that i was prompted to this conduct by none of the motives of vulgar ambition i desired neither lordships nor estates neither elevation of rank nor extension of prerogative sufficient to myself if i effected the happiness of the people and they confessed me their benefactor my every passion would then be gratified the utmost boundary of my personal wishes proceeded no farther than this that i might be honoured and loved what i desired i obtained the youth i had procured to myself through the medium of the opus magnum was like what we are told of the youth of job when i went out through the gate of the city the young men saw me and hid themselves and the aged arose and stood up the nobles refrained from talking and the princes laid their hands upon their mouths when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to my actions here it may be thought i had ascended to that sphere which it was fit the possessor of the philosophers stone should fill and reaped the rewards to which a man thus endowed ought to be forward to entitle himself nor will i affirm that i was insensible to the gratifications of my present situation though i sought to escape from the applause that pursued me yet there is something in the nature of the human mind that makes it impossible for us to hear it without complacence it was not however a boisterous and obtrusive acclamation that satisfied me a certain inwrought modesty of nature made me listen to noisy commendations with a sentiment of shame they seemed to be more than any thing i had done could deserve or they seemed to be in a tone from which the delicacy of a virtuous mind shrinks back displeased they were so obstreperous as to take from me the power of hearing the sweeter verdict of my own conscience no it was the unbidden tear that glistened in the eye of my beneficiaries the tongue that faltered beneath the essays of gratitude the overwhelmed heart that had no power to express itself the hand of the parent that was stretched out to his children and dumbly said these these shall thank you it was these things that i felt within as the balsam of my life and the ambrosia of heaven chapter xxxvi yet thus surrounded and regaled with this animated praise i was not content i wanted a friend i was alone amidst the innumerable multitudes of those i had blessed i knew no cordiality i could repose no confidence i could find no equal i was like a god who dispenses his bounties profusely through twenty climates but who at the same time sits separate elevated and alone in the highest heaven the reader may if he pleases despise me for the confession but i felt that i was not formed for the happiness of a god i was not however long sufficiently at leisure thus to refine upon the deficiencies of my situation i had engaged in a task of extreme delicacy in which the smallest failure would draw along with it the most serious consequences mine was not an undertaking that had for its object to supply those around me with luxuries or to augment the stock of their cheerful relaxations and amusements the very existence of my beneficiaries depended on its success i had put myself in a considerable degree with whatever diffidence and caution in the room of the course of nature and had taken the administration of the common benefits of human society into my hands the populace are ever ready to construe this delegation in the strictest sense unqualified to trace the wheels and combinations of the great machine if prosperity is their lot they willingly ascribe it to their protectors and governors and if they are unfortunate it is against them that the storm of their resentment is directed the moment they are thus irritated their impatience is too great to admit of correctives and remedies in the fury of their disappointment they disturb every thing and render that irreparable and fatal which was at first only doubtful and unpromising my proceedings as i have already said bore in the commencement the most benignant face and seemed a revival of this despairing and unfortunate nation little less than miraculous the regular labours in which the inhabitants became engaged restored a healthful tone to their minds the payments they duly received seemed to discharge them from all anxious solicitude and as by my own efforts and the enterprises of others the market was supplied with provisions they had no difficulty in exchanging these payments for the necessaries of life the supply of the market at first was easy the universal dejection that preceded though it had not prevented all exertions for that purpose had rendered those exertions too feeble for extensive success the strenuous efforts that were now made were productive of a copious supply but they rendered each importation more difficult than the importation before the demand continued the same the relief was every day more diminutive and precarious the harvest was however advancing with the happiest auspices and though some time must yet be consumed in expectation it was probable frugality and fortitude might enable the inhabitants to hold out till the season of plenty should arrive but fortitude is not the virtue of a populace the higher had been their hopes and the more unexpected their deliverance with so much the more blank and melancholy a countenance they beheld this unexpected delay and retrogression not understanding the powers by which i acted they blindly ascribed to me the faculty of doing whatever i pleased as long as every thing went on prosperously they were grateful the moment a reverse occurred they were inclined to murmur they made no allowance for the limited capacities of a human creature they imputed whatever was unpleasing to indifference or ill will the price of commodities after having for a while become moderate now rapidly rose again this was partly the consequence of the increased quantity of the precious metals by means of which any assignable sum bore a less proportion to the provisions of the market than it had done before bread was at a very high price and it occasionally happened to buyers who did not come early enough that there was no bread to be purchased the doors of the houses where it was sold were besieged the industrious poor appeared before them with the first faint dawn of the mornings light here they consumed hours of painful expectation in grievous addition to the hours of their customary fatigue the whole was a scene of anguish and calamity the passions of those who composed it mingled with the distress and rendered it too heavy to be borne anticipating famine they felt the mischiefs of it before it arrived never was the demand so urgent it seemed as if the capacity of mens appetites was enlarged and the cravings of hunger became more insatiable in proportion to the smallness of the supply to people thus circumstanced it would have been vain to recommend frugality and moderation they devoured the food with their eyes while it was yet beyond the reach of their hands and the lesson you read them would have sounded in their ears as if you had bid them die to day to escape the danger of dying to morrow the crowds which the necessity of purchasing bread brought together at certain hours when assembled naturally entered into the discussion of their present discontents they were not satisfied with the discourse and jostling of the morning the habits produced by these noisy assemblies had a secret charm with them and drew them together at seasons of less urgent demand they patroled the streets they were loud in the expressions of their dissatisfaction with the inconsequence incident to the lower orders of mankind they threatened to destroy the mills the markets the places of sale the means and materials by which their wants were to be supplied in the midst of these scenes of tumult and confusion it is not to be imagined that i escaped uncensured far otherwise in proportion to the gratitude and adoration with which they had lately regarded me were their detestation and abhorrence now my interference was spoken of with contempt and execration for what purpose had i a foreigner come into their country and intruded myself into their affairs why had i impiously taken them out of the hands of their heavenly father whose care was so constant and whose relief so certain it was on my part a despicable vanity and presumption which the justice of providence could not fail to avenge and they must now suffer the punishment of my blasphemy but they did not stop here there was no horrible calumny which they did not invent or give credit to against me they imputed to me the basest personal motives for what i had done under the hypocritical pretence they cried of being their benefactor and saviour i was using them only for my private ends i had become a purchaser and vender of corn for the single purpose of increasing my fortune the present scarcity they were well assured was artificial and of my own contriving i had magazines in different stations on the borders which when the price was risen to the standard of my avarice and when half the people had fallen victims to my inhumanity i purposed to dispose of to an immense profit such were the aspersions to which my character became generally exposed by the populace who now experienced the unsatisfied cravings of hunger and in whom my proceedings had excited hope only to be followed by a more cruel disappointment they were greedily credited many who knew their falsehood were yet zealous to propagate them short as had been my residence in hungary i had made many enemies it is to be feared that no man can be assiduous and indefatigable in the service of others without incurring that consequence i employed a great number of workmen every one whom for whatever reason i refused to employ every one who being unqualified for the service i required looked with an envious eye on the better fortune of his neighbour was well disposed to be my enemy persons of no contemptible account in the community had been excited by expectations of profit to engage in the importation of corn these persons viewed my efforts in the same department with a suspicious eye and regarded a man who however cautious in his proceedings was not regulated by the same motive as a most pernicious rival my sudden elevation and importance in the country were viewed with not more astonishment than aversion by those whose importance i obscured they could not hear with patience of an upstart a boy a stranger one universally unknown elbowing out the influence of all that was most illustrious and venerable in the community and robbing them daily of their adherents and retainers all these persons left no effort untried to defame my character the impulse once given the turbulent disposition of the populace became every day more formidable it is much easier to disseminate a temper of this sort than to quell it my opulent foes might take alarm at its excesses and desire to undo what they had done but it was beyond their power every day i feared lest from threats and invectives the populace should proceed to violence every night i thought i had reason to congratulate myself that the day had passed without waste and spoil committed by them on the means of their subsistence or was not marked with the destruction of their champion and benefactor in some places a sort of petty sedition broke out among the labourers i employed in the morning they refused to work why should a man work they muttered when after all he may starve with the wages of his labour in his possession at night they became impatient and furious and demanded from my superintendents and storehouse men the food which in the morning they had refused to earn and were therefore now unable to purchase i had already had some experience in the nature of popular tumults i had now no marchese filosanto at hand to persuade me of their inefficacy and if i had i should no longer have lent an ear to his serene and unsuspicious generosity i felt the reality of the danger i saw the storm as it blackened in my horizon and was deeply convinced what it would be if it burst upon my head it may be imagined with what feelings i viewed my whole design on the point to be subverted by the unruliness of those for whose benefit it had been planned it is true i had now no darling relations to be involved in my fate no incomparable wife no daughters illustrious in innocence and beauty yet my feelings were scarcely less pungent than they had been at the period of my catastrophe at pisa i had blamed myself in review that in my experiments at constance at dresden at pisa and at madrid i had not commenced upon a sufficiently ample scale but had suffered myself to be frustrated by the ingloriousness of my precautions that had not been my error in the present instance yet my success now promised to be scarcely more flattering than upon former occasions i had looked for happiness as the result of the benevolence and philanthropy i was exerting i found only anxiety and a well grounded fear even for my personal safety let no man build on the expected gratitude of those he spends his strength to serve let him be beneficent if he will but let him not depend for his happiness on the conviction of his rectitude and virtue that is to be impressed on the minds of others there is a principle in the human breast that easily induces them to regard every thing that can be done for them as no more than their due and speedily discharges them from the oppressive consciousness of obligation there is a levity in the generality of men that entails on them a continual oblivion of past benefits and makes one recent disappointment of more importance in their eyes than an eternity of kindnesses and condescension i shall have other instances of ingratitude to display in what yet remains to be related of my story my nights were restless my thoughts were in arms what was it that it became me to do in the present emergency sometimes in the bitterness of my heart hating myself hating the endowments of the stranger hating a race of beings who denied all credit to the most unheard of exertions for their advantage i determined to withdraw unobserved from my attendants and clients and bid adieu to hungary for ever but whither was i to fly what was i to do next what experiment could i make of the purposes to which to apply the philosophers stone that i had not already made these questions to none of which i could give a satisfactory answer checked the career of my passion and gave pause to my thoughts whatever i did i was determined to do nothing rashly nor to quit a great experiment without its having been fully tried it was no light concern no trivial childs play in which i had embarked i had taken the welfare perhaps the existence of a great and heroic nation under my protection in this glorious vocation it did not become me to be lightly discouraged what if those i served and saved did not show themselves sufficiently sensible to the exertions i made for them i ought to purify my bosom on an occasion like this from base and ignoble motives and to deem myself sufficiently recompensed by my conscious virtue what if the service in which i had engaged now appeared to be a service of hazard and peril is there any great undertaking that can be separated from this condition if hastily from cowardice from pique or from any other motive i deserted the business on which i had entered what was to become of my mistaken indeed but in that case most unfortunate clients the greater was the crisis to which they were exposed the more were unremitted vigilance and uncommon powers necessary to guide them amidst its rocks and its quicksands i saw thousands of men who for several weeks had fed as it were from the stores of my bounty by a propensity inseparable from the human heart i became attached to the work of my meditations and the labour of my thoughts all their fickleness their injustice even the atrocious calumnies they admitted and propagated against me could not wean my attachment from beings a great portion of whom but for my interference would i believed long ere this have expired of hunger in the peculiar and urgent circumstances in which i found myself no expedient was so obvious as that of calling in the interference of the government under which i lived it was necessary that the resources of national subsistence should be defended from the wanton spoil of those who when they were annihilated must inevitably perish it was necessary that the benefactor of hungary who i flattered myself was still able to watch effectively for her advantage should be protected from her misguided resentment the alternative was singularly painful to my feelings the pride with which my unparalleled endowments inspired me was deeply wounded when i was compelled to confess that i was not alone equal to the task i had undertaken and that i must submit to call in a foreign auxiliary i augured little favourable from the interference of government which if i implored i could scarcely expect to guide which was not likely to submit to my principle of rendering its interference the mildest and smallest that the nature of the case would admit but puffed up with presumption and intoxicated with authority would probably leave no concern of the public welfare uninvaded least of all could i anticipate much of good from a turkish government but what could i do i could discover no other expedient influenced by the views i have recited i had hitherto kept myself as far from the observation of the political directors of the state as i could but my cautiousness and reserve were now at an end with my eyes open i exposed myself to all the evils that might attend on my proceeding i determined to apply to the bashaw of the province previously to my taking this step i had the precaution to enquire his character he was the genuine offspring of the turkish system of government his name was muzaffer bey he was originally a circassian slave then a janissary and rising by insensible gradation had at length been appointed bashaw of buda which as being the immediate frontier between austria and the porte was at this time the most arduous situation in the gift of the sultan he was esteemed a good soldier he had been early distinguished by his dexterity in military exercises he had since seen much service and in every situation in which he was placed had earned commendation and honour he was abstemious and hardy for himself he neither pampered his appetites nor shrunk from severity and he had as little indulgence for those under his command as for his own person yet he was indebted for his present eminence more to the arts of the courtier than to his merits in the field his chief care had ever been to recommend himself to those above him and to obtain the good will of his equals for the opinion of his inferiors he gave himself little concern with considerable ability he laboured under no check from either principle or ingenuous pride and therefore was extremely successful in his attacks on the inclination of those he sought the habits of his mind had modified the lines of his countenance and the tones of his voice except to his dependants and the poor he almost always spoke with a smile upon his face and his enunciation was silver tongued oily copious and insinuating if he ever adopted a different manner the variation was only in the means not the end and when he seemed to travel by an opposite road the goal at which he aimed was the same he never consulted any oracle but that of his apparent interest if he had any insolence in his nature he regarded his slaves and those under his military command as affording a sufficient sphere for its exercise he had no affections to disturb him from his bent he had no passions but the self complacency of superior cunning and the sordid love of pelf this account of the man with whom i had to deal was far from encouraging but i had no alternative i sent to signify my desire to confer with him or to speak more accurately to ask in the eastern manner when it would be agreeable to him to receive a present of which i requested his acceptance he appointed the morning of the following day i prepared a gift such as might tend to conciliate his favour without marking in the donor the possession of immoderate wealth it consisted of silks and muslins with a small piece of plate of exquisite workmanship my present was borne by two of my servants we were ushered to the bashaw in his private apartment there were two or three persons in attendance upon him they examined my present together and without condescending to express much approbation i could nevertheless discern that the bashaw was pleased with it this ceremony concluded muzaffer ordered what i had brought to be taken into a different apartment and every other person withdrawing we were left alone while the bashaw was examining my gift i took the opportunity of considering his person he appeared to be about sixty years of age his complexion dark and muddy his features coarse and distorted his mustachoes remarkably large his person though bony and muscular considerably below the middle size and his figure ungainly and ungraceful i felt surprised that such a man should ever have been an excellent soldier or have risen from a low rank to one of the first situations of the empire to look at him he seemed better formed for the vice of a comedy than the ruler of a nation he raised his eyes towards me askance as he sat leaning on his elbow and said you call yourself the sieur de chatillon and your age is two and twenty i am glad you are come to me i intended to have sent for you and you have saved me the trouble i made many apologies for my intrusion but added that i had a petition to prefer and i hoped he would favour me with a hearing not at all not at all do not call it an intrusion it is necessary i should be acquainted with you he proceeded you have undertaken to confer great benefits on the subjects of the grand signior my master to rescue them from famine young rich a stranger unknown to my master unknown to his subjects i understand that you have spared no labour or expense to bring about their welfare this is really a very extraordinary case your merit is unprecedented i do not feel myself competent to reward it i answered that i laid no claim to uncommon merit that every temper had its particular gratifications and that i found as real a luxury in the proceedings he had remarked as other men did in the excesses of the table or the promiscuous enjoyments of the harem it is out of my power continued he to remunerate you as you deserve i must send you to constantinople i perceived that this was the first essay of his artifice i informed him which i have no doubt he knew well enough before that i had no desire to go to constantinople i wished to remain where i was and to finish what i had begun what you have not done then suddenly and with an abrupt voice exclaimed the bashaw by mahomet a man of a reasonable appetite in your place might be satisfied have not you filled the streets with riots and the country with rebellion do not the populace assemble in crowds insulting every one they meet and talking of nothing but fire and devastation the bowstring and the cimeter be so good my dear sir as to inform me what further you may have in view reverend bashaw cried i with submission yet with firmness i have none of these things in view but a moment ago you did justice to my intentions they are those of beneficence and beneficence only i know nothing about that i have nothing to do with honest mens blunders i look to the effects they produce these effects most mighty sir are temporary they are the clouds that will often obscure for an instant the brightest sunshine condescend to lend me your generous assistance and all will be well do not tell me of clouds and sunshine this is to my thinking not an april shower but an earthquake and a hurricane if we are all to be swallowed up or whirled into the air it is no consolation to me that the day after we are gone every thing shall be as fair and serene as paradise itself remember sir that when i came into hungary i found its inhabitants in the most desperate condition miserable wasted and starving have i not already suspended this evil for months yes i do remember you are one of those busy bodies who never see an evil without imagining they are the persons to correct it intruding into every thing and subverting every thing the superintendence of the public welfare is a mystery to which none are competent but those whom mahomet has raised to the situation of statesmen your interference is blasphemy against the spirit of our religion and deserves to be encountered with the most exemplary punishment good god then is it in this country a crime to feed the hungry to clothe the naked and shelter the houseless sieur de chatillon retorted the bashaw you appear to be unacquainted with the maxims of turkish policy the wisest and most beneficent in the world if none of the disturbances had happened at which i have so much reason to be alarmed still in relieving the people in the manner you have done you have incurred the guilt of high treason against the sultan know sir that through the whole extent of his dominions there is but one proprietor and that is our illustrious monarch you say that you wish to be the benefactor of his subjects and the judge of your own proceedings such sentiments are direct rebellion against the glorious constitution of ottoman the sovereign of constantinople will have no benefactor in the countries he presides over but himself like the invisible ruler of the universe he acts by second causes he allows his ministers to be the instruments of his beneficence but all must be ascribed to him must flow from his will and be placed under his control you who have formed a plan of public benefit without consulting him and have presumed like a luminary of the world to move in an orbit of your own have in strictness of construction forfeited your life to his justice and i consult rather the clemency of his nature than the maxims of his policy if i suffer you to go from this palace with your head upon your shoulders without permitting myself to be too much moved by the imperious language addressed to me i complained to the bashaw of the rigorous and arbitrary character of what he stated to be the maxims of the turkish government i solemnly protested that i had no private or personal object in view the effect of my operations would be to give new strength and energy to his masters dominions by diffusing happiness among his subjects by reviving industry and scattering plenty prosperity and ease all disaffection would be rooted out and the people who are never minute in scanning the cause of their enjoyments would bless the sceptre under which they were made to participate such manifold benefits if the policy of the divan led them in any degree to interfere they ought rather to crown my measures with their applause than wantonly to throw obstacles in the way of what i purposed i asked however no reward i demanded no favour for myself all i desired was that the sultan would assist me in securing to his people those benefits the dissemination of which i had so auspiciously begun the bashaw without taking any direct notice of this expostulation answered that i was not aware of the maxims of his government to which in consideration of my seeming generosity and rectitude he was willing to give the mildest interpretation it is however continued he to the last degree idle in you to imagine that you can be permitted to go on unobserved and that the sultan and his representatives are to take no account of your proceeding the great instrument for ruling mankind is by their passions and their opinions the man from whom they believe they have the most to fear and the most to hope will always be their master whatever be your secret or your professed designs you go on from day to day making yourself partisans and enlisting the subjects of the sultan among your personal retainers what security has he for your submission and loyalty how shall he know that when you have acquired the advantages of a powerful leader you will not go over to the enemy or in the present distracted condition of the province even have the audacity to set up for yourself if therefore by an unexampled clemency of construction i decline to reduce you into the passive machine of my masters will it is at least incumbent on me that i should take account of your powers and possess myself of the schedule of your property by this means only can i watch your progress and take care that you do not suddenly become too powerful for a subject are you prepared to satisfy me on this head on this question i hesitated for a moment i had not exactly anticipated the enquiry at length i requested the delay of a few days and then i promised that all his demands should be satisfied the bashaw resumed sieur de chatillon i remark your hesitation and i draw from it no favourable augury these indirect and involuntary indications are more worthy of my attention than all the studied and elaborate information you shall think proper to give me sir you are a man of darkness and every thing that relates to you is enveloped in mystery you come hither with no apparent motive you have no connections of blood in hungary you have no acquaintance with any eminent person of the hungarian nation i have had my spies on you though i have not hitherto thought proper to summon you to my presence you have purchased no property in the province i cannot learn that you have any correspondences or resources from abroad i have been at the pains to procure an account of your expenditure during the three months you have resided among us much of that expenditure has been obscure clandestine and indirect but i believe you will find my estimate which you are at liberty to inspect and remark upon tolerably correct your disbursements for three months exceed the amount of two years income of the richest subject that even the credulous monarchs of christendom suffer within their dominions what am i to think of this how can i be sufficiently vigilant respecting a man whose expenditure is immense and whose wealth can neither be traced to its source nor ascertained in its amount i was not slow in conjecturing the result which the bashaw proposed to himself from our present conference i was confirmed in my conjecture by the circumstance of his choosing that the discussion between us should be apart from all witnesses he regarded me as a boy and had therefore practised upon me all those arts which might most effectually excite in me fear and alarm he found however that under the external indications of youth and inexperience i possessed the wariness that added years most powerfully inculcate and the self possession of a mind thoroughly awake to its situation and its resources this must have been to the minister before whom i stood a memorable phenomenon but curiosity is not a turkish passion and the single object of the bashaw in the present instance was to make the mysteriousness of my circumstances a pretext for extorting money i submitted with as little seeming reluctance as possible to the necessity of the case i requested the good offices of muzaffer to protect my benefactions and begged permission to make him the compliment of a handsome sum of money by way of convincing him that i was worthy of his friendship this business was easily adjusted between us i found him perfectly skilled in the duties of a public office and by no means under the dominion of visionary scruples he told me he was now convinced that i was a well meaning man and a good subject he said that nothing could tend more effectually to demonstrate my innocence than my showing that i understood the duties and concerns of a minister of state and that for his own part he was never so happy as when he was thus able to reconcile his private interests with the good and faithful service of his master there was nothing that demanded a more unremitted vigilance or a more skilful management than such a situation as his and it would be most unreasonable either in the sovereign that appointed him or the subjects over whom he was placed to expect him to be indifferent to the emoluments and perquisites of his function he complimented me warmly upon the disinterestedness and liberality of my exertions he thought himself particularly fortunate in having so public spirited an individual within the circuit of his jurisdiction in fine he hoped he should be honoured with my personal acquaintance and assured me that nothing could make him more happy than the frequent repetition of my visits we now perfectly understood one another and it was apparent that i had to do with a man who for what he deemed an adequate consideration would willingly lend me the authority and countenance of his office and suffer me to guide him in any of the functions i might conceive necessary for the execution of my projects guards were agreed to be placed upon the magazines where corn was still contained and from place to place on the banks of the rivers where the depredations of a misguided populace were most to be apprehended finding the bashaw so perfectly willing to comply with my requisitions i further obtained from him the direction of several squadrons of cavalry for the protection of the crops which from the consequences of my interference now began on all sides to variegate the scene this was a most important service when the corn was first committed to the earth it was out of the reach of military devastation but as time glided silently on the case became materially altered the enemy might from forecast desire to reap the harvest of what he had not sown or from malice to destroy that without which the turk would perhaps be unable to retain his newly acquired territory this had in reality been the principal cause before my arrival in hungary of the very general neglect into which agriculture had fallen muzaffer than whom no person could now be more polite and condescending allowed me to determine the number and nature of the troops i required and added that though he could not openly put them under my direction the slightest intimation i might think proper to convey to him should at any time decide their march and regulate their quarters chapter xxxvii in my conference with the bashaw i may seem to have secured more than one point of material importance yet it was difficult for any man to be in a state less consolatory or more full of danger and menace than i was at this moment by my vigilance and the power which thus i had acquired i prevented indeed the inhabitants from wantonly destroying the means of their own subsistence but the more i was their benefactor the more i appeared to become odious to their thoughts my negotiation with the bashaw whatever other benefit might accrue from it did not tend to increase the resources of the country i was obliged to witness many scenes of wretchedness he that would assist mankind in their adversity must harden his heart to be the spectator of the distress that he can and that he cannot relieve but whatever i beheld of this sort the majority of the bystanders obstinately persisted to ascribe to my deliberate malignity the military aid i found myself necessitated to introduce by no means tended to disarm the prejudices of my clients in one or two instances but no more slight tumults arose and a few of the rioters fell a prey to their own wickedness and folly these misfortunes were cast as reproach upon me and i was pursued with clamours and curses i found it requisite to obtain a guard for my person i was abhorred by those for whom all my vigilance was exerted and insulted by the mouths that i supplied with the necessaries of existence nor was this my only source of alarm and uneasiness in my present situation i was by no means a dupe to the ostentatious civility of the bashaw i perfectly understood his insinuation when he invited the frequent repetition of my visits i knew that however dearly i purchased his friendship and patronage i should still have to purchase them again and again his extortions upon me admitted of no limits except from his own modesty or the estimate he might form of my invisible resources bribery itself afforded me no complete security and now that i had become an object of curiosity and remark he had sufficiently shown me i was at the mercy of his caprice or that of his master for my liberty and even for my life yet could i have resolved to quit hungary and seek the protection of some more regular government what benefit should i derive from a removal mystery was the great and unconquerable bane of my situation and from the poisonous influence of mystery the most regular system of government was not competent to protect me it would be idle to imagine that in any country on earth a stranger would be permitted to launch into such expenses as those in which i was engaged without becoming an object of suspicion and being made liable to continual interruption in his measures yet unless allowed to use the resources i possessed of what advantage was it to be the depository of wealth without a bound was it to be wished for a man under my circumstances to have a family or to be without a family when i had one i found the legacy of the stranger robbing me of every comfort of that sort with the most calamitous aggravations when i was stripped of wife and children though no man could prize those benefits more dearly than i prized them i took to myself the consolation that at least now i should risk no ones happiness but my own and that for a person exercising my endowments it was perhaps requisite to be free from every shackle and incumbrance i found however the topic from which i had consoled myself in reality the source of a new misfortune i had the wealth of a nobleman but i was deprived of his adventitious attributes i had no illustrious ancestry to boast i had neither lineage nor parent i had neither wife nor children in whom mutually to reflect and see reflected the elevatedness and generosity of my station i had not even the ordinary advantage which is within the reach of almost every man of connections and acquaintance friends handed down to me as a branch of my patrimonial inheritance friends whose value experience enabled me to ascertain and friends with whom long habits of familiarity had given birth to reciprocal endearment the bashaw had imputed to me the design of forming a party alas these which are the great materials for cementing party attachments were totally denied me i had no bonds of alliance but those which money afforded the coarsest the meanest the least flattering and the most brittle of those ligatures that afford the semblance of uniting man with man chapter xxxviii aware of the difficulties which unavoidably sprung out of the nature of my situation i resolved immediately to endeavour to supply them to the best of my power i conceived that there was no consideration so urgent upon me at the present moment as that i should without loss of time create to myself connections that might balance and keep at bay the sallies of arbitrary rule and that i should weave with my own hand the cords of friendship i had no sooner formed this project than an individual suggested himself to my reflections whom i judged to be by a singular concurrence of circumstances happily fitted to be the subject of my experiment and admirably qualified to afford me protection in the most unfavourable events the name of this man was bethlem gabor he had been some time before brought to me by one of his friends and he was a man whom for a thousand reasons it was impossible to see and converse with without receiving the most indelible impression he was the lineal representative of one of the most illustrious houses in hungary his vocation like that of the majority of the hungarian nobility had been arms but in the midst of a fraternity all of whom were warlike he stood conspicuous and alone his courage though cool and deliberate almost mounted to a degree of desperate rashness and the fertility of his invention and the variety of his stratagems did not fall short of his courage the celerity of his measures was equally distinguished distance was no bar to him and he had no sooner conceived a project however arduous than it was executed he had formed under his own eye a band of men like himself impetuous yet deliberate swift in execution silent in march invincible to hardship contemners of fatigue of difficulties of hunger and of thirst when introduced to me he was upwards of fifty years of age he was more than six feet in stature and yet he was built as if it had been a colossus destined to sustain the weight of the starry heavens his voice was like thunder and he never uttered a word but it seemed to shake his manly chest his head and chin were clothed with a thick and shaggy hair in colour a dead black he had suffered considerable mutilation in the services through which he had passed of one of his hands three fingers were gone the sight of his right eye was extinguished and the cheek half shot away while the same explosion had burned his complexion into a colour that was universally dun or black his nose was scarred and his lips were thick and large bethlem gabor though universally respected for the honour and magnanimity of a soldier was not less remarkable for habits of reserve and taciturnity but these habits misfortune had caused to become more deeply ingrafted in his nature during one of his military excursions a party of marauders had in his absence surprised his castle burned it to the ground and savagely murdered his wife and children and every living creature within the walls the same stroke that rendered him childless made him also a beggar he had been regarded for his proceedings as an adherent to the turkish standard but he had always tenaciously maintained the most complete independence the adversity that had now fallen upon him was too great he would not become a pensioner of the sultan despair had taken fast possession of his heart he disbanded the body of men he had formed and wandered a solitary outcast upon the face of his country for some time he seemed to have a savage complacence in conceiving that the evil he had suffered was past all remedy and in spurning at those palliations and disguises with which vulgar souls are accustomed to assuage their woe yet the energy of his nature would not suffer him to rest he wandered an outcast but every day engendered some new thought or passion and it appeared probable that he would not yet quit the stage of existence till he had left behind him the remembrances of a terrible and desolating revenge it may seem strange that such a man as i have described should be the individual i selected out of the whole hungarian nation to make my friend it may seem that his qualities were better adapted to repel than attract my choice would not appear strange if the reader could have conversed with him as i did he was hideous to the sight and he never addressed himself to speak that i did not feel my very heart shudder within me seldom did he allow himself to open his thoughts but when he did great god what supernatural eloquence seemed to inspire and enshroud him not that upon such occasions he was copious and ciceronian but that every muscle and every limb seemed to live and to quiver with the thoughts he expressed the hearer could not refuse to venerate as well as fear him i never pitied him bethlem gabors was a soul that soared to a sightless distance above the sphere of pity i can scarcely say i sympathised with him but when i listened to his complaints rather let me say his invectives i was astonished overwhelmed and motionless the secret of the effects he thus produced lay in his own way of feeling the incidents he described look at him when he sat alone wrapped in meditation you would say that is a man of iron though adversity pour her fiercest darts upon him he is invulnerable he is of too colossal a structure to be accessible to human feelings and human affections listen to his narrative or rather to the bursts of passion which with him supplied the place and performed the functions of narrative you would soon confess your mistake while he spoke he ceased to be a man and became something more amazing when he alluded to what he had endured you did not compassionate him for you felt that he was a creature of another nature but you confessed that never man seemed to have suffered so much or to savour with such bitterness the cup of woe he did not love his wife or his children as any other man would do he probably never dandled or fondled them his love was speechless and disdaining the common modes of exhibition it might sometimes be mistaken for indifference but it brooded over and clung round his heart and when it was disturbed when the strong ties of domestic charity were by the merciless hand of war snapped asunder you then saw its voluminous folds spread and convulsed before you gigantic and immeasurable he cursed their murderers he cursed mankind he rose up in fierce defiance of eternal providence and your blood curdled within you as he spoke such was bethlem gabor i could not help admiring him his greatness excited my wonder and my reverence and while his manners awed and overwhelmed me i felt an inexplicable attachment to his person still increasing in my bosom on his part my kindness and partiality appeared scarcely less pleasing to bethlem gabor than his character and discourse were fascinating to me he had found himself without a confidant or a friend his wife and his children in a certain degree understood him and though he had an atmosphere of repulsion beyond which no mortal ever penetrated they came to the edge of that and rested there they trembled involuntarily at his aspect but at the same time they adored and they loved him the rest of the world viewed him from a more fearful distance respected him but dared not even in fancy be familiar with him when therefore he lost his family he lost his all he roamed the earth in solitude and all men made room for him as he passed i was the first who since the fatal event that had made him childless and a beggar had courted his society and invited his communications i had dared to take the lion by the paw and seat myself next him in his den there was a similarity in our fortunes that secretly endeared him to me we had each by the malice of a hostile destiny though in a very different manner been deprived of our families we were each of us alone fated each to be hereafter for ever alone we blended ourselves the one with the other as perfectly as we could often over our gloomy bowl we mingled groans and sweetened our draught as we drank it with maledictions in the school of bethlem gabor i became acquainted with the delights of melancholy of a melancholy not that contracted but that swelled the soul of a melancholy that looked down upon the world with indignation and that relieved its secret load with curses and execrations we frequently continued whole nights in the participation of these bitter joys and were surprised still at our serious board by the light of the morrows sun i have now i believe fully accounted for our intimacy and displayed the ligatures that secretly bound us to each other it is scarcely necessary to add that my understanding confirmed what my heart impelled bethlem gabor appeared to me the fittest man in the world upon whom to fix for my friend we were qualified mutually to benefit each other my kindness my unremitted attentions the earnestness with which i listened to and soothed his griefs mitigated their agony i proposed when i could once more reconcile and incite him to activity to repair his castle and restore his fortune on the other hand he was of all the persons i could have pitched upon the ablest to protect me by his birth he ranked among the first men of his country by his ability at least as a partisan soldier a character at that time highly esteemed he rose above them all for some time i regarded bethlem gabor as entirely my friend and i consulted him in every thing in which compatibly with the legacy of the stranger of the summer house i could consult him i told him of the suspicions of the bashaw and the precariousness of my safety i demanded his advice as to the best method of securing it ought i to regard it as a more effectual or as a cheaper expedient to attempt to purchase the countenance of the sultan instead of condescending to bribe his minister ought i to set up for myself and by rendering myself the independent prince of one of the hungarian provinces defy the turk or at least endeavour to negotiate with him from a more respectable and commanding situation i said more than enough under these heads as it afterwards appeared to awaken strange imaginations in a mind of so much penetration as that of bethlem gabor in fine i demanded of him whether in case of any great and formidable danger falling on me he would to the utmost of his power afford me protection when the question was first started he swore to me with his customary impressiveness and energy that he would while i was thus employed in consulting him and opening to him as far as was practicable my prospects and fears i did not less succeed in dissipating or suspending the despair of his melancholy it was of benefit to him in this respect that by opening to him my affairs i from time to time called off his attention from his personal misfortunes i proposed to him the rebuilding his castle and i at length obtained his permission to send off a corps of workmen for that purpose beside the castle in which his wife and children had been murdered and which the marauders had nearly destroyed he had one considerably stronger though void of all recommendation from cheerfulness or beauty in the more northerly part of the kingdom this we visited together i restored the condition of his fields with considerable difficulty i replaced the cattle he had lost by purchases in poland and i revived his dilapidated revenues at first he felt an invincible repugnance to the receiving any advantage from the bounty of another but by continual remonstrances i was able to persuade him that he owed me nothing and that what i did was no more than was required from me by a regard for my own safety if ever on the face of the earth there lived a misanthrope bethlem gabor was the man never for a moment did he forget or forgive the sanguinary catastrophe of his family and for his own misfortunes he seemed to have vowed vengeance against the whole human race he almost hated the very face of man and when expressions of cheerfulness peace and contentment discovered themselves in his presence i could see by the hideous working of his features that his spirit experienced intolerable agonies to him such expressions were tones horribly discordant all was uproar and havoc within his own bosom and the gaiety of other men inspired him with sentiments of invincible antipathy he never saw a festive board without an inclination to overturn it or a father encircled with a smiling family without feeling his soul thrill with suggestions of murder something i know not what withheld his hand it might be some remaining atom of humanity it might be for his whole character was contemplative and close it might be that he regarded that as a pitiful and impotent revenge which should cause him the next hour to be locked up as a madman or put to death as criminal horrible as was his personal aspect and wild and savage as was his mind yet as i have already said i felt myself attached to him i knew that all the unsocial propensities that animated him were the offspring of love were the sentiments of a lioness bereaved of her young and i found an undescribable and exhaustless pleasure in examining the sublime desolation of a mighty soul bethlem gabor had at first regarded me with some degree of partiality kindness in almost all cases begets kindness he could not see how much i interested myself about and how much i courted him without feeling for me a sentiment different from that he confessed for other men i saw however after some time with inexpressible grief that his regard for me instead of increasing suffered perceptible diminution our propensities were opposed to each other he rejoiced in disorder and desolation as in his congenial element my present pursuit was the restoration of public order and prosperity he repeatedly expostulated with me on this i had sometimes in our conversations in the bitterness of my recollections exclaimed on myself as the most unfortunate and most persecuted of men though without entering into an explanation of my sufferings he reminded me of these exclamations he reproached me as a contemptible and pusillanimous wretch that i did not like him resolve amply and memorably to revenge my own sufferings upon my species at large in his estimate the poorest and most servile of all maxims was that of the author of the christian religion to repay injury with favour and curses with benediction i perceived with grief that the kindness towards me that had been excited in bethlem gabors mind rather declined than augmented but i was very far from being aware of the degree in which as i afterwards found this sentiment had relapsed into its opposite it seems i inflicted on him a daily torture by my daily efforts for the dissemination of happiness of these he had not been at first completely aware his mind had been too much absorbed in its own feelings to attend very distinctly to any thing i did unless it were done in his presence but in proportion as i soothed his sorrows and made him my confidant the film was removed and all that he saw had the peculiar misfortune to excite at once his contempt and his rage the finishing stroke that i gave to the animosity which unknown to me was now brooding and engendering in his breast consisted in my bestowing an important benefit upon one against whom he had entertained a long and eternal feud chapter xxxix while bethlem gabor became every day more confirmed in his antipathy against me i reposed in him an unsuspecting confidence a confidence more extensive than i had since the singular and fatal acquisition i had made reposed in any other man frequently for a considerable time together he resided under my roof frequently we went forth together in those excursions which either my projects or his views rendered it necessary for us to make in his character of a nobleman of great consideration in his native country he was now rising like a phnix from its ashes his castles were repairing his property was restored the list of his retainers daily became more numerous he revived and carefully recruited the martial band which in the first exacerbations of his despair he had dismissed from his service my purse and all that i had were his he never made a demand upon me that i did not instantly supply i reaped a particular pleasure from the largeness and frequency of his requisitions there was nothing for which i was more anxious than to bind him to me in indissoluble ties of gratitude and affection little alas did i understand the compound of tenderness and ferocity of decisiveness and inscrutability with which i was now concerned my friend such i esteemed him had been absent some time i expected his return to my residence at buda and anxious to pay him every mark of attention and respect i set out to meet him it was scarcely safe during the existing hostilities between the austrians and the turks to travel any where without a guard i had the precaution in the present instance to take with me an attendance of twenty men it was after having partaken of a slight and early dinner that i set out on my excursion the season was remarkably fine and the air genial and balsamic i scarcely ever commenced any tour with more agreeable sensations the harvest was already ripe and as i passed along i saw reapers from time to time entering upon the first essay of their interesting occupation i felt that i had at length surmounted one of those difficulties with which i had been so strongly assailed and to which i had refused to yield if i were not free from apprehensions from the arbitrary nature of the government under which i lived i believed however that i had nothing further to dread from the misconstruction and animosity of the nation i preserved my anxiety as to whether i should be able to substantiate the benefit i had sought to confer was at an end and i had little doubt that with the plenteous crops which were on the point of being gathered my popularity would return and the gratitude of my clients become more ardent than ever it was a delicious enjoyment that i now experienced the pleasures that the eye unavoidably takes in from the spectacle of a luxuriant autumn became blended in my mind with the ideas of famine put to flight my own rectitude vindicated and the benevolent purposes realised the prosecution of which had cost me so profound a heartache we at length passed the lines of the soldiers planted for the defence of the soil against the depredations of the enemy i had calculated that i should meet my guest a few leagues from buda i was deceived in my estimate the day however of his arrival was fixed i could not be mistaken in his route i resolved not to turn back without meeting him the road i took led upon the borders of that part of hungary which owned the austrian yoke the shades of night were fast gathering round us and we heard at a distance the alarm guns and the drums of the enemy i was not however a novice in the appearances of a country the seat of military excursions and war and if my mind were not wholly free from perturbation and uncertainty i at least resolved not to be turned aside from my purpose we travelled two hours longer still no notice of the approach of bethlem gabor at length a question was started whether we were still in the right road and i thought it advisable to hold a sort of council of war to deliberate respecting our further proceedings having assembled my attendants for that purpose i was now first struck with the apprehensions and timidity which they unanimously betrayed they had been drawn out rather for show and to keep accidental stragglers in awe than with the expectation of actual service i became sensible that nothing was to be hoped from their resistance in the event of an action and the utmost i could aim at was in the mean time to hold them together by the sentiment of a common danger it was resolved to return i began to be apprehensive that bethlem gabor had been prevented by some unexpected occurrence from observing his appointment scarcely had we faced about before we heard a body of cavalry approaching us i called to my party to halt i soon discerned from symptoms not difficult to be remarked by a careful observer that the party at hand was composed of austro hungarians we had every thing to fear from them i held myself bound under these circumstances first to make experiment of the fleetness of our horses i however charged my people to keep together and not to suffer the enemy by means of our inadvertence and folly to make an easy prize of us one after another in a short time i found that our pursuers sensibly gained ground upon us i was mounted upon an excellent beast and could easily have rode away from my troop while they would have been placed as a sort of intercepting object between me and the enemy but i had too much of a military spirit not instantly to reject so inglorious an expedient i called a second time to my attendants to halt i judged that the party of our antagonists was less numerous than ours i was convinced that our common safety depended upon our concerted resistance filled with the gallantry that my situation inspired i did not perceive till it was too late that my present call to halt was attended to by few even those few rather hung back divided between apprehension and shame i was the foremost and before i was aware i found myself through the means of the darkness enveloped by the enemy from my appearance they judged that i was the master and the rest my attendants they contented themselves therefore with the prize they had made and did not give themselves the trouble to pursue the fugitives they eagerly enquired of me who i was and comparing my answers with various circumstances which rumour had brought to their ear they easily concluded that i was the rich stranger of buda the character they had heard of me did not produce in these freebooters any sentiments of forbearance or demonstrations of respect the only point about which persons of their habits were concerned was how they should make the greatest advantage of what the fortune of war had thrown in their way while they were consulting and various expedients were started by one and another for this purpose a second alarm was given and one of the party being despatched to reconnoitre presently returned with intelligence that the persons approaching were horsemen of the enemy and that they amounted as he guessed to forty in number upon this information the party whose prisoner i was agreed to return with all expedition by the way they had come and commanded me upon pain of death to proceed in their company this menace had not the effect to deprive me of courage or presence of mind and i easily conceived that the readiest way to deliver myself from my embarrassment would be to join at the first opportunity the band of turco hungarians whose approach had occasioned our sudden retreat the darkness of the night was favourable to my purpose and taking advantage of a sudden winding in the road i slackened all at once the pace of my horse without being observed by my companions who as the enemy approached had now their thoughts almost wholly intent upon the safety of their retreat they passed me and i no sooner perceived that to be the case than covered from their observation by the intervening inclosure i turned my horse and gradually as my distance from my keepers increased urged him to a fuller speed it was not long before i came up with the band which had produced our alarm and hailing them with the acclamation long live the mighty sultan was without difficulty admitted into their troop i instantly understood to my great joy that this was the party of bethlem gabor that i had come out to meet he received me with much cordiality and seemed greatly rejoiced that fortune had made him the instrument of my rescue he proposed however that having met on the road i should now instead of proceeding to buda return with him to his northern castle from which our distance was scarcely greater than from the metropolis the proposal was such as i had not expected nor could i well comprehend the purpose with which it was made but the habitual demeanour of bethlem gabor neither accorded with his minutely assigning a reason for what he did nor was calculated to encourage enquiry in another i saw no material objection and therefore felt little scruple in yielding to his desires our brief consultation on this point passed at some little distance from the rest of the troop when the morning broke the first thing that excited my attention was the appearance of his followers they were full forty in number well mounted of a large and athletic figure with sun burnt faces immense whiskers and a ferocious countenance i thought i had never seen so tremendous a band to me they were every one of them strangers of all the persons that surrounded me the only one of whom i had the slightest knowledge was bethlem gabor himself i know not why it was but i no sooner beheld my situation than i was struck with alarm i saw myself completely in the power of a man who three months before was ignorant even of my existence i had not a single attendant of my own not an individual with me over whom i had personal authority or command i had no reason to distrust my host towards me his demeanour had ever been frank confidential and manly i had every imaginable claim upon his generosity and his gratitude but our senses are often the masters of our mind and reason vainly opposes itself to the liveliness of their impressions every time that i lifted my eyes and saw myself hemmed in by these barbarians my heart seemed involuntarily to fail me bethlem gabor too appeared to neglect me he had never shown himself so little obliging and attentive as at this moment and aided by the rest of the scene i thought i had never beheld him so deformed or so tremendous i was more than half inclined to wish myself again a prisoner with the austrians when we arrived at the castle we were all of us fatigued and hungry we had roamed during the whole night a repast was prepared we sat down to partake of it excuse me said bethlem gabor in a low voice as he passed me that i this night offer you the fare of a soldier to morrow you shall be accommodated in a different manner the words were innocent the proceeding natural but there was a mysterious gloom at least as i thought in the tone in which he spoke that electrified me the hall in which we supped was spacious and lofty the naked walls and rafters were imbrowned with age though it was daybreak as we entered the windows were still darkened and the apartment was illuminated only by the partial glare of lamps depending from the roof as i sat at table with the troop of my host i appeared to myself as if inclosed in a cavern of banditti though excellent partisans skilful in execution and perfect in their discipline they were unpolished in their manners and brutal in their conversation i had been inured from infancy to all the refinement that the age in which i lived had any where to boast and amidst the various evils i had suffered that of being associated with the vulgar and the base had never presented itself while they uttered now a loathsome jest and now a sanguinary ejaculation i became ashamed of my species and the pride of manhood perished within me they however paid little attention either to my feelings or my person and accustomed as i had been whether with friends or enemies to be regarded as of some importance i found myself unaccountably and suddenly dwindled into a cipher i felt it like a release from the state of a galley slave when bethlem gabor proposed that we should break up our meeting and retire to rest chapter xl a succession of gloomy thoughts revolved in my mind for some time after i was left to myself i was however overcome with fatigue and after an interval of harassing meditations insensibly fell asleep i was awakened after some hours repose by the presence of bethlem gabor standing by the side of my couch he invited me to rise and when i had attired myself started the plan of our visiting together the various apartments of the castle a small part of which only had been seen by me when i was last at this place among other things he told me there was a subterranean of most wonderful extent interspersed with a variety of cells and lurking places of which no man had to his knowledge ever ascertained the number the same dreary complexion of thought followed me to day which had been first produced in me upon my reception into the troop of bethlem gabor the preceding night my sensations were of the most depressing and discomfiting nature i felt as if i were the slave of some dark mysterious tyrant and dragged along supinely wherever he motioned me to go i tasked myself seriously i reasoned with myself i felt that it was no idle and every day part that i was called to sustain and i resolved that i would not be ruined by my own inactivity and cowardice yet when i examined the question dispassionately i could not find that i had any occasion for courage and i confessed that it was not less censurable to discover a useless spirit of mistrust and defiance than to desert ones preservation where resistance was demanded what reason had i to suspect a man between whom and myself there had prevailed so much mutual confidence none none i replied but the causeless and superstitious misgivings of my own mind even if i had ground to distrust him what remedy had i against his ill faith placed as i was in the midst of his own domains and surrounded by men devoted to his service to discover apprehension under such circumstances was to excite animosity these reasonings particularly occurred to my mind as i stood waiting for the torch which he had himself gone to procure that he might attend me to the subterranean caverns i had as yet seen no one since we broke up from our nightly repast but my host we will breakfast said he when we return from viewing these curiosities we crept along a succession of dark and gloomy vaults almost in silence bethlem gabor though he led me on and discharged the office of a guide seemed to have small inclination to assume that of an interpreter this was sufficiently in unison with his ordinary character to have little claim to excite surprise yet the reader will not on reflection greatly wonder that my present situation was far from agreeable i was alone in passages which to judge from any discoverable token you would scarcely imagine had for ages been trod by a human creature the voice was lost amidst the damps of these immense caverns nor was it possible by any exertion to call the hand of man to your aid my guide was an individual whom calamity had prompted to quarrel with the world of strong feelings indeed of capacious thought but rugged ferocious brutal and inaccessible to prayer i had chosen him for my protector and ally i had never intended to put myself in his power there was a mystery in his carriage a something not to be explained a shell that no human forces could penetrate that was mortal to confidence and might quail the stoutest i thought there would be no end to our pilgrimage at length we came to a strong door cross barred and secured with a frame of iron bethlem gabor unlocked it we had no sooner entered that it impetuously closed behind us what is that said i startled at the loudness of the report come on cried my host it is only the wind whistling through the caverns the spring bolt is shot but i have the key in my hand at the opposite end of the apartment was another door with an ascent of five steps leading to it bethlem gabor unlocked that also and then faced about with the torch in his hand i was close behind him stay where you are said he with a furious accent and thrust me violently from him the violence was unexpected i staggered from the top of the steps to the bottom this door closed with as loud a report as the other bethlem gabor disappeared i was left in darkness for an instant i doubted whether the situation in which i thus found myself were the result of design or of accident the shutting of the door might be ascribed to the latter the action however and the words of my host did not admit of that interpretation i stood motionless astonished and almost incapable of reflection what an incredible reverse was thus the creature of a moment yesterday i possessed unbounded treasures and the hearts of the whole turco hungarian nation yesterday as i rode forth on this fatal excursion i beheld the food of a mighty people mature for consumption the growth of my exertions and it will not be thought surprising that my heart leaped within me at the sight who would not have envied the unparalleled eminence at which i had arrived my triumphs were attended with no melancholy exceptions to damp their joy they were the children of no intrigue they were manly frank ingenuous and honourable my laurels were stained with no drop of blood were tarnished with no tears of the widow and the orphan how much more noble to rescue mankind from famine and death than to violate the honest pride of their nature with the exhibition of victories and trophies yet truly considered there was nothing abrupt in the reverse under which i was now suffering the whole was a chain every link of which was indissolubly connected from one end to the other my attempt to rescue a people from the horrors of famine necessarily exposed me to unfavourable accidents and misconstruction it inevitably led to my application to the government for its aid it could not fail to excite the alarms and jealousies of government as to the tendency of my proceedings by exhibiting me as the possessor of immense wealth with very limited means for the protection of that wealth it marked me a prey to a rapacious viceroy or his more despotic master when i became sensible of the precarious situation in which i stood towards the powers of the state could i have fallen upon a more natural expedient than the endeavour to cover myself with the shield of friendship and gratitude in the person of one of its nobles but this expedient would almost infallibly lead to the placing myself sooner or later in the power of the man whose friendship i sought i had done so and this was the termination of my views and my projects i now well understood the purpose of that inattention and neglect with which bethlem gabor had treated me the preceding evening the uneasiness resulting from which i had blamed in myself at the time as the dictate of weakness and unworthy suspicion yesterday i had been placed under the safeguard of a nation every man in buda and its environs was familiar with my person every man would have been ready almost to sacrifice his life to procure my safety now i was far from the scene of my philanthropical exertions no one in the troop of bethlem gabor knew who i was he had appeared to treat me the preceding evening with indifference and contempt if they saw me no more no curiosity would by that circumstance be excited in their minds my clients on the other hand in the vicinity of the metropolis however great an interest they might take in my fortune had no clue that could lead them to the knowledge of it they must suppose me a prisoner with the austrians or that i had been killed in resisting to become their prisoner i was cut off from all assistance and discovery and left as much in the power of my treacherous ally as if i had been alone with him oppressed with the utmost disparity of personal force in the remotest island of the pacific ocean such were the reflections that early suggested themselves to my mind in the solitude and darkness in which i was thus unexpectedly involved meanwhile one tedious hour succeeded to another and i remained unintruded on and unnoticed i could form no conjecture as to the object of bethlem gabor in the atrocious perfidy he had committed could he have any resentment against me and did he meditate revenge he had received from me nothing but benefits did he employ restraint on my person as the means of extortion i could not conceive that he could have any clue leading him to the discovery of my grand secret and short of this my bounties had been so exuberant as i imagined left him nothing to wish in this wilderness of conjecture i however fixed upon extortion as a motive less incredible than revenge i impatiently waited till the appearance of my tyrant should free me from some part of my present uncertainty he did not appear in the mean time i was in a condition feeble and exhausted the exercise of yesterday the hourly baffled expectation of meeting him whom i had called my friend the alternation of being first taken prisoner and afterwards rescued had extremely fatigued me we had travelled during the whole night yet the unaccountable dejection of mind under which i laboured on our arrival at bethlem gabors castle had prevented me from taking almost any share in the coarse repast that had then been set before us the entrance of my host in the morning had rendered my slumbers short as i followed him to my dungeon unconscious whither i went my limbs ached and my heart ached still more i was ill prepared for a fast of thirty six hours which the brutality of my jailor inflicted upon me after having long expected him in vain i gave myself up to despair what a termination of life for him who possessed the philosophers stone i cannot do justice to the sensations that now took possession of my mind it was not the deadly calm of despair for i still expected every moment when bethlem gabor would appear i believed than he would and i believed that he would not leave me to perish i listened with eager attention to every sound and my soul floated on the howling winds in vain nothing came of it there was no alteration in the sound or only those vicissitudes to which the howling of the wind is unavoidably subject i then turned away in anguish i cursed i stamped with my feet i smote my forehead with my closed hand i tore my hair anon another sound arrested my attention it was a different howling it seemed to be like a human voice my fancy created to me the tread of a human foot i listened with more intentness of soul than ever it was again in vain no no he will not come he will never come why should i agitate myself to no purpose let me lie down and die i reasoned with myself why should i wish to live i am nothing to any human being i am alone in the boundless universe i have no tie to existence st leon has no wife st leon has no child he has neither connection nor friend in the world even in this wretched vision of the philosophers stone have i not tried it enough have i any hopes from it is it not time that i should throw away that and existence together my meditations were ineffectual i suppose it is the case with all men thus violently thrust out of life in the full possession of their faculties i know it was the case with me the more peremptory was my summoner the more obstinately i clung to the worthless toy at length i laid myself down on the floor and if i occasionally listened i no longer ran to the walls and the doors to catch the uncertain sounds the gnawings i now felt within were intolerable they were at one period so severe that i can compare them to nothing but the sensation of having swallowed a glowing ember afterwards the weakness of nature would no longer feed this excruciating pain and it subsided into a starting and convulsive throb the pain was diversified with intervals of a death like and insupportable sickness but no i will not attempt to describe the horrors of hunger sublimed by despair where the torture of the mind gives new pungency and uproar to the corporeal anguish the image as it now presents itself to my recollection is too dreadful at last i sunk into a state of insensibility and the agony i had suffered seemed drawn to its final close the busy turmoil the feverish dream of human existence was at an end i shut my eyes and i believed i should open them no more chapter xli how long i endured this suspension of the vital faculties i cannot tell the next impression on my sensorium subsequent to those i have described was a sort of external twitching and violence that seemed to persecute me it was an importunity from which i felt desirous to escape i longed to be undisturbed and at rest the intruder on my quiet would not leave me and i at length roused myself as if to put away my cause of molestation my thoughts were all confounded and obscure i knew not where i could scarcely be said to know who i was a little more effort brought with it a further capacity of perception i saw before me what was now the chief object of my mortal aversion the figure of bethlem gabor it was some time longer before i became aware that he had been employed in taking up my apparently lifeless corpse placing it on a stone bench in the side of the cave and chaining it to the wall he observed the motions that indicated in me returning life he remarked the stare of my glassy and rayless eyes he now spoke with a stern and unpitying voice there is food there is a light eat having thus said he left me what a cruel and remorseless treatment he cared not for my life he disdained to make the slightest exertion to restore me he left it to chance whether i should revive or perish the figure of a dying man that i presented did not make one fibre of his bosom bend or quiver i revived i ate by degrees i recovered from the deadly languor which had invaded my senses in about twelve hours longer bethlem gabor returned with a new supply of sustenance i was now strong enough to be able to converse with him i heard the heavy sound of opening locks and removing bolts before he entered and i summoned my faculties to expostulate with him why am i here what is the meaning of the unworthy way in which you treat me it is he regarded me with a truculent aspect as if he would pierce through my heart because i hate you you hate me good god is it possible what evil have i done to you what good have i not done you what supplies have i refused you what occasions have i neglected of studying your advantage your interest and your honour if thus your hatred is purchased how shall that man demean himself who is to purchase your love oh think not my hatred idle or capricious heaven knows i would have refrained from hating you if i had been able i struggled against it with all the energies of my soul but you have committed towards me the most mortal offences that man ever endured there is an antipathy between your nature and mine that all the menstruums in the world could never bring to coalesce eternal providence and what is the source of this antipathy and do you profess ignorance have you not gone on day after day with the full consciousness and will to torment me have i not warned you and expostulated with you times without number of what have you warned me i hate mankind i was not born to hate them i have no native obliquity of character i have no diabolical maliciousness of constitution but they have forced me to hate them and the debt of abhorrence shall be amply paid i loved as never mortal loved no human heart was ever so devoted and centred and enveloped in the kindly affections of family and parentage as mine has been was not my wife were not my children murdered when i came home to feast my eyes and tranquillise my soul with the sight of them did i not find all waste and desolation did i not find their bodies naked pale disfigured with wounds plunged in blood and already putrid this was the welcome i looked for this was the object i so speeded to see no never was a moment like that my whole nature was changed in an instant my eyes were blasted and dried to horn my blood froze in my well stored veins i have no longer delight but in human misery my revenge is not causeless this was not the act of individuals all men in the place of these murderers would have done as they did they are in a league together human pity and forbearance never had a harbour but in my breast and i have now abjured them with something more of inwrought vigour and energy i will become like to my brethren all men are excited by the same motives urged by the same temptations influenced by the same inducements why should i attempt a futile distinction when nature had made none all men bear the same figure i cannot view the human figure without a torture the most dreadful i always knew answered i your general hatred of mankind but your manners and your behaviour persuaded me that you exempted me from the general censure i wished to do so you made the attempt impossible you told me that you had suffered the same misfortunes which i had that you by the injustice and persecutions of men had also lost your wife and your children i hailed you as a brother in my heart i swore to you eternal friendship i said we will carry on this holy warfare together we communicated to each other our mutual sorrows with you and you only i found moments of consolation soon i discovered my mistake instead of like me seeking occasions of glorious mischief and vengeance you took upon yourself to be the benefactor and parent of mankind what vocation had you to the task with the spirit of a slave who the more he is beaten becomes the more servile and submissive you remunerated injuries with benefits i found that there was not within you one atom of generous sentiment one honest glow of fervent indignation chicken hearted wretch poor soulless poltroon to say the best of you to your insensate heart it was the same whether you were treated with reverence or scorn i saw you hunted hooted at and pursued by the people you fed you held on your course and fed them still i was compelled to witness or to hear of your senseless liberalities every day i lived could i submit to this torment and not endeavour to remove it i hate the man in whom kindness produces no responsive affection and injustice no swell no glow of resentment i hated you the more because having suffered what i had suffered your feelings and conduct on the occasion have been the reverse of mine your character i thank god is of all beings the most opposite to that of bethlem gabor at length you filled up the measure of the various thwartings with which you daily insulted me there was one native of hungary between whom and me there subsisted an open and eternal war i relate in no human ear the cause of my animosity to that man suffice it that it was deep immeasurable inexpiable with a refinement of cruelty and insult difficult to conceive you chose that man for one of the objects of your beneficence would i consent to see my name joined in pension list with my mortal enemy the injury you inflicted on me would have been less if you had stabbed me to the heart less that would have been a blessing i impose on myself the task of living for my revenge but never shall i deem that man my foe who should rid me of all this tumult of passions and this insupportable load of existence together you have heard my motives you may wonder at you may censure them but they are human i have nothing further to say to you now you have no need to recur to expostulation expostulation never moved the heart of bethlem gabor hereafter you shall hear more thus speaking he left me and i must confess with whatever disgrace to my sagacity he opened upon me a new world i conceived not till now the faintest suspicion of what had been labouring in his bosom amidst all my experience of the varieties of human character this was a species that had never fallen under my observation before what a painful and mortifying occurrence is it in human life when we have lived with a man from day to day when we have conversed with him familiarly and seen him in all the changes of circumstance and when we flatter ourselves we have penetrated all the recesses of his heart suddenly to start upon something portentous that brooded there of which to that moment we had not the lightest suspicion i am not the only individual to whom this event has occurred in a subsequent visit of bethlem gabor to my cell for he only attended me with provisions he would intrust the secret of my confinement to no other mortal i intreated him to inform me with what intention he retained me a prisoner and to fix a price on my ransom to this overture he appeared to yield some degree of attention he made no explicit answer but asked with an inquisitive and severe tone in what manner i imagined i could procure money in my dungeon let us agree upon the terms and set me at large you have never found me deceitful and you shall not find me deceitful now do not hope i will consent to that i ask you again in what manner do you imagine you can procure money in your dungeon i reflected for a moment liberty is ineffably sweet and whatever followed upon the present overture i was determined not to neglect the faintest prospect that led to a termination of my confinement there is answered i in my mansion at buda a chest which if it can be brought to me hither will enable me to supply your demands i have the key in my custody and no key but my own will unlock the treasure give me the key replied bethlem gabor no rejoined i it is in my custody it is not upon my person i have taken care of that no human hand shall touch it but my own and how can i cause this chest to be brought to you without risking a discovery of your situation or that i had a concern in your disappearance of that said i judge for yourself i have made a proposition to you and i have done enough i will have no share in the detail of its execution well said bethlem gabor after having ruminated a moment the chest you shall have i undertake that describe it i described the chest and its situation in my house with a minuteness that made mistake impossible after a considerable time it was brought to me it was too bulky and ponderous to be introduced into my cell by a single arm but bethlem gabor having first caused me unconsciously to swallow a powerful opiate found no difficulty either to conceal my person in the dark shadows of this ragged subterranean or to cause some of his followers to place the chest within my reach believing that they placed it in a vacant apartment i awoke and found it at hand i was secure that the lock was such a one as could not be forced but i examined the different surfaces to see whether violence of any other sort had been exercised on it there were marks of damage but not sufficiently unequivocal to enable me to form a certain judgment on this point the chest contained not gold but the implements for making and fashioning gold allowing for the distance from which it was brought they appeared to be pretty exactly in the state in which i left them i had never placed much confidence in this expedient for softening the heart of bethlem gabor but i perceived that it would serve at worst to divert my thoughts and by exciting in me some share of expectation might call off my attention from the miseries of my present condition embracing the occasions when i was most secure against the intrusion of my jailor i provided myself with the sum that had been previously agreed on between us my task being finished i carefully displayed the produce of my labour against the next time bethlem gabor should visit my cell he viewed it with an air of sullen and gloomy triumph he removed it from the cave which was my habitation to an apartment of this subterraneous abode little distant from my own when he had concluded this employment it seemed to be a just inference that he was to give me my liberty he did no such thing without uttering a word he closed the door of my cavern locked it and departed when bethlem gabor next entered my cell i reproached him with this as with the breach of a solemn engagement his first answer was an infernal laugh expressive of derision hard heartedness and contempt by and by however he condescended to explain himself more fully i made no engagement cried he you talked of a ransom and i suffered you to talk i made you no answer i gave you no encouragement boy i deceived you not no though my heart pants for vengeance and for misery i will never be guilty of treachery i will break no engagements i am a knight and a soldier you have given me ten thousand ducats what are ten thousand ducats to me do you think i am uninformed of your secret i opened your chest i found no gold its contents were crucibles minerals chemical preparations and the tools of an artist you are possessed of the grand arcanum the philosophers stone if i had a doubt of it before the transaction of yesterday converted conjecture into certainty and did you suppose idiot driveller that you are that i would take ten thousand ducats in commutation for wealth inexhaustible no you are my prisoner and may choose in this infallible dilemma whether you will remain my slave to supply me daily resources as i shall daily think proper to demand or at once make over to me your whole mystery and place me in this respect on a level with yourself it was now my part to be peremptory and firm i refuse said i every part of your dilemma and all that you can propose to me do you talk of my remaining your slave to supply you with daily resources do you imagine that shut up in this dungeon i will nevertheless labour for your gratification do you believe that that gift which i received as the instrument of my own happiness and the benefit of mankind shall be made the pledge of my perpetual imprisonment with regard to imparting to you the secret you suppose me to possess i answer without hesitation that dearly as i prize liberty and numerous as are the motives you may think i have to prize it i will not purchase my liberty at that rate i would rather spend the days of eternity in this cavern than comply with your proposal the gift of the philosophers stone the moment a man possesses it purifies his mind from sordid and ignoble inducements the endowment which raises him so much above his species makes him glory in his superiority and cherish his innocence he cannot if he would mingle in the low passions and pursuits of the generality of mankind for myself i value too much the verdict of my own heart ever to allow myself to be influenced in the main concerns of my existence by menaces and compulsion beside this gift i received for holy and beneficent purposes to such it is consecrated and if i ever impart it i must select its depository with all the assiduity and penetration it is practicable for me to exert you i will henceforth benefit no more you hate me my disapprobation of you is fixed and irrevocable i weep to think how much i have been deceived in you i weep to think how many high and heroic qualities in your breast are now converted into malignity and venom you the possessor of the philosophers stone you tell me the sole pursuit of the rest of your life is revenge and human misery what an image do you raise in my mind if with such dispositions you possessed the means which the acquisition of riches inexhaustible would confer on you and do you believe that any consideration on earth could induce me to realise such an image as you please replied bethlem gabor indignantly i have nothing to propose to you think you that either as my enemy or my slave and i hold you for both i would descend to negotiate with you i simply told you your situation yours be the consequences of your wilfulness and folly one mistake however that i see you make respecting my purposes i will remove you seem to suppose that if you were to communicate to me your secret i would then set you at liberty no by heavens this cavern is your abode for ever you shall never go forth from it alive and when you are dead here your flesh shall moulder and your skeleton shall rest as long as the world remains look round your walls enter fully into possession of your final home i know that to keep you here and alive my prisoner i must in a certain sense imprison myself but at that i do not murmur i shall have the gratification of beholding my foe and seeing him daily wither in disappointment you wish to be a father to the human race and i shall deem the scope of my misanthropy almost satisfied while in your restraint i image myself as making the human race an orphan never shall bethlem gabor set at large a man of your unnatural and gall less disposition and your powers for the indulgence of that disposition sieur de chatillon i do not want your secret it suffices that i know you possess it have i not yourself in my keeping it will be more joy to me rudely to issue my commands and to see you complying with them in spite of the most heartfelt reluctance than to possess the richest gift on earth in the fullest independence think you bethlem gabor incompetent to tame the tenant of this wretched cavern boy you are my prisoner you shall be my creature i will humble you at my feet and teach you to implore my bounty for the most miserable pittance look to it you know your destiny do not provoke my fury without a foresight of the consequences i will enter into little further detail of this my wretched imprisonment in the wilds of hungary it was not destitute of its varieties and i could if i pleased fill a volume with the artifices and the violence of my gloomy superintendent i could fill volumes with the detail of the multiplied expedients the furious menaces the gigantic starts and rhapsodies of passion by which he alternately urged me to compliance and concession but i will not i will bring to an end the history of bethlem gabor and then having detailed the surprising events that immediately followed it will close the page of st leons history for ever i stood like a rock shut out from all other gratifications i at least resolved to accumulate in my own person all the energies of resistance if i were to unfold the story i could command the readers astonishment his admiration but the object of these papers is to record not my merits but my fate how different was my imprisonment in the cavern of the man abhorring palatine from that which i had experienced in the dungeons of the inquisition there an inexorable apathy prevailed my tyrants were indifferent whether i died or lived filled with the sense of their religious elevation they held on the even gravity of their course and counted my groans and my tears neither for remorse nor pleasure the variety i experienced in their dungeons was the growth of my own thoughts from without i encountered no interruption it was not to be ascribed to those who held me in durance if my faculties were not lethargied into death bethlem gabor possessed no share of their apathy his malice was ever alive his hatred ever ingenious and new in its devices he had a purpose to answer to extort from me the supply of his necessities and projects it was not so much perhaps that he stood in need of this as that he placed a pride in it and had fiercely resolved to show me that i was unreservedly his slave his animosity against me was so fixed and insatiable that nothing that was pain to me was indifferent to him if at any time he saw me subsiding into insensibility he failed not to exert himself to sting me into life again the consequence of this was somewhat different from what bethlem gabor expected desponding as i was weary of life and almost finally alienated from the all coveted gift of the philosophers stone if he had left me to myself i should very probably have sought in insensibility relief from the torment of my own thoughts but he taught me a better lesson refusing me the indulgence of torpor he obliged me to string myself to resistance he gave me a passion he gave me an object he gave me comparative happiness i was roused to opposition i was resolved that placed as i seemed to be at his mercy i would yield him no atom of his desires thus employed i found in my employment pride perpetual occasion presented itself for fortitude and i gradually ascended to the sweets of consistency perseverance and self gratulation i had for years been inured to satisfy myself with a sparing stock of pleasures and i was less at a loss to expand and ramify those which i now possessed than almost any other man would have been in my situation if my attendant train of sensations was scanty bethlem gabor took care to afford them a perpetual supply of food and employment and i was comparatively little exposed to the pain of vacuity when he saw that i was inflexible and that he could no longer gain from me the smallest compliance with his will he raged against me with terrifying fury was it a crime in me that this fury in my tyrant produced the operation of a sedative and a cordial there was no malignity in the joy it gave me i had much aversion for bethlem gabor but no hatred i took no pleasure in his agonies because they were agonies my sympathies towards him now i confess were small but the joy i felt was because his fury told me was the unwilling evidence of my own value i left him to assail the mound i opposed to his desires as he pleased it remained strong and unaffected as the sea beaten promontory from the inefficacy of his efforts i sometimes took occasion to remonstrate with my jailor and demand the restoration of my liberty but bethlem gabor was not a man whom arguments and expostulations like these could move in spite of himself however i commanded his wonder if not his esteem he regarded the contrast as almost incredible between the boy aspect under which he saw me and the inflexibility and resources of my time instructed mind the contentment that i have here described in myself was however a creature of the imagination the forced progeny of uncommon effort it was no natural state of the soul my mind would sometimes wander beyond the limits of my cavern and remember that there were other persons beside bethlem gabor and myself in the world i recollected the situation in which i had left my great project for the reviviscence of hungary and rejoiced to remember that it was already in such forwardness as i hoped no longer to stand in absolute need of my assistance yet what i had done was but a small portion a dismembered branch of what i had meditated to do and what every person of a generous and enterprising mind who had been in possession of the philosophers stone would have designed why was i thus stopped in the commencement of a career so auspiciously begun and to which an ardent fancy would prescribe no limits why was every power of the social constitution every caprice of the multitude every insidious project of the noble thus instantly in arms against so liberal and grand an undertaking nor could i help repining at the perverseness of my fate which had decreed that i should savour all the bitterness incidentally resulting from my plan and not be permitted so much as to taste the applause and reward that ought to grow out of its completion thousands of men were at this instant indebted to my generosity and exertions for every blessing they enjoyed and i was cast forth as the refuse of the earth pining under the alternate succession of solitude negligence and malice my very existence and the manner of it unknown except to one individual who had from the strangest and most unexpected motives sworn eternal hostility to me bethlem gabor had resolved that so long as he lived i should remain a prisoner when he died if he continued my only jailor the single individual acquainted with the place of my confinement the probable issue was that i should perish with hunger twelve years before i should have contemplated this attitude and condition of existence with indescribable horror but within that time i had been better taught i had received an education i thank them in the dungeons of the spanish inquisition and if that be properly considered it will not be wondered at that i was superior to ordinary terrors early in my present situation the presentiment had suggested itself to me that by some striking event i should be rescued from my present confinement and improbable as the suggestion was it made an indelible impression on my mind i had originated in or it had produced a dream the scenes of which had appeared particularly luminous and vivid i imagined i saw a knight cased complete in proof enter my prison a smile of angelic kindness beamed on his countenance he embraced me with ardour he made a sign to me to follow him i felt that i had seen him somewhere that he had been my intimate friend yet all the efforts i made in sleep or afterwards when i was awake were unavailing to remove the mystery that hung upon his features i rose to obey him the ground trembled under my feet like an earthquake presently with the incoherency usually attendant on a dream the figure changed to that of a female of unblemished grace and beauty it unfolded a pair of radiant wings we ascended together in the air i looked down and saw the castle of bethlem gabor a prey to devouring flames here ended my dream i soon felt that i could reason myself out of all confidence in the presages of this wild and incongruous vision but i refused to do it my consolations were not so plenteous in this frightful solitude as that i should willingly part with one so delicious reason thus applied i contemplated as an abhorred intruder it was for a long time part of my occupation in every day to ruminate on this vision not with the sternness of a syllogist but with the colouring of a painter and the rapture of a bard from thus obstinately dwelling on it in the day it happened that it became again and again and again my vision of the night slumbers like these were truly refreshing and armed and nerved me for the contentions of my tyrant sacred and adorable power of fancy that can thus purify and irradiate the damps of a dungeon and extract from midnight glooms and impervious darkness perceptions more lovely and inspiriting than noontide splendour chapter xlii i had now continued here for several months and in all that time had received no external impressions but such as related to the cell i inhabited and the misanthropical savage by whom it was visited one evening that bethlem gabor entered my dungeon i observed in him an air of unusual disturbance where apathy reigns the intercourse between those over whom it presides will be marked with a death like uniformity but wherever the furious passions take their turn they will occasionally subside into a semblance of familiarity and benevolence there was something in the countenance of my tyrant that made me for a moment forget the complicated injuries i had received from him what is it that has disturbed you cried i there was no answer there was a knitting in his brow and a contraction in his features that showed me his silence was an effort he departed however and had already passed the threshold of my dungeon the door was in his hand he returned chatillon said he perhaps you will never see me more my castle is besieged i have passed through dangers of a thousand names and i ought not to be made serious by that which now assails me but a gloomy presentiment hangs upon my mind the busy phantom of life has lasted too long and i am sick at heart in the worst event i will not be made a prisoner i will die fighting i feel as if this were the last day of my existence and upon the brink of the grave animosity and ferociousness die away in my soul in this solemn moment my original character returns here striking his heart to take possession of its native home a character stern and serious if you will but not sanguinary not cruel not treacherous or unjust between you and me there is a deadly antipathy but you did not make yourself you intended me friendship and advantage the sufferings you have experienced from me in return have been sufficiently severe if i die defending my walls and you remain thus you will perish with hunger i had intended it should be so but i am now willing to remit this part of your fate i will enter into a compromise with you i will trust to your fidelity and your honour i will take off your chains i will bring you a timepiece and torches i will leave with you the key of the spring lock of your cavern provided you will engage your word to me that you will not attempt to make use of your advantages till the expiration of twenty four hours to these terms i assented without hesitation the chains fell from my wrists and my ancles i stood up once more unshackled and in respect of my limbs a free man when bethlem gabor was on the point to depart my soul melted within me i took hold of his hand my fingers trembled i grasped and pressed the fingers of my tyrant i cannot describe what then passed in my bosom no man can understand my sensations who had not been in my situation who had not passed through a treatment arbitrary ferocious and inhuman and had not then seen the being who had wounded him so unpardonably suddenly changing his character commiserating his fate and rescuing him from destruction from this time i saw bethlem gabor no more he died as he had sworn to do in the last dike of his fortress his self balanced and mighty soul could not submit to the condition of a prisoner he was nothing if he were not free as the air and wild as the winds i may be mistaken but this appears to me to have been a great and admirable man he had within him all the ingredients of sublimity and surely the ingredients of sublimity are the materials of heroic virtue i have much cause of complaint against him he conceived towards me an animosity the most barbarous and unprovoked but in writing this narrative i have placed my pride in controlling the suggestions of resentment and i have endeavoured to do him justice i had engaged to wait twenty four hours i waited only six i know not how the reader will decide upon the morality of my conduct but i own i had not the force i believe i may call it the insensibility to remain in my dungeon any longer there was no doubt that if bethlem gabor returned a conqueror the term of my imprisonment would be renewed and all his former menaces continued in force what should i deserve to have thought of me if i could sit down idly and tamely wait the return of my jailor no liberty is one of the rights that i put on when i put on the form of a man and no event is of power to dissolve or abdicate that right of what validity was the promise that bethlem gabor extorted from me by compulsion and as the condition of that which he had no title to withhold what gratitude did i owe to this man who treated me with every contumely and shrunk from nothing but the thought of causing me to perish with hunger whatever became of my attempt to escape i could at least in this vast subterranean hide myself from the face of him who had injured me i had a provision of phosphorus in my chest and could therefore extinguish my torch upon the slightest alarm and relume it at pleasure what was the value of life situated as i was situated it was better to perish in the attempt to escape than linger on for ever in perpetual imprisonment as a further resource i left a billet in my dungeon for for this also i had implements intreating bethlem gabor by every motive of compassion and humanity to provide for me the means of sustenance as usual having taken these precautions i lighted a fresh torch and unlocking the door and thrusting the key into my girdle set out upon my expedition though bethlem gabor had stipulated for twenty four hours the siege might even now be over and i trembled every instant lest my jailor should return i wandered for a considerable time among the alleys and windings of this immeasurable cavern i had the precaution to mark the sides of the vault with characters and tokens as i passed that if necessary i might be able to find the way back to my dungeon this might prove an indispensable resource to prevent me from perishing with hunger once or twice i changed my route inferring from a comparison of circumstances the best i could make that i was not in the direction of the castle from which bethlem gabor had led me to my imprisonment in all this wandering i had seen nothing i had heard nothing which could demonstrate to me that i was approaching the habitation of man i had groped my way for near two hours when on a sudden i heard a loud and tremendous shout that almost stunned me and that from its uncommon shock could be at no great distance from the place where i stood this was succeeded by a terrifying glare of light i extinguished my torch both that i might be better qualified to observe and that i might be less in danger of discovery by any one who should approach me unawares the shouts were several times repeated the light i found to proceed from that end of the vault towards which i had been advancing and by the best conjectures i could form i concluded the outlet into the castle to be at no great distance i heard the crackling of the flames and the fall of rafters and beams presently i discerned a volume of smoke approaching me and found that if i remained long in my present station i should incur the risk of being suffocated i formed my resolution i concluded that bethlem gabors castle was taken and set on fire by the austrians i believed that my persecutor was already no more to this faith i was undoubtedly prompted by the presentiment which he had communicated to me i saw that it would be impossible for me to emerge into light till the flames should abate i once more therefore lighted my torch and returned by the straightest road i could find to my dungeon arrived there i proposed to pass the interval quietly in the cavern where i had so long felt the weight of the hungarians chains suddenly however the suggestion occurred to me may not my conjectures be false may not bethlem gabor yet repel the enemy and return to me from amidst the ruins of his falling castle the thought was sickness and extinction to my heart hope beautiful as are thy visions in how much anguish and agony do they clothe the terrors of disappointment never had bethlem gabor been half so dreadful to me as now i shrunk away i took with me the fragments of provision that yet remained i hid myself i deemed no cell remote enough to conceal me from the inhuman persecution of my tyrant i continued in the subterranean all that day and all the succeeding night once in this period i attempted to reconnoitre the avenue of my escape but i found the situation still so heated and suffocating that i did not venture to proceed at length i came forth from this den of horrors and again beheld the light of the sun the path had already been sufficiently explored by me and i no longer found any material obstacles i now saw that my conjectures were true the castle of my ferocious adversary was a pile of ruins the walls indeed for the most part remained but choked with fragments of the falling edifice blackened with the flames and penetrated in every direction by the light of day with difficulty i climbed over the ruins which opposed my egress from the subterranean and rendered my passage to the outside of the castle an affair of peril and caution here the first object that struck me was some tents probably of the soldiers who had been employed in this work of destruction i was hailed by a sentinel and i demanded that he would conduct me to his commander he led me to the centre of the little encampment and i stood in the presence of his chief i lifted my eye to behold him and was petrified with such astonishment as till that hour i had never felt it was charles my son my only son the darling of his mother the idol of my soul chapter xliii it may seem extraordinary that i should instantly have known him he was sitting at a table covered with papers and with one or two aides de camp waiting to receive his orders he was clothed in complete armour and his casque was resting on the ground by his side when i entered his eye was fixed on a despatch that day received from the great palatine of hungary but in little more than a minute he raised his head and his countenance was completely presented to my view it was fifteen years since i had beheld it he was then scarcely above half his present age a mere stripling in whom the first blush of manhood had awakened the sentiment of independence and an honour impatient of a shade he was now a leader of warlike bands his complexion olived over with service and his eye rendered steady with observation and thought but i knew him i knew him in a moment my soul with the rapidity of lightning told me who he was not all the arts in the world could have hid him from me not all the tales that delusion ever framed could have baffled me i could have challenged him against the earth i have already had occasion to explain the complexity of my feelings when after a long absence i visited the heiresses of the house of st leon the sweets of recognition that transporting effervescence of the mind where the heart bounds to meet a kindred heart where emotions and tears mingle in speechless encounter where all is gazing love and strict embrace these pleasures were denied me i stood stiff and motionless in the presence of my child my heart might burst but it must not and it could not communicate its feelings after an instants pause of overwhelming sensation i sunk back on myself and considered my own figure it happened that exactly opposite to me in the tent of my son hung his armour and over the rest his polished shield in which i saw my own person clearly reflected the youth of my figure indeed was still visible but the hardships of my dungeon had imprinted themselves in glaring characters on my face my beard was neglected my hair was matted and shaggy my complexion was of a strong and deadly yellow my appearance to a considerable degree told my story without the need of words charles enquired of those who brought me where they had found this wretched and unhappy figure and was told that i had been seen a few minutes before coming out from the ruins of bethlem gabors castle he humanely and naturally concluded that i was a victim on whom the tyrant had exercised his ferocity and that i had been shut up in some dungeon of the fortress it was impossible that any person above ground in the castle should have come out alive from the operation of the flames he commanded that i should be led to a neighbouring tent and taken care of after having been refreshed with food and rest and attired with other apparel he directed that i should be brought to him again that he might hear my story under these circumstances there was nothing for which i was more anxious than that i might recruit myself and shake off as quickly as possible the effects of my confinement cordials were brought me and i tasted of them i bathed in a neighbouring stream one of my sons attendants removed my beard and arranged my hair i now desired to be left alone that i might take some needful repose i could not sleep but i reclined my limbs upon a couch and began to collect my thoughts i saw myself in one hour the sport of the most complete reverse of fortune that could happen to a mortal i had been the prisoner of a cavern so wild and pathless as almost to defy the utmost extent of human sagacity to explore its recesses from this cavern but for the sudden and extraordinary event which had just occurred i could never have come forth alive all sober calculation would have taught me to expect that i should have remained there chained up like a savage tiger in his cage as long as bethlem gabor existed and that when he died i should perish unheard unknown no creature that lived suspecting my situation no lapse of ages ever bringing to light my dismal catastrophe the remorse and relenting of bethlem gabor towards me seemed so little to accord with any thing that i had personally witnessed of his habits and his mind that even now i feel myself totally unable to account for it as it was however i was once again free from the state of an outlaw imprisoned for life i suddenly saw myself at large inspirited by the light of the sun and refreshed by his genial rays in the full possession of youth and all its faculties enabled to return amidst my clients of buda or to seek some new adventure in any corner of the earth to which my inclination led me there is no man however overwhelmed with calamities however persecuted with endless disappointment however disgusted with life and all its specious allurements to whom so sudden and admirable a change would not convey some portion of elasticity and joy but there was one thought that entirely occupied me i cannot describe how my soul yearned towards this my only son the sentiment even now as i write is an oppression i am scarcely able to sustain willingly most willingly would i have traversed every region of the globe if so i might have discovered his unknown retreat and now suddenly without the smallest effort on my part he was placed before me his last solemn parting his abjuration of my society and intercourse for ever rose to my memory and gave a zest inexpressible to our present encounter at the thought that my son was in the neighbouring tent all earthly objects beside faded from my mind and appeared uninteresting and contemptible i instantly resolved to devote myself to his service and to place all my enjoyment in the contemplation of his happiness and the secret consciousness of promoting it he had if i may so express myself in my own person forbidden me his presence in my now altered figure i might disobey his injunction without fearing his rebuke let not the reader condemn me that endowed as i was with unlimited powers of action i preferred a single individual my own son to all the world beside philanthropy is a godlike virtue and can never be too loudly commended or too ardently enjoined but natural affection winds itself in so many folds about the heart and is the parent of so complicated so various and exquisite emotions that he who should attempt to divest himself of it will find that he is divesting himself of all that is most to be coveted in existence it is not a selfish propensity on the contrary i will venture to affirm that the generosity it breathes is its greatest charm beside in my case i considered my own existence as blasted and i could therefore find nothing better than to forget myself in my son i had made a sufficient experiment of the philosophers stone and all my experiments had miscarried my latest trials in attempting to be the benefactor of nations and mankind not only had been themselves abortive but contained in them shrewd indications that no similar plan could ever succeed i therefore discarded for the present at least all ambitious and comprehensive views and believed that i ought to be well content if i could prove the unknown benefactor of the son of marguerite de damville i entered into a solemn engagement with myself that i would forget and trample upon every personal concern and be the victim and the sacrifice if need were of the happiness of my child dismissing my project of becoming a factor for the hungarian people i determined to lay aside the name of chatillon and cut off every indication that might connect my present existence with that of the rich stranger of buda one of the advantages i possessed for that purpose was that no creature in hungary had the slightest suspicion that the sieur de chatillon had ever been the prisoner of bethlem gabor having thus arranged my thoughts i now called for the garments that had been assigned me they were supplied me from the stock of my son and when i had put them on i overheard the attendants whispering to each other their astonishment at the striking resemblance between their master and myself when i came once more into the tent of their captain and stood as in the former instance before his shield i did not wonder at their remark the coincidence of our features was so great that had we passed through a strange place in each others company i should infallibly have been regarded as his younger brother yet there was something of marguerite in the countenance of charles that i wanted when i recovered as in a short time afterwards i did my vigour and health i was more blooming than he but there was something graceful ingenuous and prepossessing in his aspect which i could by no means boast in an equal degree and which might have carried him unhurt and honoured through the world we shall see some of the effects of this in what i shall presently have occasion to relate when my son required of me to declare who i was i told him as i had already determined to do that i was a cadet of the house of aubigny in france that after having passed through several other countries i had come into poland with the floating and half formed purpose of entering as a volunteer against the turk but that before my plan was completely arranged having been led by my juvenile ardour in a hunting party far within the frontier of hungary i had been so unfortunate as to become a prisoner to the troopers of bethlem gabor i added that when introduced to their chief i had given him so much offence by the firmness of my manner and my refusing to comply with certain propositions he made me that he had thrust me into a dungeon from which but for the gallant exertions of the present detachment i should never have come out alive charles heard my story with attention and interest he called on me to resume my courage and my hopes and to be confident that my sufferings were now at an end he told me that he was a frenchman as well as myself and like myself had been a soldier of fortune he felt he said a powerful sympathy in my tale there was something in my countenance that irresistibly won his kindness and if i would put myself under his protection he did not doubt to be the means of my future success he spoke with great asperity of bethlem gabor who as an intrepid indefatigable and sanguinary partisan had been the author of greater mischiefs to the christian cause than any of the immediate servants of the sultan of constantinople he congratulated himself that the same action that had delivered the world from so murderous a renegado had rendered him the preserver of a youth of so much enterprise and worth as he doubted not i should prove he said there was but one other man in hungary who had been so effectual an enemy to the cause of truth and christianity as bethlem gabor the name of this man he understood was chatillon and he grieved to say that he bore the appellation of a frenchman to the eternal disgrace of the nation that gave him birth he had joined the turkish standard and by exertions difficult to be comprehended had rescued the infidels from famine at a time when but for his inauspicious interference buda and perhaps every strong town in hungary were on the point of falling into the hands of the christians it was this same man who had revived the resources of bethlem gabor after they had once before by his own fortunate exertions been routed out and whom i might therefore in some sense consider as the author of my calamities as well as the inveterate foe of christendom such a wretch as this was scarcely entitled to the common benefit of the laws of war and he would not answer for himself if chatillon had fallen into his power to what extremity his holy resentment against this degenerate fellow countryman might have hurried him providence however had overtaken him in his impious career and he had fallen obscurely as he had lived basely in a night skirmish with a party of marauders from the austrian camp the reader may believe that i did not a little rejoice that in announcing myself a few moments before i had taken the name not of chatillon but daubigny what i heard however occasioned in me a profound reflection on the capriciousness of honour and fame and the strange contrarieties with which opposite prejudices cause the same action to be viewed i could not repress the vehemence of my emotions while i was thus calumniated and vilified for actions which i had firmly believed no malice could misrepresent and fondly supposed that all sects and ages as far as their record extended would agree to admire in another point of view the invective which my son thus unconsciously poured in my ears had the effect of making me regard with a more complacent satisfaction the plan i had formed of devoting myself to his service here i pursued no delusive meteor of fame the very essence of my project lay in its obscurity kings and prelates armies and churches would no longer find an interest in disputing about my measures i should indulge the secret promptings of my soul undisturbed alike by the censure of the world and its applause it was thus that under every change of fortune i continued to soothe my soul with delusive dreams meanwhile my project went on with the happiest auspices the friendship between me and charles continued hourly to increase as a frenchman whom chance had introduced to his acquaintance in a distant country it was natural that he should feel a strong bias of affection towards me but that sort of fraternal resemblance which the most inattentive spectator remarked in us operated forcibly to the increase of charless attachment he would often in the ingenuous opening of his soul towards me call me his brother and swear that i should for ever experience from him a brothers love charles had by this time completed the thirty second year of his age i was in appearance at least ten years younger than he there is something in this degree of disparity that greatly contributes to the cultivation of kindness and is adapted to the engendering a thousand interesting sentiments frequently would he exclaim our fortunes my dear henry that was the name i assumed have been in a considerable degree similar we were both of us early cast on the world i indeed at the immature age of seventeen i entered the world without an adviser or a friend but my destiny was favourable and i escaped its quicksands and its rocks i have now by a concurrence of happy circumstances obtained a place among honourable men and soldiers and for what is to come may reasonably regard myself with some degree of confidence you are yet in one of the most dangerous periods of human life your work is all to do your battles are yet to fight suffer me my dear friend to represent your better genius and act an elder brothers part you shall find me no ignorant mentor and no ungentle one nothing could be more gratifying to me than to see the shoots of affection thus springing up spontaneously in charless bosom i willingly humoured the generous deception that he was putting on himself and heard with transports inconceivable his assurances of kindness and protection we rode and we walked together we were in a manner inseparable when he went out to reconnoitre i was his chosen companion when he inspected the discipline and condition of his soldiers he applied that opportunity to initiate me in the science of war when he expected to encounter the enemy he placed me immediately by his side sometimes he would open his heart to me and dwell with a melancholy delight upon his secret sorrows it is no wonder my henry he would say that i feel this uncommon attachment to you i am alone in the world i have no father no mother and no brethren i am an exile from my country and cut off for ever from those of my own lineage and blood it is with inexpressible delight that i thus cheat the malice of my fate and hold you to my bosom as if you were indeed my brother i would not part with the fiction for the mines of peru and i know not whether i do not cultivate it more assiduously and regard it with a sentiment of more anxiety and zeal because it is a fiction than i should do if it were a reality i had indeed added charles a mother and when he had started this theme he would dwell for ever on her praises i easily saw that never son loved a mother more cordially than charles loved the all accomplished marguerite with what sentiments did i hear her eulogium i could not join in her praises i could not be supposed to know her i stood there as the statue of prometheus might have done if after being informed with a living soul the gods had seen fit to chain its limbs in everlasting marble the passion within me panted and laboured for a vent but i was invincibly silent with what sentiments did i hear her eulogium every word of it was a dagger to my heart every word said and thou villain wert not thou her murderer more painfully than the fiercest reproaches could have done when charles had celebrated with an eloquence truly divine this incomparable mother a sudden pang of memory would make him start into rage and this mother i left of this mother i cannot tell whether she is alive or dead what shall i say the crime or the not less fatal error of my father separated me from this mother i loved my father i loved him because he was my father i had great obligations to him he once had virtues but my mother if i could have found her in the wildest desert of africa and have known her virtues a stranger to my blood descended from the remotest tribe of the human race i should have chosen her for my friend my preceptress and my guide beyond all that youth and beauty with their most radiant charms could tender to my acceptance thus unconsciously yet ingeniously did my dear son from time to time torture his fathers heart i could not even deliver him from the gloomy and wretched uncertainty whether this mother were alive or dead with one word i could have composed his soul into a sober grief i could have said your adorable mother at length rests from her sorrows she is no longer the victim of a misguided and a cruel father you have no longer occasion to brood over that most disconsolate of reflections i know not what anguish may be at this moment suffered by her who is entitled to all my duty and all my affection with one word i might have told this and that word i dared not utter chapter xliv my son related to me his history and made me the depository of his feelings and reflections the name of st leon indeed never passed his lips i felt that he had consigned that to inviolable oblivion the appellation he bore in the army was the chevalier de damville soon after he abandoned me at dresden he had entered as a volunteer in the imperial army charles the fifth was at that time assembling forces to encounter the confederates of the league of smalcalde in this situation my son was eminently fortunate he was distinguished for uncommon enterprise and courage in some of the first actions of the war and early attracted the notice of gian battista castaldo count of piadena who held an eminent command under the emperor in this army my son was a party to the decisive battle of muhlberg in april four years afterwards castaldo was appointed commander in chief against the turks in hungary and the french chevalier accompanied his patron to this new scene of military enterprise charles had felt dissatisfied with the grounds and motives of war between the catholics and protestants of germany men worshipping the same saviour and appealing to the same authorities but many of them at least from the most upright and ingenuous scruples differing in their interpretation of those authorities but in their contentions between the crescent and the cross he entered with unbounded enthusiasm into all the feelings that constitute a champion or a martyr he conceived that whatever was dear to the human race in this world or the next hung on the issue he regarded the grandeur of the cause as purifying his efforts and consecrating his name and when he lifted his sword in vindication of an expiring god he felt himself steeled with more than mortal energy my son dwelt on the merits of his patron with a degree of veneration and love that knew no bounds castaldo was ranked by the consenting voice of mankind with the most accomplished generals of the age in which he lived i knew him said charles in his most private hours and stood next to and observed him in the greatest and most critical occasions of his life it was the least of his merits that he distinguished me that he took me up friendless and an orphan that under every circumstance he was more than a father to me that he corrected my faults that he guided me with his advice that he instructed me with his wisdom and supported me by his countenance castaldo was the most persevering and indefatigable of mankind no difficulties could undermine his apparent serenity no accumulation of dangers could appal or perplex him victory never robbed him of his caution misfortune and defeat never destroyed the grandeur and elasticity of his soul i firmly believe that no general had ever a more discouraging variety of counteractions to struggle with the enemy was barbarous and sanguinary yet firm and undismayed in the full vigour of their political health under the rule of the ablest of their sovereigns the nobles of the country castaldo had to defend had almost all of them been alienated one after another by the tricking and ill judged politics of the house of austria the nation was ruined houseless and starving many of the officers who served under my general were the basest of poltroons but they were imposed upon him by his court he was compelled to place them in important trusts and even when in the most dastardly way they betrayed those trusts they were by some pitiful intrigue sheltered from his discipline and his justice the forces of castaldo were mutinous and ungovernable and he was almost constantly denied the funds requisite for their pay for two years the count of piadena struggled with these complicated difficulties when he had obtained a hard earned advantage at one extremity of the kingdom he found it rendered useless by some treachery or incapacity in the other extremity which it was instantly necessary he should hasten to repair he quelled four alarming mutinies by his firmness his resources and the prudent combination of his calmness and severity in the midst of one of his most arduous situations he suddenly received intelligence that the states of hungary which were at that time assembled were debating whether they should enter into a treaty with solyman for the purpose of placing their country under the turkish sceptre he immediately flew to the place of council the decision in favour of solyman was drawn up and ready to be adopted but castaldo by his presence his authority and his eloquence recalled the states to their duty and prevented them from eternally staining the christian name surrounded with these difficulties opposed to an enemy many times more numerous than the forces he could bring against them and whose wants were all plentifully supplied castaldo by his single abilities kept the balance even or rather caused it to incline in favour of the christian scale but what added charles avails the most consummate merit how may the most incessant and undaunted exertions be shadowed by the veil of obscurity the world judges by events success is necessary to procure the palm of fame after two years of such labours as i witnessed and glory to describe a mutiny broke out among the mercenary troops more formidable than any that preceded it was no longer even in the abilities of castaldo to quell we honour and respect you said the mutineers but we will no more serve without pay we have been baffled two years we will march to the gates of vienna and demand from ferdinand our sovereign why we are thus denied the arrears that are due to us they chose leaders for this expedition among themselves the great castaldo whose peculiar talent it is to accommodate himself to events and never by any misfortune to be deprived of his invention and resources saw what it was that became him having in vain tried every method for retaining his troops in hungary he offered himself to lead them to vienna then was seen the true ascendancy of a noble mind goaded with want and distress they had been deaf to the remonstrances of their general when he sought to direct them against the enemy but when they saw him submitting himself to their rage and impatience and fearlessly intrusting his safety to those who had before refused even to listen to him and who had reason to fear his retribution as their accuser and judge they were awed and speechless they almost repented of their frenzy and were half determined to return to their duty their remorse indeed was imperfect and ineffectual but castaldo led this band of mutineers through the heart of the kingdom with as many symptoms of regularity modesty and order as if they had been the best paid the promptest and most loyal army in the world my son spoke in terms of the warmest enthusiasm of the defence of erlau in the period of castaldos last and most arduous campaign against the turks in respect of fortifications the town was scarcely competent to resist the feeblest enemy but its deficiency in this point was supplied by the constancy and valour of its garrison and inhabitants the very women displayed an enterprise that the more vigorous sex have seldom exhibited in one instance a heroine of this sort was seen fighting in the presence of her mother and her husband her husband fell dead by her side let us my daughter said the mother remove the body and devote the rest of our care to its honourable funeral may god returned the impassioned widow never suffer the earth to cover my husbands corse till his death has been amply revenged this is the hour of battle not a time for funeral and for tears so speaking and seizing the sword and shield of the breathless champion she rushed upon the enemy nor did she quit the breach till by the slaughter of three turks who were ascending the scaling ladders she had appeased the fury in her breast and the ghost of her departed husband then raising the corpse and pressing it to her bosom she drew it to the great church of the city and paid to it the last honours with all possible magnificence many other examples of a heroism not inferior to this were displayed on the same occasion and shall i added charles in a sally of glorious enthusiasm ever desert a cause which has been thus honoured shall i betray a soil which has been immortalised by such illustrious actions shall i join myself to the renegado bethlem gabor and the execrable chatillon no such virtue as i have described never could have been conceived but in the bosom of truth great as is the pious devotion i feel for that god who died on the cross for the salvation of mankind i own my weakness if it be a weakness his cause is scarcely less endeared to me by the sublime exertions of his heroic followers than by his own adorable condescension and mercy when the glorious castaldo departed with his rebellious army for the metropolis of germany there was nothing i more earnestly desired than to accompany his march for seven years he had conferred on me the benefits and shown towards me the affection of a father and i could not think of being separated from him without the extremest anguish beside i regarded it as little less than sacrilege to quit his side at a time that he was exposed to the furious suggestions of a host of robbers and banditti but he would not allow me to abandon my post some time said he we must separate and you must stand alone i have been long enough your instructor and if my lessons or my example can produce improvement in you they must have performed that office already he treated with disdain the thought of the danger to which he might be exposed and his need of a faithful guard a thought which he had detected in the midst of my anxieties but which i had not the courage to mention this said he is your genuine sphere you are a young man burning with the zeal of truth and religion you are inspired with the enthusiasm of a champion and a martyr heaven knows how willingly i would have spent my blood for the overthrow of mahomet and his blasphemous impieties to me this is not permitted to you it is i shall be engaged in the painful scenes of civil contention between christian and christian misguided and inflamed by the human inventions of luther and of calvin you have before you a clearer and a brighter field and i confidently persuade myself you will be found worthy of your happier destiny the count of piadena bestowed me so he was pleased to express himself upon nadasti the great palatine of the realm as the most precious pledge of his friendship that it was in his power to confer since the retreat of castaldo the christian standard has obtained little more either of attention or aid from our lawful sovereign now the possessor of the imperial throne ferdinand for a great part of this time has had his negotiators at constantinople whom the insulting turk has condescended neither sincerely to treat with nor to dismiss the christian army in hungary has been left to its own resources but zeal has supplied the place of magazines and religious ardour has taught us to omit no occasion of annoying and distressing the enemy the most considerable occurrence of this period has been the siege of ziget about four years ago solyman taking advantage of certain factious broils among our hereditary nobility appointed at that time one of his eunuchs bashaw of buda and having placed a numerous army under his command dismissed him from the foot of his throne with this arrogant injunction not to enter the capital of his province till he had first sent the keys of ziget as an offering to his royal master horvati the christian governor of this fortification is one of the most accomplished and the bravest of our native commanders and nadasti having sent him a reinforcement the better to enable him to support the threatened siege i was in the number of the soldiers appointed on this service the trenches were opened early in june and the siege continued for the space of seven weeks the bashaw though an eunuch in person stunted and of monstrous deformity was distinguished for an uncommon degree of audacity and perseverance four times he filled the dikes of the fortification with wood and earth and as often by means of a furious sally of the besieged the materials which had thus with vast expense of industry and labour been accumulated were set fire to and consumed on the twelfth day of the siege he gained possession of the town and drove us back into the citadel but on the day following we recovered the ground we had lost and from that time the town was his no more the actions of these days were the severest of the whole siege we fought the enemy street by street and inch by inch the great fountain in the market place ran with blood we ascended hills of the dead which the infidels opposed as a barrier to our further progress i seized two turkish standards and though wounded pursued the enemy through the eastern gate and returned in triumph nadasti in the sixth week of the siege marched to our relief but he was met and worsted by the bashaw who returned victorious to the foot of the walls during the whole of the siege mutual animosity was cherished by every species of contrivance and the heads of the distinguished dead were exhibited on both sides as spectacles of abhorrence and terror the inflamed passions of the combatants several times found a vent in listed duels horvati the governor killed in one of these encounters a gigantic turk who had sent a proud defiance to our host i procured myself honour upon a similar occasion and the scarf which i now wear composed the turban of the infidel i slew at length the disappointed bashaw was obliged to raise the siege and he soon after died of grief and mortification in his palace at buda i confess i recollect the christian exploits in the defence of ziget in which i also had a share with rapture and delight they will serve to awaken in me new animation when hereafter the coldness of ordinary life might strike palsy to my soul i shall never think i have lived in vain after having contributed in however humble a place to arrest the career of insolence and impiety which under the standard of the crescent threatened to over run the whole christian world such were the adventures and such the sentiments of the gallant chevalier de damville i had been a warrior in my youth and the discourse he held was sufficiently congenial to my earliest propensities i saw indeed that he had gained in the zeal of a soldier of the cross a source of martial heroism to which my military history had been a stranger but though i could not entirely enter into this sentiment of his and indeed regarded it as an infatuation and delusion i did not the less admire the grandeur of soul with which this heroic fable inspired him there was no present propensity in my heart that led me to delight in deeds of blood and war i saw them in their genuine colours without varnish or disguise i hated and loathed them from my very inmost soul but notwithstanding this i was sensible to the lustre which military zeal cast round the character of my son nor is this incredible or absurd the qualities of a generous and enterprising champion are truly admirable though the direction they have received should be worthy of eternal regret charles de damville was my friend and when i say this i cannot help stopping a moment for the indulgence of reflecting on the contrast between my present intercourse with my son and my late connection with bethlem gabor i had sought the friendship of the hungarian partisan partly because i wanted a protector and an ally but partly also because in my soul i looked up to and admired the man i called bethlem gabor my friend i persuaded myself that i had cogent reasons for calling him so but there was little sympathy between us he was wrapped up in his own contemplations he was withered by his own calamities our souls scarcely touched in a single point no no this is not friendship friendship is a necessity of our nature the stimulating and restless want of every susceptible heart how wretched an imposture in this point of view does human life for the most part appear with boyish eyes full of sanguine spirits and hope we look round us for a friend we sink into the grave broken down with years and infirmities and still have not found the object of our search we talk to one man and he does not understand us we address ourselves to another and we find him the unreal similitude only of what we believed him to be we ally ourselves to a man of intellect and of worth upon further experience we cannot deny him either of these qualities but the more we know each other the less we find of resemblance he is cold where we are warm he is harsh where we are melted into the tenderest sympathy what fills us with rapture is regarded by him with indifference we finish with a distant respect where we looked for a commingling soul this is not friendship we know of other men we have viewed their countenances we have occasionally sat in their society we believe it is impossible we should not find in them the object we sought but disparity of situation and dissimilitude of connections prove as effectual a barrier to intimacy as if we were inhabitants of different planets it is one of the most striking characteristics of the nature of man that we are eternally apt to grow dead and insensible to the thing we have not half our faculties become palsied before we are in the slightest degree aware that we are not what we were and what we might be there are philosophers who regard this as the peculiar privilege of man a wise provision of providence to render us contented and easy with our lot in existence for my part i do not envy and i have never aspired to the happiness of ignorance and stupidity but be it a blessing or a curse the phenomenon is undoubted present me with some inestimable benefit that my nature fitted me to enjoy but that my fortune has long denied me to partake and i instantly rise as from an oppressive lethargy before it may be i felt myself uneasy but i knew of no remedy i dreamed it was my nature i did not put forth a finger for relief but now that i have drawn the unexpected prize i grow astonished at my former blindness i become suddenly sensible of my powers and my worth the blood that slept in my heart circulates and distends every vein i tread on air i feel a calm yet ravishing delight i know what kind of an endowment life is to a being in whom sentiment and affection are awakened to their genuine action this was the effect of the mutual attachment produced between me and charles i looked into him and saw a man i saw expansive powers of intellect and true sensibility of heart to be esteemed and loved and protected by such a man to have him to take one by the hand to enquire into ones sorrows to interest himself in ones anxieties to exult in ones good fortune and ones joys this and this only deserves the name of existence i had however a painful drawback upon my satisfaction it was my fate since the visit of the stranger of the lake of constance to rejoice for moments and to lament for years i could not at first ascend to that purity and eminence of friendship to forget myself i could not but painfully feel the contrast between me and my son how happy was charles how respectable how self approving how cheerful of heart i shall presently have occasion to speak of a still further addition to his happiness i looked indeed young fair blooming a stranger to care but i had a secret worm gnawing at my vitals this very deceitfulness of my countenance was a bitter aggravation to my remorse i never saw my features reflected in the polished shield without feeling myself struck to the core charles had walked right onward in the paths of honour he feared no detection he had no secret consciousness that gave the lie to the voice of applause partiality and friendship but i was all a lie i was no youth i was no man i was no member of the great community of my species the past and the future were equally a burthen to my thoughts to the eye that saw me i was a youth flushed with hope and panting for existence in my soul i knew and i only knew that i was a worn out veteran battered with the storms of life having tried every thing and rejected every thing and discarded for ever by hope and joy when i walked forth leaning on the arm of him who delighted to call me his younger brother this was the consciousness that hunted my steps and blasted me with its aspect whichever way we turned chapter xlv among the various confidences reposed in me by my son one was his love the object of his attachment was a young lady of quality named pandora niece to nadasti great palatine of hungary in consequence of the earnest recommendation of castaldo in nadasti had taken my son under his particular protection and charless principal home at the periods when the army was dispersed in winter quarters was at the palatines house in the city of presburg here his manners had become more polished and his taste more refined till then bred in tents and living amidst the clangour of arms he had been a mere soldier rough generous manly and brave but nadasti was an elegant scholar smitten with that ardent love of classical and ancient lore which has so eminently distinguished the sixteenth century he assembled round him men of letters from various parts of europe and under his auspices the days of matthias corvinus king of hungary seemed to be revived whose love of literature was such that he kept three hundred transcribers in his house constantly employed in multiplying copies of the precious relics of roman and athenian learning the consort of nadasti was one of the most accomplished matrons of the age in which she lived and her three daughters were patterns of every polite and amiable accomplishment such was the school into which the chevalier de damville entered at the age of twenty five immediately after the retreat of castaldo this may seem an age somewhat late for new modelling the character but charles had an enterprising and aspiring temper and he soon became a distinguished ornament of courts and the society of ladies castaldo had taught him all he knew the temper the manners and the science of a military chieftain the palace of nadasti finished and completed the education of my son pandora was only fourteen years of age when charles de damville first became a sort of inmate of the house of her uncle she at that time lived with her father but he being afterwards killed in the battle which nadasti fought for the relief of ziget pandora occupied an apartment in the palatine palace from the first hour he saw her a mere child as it were accompanied by her governess charles confessed to me that he had beheld her with eyes of distinction he had said to himself this little girl will hereafter be a jewel worthy of the crown of an emperor he had found something inexpressibly attractive in the starry brightness of her complexion her air he regarded as both lighter and more graceful than any thing he had ever before seen and her speaking and humid eye seemed to him the very emblem of sensibility and sweetness if at the girlish and immature season of fourteen he had ascribed to her all these perfections it will easily be supposed that as she increased in stature as the beauties of form unfolded themselves in her and she advanced in sentiment and a lovely consciousness of her worth the partiality of charles became more deep and unalterable but the orphan niece of nadasti was altogether without a portion and the great palatine would have seen with more complacency the chevalier de damville addressing his pretensions to one of his daughters charles confessed to me that the passion he nourished had been fruitful of pleasures and griefs of hope and perplexity it was now almost a year since pandora and himself had confessed a mutual affection the confession had not been the result of design on either side both had wished to suppress it pandora from virgin dignity and reserve and charles because he saw not how their affection could be crowned with success and he dreaded more than any misery to himself to be the author of degradation and misery to her he loved but what is ever uppermost in the heart will at some time or other betray itself their sympathetic and accordant feelings upon a point so deeply interesting to both rendered them eagle eyed to discern the smallest indications they had had a thousand opportunities and a thousand opportunities had been resisted they became more than usually silent and reserved towards each other they shunned to meet and when they met avoided each others eyes one day a casual encounter in a solitary retreat which each had sought principally with intention to escape the presence of the other had taken them off their guard they were mutually hesitating and perplexed each discerned more unequivocal indications than had ever occurred before of the state of the others sentiments the entire accord snapped as it were at once the chains of reserve and each after a short interval of hesitation spoke with an eloquence hitherto untried the language of love the difference of years between them gave a zest to the communication pandora seemed to be throwing herself upon the protection of an elder brother of a guardian one in whose prudence she confided as the antidote of her inexperience charles felt his maturer years as imposing on him more severely that sacred integrity the obligation of which at least as society is at present constituted seems in the majority of cases to grow out of the relative situation of the sexes of the protectorship of the one and the dependence of the other and now exclaimed charles what am i to do what am i to desire it would be affectation in me to conceal from myself on an occasion like this that the reputation i have acquired both in the arts of peace and war is such as to have caused nadasti to set his heart upon my becoming his son in law the great palatine though in many respects generous and liberal has that inflexibleness of opinion which is perhaps more apt to grow up in the hearts of scholars than in other departments of society he is grave and solemn all his habits are of a majestic and lordly nature and i have small reason to hope that i shall find him accessible to my representations he is little subject to sallies of passion his own propensities are wholly under the control of his judgment and it is not likely that he will make allowance for the ardent affections of other minds pandora is entirely dependent on him in any case the portion she would receive from him would be very inadequate to her worth but discarded and discountenanced by him who has the absolute rule of christian hungary what can she expect i am myself destitute of fortune my provision as a soldier will be very inadequate to the wants of the first and softest of her sex but even of that provision nadasti will deprive me if i marry in opposition to his pleasure shall i make pandora the inhabitant of tents and encampments shall i expose her to all the changes and hazards of a military life shall i drag her as the attendant of a soldier of fortune through every climate of europe no by heavens i should regard myself as the most selfish and the basest of mankind if i could deliberate on such a question never shall the charmer of my soul owe a single privation to her charles i love her with so pure and entire a passion that i prefer her prosperity to every earthly good nor is it merely necessary to my attachment that she should live in plenty and ease i require that my pandora should be seen in her native lustre that she should be surrounded with every appendage due to her merit that she should command applause from the mercenary and homage from the superficial her praise is the only music i enjoy i could not bear to hear her name coupled with levity and scorn i could not bear that where she appeared every eye should not be turned to her with reverence and honour my passion i confess it is that of a disciple of liberal arts and a nobleman not that of an arcadian the period of the campaign now drew to an end and charles having requested me to accompany him set out for his usual winter retreat in the city of presburg i saw pandora never in my life had i beheld any thing so sweetly simple i had always been an admirer of the sex but the perfections of pandora were of a nature that i had not observed in any other woman her symmetry was so perfect the pearly lustre of her skin so admirable and her form and carriage so light and ethereal that at first view it was difficult to persuade ones self that she was framed of the same gross materials as the rest of the species she seemed not constructed to endure the shocks of the world and the rude assaults of ill humour or neglect of censure or adversity her voice was of the sweetest the clearest and softest tone i ever heard there was a peculiar navet in her accents that riveted your soul in irresistible fetters her conversation for in the sequel i enjoyed much of her conversation had a very uncommon zest she seemed to have no art and what she uttered appeared as if wholly unchecked by consideration or reserve you were persuaded that she always delivered without restraint the first thing that occurred to her mind yet in what she said there was so much good sense so much true feeling and as the occasion allowed so much whim and imagination that you could not discover how any of her words could be changed but for a worse this circumstance strikingly contrasted with the childish simplicity or rather the feminine softness and sylph like delicacy of her manner and her tone the opposition of appearance between her and my son made a strong impression upon me he was a perfect soldier with an ample chest broad shoulders and a figure though graceful and well proportioned yet so strong that it seemed framed to contend with and to conquer the wrestlers in the grecian games his complexion shaded with luxuriant curls of manly hair was itself made brown with the rigours of climate pandora was so heavenly fair so sweetly delicate and slender that you would have thought she would be withered and destroyed in his embrace like the frailest ornament of the garden before the northern breeze but courage to choose what is rugged and manlike is often characteristic of the softest of her sex i speedily contracted an intimate commerce with the beautiful pandora i was naturally desirous to be as consummate a judge as possible of those perfections which i believed fated to determine the future happiness of my son when sufficiently satisfied in that respect i still continued the indulgence and found a pure and exquisite pleasure in the daily contemplation of accomplishments that were to prove the materials of his gratification and delight whose gratification i preferred to my own i had a still further view in this commerce i was anxious to be perfectly informed of the connections and family of pandora that upon them i might build a project i had deeply at heart of bestowing on her in the least questionable and exceptionable manner a dowry that should place her upon an equality with her cousins the daughters of nadasti and deliver my son from all apprehension of the unpleasing consequences to result from the resentment of the great palatine nadasti was opulent and the portions of his daughters very considerable and however inclined i could not exceed this limit without risking the entire miscarriage of my project charles thought nothing too rich either in situation or income to do honour to the mistress of his soul but separately from this enthusiastic sentiment both he and pandora had too just a taste not to prefer the simple majesty of ancient nobility to the expensive ostentations of modern refinement having digested my plan i was obliged to travel as far as venice for the execution of it the mother of pandora had been a venetian and the uncle of her mother was one of the adventurers who had sailed with pizarro for the conquest of peru he had died before the completion of that business and had left behind him no relative so near to him in blood as the lovely pandora by a singular piece of good fortune i encountered at venice an individual who had sailed in the same ship with the young ladys uncle the uncle having died prematurely the share he might otherwise have obtained of the spoils of peru was sunk in the shares of the rest and nothing was allowed to remain that might have descended to his heirs his friend and countryman i found though once rich with the booty he made had by a series of calamities before he reached his native home been reduced to a state of poverty the vicissitudes he experienced had produced in him the effect of a very uncommon eagerness for acquisition this man i fixed on for my instrument i opened to him my plan and offered him a very ample gratification provided he acted successfully the part i assigned him in concert with each other we digested and forged the various documents that were best calculated to give credibility to the tale having completed our arrangement i set out for presburg without a moments delay and directed my venetian not to follow till after a stipulated interval he was not to enter into full possession of his reward till he had completed the task he had undertaken it was fixed that no person in hungary should be acquainted with my visit to venice but only be allowed to understand generally that i had been engaged for a certain time in an excursion of amusement so hard is the fate of the possessor of the philosophers stone and so limited his power as to have rendered all these precautions on my part indispensably necessary had not the various circumstances concurred the detail of which is here stated the birth of pandoras mother in a maritime state the expedition of pizarro to peru her uncles engaging in this expedition and dying before it was completed and my own casual rencounter with his compagnon du voyage my project would too probably have been baffled a direct gift of the fortune i designed would never have been admitted of and had not the coincidence been eminently favourable even though i should have succeeded in misleading every other party i could not hope to have eluded the perspicacity and jealous honour of my son when i returned to presburg i again renewed my intercourse with pandora the passion entertained by damville for the beautiful orphan was a secret to every person at court they had managed so discreetly as to have avoided every hint of suspicion and as it was universally known that the great palatine had an eye on this gallant soldier for one of his daughters few persons entertained a doubt that my son would speedily declare his election among the co heiresses of nadasti on the other hand in the friendly intercourse between me and pandora neither she nor myself felt that there was any thing to conceal and it was therefore a matter of complete notoriety my blooming youth of appearance was remarked by the majority of bystanders we were judged formed for each other and before i was aware the beautiful hungarian was awarded to me by the general voice as my destined bride when however i became acquainted with the rumour i was contented to smile at it the consciousness in my own breast how far the public sagacity had wandered in its guess gave to that guess in my apprehension a certain air of whimsical and amusing chapter xlvi such was the situation of the affair of pandora and i daily looked for the arrival of my venetian confederate when suddenly i remarked an alteration in the carriage of my beautiful ally she had hitherto on all occasions sought my conversation she now appeared sedulously to avoid me her manner had been characterised by the gaiety the sprightliness and general good humour incident to her age and congenial to her disposition she was now melancholy her melancholy assumed a tone correspondent to the habits of her mind and was peculiar and individual it had an ingenuous and defenceless air inexpressibly calculated to excite interest it seemed to ask what have i done to deserve to be melancholy you felt for her as for a spotless lily depressed by the unpitying storm you saw that those enchanting features were never made for a face of sorrow and that that bewitching voice ought never to have been modulated into an expression of heaviness i was in the highest degree anxious to learn the cause of this revolution and was the farthest in the world from suspecting its real foundation i pursued pandora with so much importunity and demanded an interview with such irresistible earnestness that she at length consented to grant it we met in a remote part of the garden why henry said she do you thus persecute me you are my evil genius the cause of the greatest calamity that could ever have overtaken me i started for heavens sake beautiful pandora what do you mean i love the chevalier de damville i have loved him long he is dearer to me than life and he has cast me off for ever and am i the cause yes you and you alone i had for some time observed a change in his behaviour that he was uncommonly grave serious and reserved i endeavoured to soothe him i redoubled my blandishments in our next season of unreserved discourse i tenderly enquired into the source of his grief for a long time he resisted my importunity at length faithless girl said he have you the cruelty to ask the meaning of my depression this is the extremity of insult is it not enough that i know your inconstancy is it not enough that i have found you like the rest of your frivolous sex the mere slave of your sense of sight regardless of vows regardless of an affection which despised all interests but that of tenderness and love caught by the first appearance of something younger softer and more courtly than i pretend or desire to be will nothing satisfy you but the confession of my unhappiness from my own mouth do you require expostulation intreaty and despair from your discarded lover to fill up the measure of your triumph for a long time i was totally at a loss to apprehend my dear chevaliers meaning no continued he i am not jealous there is no temper i hold in such sovereign contempt as jealousy i am not of a disposition easily to conceive umbrage or lightly to doubt the protestations of the woman i adore i have been blind too long but i see that you are eternally together i see that you take advantage of the distance at which the despotic temper of nadasti keeps us from each other to give all your time to my favoured rival you seem never to be happy out of his society i was first led to throw off the dulness of my unsuspecting security by the general voice of the public the whole court gives you to each other not a creature it holds but has discerned that passion which you have the insolence to expect to conceal from me since i have been awakened from my security i have seen it a thousand times i have seen your eyes seek and encounter each other i have seen them suddenly lighted up by your interchanging glances i have seen the signs of your mutual intelligence i have seen with what impatience the moment you could escape from the crowded circle you have joined each other and retired together ungenerous pandora but do not imagine i will enter the lists with the gaudy butterfly who has now attracted your favour i have told you already that i am not formed for jealousy i am not the sort of man you have supposed me to be i have loved you much i have loved you long but i would tear out my heart from my manly breast if i believed it yet retained an atom of passion for you i know what it was i loved i loved a character of frankness of ingenuousness of simplicity which i fondly imagined was yours but which i now find was the creature of my own fancy the pandora that stands before me the child of art the base wretch that could take advantage of my forbearance in regard to her uncle which was adopted purely out of love to her the unfeeling coquette that would wish to retain me in her chains when she had discarded me from her affections this creature i never did love and i never will i know how deeply rooted the habit has been in my bosom of regarding you as the thing you are not i know how bitter it is to a temper like mine to detect so unlooked for a delusion i know what it will cost me to cast you off for ever but i never yet proposed to myself a conquest over my own weakness that i did not gain nor will i now if you were to discard this wretched daubigny to morrow if you were convinced of and contrite for your error i must ingenuously tell you no time no penitence could restore you to my admiration i had set up an imaginary idol in my bosom but you have convinced me of its brittleness and dashed it to pieces i endeavoured continued pandora by every imaginable protestation to convince my late faithful lover of his mistake but it was to no purpose all i could say only tended to swell the tide of his fearful resentment be silent cried he add no further to the catalogue of your wanton and causeless delusions do not make me hate too much what i once so blindly and ardently adored i feel that i have an enemy within me that would fain co operate with your deceptions and hypocrisy i find that man treacherous to himself is formed by nature to be the fool of your artful sex but i will subdue this propensity in me though i die for it i may be wretched but i will not despise myself have i not seen your falsehood have not all my senses been witnesses of your guilt the miracle is that i could have been duped so long i have heard this stripling lover of yours inexhaustible in your praises and dwelling upon them with an ardour that nothing but passion could have inspired i have seen as i have already told you the intelligence of your eyes i have seen those melting glances i have heard those tender and familiar tones between you that bespoke the most perfect confidence and the most entire mingling of heart if i did not believe this i should believe worse of you i should think your heart not merely capricious but an absolute prostitute prepared to bestow upon hundreds those sweet those nameless tendernesses of accent and countenance which i fondly imagined were reserved for me alone i should regard you as the worst and most pernicious acquisition that could fall to the lot of a man go pandora added he my heart is chaste my soul is firm i can no longer be deceived by you i will not dispute your charms with the idle boy you have now thought proper to favour and saying thus he burst from me in an agony of impatience alas continued the sweet and ingenuous pandora my dear henry what shall i do how shall i remove the unreasonable imaginations of this noble mind bear me witness heaven nothing could be more innocent than the correspondence i allowed myself to hold with you my adorable charles was continually calling you brother i scarcely ever heard him speak of you by any other appellation i regarded charles as my husband i already viewed you in anticipation as the brother of my lord excluded as i was from frequent conversation with him whom i most loved i endeavoured to supply the deficiency by an unreserved communication with you the extreme resemblance of your persons increased my gratification you were his picture his speaking image while i looked at you i said such once was my charles before he was the great man the gallant soldier the accomplished cavalier the adored object that now engrosses my affections beside i knew that charles loved you as much as he did any man on earth and that knowledge made you dear to me you were constantly eager to dwell upon and describe his excellences could i fail to be pleased with your conversation i own that the pleasure i took in it was unbounded and the emotions it awakened in my affectionate heart delicious but all this candidly explained was only an additional proof of the tenderness and constancy of my earliest attachment and now ever since the fatal day in which this conversation passed with my charles he is absent from court and i know not whither he is gone he has disdained to seek any further explanation nor do i know how to appeal to his calmer feelings and more deliberate mind one thing however i had determined on and that was henry strictly to avoid your society i trust wherever my charles is he will hear of this i owe this expiation to his agonised feelings and to the appearances that in some degree justify his misconstruction i will wait patiently till the simplicity and singleness of my conduct have cleared my faith if i should otherwise have found pleasure and relief in your society i will make a merit with myself of sacrificing this to the apprehensive delicacy of my charless mind in this single instance your importunity has prevailed with me to dispense with my rule you were not to blame and i thought upon more mature reflection that i owed you an explanation but henceforth if you have any kindness for me or value for him who has acted and felt towards you like a brother i must entreat you to co operate with me in this and that whether in public or private we may bestow no notice on each other and avoid all opportunities of communication to persuade you to this was indeed a principal inducement with me so far to deviate from the rule i had laid down to myself as to admit this conversation i was extremely affected with the unhappiness of pandora i exerted myself to console her i promised that nothing on my part should be wanting to remove every shadow of doubt that hung upon her fidelity and i exhorted her to believe that every thing would infallibly terminate in the way most honourable and gratifying to herself pandora listened to me and dried her tears the conversation was interesting and soothing to us both we regarded it as the last unreserved and sympathetic communication we should ever have with each other it insensibly grew longer and longer and we knew not how to put an end to it we were still in this state of irresolution when looking up i perceived charles de damville approaching from the further end of the walk that led to the alcove i would have withdrawn i was anxious to remove the unjust suspicion that hung upon his mind but the instant that presented to him so strong an apparent confirmation of them the instant that by so doing must have worked up his soul into tumult did not appear a favourable one for explanation to withdraw was impossible pandora had discerned her lover at the same moment with myself she was seized with a faintness she would have sunk to the ground but i caught her in my arms i rested with one knee on the earth her head was reclined on my bosom charles approached with a quicker pace rise said he this is beyond my hopes i left presburg with the purpose of not revisiting it for years but as i proceeded further and further from a place which had lately been the centre of my affections i began to doubt whether i had not acted with precipitation and to believe that there was yet some uncertainty hanging on my fate the seemingly earnest protestations of this delusive syren rung in my ears mechanically without any formed resolution i changed my course and returned on my steps my doubts are now at an end i find you taking instant advantage of my absence to throw yourselves into each others arms the feelings i so lately uttered in your presence pandora would have kept you apart if my feelings had been in the least sacred in your eyes if all my surmises had not been too true he took by the hand the weeping pandora and led her to the seat which a little before she had quitted why all this artifice why all this deceit it is said that we are not masters of our own hearts and that no human passion is formed to endure for ever influenced by these maxims i could have pardoned your inconstancy too fair too fickle pandora but why strain every nerve to make me believe you still retained a passion you had discarded to subject me to the lingering torture of deceit instead of communicating to me a truth agonising indeed to human frailty but calculated to inspire fortitude and decision this i cannot excuse this racks me with the bitterest of disappointments disappointment in the virtues i had ascribed to you and convinces me that you are neither worthy of me nor worthy of happiness and you too daubigny you have acted a part in this unworthy plot i rescued you from prison from a dungeon from which a few hours before you had no hope of coming forth alive i took you under my protection when you had no friend i placed you next myself i conceived for you the affection of a brother i loved you next in degree to the mistress of my soul in return for all that i have done and all that i felt for you you have with insidious heart and every base disguise seduced from me the woman of my choice why not frankly and ingenuously have demanded her at my hands the heart is free your reciprocal passion though i might have regretted it i should have been unable to blame it is the cloak that you have drawn over it that proves the baseness of its origin do you think i had not the courage cheerfully and without a murmur to resign to you this illustrious fair one i feel that i was worthy to be openly treated had i seen in you a mutual and ingenuous passion i would not have been the bar to its just consummation i would not have sought the person of a woman whose heart in spite perhaps of her better resolutions was given to another i should loathe myself for ever were i capable of such a part it was the sympathetic sentiment towards me beating in accord to the sentiment of my own bosom that i once saw in pandora and not either her peerless beauties or the excellences i imputed to her mind that formed the master charm which fascinated my soul i feel that i had the force in the negation of my own happiness to have drawn comfort and compensation from the happiness of two creatures i so dearly loved as daubigny and pandora but this alleviation in the midst of what you have condemned me to suffer you have ungenerously denied me i sought to interrupt my son i could no longer bear to see him involved in so painful an error and not exert every nerve to rescue him from it but his passions were wrought higher than mine he would not suffer me to speak be silent daubigny i cannot brook to be interrupted now my heart is full and i must have leave to utter the sentiments that agitate and distend it he advanced towards pandora he took hold of her hand rise madam i shall not long trouble you with the boisterous impetuousness of my passions do not resist me now she rose and followed him her face still covered with her handkerchief and drowned in tears he led her to the front of the alcove he motioned me to approach with his other hand he took hold of mine he seemed to lift pandoras hand to his lips as if to kiss it with a sudden start he put it down again he held it below the level of his breast during this scene pandora and myself were speechless most women in the situation of pandora would i suppose have spoken and have been eager to vindicate themselves from so groundless an imputation but what she did was peculiar to the delicacy and defencelessness of her personal character she was overwhelmed and incapable of effort for my own part my feelings were uncommonly complicated my apparent situation was a plain one the situation of a youth mistaken by his friend for the seducer of the mistress of that friend and had my feelings been merely relative to this situation i could undoubtedly have spoken without embarrassment but with this were involved the sentiments originating in my secret character the sentiments of a man anxious to benefit and who had devoted himself to the interests of another of a father tremblingly alive to the happiness of his son and eager to dive into his soul that he might the more sensibly admire his virtues and with a more enlightened skill secure his fortune i was silent charles de damville proceeded thus said he i join your hands thus i withdraw all my claims upon pandora thus i remove every impediment to your wishes this pandora this daubigny i was capable of if you had treated me honourably and avowed an honest passion you do not know charles de damville you have treated me as none but the most groveling soul could deserve to be treated had you been ingenuous i should have a consolation in what i am doing that now i cannot have i can no longer persuade myself that i am joining two worthy hearts to each other i can no longer relieve the bitterness of my own disappointment by the image of your future felicity may i be mistaken may you be truly happy in each other you cannot be happy beyond the wishes formed in your favour by him who will remember to the latest hour of his existence how much his heart was devoted to you both saying this he burst away from us abruptly and disappeared at first as i listened to the heroic language of my son i asked myself whether it were the expression of a warm heart or a cold one it costs nothing to a cold heart to ape the language of heroism and to pretend to make the greatest sacrifices when its constitution has rendered all effort unnecessary to the feat but i looked in the face of charles and forgot my doubts his voice he had indeed wound up to the tone of his speech it was a little tremulous but in the main firm serious deliberate and elevated but his countenance was the picture of distress there sat enthroned defying all banishment and disguise the anguish of his soul his eye was haggard his complexion was colourless and wan he had been absent several days from presburg his appearance told me that he could scarcely either have eaten or slept during the period of his absence he might talk of the generosity with which he could resign pandora i read in his face what that resignation had cost and would go on to cost him ingenuous noble hearted charles i doubted whether but for a reverse of the events he apprehended he would be able to survive it he had no sooner left us than i applied myself to comfort pandora i swore to her that in spite of every temporary cloud i would yet witness the union of her and her adored chevalier i assured her that i would not rest till i had forced damville to hear me and compelled him to credit the sincerity of my tale how many things were there that in the scene which had just passed i might have urged in answer to damville but respecting which my situation imposed upon me the most rigorous silence i might have said you call yourself my protector my benefactor my patron the real relation between us is the reverse of the picture you have drawn i want not your protection i am qualified if i please to be a patron to all the world i am meditating the most generous things in your behalf this perfidious friend as you deem him has devoted all his thoughts and postponed all his gratifications that he might prove himself substantially and in the most important particulars your friend more than this i might have said i might have said i am your father i have no inclinations no passions contravening your gratification i love you with more than a fathers love i transfer to you all the affection i entertained for your peerless murdered mother all my study is your happiness you are to me the whole world and more than the whole world extensive and singular as are my prerogatives i fold them up i forget them all and think of you alone i cannot give a stronger proof than is contained in what i have here stated of the misery of my condition i was cheated as i have once before remarked with the form of a man but had nothing of the substance i was endowed with the faculty of speech but was cut off from its proper and genuine use i was utterly alone in the world separated by an insurmountable barrier from every being of my species no man could understand me no man could sympathise with me no man could form the remotest guess at what was passing in my breast i had the use of words i could address my fellow beings i could enter into dialogue with them i could discourse of every indifferent thing that the universe contained i could talk of every thing but my own feelings this and not the dungeon of bethlem gabor is the true solitude let no man after me pant for the acquisition of the philosophers stone charles de damville had again left presburg the very instant he quitted the alcove when i inquired for him in the palace i received this afflicting intelligence i did not hesitate a moment in resolving that i would pursue his steps it was of the utmost consequence that i should overtake him all that was most interesting to me hung upon our interview the preparations however of my journey though followed with ardour inevitably reduced me to the being some hours in the rear of my son i was continually in his track but could not come up with him to judge from events you would have supposed that he had as strong a motive to fly as i had to pursue he led me along the course of the danube to the source of that far famed and munificent river i reached the passage of the rhine and was on the point of crossing into alsace but here i lost all notice of charles no enquiry i could make was effectual to procure me the slightest intelligence he had not crossed the river he had proceeded neither to the right nor the left along its banks i was disappointed mortified and distressed what was i to do next could i return to pandora what tale must i relate to this adorable creature whom i had urged to depend upon my exertions could i leave her however to the anguish and uncertainty that must follow upon her hearing no more either from her lover or myself i think i never felt more truly depressed than in this conjuncture most amply most critically did the curse of the opus magnum attend upon my projects and render all my exertions abortive it was the same whether my plans were formed upon a larger or a smaller scale when i endeavoured to live in total obscurity in madrid when i undertook to be the steward and the father of the people of hungary and now that with a chastised ambition i sought what is permitted to all other human creatures to provide for the honourable settlement of my only son still still my evil genius pursued me and blasted every concern in which i presumed to interfere i had intruded between two faithful lovers unfortunate they had been indeed and considerable obstacles were interposed to their felicity but obstacles are commonly found to yield to firmness and constancy and without my fatal interference charles and pandora would one day have been happy if by adverse fates they had hitherto been kept asunder still they understood each other and rejoiced in their mutual confidence and attachment this the consolation of all their sorrows and disappointments it was mine to have destroyed the globe for aught i knew would speedily be interposed between them and here i stood in the middle point like one of those invincible repulsive powers hid in the storehouse of nature forbidding to them all future retrogression to each other chapter xlvii the picture which my distracted fancy thus set before the eye of my mind was not altogether verified in the event after a thousand fruitless inquiries and perquisitions i found to my utter astonishment that charles arresting his career at the town of fribourg had returned upon his steps and sought a second time the metropolis of austrian hungary this was of the class of those events which we sometimes meet with in the world that baffle all calculation and strike us like magic or like madness in their authors i had nothing to do as i conceived on this occasion but to follow the example of my son and like him to resume the route of presburg i yet hoped to witness if not to co operate in the reconciliation of charles and pandora my spirits in this respect were revived and my prospects made brighter by the thoughts that these virtuous and meritorious lovers were at last likely to be once again inclosed within the cincture of the same city add to which my venetian confederate had not yet made his appearance at presburg and not only was i under engagements to give him the meeting there but it was also clear that his errand could not be brought to its proper close without my assistance i once more entered the city to which pandora owed her birth charles de damville had preceded my arrival several days i should without delay have repaired to his apartments but that i found at my own lodgings a letter from benedetto cabriera of venice informing me that he was now in presburg and to avoid all cause for suspicion had taken up his residence in a remote quarter of the town from the enquiries i made i became satisfied that my son had in some degree resumed his usual occupations and that there was no appearance of his again immediately quitting the metropolis i therefore felt my transaction with cabriera more urgent than an immediate conference with charles though i had sought that conference with earnest expedition yet i dreaded it it might require the maturest consideration and the nicest management to render it effectual for the purposes i sought i found from certain intelligence that damville and pandora had yet had no explanation with each other i therefore regarded my exertions for that purpose as a final effort and i was willing that every thing should be in train and the portion of pandora fully adjusted before i entered upon that interesting scene with cabriera i had little difficulty the documents and evidences of his tale we had concerted at venice and i presently found that he told his story so plausibly and supported it so consistently that it was admitted by every one without the smallest suspicion no sooner had cabriera opened his business to the parties to whom the cognisance of it most properly belonged than i once more presented myself to the beautiful and engaging niece of nadasti the instant i entered her apartment i was shocked with the extreme change of her personal appearance all the airiness alertness and vivacity that had once so exquisitely adorned her were gone the roses in her cheek were faded and had given place to a delicate but sickly paleness her arms though always what is called white had before been round and had been distinguished by the purest hue of health they were now emaciated skinny and colourless her eyes were hollow and her eyelids inflamed with weeping all these changes had taken place in about five weeks that had elapsed since i saw her last i was so struck with the sight that i involuntarily started and could scarcely command myself enough to refrain from tears it was plain that she carried an arrow in her bosom which one hand only in the universe could extract with safety as i approached she raised her lovely head that had been depressed with grief and lifted her white arms with an expression of despair come nearer my sweet henry said she i rejoice to see you though you have proved my worst enemy the destroyer of my peace but your intentions my kind boy my brother for such i will still call you have always been good and innocent but ah henry you have deluded me you urged me to banish despair and every day i see more reason to despair i asked if she had not seen the chevalier since his return to presburg it were better for me replied pandora if i had not seen him what has really happened is worse than if i had been denied to see him i have met him every day in the apartments of my aunt to an indifferent eye it would have appeared as if he neither sought nor avoided me he carries himself towards me with a cold and constrained civility but he neither demands an interview nor allows me the opportunity to utter a word to him in private oh daubigny i see too well that i have lost him for ever when he fled my presence when he resolved to seek some distant region cruel as that conduct was it convinced me that i was of some importance to him but now he passes by me in stern neglect he has utterly driven me from his heart indeed my brother this last blow is too much i feel that i shall never recover it and does the chevalier cried i appear at his ease does he exhibit the wonted symptoms of his health and triumphant spirit away too pleasing deluder replied pandora cheat me not with false hopes flatter me not with unreal expectations damville does not appear to be well or happy but you have deceived me too much the disappointments that you prepared for me are too excruciating i feel now at no time so high a degree of gloomy satisfaction and composure as when i press despair firmly to my breast but you henry continued she are probably uninformed of my last and severest misfortune i had a great uncle in the list of the adventurers that achieved the conquest of peru he has died and unexpectedly bequeathed me a fortune that sets the portionless pandora upon a level with the wealthy heiresses of the great palatine himself for a long time want of fortune was the only obstacle that stood between me and all my hopes of happiness now that poverty is no longer an evil to me and wealth no longer desirable i have obtained this unwelcome acquisition you can have no conception how painful a sensation is produced by this mockery the gift of ample possessions to the votary of despair i endeavoured somewhat to encourage pandora but she obstinately rejected my soothings i was the less importunate on this subject as since the return of my son i persisted to persuade myself that i should soon have something more substantial to offer her on his part than mere guesses and conjectures the day after this conversation i boldly sought the presence of the chevalier till then i had since our return to presburg avoided to meet him i now resolved to force from him a hearing to assure him with the most solemn asseverations of my own innocence and the constancy of his mistress to represent to him in how eminent a degree the newly acquired estate of pandora was calculated to facilitate their mutual wishes and finally to offer him any pledge he should desire of the sincerity of my declarations even to the banishing myself from the presence and intercourse of him and the lovely pandora for ever when i saw my son his appearance and air advanced a forcible claim on my compassion i will not now describe them suffice it that they completely proved how true was the sympathy even to the minutest particulars between him and his mistress the difference was only in kind and not in degree hers a defenceless a delicate and truly feminine grief while his amidst all its aggravations had something in it of the champion and the hero when he felt most severely he seemed to disdain himself for what he felt and though his struggles were excruciating he resolutely smoothed his manly front and the loftiness of his spirit produced on his cheek a generous and a settled blush i have just said that i had resolved to force from him a hearing i was mistaken in my calculations on this point dejected as his habits had lately been he no sooner saw me than he advanced towards me with a fierce and imperative demeanour that absolutely startled me how is it man cried he that you are at this hour out of custody custody interdicted and astonished repeated i yes custody if such a wretch as thou art be permitted to go at large what human institution what human possessions shall ever be secure good god said i what am i to understand by your present rage i know that you have considered me as your personal enemy and the underminer of your happiness but when first you accused me of this crime you treated me in a manner less violent and disdainful than that which you now employ i brook not to explain read that letter i received it at fribourg that letter brought me back from the confines of france to the spot where now we meet i took up the letter its contents were nearly as follow letter my dear friend you will permit me to call you so since to me and me only you have recently thought proper to confide your projects and your unfortunate passion for the charming pandora what you related to me on the subject convinced me how much she was unworthy of your love and how basely she has conducted herself towards you yet you will yourself feel some compassion for her when you learn who it is upon whom she has bestowed this unmerited preference know then that this wretched daubigny is no other than the notorious chatillon the infamous impostor who by his machinations about a year ago preserved the turkish provinces of hungary from being conquered by the christian arms the man is moreover a magician the pretended or real possessor of the philosophers stone he is therefore doubly worthy of death first as a traitor the abettor and comforter of the common enemy of the christian faith and secondly as a dealer in the black art and a man notoriously sold and delivered over to the devil i have received this information from the most unquestionable authority a soldier in my old corps who has lately escaped from a turkish prison no sooner saw him than he identified his person i happened to be near the fellow at the moment when by an unexpected exclamation he betrayed his discovery it immediately struck me that the circumstance might be of importance to your interests and therefore taking the soldier aside i charged him not to mention to any one what he had observed to render his secrecy the more secure i have since removed him to a garrison at some distance from presburg and i have myself mentioned the circumstance to no living creature that i might first receive your instructions on the subject and act in all respects concerning it as you shall judge proper the blackness of the character of the man sets all exaggeration at defiance this very individual whom you liberated from the bowels of the earth who by the most treacherous arts won your confidence and upon whom you lavishly heaped every imaginable distinction was all the while conscious to himself that he was the character that of all that live you hated most in one word the renegado chatillon he acted consistently with his preceding conduct and his recent disingenuousness when he seduced from you the affections of the woman of your choice i am concerned to add that on the very day that i made this discovery this chatillon daubigny disappeared from presburg nor can i by any effort learn whither he is gone it is impossible he should have been informed by any human means of the detection that had happened but indeed it is vain to attempt to form any reasonable conjecture respecting a character so mysterious and inexplicable your devoted friend andrew count of bathori well sir seeing i had finished the perusal and what have you now to allege when i saw you simply as the favoured lover of pandora however treacherous and dishonourable i might deem your conduct towards me i quitted the field i did not trust myself to be a judge in my own cause i did not confide in my estimate of your unworthiness when i was myself wholly concerned i had some time before received an invitation from the duke daumale who was collecting a number of generous and high spirited nobles to accompany mary queen of scots to the barbarous fields of her native realm i at first declined i now accepted the invitation i set out for paris to join him i found that letter waiting my arrival at fribourg and i returned deeply as pandora has sunk in my esteem i determined i would never allow her to be thrown away upon the infamous chatillon you haunt my steps i heard of you again and again on my route as i returned from fribourg i arrive at presburg and presently after you again make your appearance what further villanies have you to act what new treacheries have you devised against me this morning i consented to the representations of count bathori and agreed that you should be delivered up to justice why then are you not in custody when i consider the mystery and inscrutableness of your character i am lost in conjecture you are said to be a magician a dealer in the unhallowed secrets of alchymy and the elixir vit in cases like this all the ordinary rules of human sagacity and prudence are superseded the wisest man is a fool and the noblest spirit feels the very ground he stood on struck from under his feet how can i know that the seduction of pandoras affections is not owing to magical incantations who in that case is rather an object for compassion than for censure how can i tell that the fraternal resemblance borne by your features to my own and the sudden and ardent partiality that rose in my breast when first i saw you have not been produced by the most detested arts magic dissolves the whole principle and arrangement of human action subverts all generous enthusiasm and dignity and renders life itself loathsome and intolerable this is to me the most painful of all subjects i had a father whom i affectionately loved he became the dupe of these infernal secrets i had a mother the paragon of the creation that father murdered her all the anguish i ever felt has derived its source from alchymy and magic while the infamous chatillon thus stands before me i feel all the long forgotten wounds of my heart new opened and the blood bursting afresh from every vein i have rested and been at peace and now the red and venomed plague that tarnished the years of my opening youth returns to blast me begone infamous thrice damned villain and let me never see thee more wretch that you are continued charles for he saw me motioning to withdraw i felt that all further expostulation and discussion on my part was useless wretch that you are what is it that you are about to do think no to escape my vengeance in the midst of all the tumultuous passions you waken in my breast i still feel in myself the soldier and the man of honour i am not a thief taker or a bailiff you are within my power and that is your present protection i will not now deliver you up to the justice of the state but will hurl against you my personal defiance i am willing to meet you man to man i thirst to encounter you as my worst and most mortal foe who has perpetrated against me the basest injuries and excited in my bosom the most hateful sensations though you were fenced with all the legions of hell i fear you not and seeing that after all that is past you have once again intruded into my presence i here bind myself by all that is sacred to pursue you to the death what could i answer to such an attack i saw at once that the case as to all future harmony between me and my son was desperate and irremediable what hope could i entertain further what had hitherto been the result of our ill fated intercourse every offence and prejudice that can gall the human mind had been brought forward in it in turn i had wounded damville in the most sensible point of private life and had blasted his hopes there where he stored them all i had offended his most rooted political prepossessions by aiding the turk and feeding a nation that perished with hunger i was an equivocal character assuming different names and wandering over the world with different pretences last of all i had revived in his mind the images of his father and his mother all that had once been most dear and now was most painful to his recollection and had tortured his fancy with nameless horrors these sentiments could never be removed all the explanations in the world could never reconcile me to his mind and i felt that i had that within which in what was to come as it had in what was past must for ever annihilate all confidence between us at once therefore i accepted his challenge arranged with him the terms of a hostile encounter on the following morning and immediately after bid adieu to presburg and to the sight of every soul contained within its walls for ever this is i powerfully feel the last adventure that i shall ever have the courage to commit to writing a few minutes more and i will lay down my pen and resolve in the most solemn and sacred manner never to compose another line indeed all other adventures must necessarily be frigid and uninteresting compared with that which i have now described great god what a fate was mine anxious as i had been to prove myself in the most momentous respects the benefactor of my son dismissing all other thoughts and cares from my mind journeying with this sole object in view from presburg to venice and from venice to presburg from hungary to the banks of the rhine and from the banks of the rhine back again to hungary the whole scene was now terminated by a declaration on his part that nothing could appease the animosity he cherished against me short of rioting in the blood of his fathers heart i was reduced to the necessity either of lifting my sword against my son of running myself upon the point of his weapon or of forfeiting the engagement between us and suffering him to brand me as a coward in the face of christendom i mention not this because the variety of objects of choice produced in me the slightest hesitation weary as i was of life i could cheerfully have consented to die but not to stain the sword of charles de damville with my vital blood i prevented him from being the assassin of his fathers life i could not prevent him from being the assassin of his fathers character he was assiduous and indefatigable in spreading against me the blackest invectives which he regarded as the most unerring truths all hungary has resounded for thirty years with the atrocities of the sieur de chatillon what is here recorded contains the whole and unvarnished truth on the subject this narrative however shall never see the light till the melancholy hour when charles de damville shall be no more yet in the midst of the anguish the disappointment of every cherished hope which rends my soul i have one consolation and that an invaluable one in the virtues the glory and the happiness of my son i said i would forget every gratification and sentiment of my own in him i am now more than ever instigated to do so when i quitted presburg i left cabriera behind me in that city and i took care to obtain a parting interview with him he afterwards gave me the meeting as we then concerted at trieste in the duchy of carniola it happened as i had flattered myself the event would prove that the visible source of umbrage being removed charles and pandora in no long time came to a mutual understanding and were finally made happy in each other i had been the fortunate means of supplying to this excellent and incomparable creature the only defect under which she laboured a want of fortune her uncle having no longer a pretence to oppose their mutual passion united their hands and at the time of which i am speaking they were regarded as the most graceful and accomplished couple in the whole hungarian dominions the chevalier de damville is considered in that country as the great bulwark of the christian frontier and the most generous and illustrious pupil in the school of the bayards and the scanderbegs cabriera worn out with years and fatigues but still grasping and avaricious to his latest hour expired in my arms in the city of trieste and by his death yielded me this contentment that henceforth the only obvious means for detecting my beneficent fraud in securing the dower of pandora was for ever removed that the reader may enter the more fully into my sentiment of congratulation upon the happiness of my son and rise from the perusal of my narrative with a more soothing and pleasurable sensation i will here shortly recapitulate the good qualities that had been unfolded in this truly extraordinary young man from his earliest infancy he was a child only nine years of age at the period of the truly affecting and exemplary behaviour the reader may remember him to have displayed while i was at paris squandering the property of my family at the gaming table in the alienation of mind produced in me by that dreadful catastrophe he was my constant attendant my careful nurse and my affectionate friend when twelve months after we were driven by our calamities out of switzerland and i lay extended to all human appearance on the bed of death charles was the comforter of his mother the friend of his sisters and even young as he was contributed to the maintenance of my starving family by the labour of his infant hands at dresden as yet no more than seventeen years of age he was assailed by one of the severest trials with which the mind of man can in any case be beset but he hesitated not a moment obliged to choose between poverty and innocence with the sacrifice of all his habitudes and the loss of every friend on the one side and wealth new to his enjoyment with ignominy or an equivocal character on the other his determination was instant and unalterable cast at so immature an age alone and portionless upon the world he almost immediately by his gallantry his winning qualities and his virtues gained to himself a friend in one of the greatest captains of the age unaided by the brilliancy of family or fortune he acquired the character of the bravest soldier in hungary where all were brave this last trial to which i had been the undesigning means of subjecting him was none of the least arduous love often entails imbecility on the noblest of mankind but charles surmounted the most perilous attacks of this all conquering passion when he thought pandora unworthy he tore himself from her and would not admit a struggle when he believed she loved another he disdained to claim a heart that seemed alienated from him and himself joined the hands of his mistress and his rival he might have died he could not disgrace himself i was the heros father but no i am not blinded by paternal partiality but no he was indeed what i thought him as near the climax of dignity and virtue as the frailty of our nature will admit his virtue was at length crowned with the most enviable reward the earth has to boast the faithful attachment of a noble minded and accomplished woman i am happy to close my eventful and somewhat melancholy story with so pleasing a termination whatever may have been the result of my personal experience of human life i can never recollect the fate of charles and pandora without confessing with exultation that this busy and anxious world of ours yet contains something in its stores that is worth living for the end footnotes to this story in the book from which i have quoted it is subjoined the following reference mmoires historiques tom i p being desirous of giving my extract from the oldest authority i caused the british museum and the libraries of oxford and cambridge to be searched for this publication but in vain the story and the reference are not improbably both of

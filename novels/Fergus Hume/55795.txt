geary's accusation xxiv the gods are just the sealed message chapter i a queer fish it was a sultry july afternoon and in the azure arch of the firmament flamed an unclouded sun the corn was ripening to a rich yellow in some meadows and the newly mown hay in others was being piled on lumbering wains by perspiring laborers the red earth of the sunken lanes was caked and their blossoming hedges were burnt up by the merciless heat under spreading foliage or knee deep in rapidly drying pools stood weary cattle switching lazy tails to brush away the teasing flies honey bees ostentatiously industrious buzzed noisily from flower to flower and the sleepy birds twittered faintly midst the grateful shade of leaves the land was parched for want of rain and the languid hours dragged on slowly to the wished for evening on some such day long ago must elijah have sent his servant up the mount to watch for the growing of the small black cloud only by the trout stream was the weather endurable for the overhanging trees made the atmosphere of translucent green deliciously cool yet here and there spears of dazzling light pierced through the emerald twilight to smite the waters these moved smoothly in amber floods between the grassy banks and in places swirled pearly white round moss grown stones the stream brawled over pebbles gushed through granite rifts and gloomed mysteriously in deep and silent pools gleaming mirror like under exposed tree trunks may flies dipped to the waters swallows darted through the warm air and kingfishers glanced here and there each a flash of blue fire and ever the river talked to the voiceless woods as it babbled seawards from the woods came no reply for the wind had died away and the tongues of multitudinous leaves could no longer speak had they been able even to whisper they surely would have rebuked the gay spirits of the two young men who had invaded their sacred solitude this is simply ripping murmured one who lay on his back with a battered panama over his eyes we are doing ourselves up to the top hole i don't think heavenly ain't it it would be if you did not chatter retorted the other fixing a fly on his line why do you desecrate this beauty with slang because i'm not a poet like you to spout blank verse there is a medium between mutilation of the language and pedantic usage thereof huh with scorn who's pedantic now my dear tod as a lawyer you should use better english it is only a barrister who requires a superfine jaw retorted tod elegantly and i'm only a solicitor of sorts don't worry haskins aware of the futility of argument the other man merely shrugged his square shoulders and threw a skilful line in a pool wherein lurked a famous wary trout the fly fell lightly on the water and would have deceived any fish but the trout in question there was no response to his dilly duck come and be killed invitation and the angler made another cast with still less success as the fly hit the stream heavily scaring the trout into retreat haskins said one word under his breath but tod overheard and giggled that was exactly like tod macandrew he had no sense of the fitness of things silly ass commented his friend savagely spinning up the line you frighten the fish not on to your hook anyhow chuckled tod into the depths of his hat what a sinfully bad angler you are jerry as bad an angler as you are a lover perhaps snapped gerald throwing his rod on the grass and squatting to manufacture a cigarette tod sat up abruptly with a wounded air i call that beastly to taunt a chap because a girl won't bite won't kiss you mean i'm taking an illustration from your infernal angling said tod with aggressive dignity if you were a lover yourself you would understand oh i understand well enough replied the other lightly he paused to run his tongue along the tissue paper then added calmly i was in love with charity bird myself before you came along tod well now that i have come along perhaps you'll call her miss bird right oh miss bird in the hand is worth two there are not two interrupted macandrew indignantly but only one schoolgirl cousin as if cried tod to the woods i would sell myself gerald haskins cast a sly look on tod's ungraceful figure i see you present yourself to miss bird as a desirable gift well she wouldn't have you as a gift anyhow for all your family herald good looks and halfpenny journal fame notoriety tod notoriety only a volume of verse a book of stories and a dozen of essays do not give me the right to class myself along with the immortals i'm a failure at thirty tod in my own eyes i mean think of that tod a failure at thirty don't chuck it advised macandrew politely you may be a success at forty that won't compensate me for coming grey hairs and inevitable wrinkles said the other bitterly and smoked in dour silence tod crossed his legs and held forth gerald wentworth julian haskins he remarked solemnly all the fairies came to your nasty little cradle with gifts save the one who could have endowed you with gratitude consider your beastly good looks and abominably healthy constitution and silly popularity not to speak of your undeserved five hundred a year private income and take shame to yourself why with half your advantages i could marry charity to morrow h'm the advantages you mention were practically offered to her but she didn't seem to desire possession i expect she prefers the last representative of an ancient scots family with an embarrassed estate a reputation as a rising solicitor and a heart of gold enshrined in an agreeable looking body agreeable looking words failed tod and he sprang up to wreath a strong arm round gerald's neck haskins remonstrated as well as he could for laughter but was forced to the very verge of the bank here tod made him look into the mirror of the still pool below caliban and ferdinand apollo and vulcan count d'orsay and john wilkes growled macandrew look at this picture and at that you blighter almost choking for tod was powerful and none too gentle in his grip gerald humored his friend sufficiently to stare into the water glass thinking meanwhile of a near revenge he saw his own handsome brown face with bronze colored hair and mustache of the same hue curling under a straight greek nose which divided two hazel eyes he saw also macandrew's round ruddy countenance devoid of hair on chin and lips and cheeks but haloed with crisp red curls suggestive of his foxy nickname tod assuredly could not be called good looking with freckles and wide mouth and aquiline nose proof of high descent but so much good humor and genuine honesty gleamed from his sea blue eyes that he did himself a gross injustice in undervaluing a most ingratiating appearance tod was tod when all was said and done the best fellow in the world and the most unnecessarily modest but haskins was not going to pander to tod's desire for compliments you footling idiot he breathed possessed by a spirit of mischief as if you weren't worth a dozen of me talk about ingratitude you shall be punished my friend thus and souse into the pool they went when tod got his breath again after some spluttering he used it to a bad purpose gerald keeping himself afloat watched the stout little man climb the bank dripping like an insane river god and heard him excel himself in language which he could scarcely have used in court i'll pay you out for this swore tod hastily stripping off his wet flannels and haskins fearing his righteous wrath swam upstream clothes and all with light easy strokes laughing until the woods rang what about your confounded fish sang out macandrew when his apparel was drying in the hot sun and he was sitting unashamed amid the grass you won't catch any more i haven't caught any as it is shouted gerald swimming back i want to come ashore pax toddy pax you you unclothed biped wait till i get you here cried tod shaking his fist he is not wise who ventures into the enemy's camp quoth haskins and crossed to the opposite bank of the stream owing to the heat he had earlier shed all his clothing save a silk shirt and a pair of flannel trousers so there was not much left to dry in a few minutes he also was sitting in adamic simplicity on the farther shore imploring tod to throw over a tobacco pouch and a pipe but tod wouldn't and smoked chuckling on his side of the stream while haskins remonstrated i'll sleep then announced gerald seeing that his efforts to soften macandrew were unavailing no don't shouted tod i want to talk about her not a word unless i get my smoke here you are then and macandrew threw across the necessary materials for the pipe of peace now then he cried and the woods rang with his cry what am i to do about charity marry her cried back haskins lighting his briar and after that introduction the conversation resolved itself into high pitched talking from bank to bank while the stream rippled between it was lucky that no one was within hearing as the young men well knew for tod shouted out his dearest secrets to the wide world how can i marry her bellowed macandrew lying on his stomach in the attitude of caliban reflecting on setebos she hasn't any money and i have very little also there is the dowager to be considered the dowager was lady euphemia macandrew tod's highly respected grandmother who had looked after him since his parents had died she wanted tod to marry an heiress cousin who was still at school and tod wished for his wife a charming dancer who was absolutely proper and extremely pretty consequently tod and lady euphemia were fighting with all the ardor of their fiery race and the domestic peace of the house of macandrew was a thing of the past you should consider the dowager sang out haskins who knew and approved of the grim old lady she's your grandmother no one denies that yelled tod crossly talk sense hear then the sense of gerald son of his father shouted the other in a high tenor mrs pelham odin who is as you know the clever old actress who looks after charity won't let you marry her seeing that you have no money lady euphemia is equally opposed to the match because charity is not born as the french say if you marry against the wishes of these two mrs pelham odin won't leave charity her savings which must be considerable and lady euphemia won't speak either to you or to your wife isn't this the case ancient history ancient history roared macandrew like an angry bull but your advice jerry chuck charity and marry your cousin said haskins tersely i won't then why waste my time in asking for advice which you have no notion of taking go on your own silly way tod and don't blame me if you tumble into a quagmire of troubles i believe you want to marry charity yourself shouted tod angrily no i don't cried haskins feeling if his garments were dry she is all that one can desire in the way of beauty but i want something more than a picture wife marriages are made in heaven and charity's soul does not respond to mine tod rose sulkily and dressed himself when clothed again he took up the discarded rod to try his luck i love her he boomed and cast his fly with the air of a man who has brought forward an unanswerable argument perhaps he had for macandrew was as obstinate as a battery mule seeing that tod's attention was taken up with a peaceful sport which precluded retaliation for the late ducking gerald made his trousers and shirt into a ball and flung them deftly across the river they hit tod fairly and made him stagger and swear what he would have said or done it is impossible to say for at this moment he proclaimed with a triumphant yell that he had a bite and at this moment gerald slipped into the water again hang it don't screamed macandrew you'll frighten the fish off the hook woosh come up and tod tugged hard while the rod bent to an arc mighty big fish breathed the angler don't believe it's a fish at all spluttered haskins seeing that the line remained stationary you're making no play caught a weed maybe he swam to the line and dived under while macandrew danced and swore on the bank leave it alone leave it alone cried tod in high wrath it's a big fish oh beast oh animal oh jealous reptile he went on as the line slackened you've done it even as he spoke gerald rose to the surface spitting water from his mouth in his right hand he held an object which he flung on to the bank and then crawled up himself there's your fish tod he said rolling on the grass to dry himself your hook caught in that cylinder which had got wedged between two big stones look at it while i dress tod handled the cylinder gingerly it was made of tin and had apparently been covered with brown paper for the remains of this clung loose at either end from under splotches of red sealing wax oddly enough there was also a string tied to the cylinder at the end of which dangled the remnant of a bladder evidently the bladder had borne up the somewhat heavy cylinder for a certain time and then had burst to drop it toward the big stones amid which it had been wedged when tod's hook had caught it look's like a parcel of dynamite said tod in a nervous tone poachers fishing by night with dynamite o lord haskins who was slipping on his socks and shoes looked up it's been in the water a good time anyhow judging from the rotten brown paper and that decayed bladder there's no chance of an explosion if you are afraid to open it chuck it over no macandrew dropped on to the grass beside his friend we'll go to kingdom come together if necessary lend me your knife between them the young men prized off the lid of the cylinder with some difficulty for it fitted tightly the contents proved to be as puzzling as the vessel itself for gerald drew out a moderately long roller covered with brown wax and scored delicately with regular lines almost invisible there was nothing else in the cylinder but this roller and tod eyed it with wonderment what the deuce is it he asked twirling it round haskins pinched his nether lip and reflected it's a phonograph record he ventured to suggest see the marking tod and the wax and here he tilted the cylinder end uppermost there's a name engraved on the butt plainly for all the world to see jekle co read tod fitting in his eye glass to see clearly h'm i never heard of the firm that's not improbable your knowledge of many things being limited oh come now did you ever hear of the firm your own conceited self no but it's a firm that makes phonographs anyhow gerald slipped the treasure trove into his pocket we'll take this back to the inn and see what it means we shall have to get a phonograph then that goes without the speaking you bally ass but when we do slip this roller into its parent machine these marks will talk but how can we get a parent machine i suppose you mean a jekle co mechanism of sorts there must be a machine of that sort in the district or this roller wouldn't be here tod stared at the waters blinking in the sunshine i wonder how it got into the blessed river by accident or by design by design assuredly said haskins promptly it was wrapped in brown paper and sealed at both ends the bladder was attached to keep it afloat then the bladder went bang and the cylinder sank until you fished it out toddy queer fish and queer chance anyhow there is no such thing as chance said haskins slowly some cause we know not of brought us to the stream to day to get the cylinder why we only came holiday making protested tod you are always talking this infernal psychology supernal psychology you mean retorted the other seeing that i follow white magic and not black this he patted his pocket has a meaning we must learn that meaning and so get into trouble perhaps haskins shrugged his shoulders but trouble is the sole thing which urges us to rise tod groaned he could not understand his friend's mystical way of looking at the seen world through the unseen keeping the conversation on an ordinary level he inquired why was the cylinder set afloat why does the sun shine why does the fire burn you ask too many questions tod i am not likely to get an answer from you snapped macandrew taking up the impedimenta which they had brought to the river bank you will in this instance my son the record when it talks through the jekle co machine will tell us why the cylinder was sent downstream shipwrecked people throw bottles overboard with documents to tell of their danger as you well know h'm it's the first time i ever heard of a phonograph record being used to convey news grunted tod crossly the person who floated the cylinder is evidently up to date perhaps it's a blessed joke maybe anyhow i'll take it to the inn and learn as much as is possible don't chatter about it though why not because because haskins hesitated not being able to express himself with his usual decision i can't say anyhow hold your tongue until we know what the record has to say macandrew nodded and the two walked homeward chapter ii the message the devon maid was a tumbledown inn and the center of denleigh village which lay more or less concealed among the folds of fertile hills down the valley prattled a shallow stream and the comparatively few cottages forming the secluded hamlet were placed confusedly on either side each having its own tiny garden a broad stone bridge of cyclopean build spanned the brook in one low arch across this ran the highway which gave access to the interior world for it dipped down one hill and after passing over the bridge ascended the other on its way inland to even more remote villages near the bridge in question stood the two story inn built of rugged stone hewn into huge blocks and roofed with curved red tiles the whole overgrown with ivy and wisteria and many colored roses with three narrow windows above and two narrow windows with a moderately wide door below the house looked sullen and secretive one could have an adventure at such a hostel it breathed the spirit of romance and cut throat trapdoor romance at that before the inn stood a horse trough in front of the door the two rude benches under the windows but those who frequented the devon maid preferred to take their beer mugs and bovine conversation on to the bridge it was their rialto whereon they met in the cool of the evening to discuss the doings of their small world and such news as might filter into the isolated villages through carriers and tourists and newspapers the population of denleigh consisted almost wholly of agricultural laborers and their wives a slow thinking lot with infinitely more muscle than brains both men and women were of great stature and even their children looked bulky and overgrown for their age it seemed as though the children of anak had gathered to design a new tower of babel the room in which haskins and macandrew sat at dinner was small with a low ceiling and one inefficient window smothered with curtains it was crowded with early victorian furniture of the most cumbersome and inelegant description table and chairs sofa and sideboard bookcase and desk were all of solid mahogany deposited on a flowery kidderminster carpet somewhat worn antimacassars adorned the horsehair chairs wax fruit under a glass shade embellished the sideboard and green glass ornaments with dangling prisms appeared on either side of the black marble clock which disfigured the mantelpiece on the faded pattern of a prussian blue wall paper were steel engravings representing the death of nelson and the meeting of wellington and blucher after waterloo together with colored hunting scenes and illustrations from the book of beauty and the keepsake there were also samplers and a fender stool and a canary in a gilt cage and a cupboard of inferior china and two screens of worsted work representing parrots and macaws the apartment was stuffy and unwholesome and more like a curiosity shop than a place to dine in the young men had changed to easy smoking suits and were doing full justice to an admirable meal consisting of roast beef with vegetables superfine apple pie devonshire cream and first rate stilton they drank cider out of compliment to the county and knew that when eating was at an end two fragrant cups of coffee would add to the enjoyment of their after dinner pipes and this satisfactory state of things was presided over by a stout and genial waiter who was as black as the dress clothes he wore in honor of the guests a bull in a china shop would not have seemed much more out of keeping than was this negro in the heart of the devon hills how he had drifted into such a locality heaven only knows but he appeared exotic and strange like some tropical bird which had flown from equatorial regions to make a nest in cool gray misty england adonis geary was the incongruous name of the man and he was at once landlord and waiter save that he possessed but one eye there was nothing unpleasant in his looks and from his constant smiling and ready service he appeared to be of an amiable disposition for over fifteen years so he told his guests he had owned the inn and also had married a six foot girl from barnstaple who was as meek as she was tall this oddly matched pair had five or six coffee colored children who tumbled about the small house and made it lively the mnage was unusual to say least of it and like the inn itself the presence of the negro hinted at romance and mystery as yet haskins had said nothing about the phonograph some instinct told him to be silent about the discovery of the cylinder before this suave son of ham although he had absolutely no reason to mistrust the man all the same he intended to use geary's wits to obtain a jekle co phonograph in such a way as would not arouse suspicion concerning the particular use he intended to put it to yet why suspicions should be aroused by frankness gerald could not say for on the face of it there was nothing to point out that the cylinder was dangerous nevertheless haskins' sixth sense made him hold his tongue and impose secrecy upon tod consequently macandrew held his peace while gerald cautiously approached his aim of getting the machine it seemed incredible that a phonograph of the special make required should be found in that unpretentious inn or even in the village itself seeing how buried both were still haskins argued from the discovery of the roller so marked that a jekle co phonograph was to be had in the district being a novelist gerald had already spun a web of romance round the adventure and was conducting the same to a close with constructive skill tod watched the progress of this real and tangible romance with careless interest he thought that it was all moonshine and would end in smoke the story of a mare's nest tod called it with fine irony and giggled when haskins stalked mr adonis geary there is very little to do in the evening here began gerald finishing the last of his cheese and addressing the landlord waiter very little sah replied mr geary who spoke moderately good anglo saxon yet betrayed his negro origin in an occasional word and by a guttural intonation but you can walk to silbury with the odder jemplem for howlin' fun sah howling fun in a country town my eyes muttered tod still eating dere's walking and de bicycle and fishin' and yes yes yes broke in gerald artfully but i mean evening amusement indoor doings what you call parlor tricks interpolated macandrew exactly well mr geary have you a piano or a harmonium dere's a harmonium in de chapel whar i preach explained adonis doubtfully but de instrument of de lawd no good for debble's singing i have no intention of going to the devil for my amusement said gerald tartly while tod choked over his cider have you any cards dem's de debble's pictures sah then pass along a concertina remarked tod pushing back his chair with a sigh of repletion or even a jew's harp or a why not say a phonograph while you're about it macandrew said haskins with feigned crossness we're as likely to find the one as the other in this place at the back of beyond with great respect mr haskins sah said geary falling into the trap promptly dere's my wife's phonograph my wife hannah let you hab dat phonograph to hear de godly hymns just what i want to hear said gerald untruthfully but what on earth made you get a phonograph geary smiled expansively displaying magnificent teeth dere was a traveler who came dis way wid phonographs and he stop here he so pleased wid my wife hannah's cooking dat he gave her de phonograph and den sell many many many all round all round and the landlord stretched his arms to embrace the globe what kind of a phonograph is it asked gerald with a triumphant look at tod to bid him watch how romance was working golden threads into the gray fabric of the commonplace i don't want to hear a bad one before geary could reply there sounded through the window an up to date note from the outer world the toot toot toot of a motor horn brought the young men to their feet and to the window which looked out on to the bridge a motor car draws the attention of the grown up as much as a military band attracts the notice of a child mr geary departed with dignified haste to see what new and aristocratic visitor was coming and since tod's bulky form filled in the whole small window gerald followed at his leisure the coming of the motor car stirred up the same bustle in this lonely inn as did the mail coach in the days of old even mrs geary emerged from the back kitchen to view the spectacle with three small children clinging to her lengthy skirts like the lilliputians to gulliver's coat tails toot toot toot the horn sounded cheerfully and close at hand a magnificent hadrian scarlet as the sunset swung down the long descent and hummed across the bridge with a powerful drone there were two men in front disguised in the orthodox goggles and caps and shapeless coats but the body of the car was empty save for a large portmanteau and some small parcels done up in brown paper the rustics crowded round the car to comment thereon and to misname it a steam engine while the foremost man who was handling the steering gear slipped from his seat to stretch himself and to salute geary hello adonis is that you he said nodding brusquely i want a wash and a glass of brandy then i'm off again i must reach leegarth before sundown come dis way major said the landlord obsequiously he seemed to know the traveler extremely well and from his concluding remark gerald was positive that he did dere's a lil' glass of your own pertic'ler brandy major dis way sah glad to see you major major from the title and the tone of the arrival's voice haskins had an idea that he also knew the owner of the motor car when the goggles were shoved up over the cap and the high collar of the coat was loosened suspicion became certainty major rebb said haskins advancing a step i guessed it was you oh haskins drawled the newcomer and gerald could have sworn that not only did he start but that he darted an inquiring look at the negro landlord it was geary who replied dis jemplem and his friend dey stop wid me for one two week major the major recovered himself yes of course what am i thinking about haskins mrs crosbie told me that you and macandrew were on a walking tour in devonshire why are you stationary here of all places why not here as well as anywhere else replied gerald carelessly we struck this inn tod and i that is and intended only to stop a night or so but the food is so good and the fishing so capital and the expenses so small that we decided to remain we're off in a couple of days tod goes back to london and i make for st ives to write a new book but you major what are you doing in this galley i have come down to see a relative at leegarth an elderly aunt tod sniggered at the window from what he knew of major rebb and he knew a great deal from club gossip that retired officer was not the man to waste his time in looking after elderly relatives unless how much money has she got asked tod impudently rebb laughed for tod was a licensed jester and said things without reproof for which other men would have been kicked enough to make it worth my while to come down here said rebb coolly but i won't give the business into your hands tod so there will be no pickings i'm jolly well sure of that when you're about retorted macandrew in a soft voice dis way sah cried geary like a parrot dis way major you know adonis then said rebb entering the inn followed by haskins he's a decent sort isn't he i have put up here sometimes for a night where's the brandy adonis hurry up and give my man a glass of beer gerald had unconsciously led the way to the sitting room occupied by himself and tod here rebb sat down drawing off his gloves while the brandy was brought he was a tall thin upright man eminently well bred and somewhat stiff his closely clipped hair and well trimmed moustache were so dark and his complexion was of such a deep olive color that people declared that he had in him a touch of the tar brush and the scandal was emphasized by the significant fact that major rebb had commanded a west indian regiment in jamaica before retiring from the army but whether tainted by the african or not he certainly was a handsome man and wonderfully well preserved for his fifty years mrs crosbie to whom rebb had alluded when first addressing haskins was a wealthy widow who greatly admired the fascinating major report hinted at a match between them and report said that mrs crosbie might do worse for rebb was well off and much respected by the outside world those of whom tod was one who knew more than the major approved of declared that rebb's character was not without blemish and that he gambled both on the turf and on the green table but no one could positively say that the man was a rascal he had the vices of his generation that was all while rebb drank his brandy he told haskins and macandrew the latest club gossip and stated not without a roguish glance at tod that mrs pelham odin wanted charity to marry a titled fool who had lately come into much money tod was very indignant at this and said many things which rebb had heard before since the little man's infatuation was an open secret in the middle of his eloquence the major went off to wash his hands and face and haskins dragged his friend out to see the start of the car in five minutes rebb was in his place and his chauffeur swung up alongside good night you fellows cried the major amiably i'll see you in london night adonis and then the car spun round the curve to mount the hill on its way to leegarth wherever that might be tod yawned and sauntered back into the inn hinting that he would go to bed soon funny thing that we should meet rebb here said gerald tod raised his thick red eyebrows upon my soul i don't see it he remarked you don't want the whole country to yourself he seemed to be startled when he saw me and he knows geary well he admitted that he knew geary and as to being startled he well might be dropping across a pal in these wilds i am not a pal of rebb's said gerald stiffly i don't like him and i'm very sorry that such a jolly little woman as mrs crosbie should think of marrying him there's something queer about him bosh said tod lightly whiffing away his friend's suspicions which indeed had little foundation rebb is no worse nor no better than any other man we all have turned down pages in our life's book which we should like no one to read that's quite a high flight of oratory for you said haskins dryly oh i can gas as well as most when necessary retorted the other but you are asinine seeing a bird in every bush h'm murmured gerald unconvinced all the same i shall keep my eye on major rebb and so take a lot of trouble for nothing so long as he does not cross your path i don't see why you should worry hello tod had entered the sitting room by this time here's the phonograph he examined it narrowly in the failing light and jekle co at that by gum what do you say now cried haskins pleased that his surmise had proved correct i'll bet that we are on the verge of discovering a mystery wait until we hear a few hymns and then we can experiment with our river record but why bother about the hymns grumbled macandrew who by this time was quite as curious as haskins himself gerald glanced at the door and closed it i don't want the nigger to think that anything unusual has happened more suspicion said tod and glanced in his turn but at the window you needn't fash yourself as we say in scotland there's geary walking down to the village it was indeed the negro strolling with a crony along the brookside and when he had sauntered out of earshot haskins did not worry about the hymn tunes he slipped the cylinder record on to the machine and set the thing going then for the next minute he and tod listened in amazement to a message from fairyland this to the wide world babbled the machine in the sweetest and most melodious of voices this to the fairy prince who will come and waken me from dreams come dear prince to the pixy's house and watch that the jealous ogress who guards me does not see you i cannot read i cannot write but i talk my message to you dear prince to the stream i commit the message on this first day of april in this year five may the river bear the message to you dear prince come to me come to me come to me and waken your princess to life with a kiss the machine still continued to work but the voice became abruptly silent there was no more of the message so when the point of the phonograph reached the end of the inscribed wax gerald removed it when it was again in his pocket he turned toward the amazed tod what do you think of that he demanded triumphantly i think that the date explains the whole thing said tod grimly see the first of april five that means nineteen hundred and five which is this very year some one's having a joke i don't believe it said haskins and began to scribble in his pocketbook what the machine had said he had a good memory and reproduced the message from the fairy princess very correctly later he determined to verify the same but meanwhile kept the precious roller in his pocket and asserted his determination to search for the pixy's house what bosh grumbled tod disdainfully maybe there's no such place but if you will be a lunatic ask geary about the matter no said gerald decidedly i shall not say a word to geary and i must ask you to say nothing either this is the first piece of romance which has come my way and i don't want it spoiled by sharing it with other people my way echoed macandrew staring i like that you forget that i found the cylinder my son i am the person who is supposed to have received the letter toddy you are not a turk or a mormon so this delicious princess who speaks like a silver bell is not for you keep to charity bird and allow me a chance of finding a wife o lord jerry you ain't serious yes and no after all i am young and as the cook said of that 'appy disposition that i can love any one why shouldn't i seek in some fairy woods for the sleeping beauty sleeping sniggered tod lighting his pipe then she must have written that silly message in her sleep or perhaps she talks in it he added recollecting that the message was a spoken one a nice wife to have upon my word you won't get a wink of sleep toddy you are of the earth earthy and an unimaginative beast romance doesn't appeal to you i shall search for the pixy's house in what direction jeered macandrew up the stream this princess is apparently imprisoned in the house and must have flung the cylinder therefrom into the water ergo the pixy's house must be near the water i shall go to exeter and bring back a canoe then i shall explore and find a mare's nest don't be an ass it's all bosh it's romance romance romance but not a word toddy either to any one here or to any one in london promise oh i promise but silence you profane the mysteries of fairyland i shall explore and learn the end of this adventure and you tod macandrew i'll see what's the best lunatic asylum for you to occupy said tod caustically chapter iii fairyland notwithstanding his fantastical babble to macandrew gerald was a shrewd young man he prosecuted his search for the unknown sender of the message less to find a wife than to see the end of the adventure at the enjoyable age of thirty he was not particularly keen on getting married although his friends persistently advised him to do so but as haskins pertinently observed it was absurd to marry merely for marrying's sake when i meet the woman said gerald wisely i shall ask her to be my wife otherwise and a shrug would complete the unfinished sentence tod was quite ready to leave the conclusion of the fishing adventure to his friend being in love with a particular girl he thought of her only and had no wish to search for another girl even though she were an illiterate princess who fluted like a nightingale what with earning his living and fighting lady euphemia and wooing charity bird and tricking mrs pelham odin who was strongly opposed to that wooing macandrew's hands were quite full within two days he betook himself to london keen upon seeing the moon fay ballet in which charity was dancing but before his departure he unwittingly did gerald a service by learning something about the pixy's house and that same something was less romantic than unpleasant according to tod the thing came about by accident but haskins who believed that everything was designed even to the winking of an eye insisted that macandrew had been purposely lured into conversation with the laborer who had mentioned leegarth and the pixy's house at a nine o'clock breakfast on the very day of his departure tod mentioned to his friend that he had been taking a morning walk i had a beastly wakeful night last night grumbled tod while geary brought in a dish of trout and some hot rolls it made me sick tumbling and tossing so i dressed and strolled out at six o'clock why didn't you waken me asked haskins i would have come also not you i'd have been cursed for an hour every one knows what an infernal sleepy head you are jerry however i walked up the hill on to the moors and had a glorious view of the surrounding country i saw the stream where we fished in the hollow two miles away trees and occasional glimpses of the water you know and ever so far away there was a square towered church with a cluster of red roofed houses quite poetical my toddy murmured gerald helping himself to eggs and ham and rather bored by this geographical description the morning made me poetical said macandrew simply it was uncommonly ripping you know there was a laboring johnny coming along and i asked him the name of the church he said it was leegarth church and leegarth village h'm that's where rebb's wealthy relative lives todd nodded as it was early i had a mind to walk over and look about but i first asked the man if there was anything of interest to see he grinned and told me that i might call at the pixy's house gerald looked up and was about to speak eagerly when geary appeared again with a fresh supply of rolls oh the pixy's house said haskins carelessly what's that why you know began tod foolishly when he caught sight of a warning scowl on haskins' face and a look of interest on that of geary's you know went on tod artfully that i can't talk if you interrupt but it's all so dull objected haskins with a shrug not what i am about to tell this laborer said that a lunatic lived in the pixy's house looked after by another lunatic the blind leading the blind go on the first lunatic is a girl and the second an old woman the girl never comes out and no one has ever seen her but the old woman does shopping and all the rest of it that's all what infernal rubbish said haskins crossly he did not like his unknown princess to dwindle to a commonplace lunatic and yet when he remembered the spoken message it did seem a trifle mad well and did you call at the pixy's house not me i walked in another direction and came back to breakfast i have no use for crazy people wid all respect jemplem remarked mr geary unexpectedly de story ob dat man is all twisty turney oh said haskins apparently careless but really with anxiety so you know of this queer business geary berry lil' oh berry lil' sah dat pixy house ver' ole an' ver' tumbledown in heaps only one mad pusson dere jemplem which one the old woman or the young one asked tod abruptly oh dey boff dere jemplem but de young lady is de mad pusson she bin dere afore i come years an' years an' years oh ebber so long 'go dis pou' lady she want to kill peoples wid knives and de ole womans she watch her dat she no get out to kill de ole woman's not a mad pusson jemplem oh no dat all wrong she watch de odder you no go near dat pixy house jemplem ended the landlord earnestly or dat young lady she kill you boff dead as coffin lids haskins felt disgusted he desired to find fairyland and it seemed as though his search would end in discovering a lunatic asylum what is the lunatic's name he asked mavis durham i tink an' de ole womans she called bellaria funny names mused tod and rather pretty mavis means a thrush i fancy but bellaria gerald recalled a charming book of italian folklore which he had read some months before bellaria was the etruscan dawn goddess or the goddess of flowers i forget which he remarked strange that any one in a secluded devonshire village should be called so h'm is this old woman an italian geary i do not know sah replied the man promptly i no go to dat leegarth no never never and you no go too jemplem dat mavis lady hab de knife in you if you go dere homicidal mania said tod learnedly and cheerfully haskins shuddered it seemed terrible to think that the owner of that silvery voice who had sent so delightfully quaint a message should be a dangerous lunatic not responsible for her actions when the landlord took his departure he made an observation rather to himself than to his friend the message was sane enough he said thereby contradicting his first impression when geary spoke of the lunacy well i don't know answered macandrew doubtfully all that fairy business and talk of not being able to read or write seems queer i suppose you'll chuck the adventure now that you know this probably said haskins evasively so that tod should not worry him but in his heart he had a longing to probe the matter deeper later in the day gerald escorted tod to selbury and saw him off to london macandrew left with the impression that gerald would carry out his prearranged programme and travel to st ives on the ensuing day but when haskins walked back to denleigh he was far from having made up his mind to such a course it seemed incredible that the sender of the message should have homicidal tendencies all the same if she had not the law would certainly have prevented her incarceration in the old leegarth mansion known as the pixy's house that she could not read or write was quite possible since she had used the phonograph and yet in this age of education it appeared improbable that anyone could be so ignorant the wording of the message was that of an imaginative but not of a weak brain and the spirit of poetry it breathed appealed to the young man himself a poet of no mean order on the whole decided gerald i shall go to exeter to morrow and get that canoe on that same evening when geary went for his usual walk haskins again slipped the record into the machine and again drank in the music of that perfect voice then for the sake of hiding his secret since the landlord unexpectedly returned he set the phonograph to grind out the godly hymns which were geary's delight these were dismal enough in words and tunes but all through them sounded in gerald's charmed ears the silvery lilt of the fairy princess' tones the owner of such a voice could not possibly be crazy haskins rather regretted that he had not asked major rebb about the pixy's house and its occupant rebb doubtless knew the village of leegarth excellently well since he came down occasionally to see his elderly relative for the moment haskins was tempted to write and ask questions but on second thoughts he made up his mind to explore for himself he was even glad that tod had departed for now the secret was entirely his own and he wished to share it with no one he therefore abstained from talking to geary on the subject for he had learned all that was possible from that source and what he had learned was so decidedly unpleasant that he did not wish to hear more as it afterward turned out his reticence was wise the next day haskins informed geary of his intention to remain in denleigh for another week and the negro expressed his delight at the decision adonis was a cheerful soul who had traveled widely in the humble capacity of a steward on board various liners he therefore approached more intellectual society than he could obtain in lethargic denleigh haskins with an eye to copy after the fashion of the literary man found geary's experiences both entertaining and useful as for the landlady she was a nonentity who worked like a horse and was as dumb as one she seemed to be somewhat afraid of her ever smiling husband and gerald thought that there might be some cause for such dread with all his suave manners geary's one eye hinted at sinister doings but as yet haskins knowing him only on the surface had no fault to find with his personality there was some difficulty in finding a precisely suitable canoe in exeter but having made up his mind a singularly obstinate one gerald never rested until he had attained his object in a couple of days he returned to the devon maid with a light birchwood affair which he had purchased from a returned canadian emigrant this the young man temporarily bestowed in an outside shed and informed his landlord casually that he intended to explore the waters of the ruddle as the stream was called the name evidently came from the streaky red banks between which it flowed geary advised his guest to travel downstream toward silbury as the canoe would there be impeded by fewer stones needless to say as leegarth was in precisely the opposite direction haskins had no intention of taking this well meant advice and indeed because of the very difficulty in navigating the upper reaches of the ruddle he had purchased the canoe for he could carry so light a craft along the banks when stones and weeds blocked up the waterway when gerald took his indian coracle down to the river next afternoon he saw how wise he had been in not buying a heavier boat as the little stream wound its devious way through the dense woods it grew yet more narrow and on the whole somewhat shallow here and there deep pools were to be found inshore but as a rule the current flowed lightly over a shingly bed foaming round gigantic stones or bubbling over the trunks of fallen trees the distance to leegarth as the crow flies could not have been more than three miles but the stream twisted so oddly and the difficulties of navigation were so great that gerald sometimes doubted if he would reach his journey's end several times he was forced to climb the steep banks and drag his canoe through thickly growing saplings but on the whole the tiny shallop behaved with the dexterity of an eel in slipping through dangerous places nevertheless his traveling was more like the exploration of unknown lands than like a civilized river trip in mapped out england late in the day about six o'clock and when the western sky was beginning to glow with the hues of a soapbubble the adventurer found himself in a less toilsome position after the choked stream where the trees met overhead it was a relief to float into an immense pool fenced in by precipitous red cliffs draped with vividly green vegetation gerald emerged into this haven with a feeling of thankfulness and laid down his paddle both to rest his weary muscles and to examine his romantic surroundings the pool was nearly circular and as the narrow ruddle flowed in at one end and out at the other the whole resembled a bead on a string on the placid waters brimming like those of a mill dam the canoe floated idly until it touched the left bank haskins therefore saw on the right hand a tall cliff of ruddy earth overgrown with bushes and surmounted by a fringe of trees between these he espied a ruinous gray stone wall clothed thickly with ivy as there were two or three small windows in this wall gerald guessed that it formed the side of a dwelling place and guessed moreover that from one of those same windows the sealed message had been thrown into the pool it was of course merely a surmise that the pixy's house was built on the top of this inland cliff but bearing in mind the cylinder with its attached bladder haskins felt certain that he was correct the imprisoned mavis durham could only have launched her message from the cliff top gerald had now practically arrived at his journey's end as he had discovered the palace of the sleeping beauty shut in by enchanted woods he therefore paddled swiftly under the cliff itself to see how he could storm the castle tod would have called it a lunatic asylum in his coarse way but gerald the poet preferred the more romantic appellation also after hearing that wonderful voice he made up his rash mind that he would not believe in the alleged insanity of mavis durham until he had seen her and had spoken with her if she were really a homicidal maniac he could return with some regrets to the workaday world but if she was all that he hoped she would be well gerald drew a long breath as he thought thus if she were as beautiful as her voice as poetic as her message he did not know what would happen yet as a young man dizzy with the wine of life he should have known but such things for good or for evil were yet on the knees of the most high gods at the upper end of the pool the adventurer found a stone landing stage with an iron ring to which he fastened the canoe he leaped lightly on to the rugged platform and climbed up a rude stair to find himself facing an arched opening hewn in the face of the cliff it was masked more or less by neglected bushes and evidently had not been made use of many years still it undoubtedly led upward to the battlements of the enchanted castle so haskins pushed his way through the trees and clambered up a ruinous and twisting stair in complete darkness here indeed was an adventure not often to be met with in this unromantic age and the young man's body thrilled as he experienced hitherto unknown emotions he was sir galahad searching for the grail columbus staring at a newly discovered world a calender from the arabian nights stumbling upon the magical beauty of the world a jinn's daughter lovely and unapproachable up and up went the stair twisting and turning like an eel until haskins losing count of time thought that he was mounting to the north star finally the steps ceased to wind and the explorer clambered up a straight flight which terminated in a small opening out of which he emerged on to the top of the cliff and immediately below the ivy draped wall the house stood about twenty yards from the verge of the cliff and the space between was filled with long grass with stunted bushes and with tolerably tall trees all in full summer foliage on looking up gerald saw pointed roofs of weatherworn red tiles twisted stacks of chimneys and gray stone turrets the whole so overgrown with greenery that it looked as though the mansion were a portion of the earth itself there was no door in the wall visible if there had been one as was probable to reach the landing stage it had been blocked up or was hidden by the darkly green ivy faint heart never won fair lady thought gerald unoriginally and began to swarm up the natural ladder afforded by the tough roots of the creeper out of breath he gained the top of the wall and flinging his leg over sat astride to view this jack and the beanstalk country then he beheld charity bird chapter iv the fairy princess seated on the wall like humpty dumpty gerald gasped for two excellent reasons firstly he was a trifle breathed with the arduous climb and secondly the sight of the girl whom he believed to be miss bird amazed him out of all common sense she stood under the wall arrayed in a plain white dress without frills or trimmings or ornaments and looked more like a vestal of rome than a young lady of the twentieth century and to add to haskins' astonishment she did not appear to be the least startled or even surprised so you have come at last she said softly and the voice had in it the same melody that gerald had noted when the phonograph delivered its fantastical message charity miss bird he could hardly get his tongue to move the girl looked puzzled my name is mavis durham she said simply haskins knew that he was awake for he had grazed his knee while climbing and the pain assured him of material existence otherwise he would certainly have believed that the whole thing was a delicious dream but on looking downward more intently he saw that although the image of charity in physical appearance this girl who declared herself to be mavis durham had a more spiritual look on her face her eyes were turquoise blue like the dancer's she possessed the same wonderful hair the color of ripe corn about which miss bird's admirers raved and her features were cast in the same classic mold but she had a mystical etherial evanescent look about her which hinted at more spirituality than was apparent in charity's pronouncedly material charms it might have been the dying light of the evening or the exalted state of mind consequent on emotion that raised gerald to a high plane but the girl looked as though she would vanish like a wreath of mist under the influence of the newly risen sun the resemblance between mavis and charity was certainly marvelous and haskins could not account for the similarity but after a long and searching look he became certain that the girls were two different flesh and blood human beings and not one as he had momentarily supposed on acquiring this assurance in his innermost being the young man drew a breath of relief since charity was more or less engaged to tod and he did not wish to poach on tod's preserves the question of the resemblance he determined swiftly to leave to a later date for answer and meanwhile surrendered himself entirely to the incredible romance of the adventure surely no more poetic happening had taken place since king cophetua had gone a wooing his beggar maid but by the time his reflections had reached this point the princess of fairyland for that she certainly was betrayed excitement and uneasiness waving her hands to intimate that he should hide behind the ruddy leaves of a copper beech which over topped the wall and leaned against it bellaria will catch you called up mavis softly and then i'll never see you again get behind the beech i'll return soon she sped lightly away while haskins still trying to assure himself that he was not dreaming shuffled along the wall until he gained the covert of the spreading branches here he was safe from any espial and while mavis was absent he gently parted the leaves to view her enchanted palace whither she had called him a phonograph and fairyland it was an odd mixture of poetry and science a page with a silken bound parchment a dragon chariot to waft a mortal prince to a spellbound queen these were natural in the circumstances but to be summoned by a phonograph why it linked the age of motor cars with that of king arthur haskins saw below him a moderately sized quadrangle smoothly turfed in the center and bordered with beds of flowers stretching to moldering walls to the right and straight in front somewhat after the shape of the letter l were two ranges of a gray stone mansion clothed as was the wall with thickly growing ivy there were two stories and the architecture was tudor picturesque and graceful along the lower story of the front wing were elaborate oriel windows filled in with lattice work and as gerald shrewdly suspected with stained glass an archway pierced this wing and apparently led to another part of the grounds the range of buildings on the right was less elaborate as the windows above and below were square and modern in their looks to the left were ruinous stables and outhouses more or less tumbledown and of course the fourth side of the quadrangle was closed in by the wall upon which the young man was seated what with the gray wall the beautifully shaped oriels the peaked roofs of mellow red tiles and the mantle of greenery which overspread all the place looked like a picture from the christmas number of the graphic yet if the house was neglected the garden and lawn certainly were not the turf was as smooth as a billiard table and the beds of flowers were carefully tended as he could see from the absence of weeds and the efflorescence of blossoms these were chiefly those of humble cottage flowers tall hollyhocks golden snapdragon sweet william pansies marigolds ragged robin and musk carnations all these grew in artistic profusion and confusion making the quadrangle a world of beauty and color and perfume in the center of the lawn rose an antique sundial supported by three battered female figures and over all this dreamy old world haven of rest arched the shadowy sky blending night and day in vapory blue and rosy flushings haskins felt that a new planet had swam into his ken all that he had dreamed of as too fair for earth was here transmuted from the ideal into the real i must certainly be in dreamland thought the young man or in paradise or in prospero's enchanted island or in the vale of avilion where it doth neither rain nor snow but his poetic musings were cut short by a rustle among the coppery leaves of the beech he looked down from his wall and saw a vision of loveliness rising from the foliage like undine from the well i went to see what bellaria was doing explained mavis breathlessly and perched on a sloping bough so near to the wall that the young man could have embraced her without difficulty he felt very much inclined to do so for he was rapidly falling fathoms deep in love but a feeling of respect for the unprotected girl restrained him and he listened spellbound to the music of her voice bellaria was cooking the supper you know went on the girl prosaically so there is no chance of her coming to call me for half an hour and what then asked gerald soberly you must go away bellaria would be very angry if she knew that my fairy prince had come am i the fairy prince asked haskins softly mavis raised her brows with a trill of heavenly laughter of course you are since you came over the wall i have been watching here for months to see you arrive you would not have come had you not got my message no acknowledged haskins sensibly that is very certain no one would look for a fairy princess in this tangle of woods but he hesitated and smiled you are not sleeping yes i am not with my eyes closed of course but i am sleeping through life all my days i have lived in this dull old place and my guardian will not let me go out and see the world who is your guardian asked gerald and received a shock major rebb good lord major rebb huh so this was the elderly relative whom the man had come to see haskins congratulated himself that he had not questioned the major had he done so there would have been a speedy end to romance the word elderly had apparently been used by rebb to conceal the existence of this lovely girl from too inquiring youth no young man would search for anything elderly haskins felt like saul as though he had gone to seek his father's asses and had found a kingdom do you know my guardian asked mavis quickly noting his surprise well yes i have met him in london oh london london the girl clapped her hands in a childish way how i wish to see london my guardian says that he will take me there some day and then oh and then and then and then what then i shall live just fancy she continued swinging on the bough i am twenty years of age and i have lived shut up here with bellaria ever since i can remember my guardian comes and sees me sometimes and give me all kinds of presents he is always very kind but he will not let me leave the pixy's house i'm not shut up of course she added contradicting herself the grounds are very large there's a big garden of fruit and flowers beyond that archway and a park of trees with undergrowth just like a fairy wood i have heaps and heaps to do looking after my flowers and embroidering and cooking and playing games and listening to bellaria's stories i am quite happy and now she leaned forward until her face nearly touched that of gerald i am happier than ever because you are here are you inquired haskins stupidly and thickly he did not dare to move or to follow his impulse lest he should alarm her she was as trusting as a tame bird but a chance word or a too eloquent look might teach her that fear existed yes of course i am how silly you are in bellaria's stories the prince always comes to the princess in the end mine would not come so i sent that message and now she stretched a hand to caress his face oh my prince my prince i may not be your prince after all said gerald weakly he certainly felt unworthy of being so but you are you are cried mavis with conviction you would not have found my message otherwise i flung it from one of the windows into the pool below and you picked it up so i know that you are my prince and then she added naively you are so very handsome haskins was pretty well hardened to admiration since he knew more about women than was good for him all the same the outspoken speech made him blush who is bellaria he asked abruptly changing a too embarrassing subject my nurse who has looked after me all my life i call her the ogress and my guardian the ogre not but what they are both very kind i have all i want save liberty and why cannot you get that it is not the custom of the country haskins looked puzzled what do you mean mavis she raised her clear truthful eyes why you know don't you major rebb told me that all girls were brought up in seclusion until they reached the age of twenty one and then they were taken out to see the world i wish ten months were past sighed imprisoned beauty for then i shall be one and twenty and able to leave the pixy's house bellaria says that i won't like the world but i shall i shall i shall it was both cunning and clever of major rebb to suggest such a reason for her seclusion to the girl herself as it prevented her feeling that she was being detained against her will but she was apparently unaware that he ascribed a more terrible reason to the world beyond the gates and that she was looked upon as a homicidal maniac of course this was wholly and entirely absurd no one with such steady eyes and who spoke so artlessly could be tainted in that way she was limited from sheer ignorance and innocent beyond belief of evil a child of nature as unsophisticated as undine herself gerald doubted if she would know the meaning of the word murder what is bellaria's other name he asked after a pause dondi bellaria dondi who came from florence in italy said miss durham easily she is ugly and old and very cross but i love her all the same for she loves me and means well and oh she tells such lovely lovely stories and can repeat poetry by dante and ariosto and leopardi for ever so long i can repeat poetry also she added hastily with the complacency of a child i know lots of homer and of shakespeare and of keats and stop stop interrupted gerald hastily how can you when according to your message you are unable to read oh schaibar taught me schaibar mavis nodded with bright eyes you know the peri banou's brother in 'the arabian nights' his real name is arnold mr arnold but i call him schaibar because he is a dwarf with a long beard and a short temper he used to recite poetry and i learned to recite also but schaibar has gone away she said with a falling cadence months ago he went to australia and promised to write but he did not you could not read what he wrote mavis i could hear it schaibar should send me a record in the same way as i sent you my message but he has not done so and yet he was so fond of me i cannot understand it and mavis sighed from your mention of australia it seems that you know geography also oh yes of course i do schaibar drew the maps and told me where cities and mountains and lakes and rivers were i carry it all in my head and you cannot read or write asked gerald with a passing recollection of the golden butterfly heroine no the ogre said that my brain was not strong enough to learn the ogre said haskins forgetting my guardian major rebb he says that lots and lots of girls never learn to read or write liar thought haskins but he suppressed the opprobrious name and merely remarked anxiously but you don't feel your brain weak oh no oh no i could learn anything i think i have never had a day's illness in my life do you ever feel dizzy no why should i do you ever get into a rage and want to strike bellaria mavis laughed wonderingly i should be foolish to do that poor bellaria doesn't mean to be cross and if she cannot keep her temper i must i wouldn't strike her or anyone even if i were in a rage do you strike people when you are angry gerald coughed he had a vivid recollection of schoolfights and of horsewhipping a scandal monger much later in life it is necessary sometimes mavis he remarked the world is not inhabited entirely by agreeable people oh i know that she said quickly the old gardener matthew who came to help me from leegarth is very disagreeable and he seems to be a little afraid of me i don't know why and i am very sorry i want everyone to love me doesn't major rebb yes in a way but he is cold he never kisses me if you like a person don't you kiss her if she's a very nice person i do said haskins bubbling over with laughter now you his eyes completed the sentence you love me yes mavis he answered unhesitatingly gerald scorned a lie then of course she bent forward and in spite of gerald's virtuous resolutions their lips would have met but that a deep contralto voice boomed from the quadrangle calling on mavis angrily oh the girl flung back her head there is bellaria calling me to supper i must go or she may find you but come again and i'll kiss you you oh what is your name gerald he replied softly prince gerald she said smiling and slipped down the tree rapidly as bellaria called again haskins parting the leaves saw her cross the lawn and enter the house in the company of a tall lean woman but it was too dark to see bellaria's looks at that distance the adventurer slipped from the wall and descended to mother carey's peace pool as he named the place paddling to the opposite side he found a sloping bank and dragged his canoe into the undergrowth then in the rosy twilight he scrambled through the bushes to find some path or road leading to denleigh chapter v golden hours how haskins reached the devon maid that evening he could not tell for his memory was occupied in recalling every word of that delightful conversation but in some way he managed to strike a narrow path which led on to the high moors and thence gained the highway descending into denleigh valley it was rather late when he entered his sitting room and the rosy hues of the sunset had given place to the shadowy stillness of a summer night supper was waiting for him and almost immediately the negro appeared with a hot dish i thought you were lost sah said geary looking closely at gerald's flannels which were somewhat torn by brambles and smeared with mud oh no answered the young man ready with an explanation since he wished to satisfy the negro's curiosity without enlightening him i have been down the river and up the river in my canoe but i got mixed up with stones and cross currents and blundered in the darkness i therefore hid my canoe in the bushes and came back and you like the river sah asked geary lingering haskins supped his soup and nodded a most charming river he said in a careless voice very quiet very lonely i shall explore it again to morrow afternoon the negro withdrew quietly and haskins reflected on the persistent way in which the man questioned him more than ever did he mistrust adonis and now with stronger reason for he felt certain that the negro was connected in some way with major rebb who in his turn was assuredly connected with the pixy's house and its inmates if geary discovered that gerald had met with the enchanted princess he might officiously inform rebb when there would be trouble without doubt the major was behaving illegally in shutting up a perfectly sane girl and therefore would not create a public scandal nevertheless if he knew that haskins had penetrated his secret he might remove mavis to another hiding place gerald could not risk that until he knew more and again had met the girl he looked upon himself as the knight errant of distressed beauty and it behooved him to be wary in his dealings with a very difficult and somewhat dangerous matter after supper haskins lighted his pipe and seated himself by the open window to think over matters mrs geary entered and removed the remnants of the meal in her dumb way after placing a cup of coffee on a small table at her guest's elbow she withdrew and he was left to his reflections these began with a consideration of mavis' beauty of person and charm of conversation it can thus be guessed that haskins was in love genuinely in love and for the first time in his life as bulwer lytton says there are many counterfeits but only one eros this was haskins' experience he had loved in an earthly way many times in his time and several times had mistaken the false for the true a fastidious mind had saved him from the commercial passion of the ordinary man and he had usually approached women in the belief that they were goddesses this was hard on the sex as the attitude exacts too much perfection in a world of temptation consequently gerald had been deceived several times and therefore had guarded himself carefully against the tender passion then he met with charity bird and in common with many another man fell in love with her physical charms but in spite of her beauty which he grew to admire as he would that of a picture haskins failed to find in her the wife and helpmate his exacting nature demanded outwardly charity was all that he could desire but inwardly she was less attractive being matter of fact when she was not silly she might suit tod but she did not match with gerald so he withdrew with little regret and for some months he had been heart whole and fancy free now in an unexpected and extraordinary way the young man had met with another charity bird more perfect than the original mavis was as beautiful in looks and yet was higher in mind from the strange upbringing to which she had subjected she looked at life what little she knew of it in a poetical way yet judging by her remarks on cooking and embroidering and gardening she had a fund of common knowledge directed by common sense it was too early as yet to pronounce authoritatively on her capabilities and trend of thought but the spiritual power manifested in her personality appealed strongly to the lover who had loved her counterfeit here indeed was the true eros a deity who could be worshiped without disappointment gerald with less reflection than he usually gave to his decisions determined to be a faithful attendant at the shrine of this divinity having thus settled his attitude towards the girl with the impetuosity of a young man and a true lover haskins began to think over miss durham's position in spite of the hideous rumor reported by geary he believed from personal observation that the girl was quite sane rebb who was her acknowledged guardian had apparently set such gossip afloat so that no one might comment upon the seclusion of the girl guarded in this way by public fear which had been erected by a lying tale mavis might continue to dwell for the rest of her life amidst the ruins of the pixy's house closely watched by the florentine and spied upon in a less degree as gerald shrewdly suspected by geary who was probably a creature of major rebb's now the question was this why did rebb shut up so pretty and unsophisticated a creature in conventual solitude she had committed no crime and from what little haskins had seen of her she had no instinct which would make her commit one there must be some other reason and a strong one for the odd behavior of rebb this reason haskins determined to learn howsoever much geary and his employer might desire to conceal it also there were other questions to which the young man desired answers why was mavis so similar to charity in looks why had she not been taught to read and write why was geary as haskins verily believed posted at the devon maid to keep his one sinister eye on her gerald could not have sworn in a court of law that the negro was connected in any way with the pixy's house secret but he had an intuitive feeling from the man's behavior towards major rebb and by his eager statement of a false rumor that in some manner the landlord had to do with the matter haskins therefore placed himself on his guard and by a careless demeanor and apparent frankness he succeeded in lulling geary's suspicions as to his true reasons for postponing his journey to st ives it was geary who could answer at least some of the questions which vexed gerald's soul and he lingered to hear them unfortunately he did not know how to inquire without betraying his secret visit to the pixy's house two or three days went by and haskins regularly took his way to the river to seek the fairy palace after that first attempt to navigate so stubborn a stream as the ruddle he used the canoe very little it was easier and more expeditious to take the highway to the moors and then strike into the secret path which led to mother carey's peace pool this haskins did and then would paddle across to the landing place whence he could gain the summit of the cliff here he would climb the wall to hide behind the beech tree and hither mavis would come to chatter to her fairy prince as she still continued to call him but owing to the presence of bellaria the young man did not dare to descend into the grounds any moment might have brought about discovery had he risked so much for according to mavis the florentine was a keen and restless dragon she's afraid of something said mavis one day when gerald questioned her about the woman i don't know what it is but she is afraid why do you think that because she is always looking over her shoulder with a scared expression and she never sleeps in the same bedroom has she more than one then mavis oh yes there are many many bedrooms in the house and bellaria goes to a different one nightly she's afraid of the darkness too and remains always in the house after sundown when she goes shopping in leegarth she returns quite pale and nervous i am quite sure that she is afraid of something but she always gets angry with me when i ask what is the matter curious murmured haskins here is another mystery then he asked aloud how often does your guardian come to you not very often sometimes he is away for months and then will come twice in a week he really is very kind for he always brings me presents i call him santa claus when he does that but oh there is bellaria stay here gerald i'll see what she wants as it was early in the afternoon haskins had an excellent view of the florentine who stalked across the lawn almost to the foot of the beech drawn thither by her nursling's answering cry you are always sitting on the high branches of that tree said the italian crossly and in most excellent english why do you do that i can see the river and the pool said mavis quickly oh bellaria i wish i was a nymph that i could plunge into the cool water you can do that without being a nymph cara mia but not in the pool below not outside the grounds your guardian would be angry no english young lady leaves her home until she is twenty one haskins smiled when he heard this frightful falsehood bellaria had been well trained by her master and such was the simplicity of mavis that she accepted the limitation of her liberty in all good faith but i shall be so glad when i am twenty one she complained with a sigh si si si bellaria placed her hands on her hips and nodded three times emphatically but you will not like the world no ah dio mio the world is a dangerous and evil place and she looked in a scared manner over her shoulder shivering in the warm air the florentine had been a handsome woman tall and dark and of a commanding appearance she was still remarkably straight at the age of fifty six and carried herself with a defiant air when forgetful of the danger that threatened her whatsoever that might be then she would cringe and wince as gerald had just seen her do her eyes were large and black but the pupils were dilated and she looked like a terrified rabbit apparently the woman had cause to fear some enemy or some punishment for not only were her eyes scared looking but her plentiful hair was absolutely snow white this might have been age but fifty six is not a very great age and the hair might easily have been an iron grey there was certainly some shadow on her life which threatened disaster and only when she forgot the danger in conversation with mavis did bellaria appear defiant and stately and tolerably young but the very slightest reminder of that past and the past apparently contained the danger referred to and her form dwindled her body bent her eyes grew timid and she aged to seventy as though by enchantment all this might have been fancy on haskins' part for he was extremely imaginative but he believed that he had read the woman rightly whatever might be the reason bellaria dondi had been frightened into this lonely house there to hide from some appalling danger it appeared that the fit of terror tormented her now and that she had sought mavis' company from sheer dread of solitude quite ignorant of the man up the tree or rather the lover who was seated on the wall bellaria sat near the trunk talking to mavis both the lovers were afraid lest their secret should be discovered but bellaria kept up so loud a conversation and it seemed as though she spoke loudly to reassure herself that the occasional movements of haskins passed unheeded mavis proved herself to be a capable actress despite her simplicity for nothing could have been more artless than her demeanor geary is coming to see me to night said bellaria after a pause and the observation startled the listener he sent a message by matthew this was the aged cross gardener of whom mavis had spoken why is he coming questioned mavis major rebb told him to come and see that the young man who is stopping at the devon maid has not been lurking about here what young man asked mavis coolly i have told you a friend of the major's who is stopping at geary's inn he has taken to rowing on the river and might find this place i wish he would said the girl truthfully i should like to see a really young man you will some day bellaria assured her and then you will be sorry cara mia young men are all liars and villains geary wrote to major rebb in london telling about this mr haskins that is the name i believe so the major says that geary has to come over to night to look round the place and ask me questions so absurd bellaria shrugged her thin shoulders as if anyone could come here unless i knew why shouldn't this mr haskins come bellaria because you may fall in love and if you do you may want to marry this man major rebb does not wish you to marry until you have seen the world my dear but i have to wait for another ten months pouted mavis what is that i yes i who speak bellaria dondi shall never never see the world again here i am shut up for ever and ever why nanny i have often asked but you never will tell i tell no one the reason why i stop here said the woman sombrely i am dead to the world and to its people for twenty years i have been dead and it is as well that i should be thought to be dead if they knew if they guessed ugh she looked round and shivered if who knew no matter no matter bellaria leaped to her feet all is done with and over i was famous once cara mia yes behold in me a great singer but you know you know often have i talked to you of my greatness and it was blotted out in a night by hush hush she cast a scared glance over her shoulder and darted into the middle of the lawn bellaria bellaria called out mavis i'll climb the beech again but the woman did not reply she burst out into the shadow song from dinorah and haskins realized at once what a magnificent voice she must have had even now many of the notes were true though occasionally a high one was cracked and wheezy spreading her black skirts she bowed and becked and swept and danced to her shadow in the strong sunlight while her voice fluted high and birdlike through the air thus singing and dancing she re entered the house her dark hour over for the time being haskins wondered what could be her secret here indeed was a woman with a past but by this time mavis had climbed the tree again and was hurriedly persuading him to go bellaria suspects nothing she said eagerly and after geary comes to night he won't come again but you must be careful how can i be more careful than i am asked gerald taking her hand come at night she urged come to morrow night when the moon is high and the fairies come out to dance i am often in the garden on these summer nights for bellaria will not come out and i hate to be mewed up in stuffy rooms she will not think that i am meeting anyone and then we can talk without fear of discovery i shall lead you into the other garden through the arch but if bellaria sees me from a window her bedroom is on the other side of the house looking down on to the woods she will not see us and she will never suspect that anyone is with me she knows that i love the moonlight and besides she will not dare to come out because of her fear i wonder what that fear is said gerald meditatively i do not know but go now dear prince and come again to morrow night at ten o'clock to night you must not come lest geary see you and if he did oh mavis shivered i don't know what he would do he is a terrible black man and has a horrid knife with a yellow handle a big knife oh so dangerous he brought it from jamaica he told bellaria so he would kill you if he found you i quite believe that said gerald grimly and resolved to arm himself with a revolver when he next came to the pixy's house he was resolved not to die without a fight but don't worry darling i'll be all right goodbye to morrow night then he dropped from the wall and departed while mavis wailed that he had not kissed her chapter vi the past of adonis geary no gerald has not kissed her he wished to very badly but something in his heart a strong sense of honor maybe prevented his doing so until he had made his position clear to her she was so simple so innocent so virginal that she knew nothing of passion or of life or of that world wherein women marry and are given in marriage with an almost absurd particularity the young man desired that before being kissed she should learn that he was her true lover that he wished to marry her that he greatly desired to enter into a lifelong companionship with her to act otherwise was to bind her unknowingly to him when she understood what love meant and was ready to accept him as her husband then could he seal this acceptance with a kiss for he knew full well that such a kiss would awaken the woman in her would reveal life to her soul a caress meant so much that it was little wonder he restrained himself from following too hurriedly the desire of his heart and perhaps it was that he found her innocence and friendly acceptance of his presence too delightful to transmute with unconsidered haste friendship into love why spoil this idyll of lilies by presenting her with the red ripe roses of love the romance was so charming so dreamlike that the poetic instinct of the poet forbade him to rouse her mavis was indeed the sleeping beauty slumbering within her enchanted palace and he the fated prince as it would seem he was from his finding of the cylinder would in time awaken her with a kiss but the hour had not yet struck when it did many things would come to pass in the first place mavis would no longer be contented to live in the pixy's house ignorant of life she would wish to come out into the world even before the age of twenty one and would not wait longer for her guardian's permission such a desire would mean a meeting and an explanation with rebb and gerald as yet did not see how to bring this about he guessed that when he spoke to the major he would be told of the homicidal mania with which mavis was said to be tainted it would be vain for him to decline to believe in such a taint if rebb insisted that it was so he could refuse to allow haskins to marry his ward particularly as she was under age then again if rebb guessed that the young man wished to marry the girl he might very easily remove her secretly to a new hiding place and gerald would lose her for ever hasty action was not to be thought of and it would be best to wait until he could learn why rebb secluded the girl in that ruinous house haskins duly returned to the devon maid and found geary as cheerful and obsequious as usual but now that gerald was enlightened as to the connection of the negro with the pixy's house he found it difficult to tolerate these false smiles piercing the mask of geary's good humor he saw in him a dangerous man gripping a yellow handled knife which he was ready to use should it be necessary haskins no longer wondered at the negro's presence amongst these lonely hills he knew that he had not drifted there but had been made landlord of the inn to act as a dragon and a very dangerous dragon he might prove to be should he gain wind of gerald's philanderings with mavis geary however showed no signs that he suspected anything but waited as usual on his guest while at dinner gerald seized the opportunity to tell his landlord that he contemplated stopping at silbury on the ensuing night i have to run up to london on the day after to morrow said haskins with feigned carelessness and if i sleep at silbury i can catch the eight o'clock train i could dribe you dere sah for dat train said geary beaming and evidently pleased at haskins' announcement no my good fellow that would mean my getting up at five in the morning i prefer to sleep at silbury at the prince's head hotel will you come back here sah oh yes in two or three days but only for a time geary i have to go on to st ives you know i shall be sorry to lose you sah thank you i shall be sorry to go this inn is comfortable and the country all around is picturesque i have left my canoe down on the river and when i return i shall send it back to exeter i am tired of exploring that river it is so lonely berry lonely sah assented geary promptly and went towards the door with the tray in his hands there he stopped will you want me dis ebenin' sah i go to see a frien' in de lawd at leegarth who wish to see me for de good ob his bressed soul no i won't want you rejoined haskins secretly disgusted at the fellow for using the cloak of religion to mask his pixy's house visit i shall go to bed early t'ank you sah and geary departed later while gerald at the window sipped his coffee he saw the big negro walking up the hill which led on to the moors for the moment it flashed across the young man that geary might go to mother carey's peace pool by taking the down path and there might discover the canoe but on second thoughts he dismissed his reflection geary being quite ignorant of haskins' knowledge had no reason to seek the pool and so the canoe would be left undisturbed in the undergrowth haskins had really intended to retire early but unable to rest quietly he strolled out of the inn and on to the bridge no one lingered there now as the early birds of denleigh had gone to roost he had the rialto of the village all to himself as he thought until he became aware that mrs geary with a blue shawl over her head was leaning against the parapet wondering if he could learn anything about adonis from his usually silent wife gerald moved alongside a penny for your thoughts mrs geary he said cheerfully mrs geary turned and in the moonlight he saw that she was crying my thoughts have to do with funerals sir she said in a heavy voice but with a much less use of the devonshire dialect than he would have expected from a barnstaple woman with funerals i was thinking said mrs geary looking at the water flowing under the bridge if it wouldn't be best for me to throw myself into yon stream why on earth should you do that asked haskins blankly and it was then that he became conscious that she had been drinking for she swayed against the stonework perhaps it was the drink which made her talk more than usual added to the absence of her husband but she certainly spoke very freely and told him much that he wished to know why should i wish to do that sir she repeated scornfully because i am the most miserable woman on god's green earth oh surely not mrs geary you have a good home healthy children and a capital husband again she laughed scornfully a capital husband when it suits him oh you don't know what geary is mr haskins his soul is as black as his face and that is saying a lot i wondered why you married a negro commented haskins leaning over the bridge and leading her to confide in him i married him because i was a greedy fool sir i was a housemaid or at least a general servant under bellaria at the pixy's house gerald caught his breath that is where the mad girl lives according to your husband mad she's less mad than i am sir a poor pretty sweet young lady who is kept a fast prisoner by major rebb why is she kept prisoner i can't tell you that sir all i know is that sixteen long years ago i was a servant there and miss mavis liked me i got on well with bellaria too although she had her fits of terror at times why i can't say but she often seemed to be scared by her very shadow major rebb was away then with his regiment in jamaica oh and miss mavis lived at the pixy's house she was and is kept a prisoner there said mrs geary whose tongue seemed to be very loose with the drink else she would scarcely have talked so boldly major rebb came home with geary who had been his servant in jamaica geary stopped at the pixy's house while his master went to london he fell in love with me and quarreled with bellaria they were like cat and dog so when major rebb came down he said that if i would marry geary he would keep my old mother out of the poorhouse i didn't dislike geary then and i wanted my mother to be comfortable for the rest of her life i agreed and married geary major rebb settled us in the devon maid fifteen years ago and since then my life has been a hell with that villain geary will kill me some day added the woman in a matter of fact tone unless i kill myself first but a big woman like you can manage him not when he threatens with that yellow handled knife he holds sir i fear that knife geary says that it was used in some african sacrifice in jamaica and the sight of it makes me sick because of geary's treatment i took to drink and he's always threatening to kill me unless i leave it off how can i cried mrs geary throwing open her arms when it is the only thing that makes me able to stand the brute does he strike you he beats me and kicks me and threatens me with the knife don't tell him that i said so sir cried mrs geary with sudden terror for the drink was dying out of her if you do he'll kill me i am afraid of death she added looking into the silver water if i were not i would end everything in yonder stream i won't say a word mrs geary said haskins soothingly your husband will never hear anything from me why does he live here to watch the pixy's house said mrs geary to see that miss mavis don't get away if she did and learned what she should learn the major wouldn't be able to dash about in motor cars is it money asked gerald eagerly mrs geary drew her shawl tightly round her massive form i don't know rightly what it is she said in her heavy voice geary says very little but what he does say shows that major rebb will never let miss mavis leave that house and she's not mad poor lamb she's a poor innocent angel the sport of villains i'll go now mr haskins and mind i have your word to say nothing you have said gerald as she turned away but if you want to help miss mavis only one man can help her interrupted the woman gruffly and he must be her lover who will stand against these devils on her behalf but she never sees a man since mr arnold went away unless old matthew counts so what chance has she there she ended abruptly i have told you more than i ought to the drink the drink geary would kill me if he knew curse geary and curse the drink and she returned slowly to the inn striking her forehead and repeating the drink the drink the drink haskins remained on the bridge for a few minutes and then retired to bed not to sleep but to think deeply he had enough to occupy his thoughts throughout that long summer night mrs geary as the saying goes had given the show away from the remark about the motor car gerald felt certain that mrs geary had meant a loss of money apparently if mavis escaped from the pixy's house rebb would lose an income which rightfully belonged to the girl but of this the young man could not be sure and until he had more information he could do nothing still his suspicions had certainly proved to be correct the negro was rebb's creature and had been posted in denleigh village to guard the pixy's house and its occupants haskins felt that he was on the track of the mystery but could not follow it up until he talked it over with another person two heads were better than one in this instance and tod macandrew was very shrewd therefore haskins fell asleep with a resolution to explain matters to the lawyer when he went to london meanwhile he had to meet mavis in the moonlight on the ensuing night and that thought alone was sufficient to fill his mind to the exclusion of less romantic matters next morning geary was as suave and obedient as usual evidently he had neither found nor had he heard anything to awaken his suspicion while visiting the pixy's house haskins watched him closely and weighed every look every inflection of the voice but in every case he was satisfied that the negro had not the slightest idea that his guest had stormed the enchanted castle when the time came for haskins to drive to silbury the negro himself appeared on the box of the trap hullo said gerald climbing in and seeing that his portmanteau was all right this is an honor geary oh no sah said the negro showing his splendid teeth you ver' good pusson sah to hab at de devon maid i wish you to come here again an' an' tell odder jemplem ob dis place i'll tell everyone said gerald when the trap started and i'll be back soon to stay wid me sah for a few days i must then get on to st ives as a friend is awaiting me there what i miss about denleigh geary added the young man in a careless tone is that there are no pretty girls no sah no you hab to see jamaica for de pretty gals sah you come from jamaica then yes sah me buckra nigger sah and servant to major rebb him was in command ob a fine black rig'm't sah geary was communicative indeed and simply told what gerald had gathered from the wife however to shield her he expressed suitable surprise i wonder you don't go back to jamaica geary after the tropics this place must be chilly and extremely dull in winter yas sah it berry dull replied the negro unsuspiciously but i hab de inn and de wife and de family so i getting on berry well but some day i go back to port royal to lib wid money and den i a grand jemplem in this way adonis chattered all the long way to silbury and told haskins quite a lot about his life with major rebb the negro appeared to be quite devoted to his old master alleging that rebb had saved his life when it was in danger from what asked gerald idly voodoo said geary scowling i lose one eye in voodoo and after this remark he became silent haskins had heard of voodoo of the terrible african witchcraft and having an initiate in his company would have liked from literary curiosity to learn more but by this time the trap was entering silbury and descending the steep high street so geary refused to say anything more the loss of his eye was evidently a sore subject with him and small wonder that he loved rebb if the sight of the other eye had been saved by that military gentleman when geary drove away leaving haskins at the prince's head that individual thought deeply chapter vii love haskins being genuinely anglo saxon had not the plotting instincts of a conspirator and was therefore somewhat rough and ready in arranging for a secret meeting with mavis however love sharped his wits and he excused himself to the landlady of the prince's head for being absent after midnight on the plea that he had to ride out and see an old friend in the ordinary course of things there was no reason why he should explain at all but to make matters entirely safe should mr geary play the spy which was just what the creature would do haskins thus arranged for an explanation after dinner he called in mrs jennings and ordered a horse obtaining at the same time the key of a side door so that he could admit himself when he returned somewhere about one o'clock in the morning then he gave orders that he was to be called in time for the early morning train and afterwards snatched forty winks in order to prepare himself thoroughly for the fatigues of the night owing to the excessive heat of the weather haskins usually wore loose white flannels from morning until evening but on this occasion to escape the possible watchfulness of bellaria he donned a dark hued riding dress with brown gaiters and a tweed cap in this guise and when shielded by the semi gloom of the summer night he would certainly avoid observation and of course the chances were that the woman tormented by her fears would not venture out of the house after dark still it was best to be on the safe side and dress as inconspicuously as possible the animal supplied by the stables of the prince's head was not exactly a derby winner he proved to be a wary quadruped remarkably old and extraordinarily slow but having the great merit of knowing every inch of the surrounding country no mean qualification considering the rider's comparative ignorance however gerald had a fair idea of the five miles' route to leegarth and in due time the horse got over the ground although it must be admitted that he did not hurry himself haskins reached the village shortly after ten o'clock and skirted round the houses so that he should not be observed an unknown stranger arriving in so secluded a hamlet would assuredly awaken the suspicions of the wary geary and news travels fast in country districts so gerald kept well out of the way and after a somewhat circuitous route came to the banks of mother carey's peace pool here he fastened his horse to the trunk of an ancient oak with permission to crop the lush grass and launched his faithful canoe shortly he was perched for the fourth or fifth time on the top of the wall the night was perfect a romeo and juliet night warm and still with a cloudless sky radiant with ivory moonlight gerald looked down on the quaint peaceful quadrangle sleeping in the chill whiteness at the range of buildings with their fantastic architecture and at the darkly solemn trees which girdled this enchanted palace then he became aware of a slight white clothed figure flitting across the shaven lawns like a ghost of dead and gone beauty a musical whisper stole through the warm stillness and the adventurer with a fast throbbing heart flung himself on to the boughs of the copper beech to use it as a stair for descent in a few minutes he found himself standing in the shadow of the tree clasping a cool slender hand and looking into two wonderful eyes which flashed like the stars overhead oh you are not in white prince said mavis disappointed gerald explained i thought it best to wear dark clothes since bellaria might be on the watch there is no chance of that she is fast asleep and would not leave her bed unless the house went on fire then again went on gerald pressing her hand i had to ride here from silbury i could scarcely do that in flannels well mavis dragged him into the radiant moonlight and surveyed him critically it doesn't matter i like you in this suit of clothes you look so tall and straight and slim and oh my dear gerald laughed you will make me vain but you are vain already she said naively bellaria says that all young men are vain how can this particular young man be otherwise questioned the lover when the most charming girl in the world makes an appointment with him in the realms of romance am i charming gerald am i oh mavis clapped her hands how delightful to be told that say it again you are charming mavis and also rather reckless for laughing so loud pooh everything is safe for the gates are locked and bellaria is asleep in all these wide gardens only you and i are awake unless added mavis seriously you count the fairies and the nightingales and the crickets ended gerald smiling mavis smiled also and they stood hand in hand like a couple of schoolchildren out on a frolic then come she cried loosening her grip you must catch me catch me my prince and like an arrow from the bow she shot across the turf towards the archway followed rapidly by her lover haskins was swift of foot but mavis ran like atalanta and was flitting about the gardens on the other side of the archway before he could range alongside you are the fairy queen panted gerald when he reached her i saw you spread large white wings oh no said mavis seriously and prosaically i used my legs the queen of spain has no legs quoted haskins laughing oh how dreadful how very very dreadful and he laughed again to see that she took him seriously the gardens were very lovely and much less orderly than the quadrangle following disraeli's dictum they had been cultivated to excess and then nature had been allowed to decivilize them the result was charming and wonderfully artistic there were beds of brilliant flowers wherein slim saplings grew at will statues of god and goddess wreathed in greenery ponds of placid water rimmed with stone wherein white lilies slept on broad leaves floating amidst slender reeds the faade of the house with its tudor battlements and long ranges of latticed windows rose picturesquely in the still calm light of the moon which rendered all things ethereal and fairylike before the mansion stretched a shallow terrace of gray stone diapered with lichens and emerald moss a wide flight of steps descended from this to meet a broad path which melted imperceptibly into a jungle of tall bushes and wiry grasses and all around the trees sprang like sentinels to guard this magic domain from the prose of the outside world everything was bathed in a luminous white radiance and in this colorless world mavis flitted here and there like a moth of snow it is too lovely for mere words murmured gerald gazing at all this beauty with his poetical feelings uppermost are you speaking of me asked mavis joyfully he laughed in spite of your seclusion my dear you are a true woman for you will not allow even the landscape to be complimented when you are present human beings are so much nicer than landscape she pouted one is at least i wonder who she can be me said mavis triumphantly how clever of you to guess that my angel mavis flung up her arms with a silvery laugh i am a fairy to night and no angel they are stiff things with goose wings rhyme and reason both together said gerald sitting down on a mossy stone fronting a smooth greensward well then you are titania and i the rash mortal who has intruded on your privacy take care that i do not enchant you poor mortal you have done that already hark he raised a finger the wind is rising your majesty to play for my dancing then gerald saw a wonderful thing while the wind played with viewless fingers on the lyre of the surrounding woods mavis danced to the rhythm in exact unison with the gentle breaths which came and went she bent her golden head to listen critically to the murmurings and swung and swayed and floated to the melody of nature her feet and arms scarcely moved her slender body was almost still yet by subtle movements she contrived to interpret the meaning of the hour a low low note from the tree tops would send her floating across the grass a pause would bring her to a statue stillness and a dying sigh as the wind lost heart stirred her limbs to gentle movements like the tremblings of a flower on its stalk poised gracefully in the radiant light in her white garb and with her mystical gestures timed to the nature sounds she looked like a spirit of the woods gerald faintly grasped for one fleeting moment the idea of the sacred dances of old when every gesture and every pose was a sign of power to draw down the hierarchy of heaven to the physical plane then the wind died away and the golden notes of the nightingale fluted through the trees one bird trilled wild music and another replied with a scattering of liquid notes like falling rain all the marvelous enchantment of the night was in that speechless song and the young man's heart beat in measure with the pulse of nature he rose abruptly to his feet and when mavis floated within the circle of his arms they went round her passionately like a tamed bird she rested on his heaving breast and looked up smilingly into his brown eyes mavis read therein all that the wind and the nightingale had been trying to tell her and when the man's lips were pressed ardently to her own she felt as though she had stepped from the twilight of unformed things into the glory of sunlight and song oh she panted nestling to his heart what does this mean love he breathed love which changes man into god and again his lips sought hers with a thrill she yielded to the first caress she had ever known and the nightingale sang triumphantly in the thicket but now the song was no longer wordless she knew all that the bird could tell which is love love and love again whispered the fairy prince then mavis began to weep with a natural fear of the unknown and gerald consoled her as a mother consoles a child she clung to him in the shadow of the tree silent and wondering and with something of pain the pain of the reborn when the fire of love purifies the soul a veil had fallen from her eyes and beholding the secret shrine of the god she trembled and wept and joyed all in a breath it is wonderful wonderful terrible she murmured oh gerald if you leave me i shall die you are part of me your soul is blended with mine you love me oh say that you love me as i love truth and beauty and wisdom and all things that make up our conception of god there was silence for a few minutes and the two human beings who were really one felt that they were alone in this wonderful white world alone with god and this is love murmured mavis dreamily part of love said gerald softly what do you mean dearest the veil of love is beauty yes we must remove that veil we must look behind it to see what love really means in the innermost can we we are about to he drew her closer to his breast the inner meaning of love is sacrifice sacrifice said mavis puzzled and that sacrifice we must make if we would know the real and true meaning of love do you mean that we must part she gasped withdrawing herself for a time he assured her only for a time say a week oh mavis stretched out her arms langorously how can i live through seven days without you by knowing that sacrifice is the soul of love but why must you go she entreated oh do not go darling let us be always together in this garden i fear bellaria will object said haskins smiling she will never know oh yes we cannot always meet by stealth bellaria is a woman and will sooner or later discover our secret then there is geary and your guardian mavis shivered i am afraid of geary with his big knife but not of bellaria or my guardian she will be a little angry but when i tell her how happy i am she will be glad and my guardian is always kind oh gerald tell him that you love me and wish me to be your wife then he will stop geary from coming here and we can be happy haskins hugged her to his breast and smiled grimly in the darkness he was very certain that if he told major rebb there would be no end of trouble in order to arrive at some conclusion it was necessary to make inquiries as to why rebb kept the girl in the pixy's house when that was known steps might be taken to release her and when she was released she could be presented to the world as mrs gerald haskins but to make inquiries it was necessary that he should go to london and consult tod who was sharp enough in professional matters and a visit to london meant a seven days' separation from mavis i don't think that the major will be overpleased at my wooing you by stealth said gerald choosing his words so as not to alarm her you see i should have come openly and with his permission he would not have given it until i was twenty one cried mavis he said that i was to see no one for the next ten months precisely and that is why i have made love to you secretly explained haskins cheerily now darling heart i wish you to be brave and to help me only tell me what you wish me to do and i'll do it said mavis with a little shudder only i don't like pain to love truly we must suffer pain my sweetheart pain and sacrifice are the demands of love had we an eternity of pleasure without any disagreeables even you and i should grow weary oh no no she clung to him ah my sweet he said sadly we are but flesh and blood and so may grow weary of too perfect bliss the flower that is always in the sun wilts and dies and after all the delights of life lie in contrast what do you mean by that gerald haskins saw that he was speaking too highly for her comprehension so talked on a lower plane for the night was passing and he had to ride back to silbury my dear he said slowly i should like to stay here for ever with you and then we would be as gods but if we wish to know the true meaning of love as i explained we must sacrifice ourselves to the necessities of life we must part for seven days i have to go to london mavis and search out matters what matters but haskins wisely declined to explain in detail lest he should alarm her for she must never know the true character of major rebb gerald did not know it himself at the moment but he suspected that when the past of rebb was searched into there would be some things found which would not bear the light of day i have to go on private business he said evasively when i return you shall know what is necessary in the meantime my own brave girl you must hold fast our secret and not allow bellaria to guess that we have even met much less that we are engaged mavis stood up slim and strong with a brave light in her wonderful eyes i promise she said simply i promise sweetheart he rose also and kissed her and then they walked slowly up the path through the archway and stopped again under the beech i shall return in seven days said gerald anxious to go yet loth to depart only be silent live as you have hitherto lived and i can never do that my dearest she said flushing the world is all changed you are my world you are my oh she broke down haskins folded her in his arms and their lips met in one last long kiss then he left her silently that was true wisdom for a single word might have detained him for ever in that enchanted garden chapter viii legal advice it's nutty but not what i call top hole straight mr macandrew i am consulting you professionally so i must ask you to use the king's english it can't explain my feelings jerry it can't indeed what am i to say when you tell me that you have fallen in love in five minutes you loved charity when you first set eyes on her tod that's different snapped the solicitor she's an angel it's only right to love an angel like winking when you spot her i quite agree with you and so i loved mavis is this girl pretty haskins smiled to himself as he had not yet informed tod of the marvelous resemblance between the dancer and the recluse yes she is pretty he said calmly huh from tod that doesn't sound enthusiastic if you wish me to give details no no macandrew looked alarmed none of your beastly blank verse i understand that you wish to consult me professionally well replied haskins leisurely i have been trying to ram that into your thick head for the last ten minutes clients retorted tod with dignity do not call their legal advisers silly cuckoo names he arranged his blotting paper flattened out a sheet of paper and seized a pencil you have my best attention gerald grinned tod's professional airs were too absurd all the same he knew that he could not come to a better man for advice also tod being in love himself was likely to be more sympathetic than a regular dry as dust lawyer one moment toddy said haskins taking out a silver case i want to light a cigarette first have one these said the outraged tod significantly are business hours so i should think from your ridiculously serious face nature intended you for a chubby bacchus without any clothes toddy but circumstance has stuffed you into a stupid little office to mislead people on points of law the office is capital said tod heatedly i pay a very high rent you are being cheated then i'll i'll i'll have a cigarette ended tod weakly it was too hot to argue haskins had come up on the previous day and having slept on his business had repaired to the grimy office in chancery lane to consult his solicitor mr james ian robert roy macandrew which was the lawyer's gorgeous name usually shortened to tod by his friends because of his ruddy hair possessed two rooms sparsely furnished the outer room contained two lean clerks and an office boy who labored to increase a gradually growing business while the inner room was sacred to the master brain that was building up that same business there was a green painted safe an important looking escritoire with a sliding lid three or four chairs a battered bookcase containing tod's somewhat limited library and piles of japaned deed boxes in iron frames everything looked very legal and very dry and very dusty with the exception of tod himself spick and span and far too fashionably dressed for chancery lane tod should have been strolling in the row and if dead and gone macandrews had not squandered their money he probably would have been beside charity bird if possible as it was tod looking fresh and well fed and well groomed and alert dwelt for many hours daily in a dull room which his ancestors would have scorned but tod had been compelled to lay down the ancestral claymore and take up the pen which was hard on tod who much preferred a kilt to a lawyer's wig however it was useless to be dignified with jerry haskins as tod decided so after a glance at the door to see that it was closed he unbent he lighted a cigarette and produced a bottle of whisky and two glasses and a syphon not wishing that his clerks should see him unbend to this bacchanalian extent mr macandrew cast a second look at the door and advised gerald in scarcely legal language to fire away you've been playing the high kick oh houp la since i left you said tod with a jolly grin i've been doing nothing of the sort cried haskins indignantly this is very serious is it now bantered the lawyer well when a man decides to marry a girl whom he has only seen for five minutes i rather think it is infernally serious how did she manage to hook you what a beastly low mind you have tod h'm shut up and hold yourself tight i am going to startle you startle away tod gripped the arms of his sedate chair well then this mavis durham is the living image of charity bird macandrew stared and glared you're rotting boy there can only be one angel in the world and there are two of this especial make insisted gerald leaning back i say toddy do be serious but are you serious i am confound you don't i look it macandrew stared and glared again there is a change in you he admitted love i suppose it's the same with myself tod you don't know what love is oh don't i hang your beastly conceit well then i just do i love my heavenly charity no end so there but aren't you pulling my leg when you say that charity is the image of this mavis girl don't call her a mavis girl miss durham to you tod very well then miss bird to you haskins sighed resignedly we'll never get on at this rate i am really and truly in trouble macandrew do listen tod nodded and his face grew serious haskins seized the fortunate moment and detailed everything from the finding of the sealed message which was scarcely necessary since tod had hooked the cylinder to the parting with mavis on that enchanted night what do you think of it toddy questioned haskins anxiously it's very rum murmured tod making pencil marks on his blotting paper why does rebb keep this girl shut up that is what i wish to learn you must help me i'm only too glad but how don't you remember how mrs geary said that if mavis left the pixy's house the major would not be able to dash about in his motor car yes what of that it hints at money belonging to mavis which the major is using oh i say tod fell back in his chair you go too far i don't hold a brief for rebb but he wouldn't be such a blackguard as that besides he has six thousand a year i know that for a fact who told you mrs berch what mrs crosby's mother yes a grim old lady ain't she rather like my grandmother she is not very fond of rebb as he is not very polite to her still she wants mrs crosbie to marry him because of the money how she found out i can't say but she certainly stated that rebb had the income i mentioned but i thought that both mrs berch and her daughter were well off they assume to be answered tod with a shrug and a wink that is they have a slap up flat and go everywhere and mrs crosbie wears expensive frocks although the old woman looks like a rag shop at times that may not be lack of money but indifference to dress humph as if any woman old or young could be indifferent to frocks anyhow mrs crosbie is supposed to be a wealthy widow in the market but if she wants to marry major rebb who is not a nice man and if mrs berch wants to be rebb's mother in law it strikes me that the two may not be so rich as they pretend well well well cried gerald impatiently we are wandering from the subject rebb you say has six thousand a year on the authority of mrs crosbie's mother yes well then tod i want you to know how rebb comes to be possessed of that six thousand a year can you find out well no you might ask the income tax people i can't help thinking said haskins staring at the dusty carpet that the money belongs to mavis if you think that on the few words let slip by mrs geary said tod scornfully you haven't got a leg to stand on i go by my intuitions also toddy they rarely deceive me witness my distrust of geary i was right in thinking that he had to do with rebb and the pixy's house macandrew nodded yes you were right so far but you assume too much in accusing major rebb of taking miss durham's money it is only a guess said gerald impatiently i may be wrong of course tod still you must see that there is something queer in rebb keeping mavis shut up and in putting about this rumor of her being affected with a homicidal mania you are sure that isn't true ventured macandrew cautiously haskins grew wrathful good heavens toddy do you take me for an ass you silly blighter i tell you the girl is as sane as i am and a deal more sane than you are then why does rebb shut her up i want to find that out i tell you snapped the other savagely tod reflected perhaps this girl is rebb's daughter he guessed haskins started as well he might i can't believe that he declared violently she hasn't a drop of rebb's blood in her body and even if she were his daughter he went on in a contradictory fashion that is no reason that he should shut her in that gaol and set a beastly nigger to keep his eye on her n o drawled macandrew his eye on the blotting paper you say that this girl is like charity the very image of her that is partly why i fell in love so rapidly tod before you came along i did love charity in a way admired her beauty and all that but somehow she never made my heart beat now mavis is just as lovely as charity and more so no no no growled tod striking the desk yes yes yes insisted haskins besides there is something in her personality which charity lacks i feel my heart beat and my pulses thrill and my whole being raised to heaven when mavis looks at me so do i when i look at charity retorted the lawyer but for heaven's sake jerry don't let us pit the girls against one another mavis suits you and charity suits me there's no more to be said save that the girls might be twins i never heard that charity had a twin nor did i but then we don't know charity's history i do in part said tod quickly when mrs pelham odin was traveling with her own comedy company in india fifteen or sixteen years ago she found charity at calcutta the child was then five years of age and belonged to a native woman of the juggler caste native do you mean to say that charity has nigger blood no snapped tod sharply i don't you have only to look at her to see that she is purely european the native woman confessed to mrs pelham odin that she had picked up the child from an ayah at simla for a few rupees the ayah had perhaps stolen the child from some english people or perhaps the mother was dead at any rate the native woman bought the child and taught her to dance in the show she and her husband went round with mrs pelham odin took a fancy to the child's beauty and bought her from this native woman and adopted her as her daughter in a way she called her charity because of the way in which she was found and bird because of her silvery voice ha gerald started another point of resemblance mavis has a voice like a nightingale tod i must learn mavis's past life these two girls must be connected in some way the resemblance is too wonderful there are chance likenesses hinted tod slowly i daresay but nature doesn't turn out two girls line for line the same unless she sends them into the world as twins mavis was brought to the pixy's house when she was five years of age but she doesn't remember where she lived before that she is twenty one in ten months by jupiter tod hoisted himself up with a curious look that's odd for charity told me that she would be twenty one next year and then could run away with me perhaps there is something in what you say jerry after all what's to be done haskins pinched his chin let us leave the question of the resemblance alone for the moment tod what i want you to do is to go to somerset house and look up the wills the wills whose will what will look up any will made by anyone called durham go back fifteen or twenty years of course said gerald apologetically it is only my fancy based upon the few words let drop by mrs geary but i feel somehow in my bones as the old women say that mavis is being kept a prisoner on account of money tod fidgeted it's such a wild idea he protested wild or not it is six and eightpence in your greedy legal pocket rebb might not like my prying into his private affairs i don't see that rebb need know anything about it said gerald impatiently in fact i want to keep my doings dark in the rebb direction for if there is anything in my belief the major will do his best to queer my pitch if you look up the will of a man or of a woman called durham rebb cannot say anything as neither you nor i are supposed to know anything about the pixy's house business well tod nodded and made a note i'll search he assented any will by someone called durham man or woman and dated some fifteen or twenty years ago suppose i find nothing and suppose you do retorted his friend rising we are searching for a needle in a haystack remember toddy and must poke about in every direction we'll look into the money business first and then we can question mrs pelham odin and bellaria as to the possibility of there being any relationship between these two girls see here remarked macandrew slowly all this talk is first rate if you were writing a story and knew the end but it seems to me that as we have to deal with real life you are making circumstances to fit in with your theories perhaps i am replied haskins with a shrug but i am so much in love with mavis that i shall move heaven and earth to get her why not be bold and ask rebb straight out then he could tell you the story of the girl's birth and perhaps may explain why she is so like charity if rebb dislikes this mavis so much that he shuts her up he won't mind your taking her off his hands oh yes he will if money goes with her said gerald grimly i don't want to make rebb think that i am in love the whole business is shady do you mean your love making asked tod slyly no you rotter my love making is as straight as rebb's ways are crooked do what i say and when we learn if there is a will well we'll know how to move next meanwhile i intend to tell the story that i have told you to mrs crosbie but i say she'll go straight and tell rebb no said haskins decisively i have known mrs crosbie for years and she is as honest and good a little woman as ever lived mrs berch is also a ripping sort if somewhat funereal if major rebb is a villain and i really believe that he is i don't want mrs crosbie's life to be made miserable by marrying him or mrs berch's either you know how she adores her daughter all the same mrs crosbie may tell rebb insisted tod macandrew i don't think so i shall enlist her sympathies on my behalf every woman loves a love affair then my story will put her on her guard against major rebb and she'll probably contrive to find out the truth of the business without his knowing good day toddy boy haskins shot out of the office rapidly but macandrew sat soberly at the desk shaking his red poll it appeared to him that gerald was about to climb the hill difficulty and might not reach the top chapter ix mrs crosbie that same afternoon when mr haskins was arraying himself in a bond street kit to call on the fascinating widow he was seized with a sudden qualm as to the wisdom of his intention after all as tod very truly observed mrs crosbie was supposed to be engaged to major rebb although no official announcement had appeared in the morning post if then he related the secret which was connected with the pixy's house and with a pretty girl mrs crosbie inspired by jealousy might forthwith demand an explanation from rebb in that case vulgarly speaking the fat would be on the fire and there would be a fine blaze on the other hand gerald wished to enlist mrs crosbie on his side for two reasons firstly she had been the close friend of his mother to whom he had been tenderly attached and as a boy he had flirted with her in the calf love stage they now were what tod would call pals and gerald usually took all his troubles to her for she was a wise little woman of course there were nasty people who called mrs crosbie an adventuress and who said that she had nagged her late husband to death but these were in the minority so far as haskins could read character and he prided himself thereon mrs crosbie was a good woman who certainly ought not to marry a rascal like rebb and that the major was a rascal gerald believed perhaps on insufficient premises for after all there might be an honest explanation of the pixy's house mystery in the second place haskins wished to remove mavis from her prison and as some time would necessarily have to elapse before he could marry her he desired to place her under the wing of mrs crosbie since the widow was connected with rebb this seemed rather like putting mavis into the lion's cage but mrs crosbie was the sole woman of haskins acquaintance of whom he could ask the favor of chaperoning a young girl also once mavis was at the flat and practically beyond rebb's reach since he then could not hide her again there would be no necessity for further concealment and the major would have to account to mrs crosbie for the detention of his ward in devonshire the explanation which would have to precede the marriage of mrs crosbie to rebb could then be detailed to haskins and all things would be made straight of course there was always a chance that they might be too crooked to be straightened if so it was the more necessary that mavis should be placed in mrs crosbie's guardianship and that the little woman's eyes should be opened bearing these things in mind haskins descended into the street to call a hansom and proceeded to visit mrs crosbie she dwelt along with her mother in a palatial block of mansions known as ladysmith court and which had been erected by a financier of south african fame the mansions were situated near marylebone road and although the address was not ultra fashionable the rents were high when gerald paid his cab at the foot of the marble steps and surveyed the huge pile of redbrick buildings he reflected that tod must be wrong about the widow's financial position only a rich woman could afford to live here and there could be no money grubbing idea in connection with the rebb marriage even though the major had six thousand a year nevertheless it was strange that mrs crosbie should marry rebb when he was so much disliked by mrs berch of whom her daughter was extraordinarily fond mrs crosbie's flat was on the second floor and gerald was shown into a small but smart drawing room by a neat maid servant it was a true woman's room luxuriously furnished prettily decorated and filled with all manner of useless knick knacks and fancy china and silver framed photographs and japanese draperies and finally with masses of flowers in many hued vases the scent of the blossoms and the perfume of a burning pastille made the atmosphere fragrant but somewhat heavy in spite of the rose curtained french windows which opened on to a tiny balcony near one of the windows mrs crosbie was seated looking somewhat pale and disturbed and facing her was an overdressed man with white hair and moustache who looked like a foreigner how are you gerald asked mrs crosbie when haskins was announced and addressing him by his christian name according to custom i have not seen you for ages she shook hands and looked at him how brown you are my dear boy allow me to introduce you two men signor venosta mr haskins mr haskins signor venosta who has been amusing me do sit down tea will be in presently alas madam but i must depart said signor venosta who was a stout oily looking italian of the tenor type dressed in too gaudy a style to satisfy gerald's fastidious taste i have been with you one hour you should add that it has seemed like one minute said mrs crosbie with a pretty little laugh and waving a fan for the heat was stifling well if you must go you must she rose and walked with her visitor to the door glancing over her shoulder meanwhile excuse me gerald i shall return soon and she left the room with the italian this marked courtesy was not usual with mrs crosbie as she was a spoilt beauty who preferred that others should wait on her rather than that she should trouble herself about others haskins wondered at her self denial and especially in the face of such heat wondered also that she should look so pale and worried apparently something was wrong with mrs crosbie and he began to conjecture whether tod was correct as to money matters gerald was not over rich himself but he determined to question his mother's friend and learn if possible what bothered her so that he could proffer help his hostess returned after some minutes and looked quite herself but the renewed color might have been due to the reflection of the rose hued curtains she tripped across the olive green carpet like a fairy and resembled one being delicate and tiny and beautifully formed people said that mrs crosbie's blonde hair and pink and white complexion were due to art since a woman of forty could not possibly look so young without artificial aids but be this as it may she certainly appeared wonderfully pretty in her white silk tea gown which was draped with expensive lace haskins complimented her on her looks when she sank again into her chair and took up the cigarette case lying on the table at her elbow and yet you know added gerald thoughtfully i fancied that you looked worried and pale when i came mrs crosbie lighted her cigarette and shot a keen glance at him we all have our worries my dear boy she said blowing a wreath of smoke you should not have any mrs crosbie and if there is anything that i can put right you know that i yes yes i know she interrupted hurriedly but you can't it really is nothing oh nothing at all it is the heat that makes me look pale and washed out mother is lying down quite exhausted but will be in to tea i hope no one else will come gerald and then we can have a nice long talk that is what i have come to have he said soberly and produced his own cigarette case which he laid on the table give me a match please thank you he lighted up i am in trouble and you have come to me as usual yes i hope that i don't carry coals to newcastle mrs crosbie shrugged my troubles are only minor ones such as come to every woman when she gets past her youth you are in the flower of it and you have known me for years gerald you certainly must have irish blood in you to pay such extravagant compliments don't think too well of me my dear boy i have my faults why not look at the upbringing that i have had she ended bitterly why your mother is all that a mother can and should be interrupted the little woman i know that gerald but her husband my father was a brute my husband whom he made me marry in my teens was a brute both my mother and i have suffered poverty and nearly open shame poverty gerald glanced round the luxurious room crowded with such splendid things mrs crosbie shrugged again these are only necessities she said contemptuously fancy a woman of my tastes having to live in a flat and being bothered by tradespeople i want a town house a country house a yacht a chance of traveling all over europe like other rich people in fact i want thousands a year and i have not got them gerald looked down meditatively so tod was right after all and mrs crosbie was hard up even to the extent of being dunned by tradespeople he wondered if he could help her you have known me long enough to accept a check he stammered she whiffed away the offer contemptuously although i thank you very much for offering the money she said graciously you always were a dear boy but the amount of money i want would ruin you since i am aware that you have but the five hundred a year left by your dear mother there there she tapped him with her closed fan we won't talk further of these disagreeable things all will be well when you marry major rebb asked haskins pointedly why not the major is not bad looking and has a good position and at least five thousand a year six i believe corrected gerald who told you that tod macandrew he heard it from your mother mrs crosbie nodded yes i believe that my mother asked mr macandrew some questions regarding settlements on the chance that i should marry major rebb but mr macandrew should not have spoken about this he did not said gerald hastily you can still trust macandrew as your legal adviser he has not betrayed your confidence regarding settlements he merely mentioned major rebb's income how did you come to be talking of major rebb gerald flung the fag end of his cigarette into a silver ashtray and rose to pace the room he could always talk better when in motion i want you to help me madge he remarked you mustn't call me madge said mrs crosbie with a look at the door major rebb would not like it then you are engaged well yes i want money and are you quite sure that rebb has money mrs crosbie started to her feet and crossing the room gripped the young man by his arm her face was perfectly pale and her voice sounded uncommonly hoarse what do you mean i don't mean anything said gerald astonished by her emotion rebb is no doubt as wealthy as king solomon i only meant that you should make sure of the settlement as your friend i could say nothing else but mrs crosbie was not satisfied you have heard no rumor to the effect that major rebb is poor or is likely to lose his money no no no said haskins in perfect good faith do sit down and compose yourself if anything were wrong in that way i should speak out he could say nothing else as of course his idea regarding a possible will and money having been taken from mavis was mere theory mrs crosbie looked at him piercingly after which scrutiny she returned to her seat apparently she counted upon this marriage releasing her from terrible trouble and dreaded lest it should fall through i wish you would not frighten me she said querulously my nerves are not strong mother and i are going away to bognor next week for the change we both need one very badly well she selected another cigarette and became more her bright self which he knew so well so you wish me to help you yes and i wish you to keep what i say to yourself promise she looked at him hard you are very mysterious i am very much in earnest he rejoined dryly mrs crosbie shuffled i can't promise until i know what you are going to say she observed irritably her nerves as she had said were certainly very bad there is something in that replied haskins and felt inclined to withdraw without telling his story but after some reflection he compromised at all events you must hold your tongue about my secret for at least a month and by naming this time he hoped to deliver mavis from her imprisonment within three weeks i promise said mrs crosbie curiously but i know your secret you are in love gerald was startled how could you tell that he demanded astonished she laughed i am a woman and observant as well as intuitive look at your eyes in yonder mirror at the expression of your face at your whole bearing h'm said haskins but half satisfied every one is not so clever as you are madge don't call me madge i tell you yes i shall when we are alone hang it i have known you for years and besides i wish you to do me a service i have your promise to hold your tongue for a month yes yes yes go on go on i am all ears my story concerns major rebb what then you did mean something when you mentioned him last i meant nothing that will stop your marriage said gerald crossly although i don't know why a nice woman like you madge should marry him mrs crosbie stared major rebb is supposed to be a delightful man he may be to those who don't know him i believe that you are jealous she said with a nervous laugh well and how does your secret affect the major see here madge you may think me mean speaking about rebb to you and behind his back but i am doing so at that risk because i wish you to help some one in whom i am interested otherwise i am quite ready to see rebb personally and have it out with him later on say in three weeks more or less i shall for then i hope that mavis will be with you here and quite safe mavis ah the girl you are in love with what is she to major rebb may i ask mrs crosbie's voice rose when she put this question and her eyes grew as hard as jade while her face colored a deep red ah said haskins surprised then you love rebb no but he is rich and i don't see what right you have to ask me such questions go on what have you to say if you love rebb i can't speak i don't love rebb go on i'll keep my promise gerald hesitated no longer rising to his feet he again began to pace the room and related the same story as he had told tod only in this especial instance he suppressed his theory regarding the will and the money mrs crosbie listened quietly and with an expression of dismay but she made no remark until he had finished you are telling me a fairy tale she said quietly yes isn't it cried gerald delighted with her quietness i mean that it is untrue i swear it isn't mavis is kept in that pixy's house and i found her by means of the sealed message as i have described now i want you to get her up here and look after her until i can marry who will bring her here i shall and within three or four weeks ah said mrs crosbie quietly now i see why you asked me to hold my tongue for a month gerald you are wrong to act in this way as i have made a promise i shall keep it but it will be better for you to release me from that promise then i could ask major rebb about his ward and persuade him to let me have her up here in any case when i marry major rebb i shall have to do with this girl you love what you suggest madge would certainly be better and i may say more straightforward i hate acting in this way behind rebb's back and i intend later to speak plainly to his face but you forget how rebb has put it about that mavis is a homicidal maniac that is untrue you can't be sure of that gerald you have not seen sufficient of her to judge to take a girl reputed mad from her seclusion would be very wicked any crime which she might commit would be laid at your door but surely madge the action of major rebb is not that he may have and probably has good grounds for shutting up the girl gerald bit his lip beginning to see that with all his caution he had made a dire mistake then you won't help me no said mrs crosbie firmly how can you expect me to help you against major rebb when we are engaged to be married and how can you ask me to take charge of a girl who is mad she is not mad i tell you and i tell you that she is mad otherwise major rebb certainly would not shut her up what reason could he have to shut up a sane girl it was on the point of haskins' tongue to explain his theory but having made one mistake as he plainly saw from mrs crosbie's attitude he did not wish to make another you will keep your promise of silence he urged earnestly yes on condition that you make no attempt to run away with the girl from that madhouse i speak in your own interest you will get into trouble if you take an insane woman from her lawful guardian you seem to be quite certain that mavis is mad said gerald bitterly however as you know my secret and i am at your mercy i promise i think that you are very ungrateful cried mrs crosbie many another woman would have declined to keep what you call the secret at all i have made a mistake confessed gerald and he could have kicked himself that he a man of the world should be such a fool well said mrs crosbie as the door opened to admit the servant with afternoon tea let us say no more about it i promise to hold my tongue for a month and you promise to leave the girl alone meanwhile gerald waited until the tea tray was arranged and the girl had departed no he said decisively i have been wrong and you have shown me my duty i shall call on major rebb to morrow and explain you cannot replied mrs crosbie the major is in devonshire this announcement complicated matters then i follow rebb to devonshire said gerald doggedly my mistake must be put right chapter x the amulet it is admitted that man as a whole is not infallible but each individual man has a secret belief that he is haskins was no more complacent than other mortals in fact less so yet he had an idea that his caution and common sense invariably prevented his making mistakes assuredly as a rule he was rarely in error but to every rule there is an exception and haskins' ill judged frankness to mrs crosbie was the exception in this case it said much for gerald's sane view of life that he recognized his mistake at once and at the cost of some unpleasantness hastened to correct it this entailed an interview with major rebb which was likely to be a stormy one at the outset gerald believed that he had read mrs crosbie's character all wrong and that even after years of close companionship since she had been so intimate with his mother he knew very little about her had she really been that which he believed her to be she would he thought immediately on leaving ladysmith court have readily helped him in his somewhat eccentric wooing but on calmer reflection he arrived at the conclusion that he himself was in error his first mistake lay in overlooking the relationship existing between rebb and the widow being engaged to him as she had admitted she certainly could not be expected to act against what she believed to be his interests and his second mistake consisted in hoping that mrs crosbie who in many ways was particularly conventional would take charge of a girl believed to be insane it was only natural that mrs crosbie should believe mavis to be mad as being willing to accept the major as her second husband she could scarcely credit him with conspiracy and if mavis was not insane her detention in the pixy's house was certainly a conspiracy against her rights as a human being gerald took this view from personal observation and because he mistrusted rebb but mrs crosbie as engaged to marry the major could not be expected to endorse a theory which would render rebb unworthy of her hand or indeed of her acquaintance it may be here mentioned that haskins had not mentioned the wonderful likeness which existed between charity and mavis since the thought had flashed across him while speaking that such a statement might implicate tod in the mysterious business which was not to be thought of all mrs crosbie practically knew was that gerald loved a reputedly insane ward of her promised husband and desired her to side against that promised husband so that he might marry the girl it was impossible to expect that any woman would act in this way and gerald acknowledged to himself that mrs crosbie had behaved in a perfectly reasonable manner in refusing to help him in fact she had behaved extremely well in holding to her promise of one month's secrecy for many a woman would have told rebb there and then what had been said about him therefore mrs crosbie was not only right but gerald felt that he was entirely in the wrong felt indeed that he had acted somewhat shabbily the sole way in which he could right matters and recover his self respect was to see rebb as soon as possible and explain himself then as man to man they could thresh the matter out with this idea haskins drove back to his rooms in frederick street mayfair intending to change and pack and catch the midnight train from paddington to exeter but while dressing he reflected that it would be better to first assure himself that mrs crosbie was correct in stating the major's whereabouts rebb's rooms were also in frederick street and only a few doors away so it would be just as well to run in and to make inquiries rebb might return on the morrow in which case it would hardly be worth while to journey to denleigh so hurriedly also mrs crosbie having promised to hold her tongue for one month there was no necessity to act at once since two or three or even more days would make very little difference finally gerald was unwilling to return to the pixy's house and to mavis until he knew if his theory regarding a possible will was correct otherwise he would have nothing to tell her while meditating on the desirability of calling at rebb's rooms gerald desired to smoke to aid his thoughts after the manner of men he mechanically took his cigarette case but found some difficulty in opening it as his case was usually easy to open he looked down with awakened attention to see what was the matter and found that he had brought away mrs crosbie's cigarette case by mistake probably he had laid his own case on the small table alongside hers and in fact he remembered doing so and when departing had unconsciously taken the one which did not belong to him he resolved to return it at once by post but meanwhile took a cigarette therefrom to smoke since there were no others in his rooms this entailed opening the case and when it was open a small object which had been placed within fell out this proved to be a tiny coral hand clenched and holding a dagger something like those amulets which are sold in naples to avert the evil eye a little gold ring was screwed into the coral so that the trinket could be attached to a watch chain or to a bracelet after a careless glance and a passing thought as to why mrs crosbie should use her cigarette case as a jewel box haskins placed the coral hand on top of the cigarette case which he laid on the mantelpiece then he lighted up and walked out to seek the major's rooms these as has been said were only a few doors distant and haskins speedily arrived on the first floor of the somewhat dingy house wherein they were situated he found the door open and a mild looking valet talking to a veiled woman with a graceful figure while waiting to address the man himself gerald heard him state to the lady that his master had gone to devonshire on the previous day and would be back within four and twenty hours the lady appeared annoyed but declined to leave a card or to give any message however she stepped aside fuming as haskins guessed from the way in which she stamped her foot and clenched her hands and permitted him to speak gerald asked the same question as to the major's whereabouts and received the same answer upon which he produced his card tell major rebb when he returns that mr haskins wishes to see him on a private matter mr gerald haskins added the young man handing the card then he turned away wondering why the veiled woman should utter a muffled exclamation of surprise when she heard the christian name but his wonder was still further increased when on descending the stairs he felt his arm grasped and found that the strange lady was at his elbow you are mr gerald she said in deep contralto tones may i call you prince gerald haskins started it was in this way that mavis addressed him but this woman could not be mavis for she was too thin and too tall and her voice was too worn could she be bellaria he said tentatively bellaria assented the woman softly they were standing on the pavement by this time take me somewhere safe i wish to speak with you my rooms are close at hand said haskins promptly and wondering at this unexpected encounter with one whom he had believed to be miles away we can go there at once bell hush she clutched his arm again and looked over her shoulder as she had looked when in the quadrangle don't say that name here they may hear they may hear who may hear never mind never mind come inside come inside oh dio no mention of my name and she hurried into the doorway indicated by gerald in a few minutes they were in haskins' sitting room and here again bellaria's nervousness betrayed itself there is no one can hear us she asked her veil up and her eyes roving round the room no no replied the young man soothingly the man and his wife who attend to me in these chambers are below you can talk freely by the way he asked abruptly how did you know my name bellaria looking more aged and haggard than ever flung herself into an armchair and laughed uncomfortably prince gerald who calls you prince gerald mr haskins mavis does but then it is true what she confessed to me that you love her and she loves you quite true rejoined haskins quickly we met by chance and by chance repeated bellaria scornfully when you deliberately came where you had no business to come i know all how did you find out gerald was perfectly calm when he asked this question as she did not seem to be hostile i saw that mavis was not herself that she was disturbed and guessed that she was keeping something secret from me i watched and saw her lead a man across the quadrangle when she came in that night i told her what i had seen and so she confessed about the sealed message and about her secret meetings with you also that you desired to marry her fool cried bellaria pointing a scornful finger at her host would you marry a madwoman not in making mavis durham my wife said haskins coolly she is perfectly sane and i bellaria dondi say that she is not are you sane yourself asked haskins turning the tables on her the woman reared herself in her chair gripping the arms and directed a fierce gaze at him what do you mean she demanded why did you not come out and face me when mavis talked with me in the garden he remarked meeting her gaze firmly and fairly because because oh there is no explanation i think there is you dare not venture out after dark so you waited until mavis entered the house to question her how do you know that i dare not venture out after dark she asked and her figure seemed to dwindle and shrink mavis told me mavis knows nothing nothing do you hear god forbid that she should ever know anything but my business is my own business and has nothing to do with you prince gerald mavis is crazy she would kill you as soon as look at you at certain times i don't believe that for one moment you must you shall if mavis is not mad why should her guardian shut her up in a lonely house that said gerald very dryly is what i went to major rebb's rooms to ask when i met you bellaria arose much astonished you will dare to face the major haskins laughed do you take me for a schoolgirl of course i shall face the major and a dozen like him if necessary you are a brave man and major rebb what is he the kindest and best friend that a miserable woman ever had retorted the woman fiercely not a word against the major i won't hear a word i tell you what he does is right not in shutting up mavis she is mad i tell you mad and dangerous bellaria came close to where gerald was sitting and looked down into his face with a determined expression on learning what i did learn from mavis i came up at once to tell major rebb so that he might stop it i fear major rebb will find it somewhat difficult to stop it he is not the ruler of the earth so far as i know he is my ruler cried bellaria grandiloquently so i should think when the mere wish to give him information makes you risk risk what risk what she demanded quivering haskins shrugged his square shoulders your life for all i know she stood looking at him with clenched hands the expression on her worn face hovering between terror and defiance you talk of what you do not understand she said breathing hard quite right but i should like to understand understand what why bellaria dondi who was a famous singer should bury herself in a lonely devonshire house to keep a sane girl prisoner you have been listening she cried out in terror how do you know that i was a singer i heard you sing the shadow song from dinorah during one of my visits and when hidden behind the beech tree near the wall i heard you say that you had been a great singer bellaria covered her face with two thin hands and the tears fell through her fingers i was great i was famous she sobbed i was happy until jealousy undid me but she let her hands drop and flung back her queenly head i only did what any italian woman would have done he betrayed me why should i not betray him major rebb no enrico salviati who swore that he loved me yet left me for another but i punished him he died and perhaps i shall die as he did for all my care they will find me and then oh what agonies i have suffered for many many years this face she struck it was handsome enrico loved it these lips enrico kissed them with the kiss of judas and what better am i what better am i she rushed to the mirror over the mantelpiece to address herself bellaria dondi you can hide in the depths of the sea but they will find you you can augh her eyes fell on the silver cigarette case of mrs crosbie upon which lay delicately the clenched coral hand with the dagger augh she repeated and staggered back what is the matter gerald rose and came forward bellaria repelled him with both hands shaking with dread keep back you english spy you have brought me here you are one of them but if you use the knife i shall scream keep back keep back i don't understand gasped haskins amazed at this outburst the hand the sign the token of death she groaned then keeping her terrified eyes on gerald stole stealthily to the door tna ahi tna lasso me si davvro tna tna uttering these words rapidly and almost in a scream she made the sign of the cross on her breast and vanished by the time that haskins in pursuit had reached the top of the stairs she was at the foot a moment later and she ran swiftly in to the street holding her veil closely over her pallid face what the deuce does it mean gerald asked himself as he returned to his sitting room and examined the coral hand this thing seems to have terrified her almost to death 'tna tna' humph i must learn what that means it is an italian word i expect now what he went on musing on the strange behavior of signora dondi much perplexed and did not notice that a lady was standing in the doorway her cough made him look round and so unnerved was haskins by his late experience that he fairly jumped mrs berch he said recognizing the lady at once i apologize for not seeing you i apologize also said mrs berch in the stern voice habitual to her apologize that is for entering unannounced but the door was open gerald so i took the privilege of old friendship and entered delighted to see you mrs berch said haskins wondering why she had come won't you sit down for one minute and she took a chair mrs berch was a tall thin woman with a worn white face and hair as black as her eyes notwithstanding her age which was over sixty she was dressed in some lustreless dark material without any trimming and carried herself very erect in fact there was something of the roman matron about her so stern and proud did she appear gerald liked her as she had always been kind to him but mrs berch was something of an enigma to him he could not understand why so bold and determined a woman should have submitted to the brutality of her late husband yet mrs crosbie's father had behaved like a demon to his wife as gerald had learned from his mother she adored her daughter and as the saying is lived again in her child you wonder why i have called said mrs berch in an unemotional voice which always reminded haskins of one talking in sleep especially when i was lying down with a headache when you came but madge asked me to bring you this and she produced gerald's cigarette case thank you i left it behind by mistake and took madge's here it is mrs berch arose and received the dainty trifle that is all i called about gerald i shall take it back to madge at once she was much disturbed at losing it i don't know why she should have been said haskins she must have guessed that i had taken it and would send it back oh by the way you may as well put this into it i opened the case for a cigarette and found this it fell out and he passed along the coral hand mrs berch's dead white face flushed and her black eyes glittered i am glad that is not lost she said eagerly it was this that madge was anxious about what is it some ornament to which madge attaches some value i fancy h'm is it the badge of any society mrs berch's flush face faded to a chalky white why do you ask gerald asked a question in his turn did madge tell you what i came to see her about no madge never betrays anyone's confidence but i heard your story you heard it haskins stepped back a pace in his astonishment yes said mrs berch coldly and slipping the case along with the coral hand into her pocket i was asleep on the sofa in the other room which is as you know divided from the drawing room by curtains i woke to hear what you said about that girl and major rebb in the interests of my daughter i listened and you intend to tell major rebb no madge asked me to hold my tongue and indeed gerald i would do so for your own sake major rebb is an ill man to meddle with haskins threw back his head defiantly i am not afraid of rebb he said in a haughty tone i went to see him to day to explain myself but he is in devonshire gone to see his unfortunate ward i expect when he returns i shall demand an explanation he may not give it to you said mrs berch pursing up her mouth he must i love mavis and i intend to marry her but if she is mad she is not mad and well mrs berch there is no use in my talking to you on the matter i did wrong to speak to madge about it since she is to marry major rebb madge will hold her tongue as she promised and so shall i gerald thank you both replied gerald courteously but there will be no need after to morrow i intend to see rebb as i said to learn what to learn said haskins why he shuts up his ward seeing that she is not in my opinion insane also to learn why bellaria who watches mavis buries herself in the pixy's house i heard you talk of the woman said mrs berch in her chilliest manner and i presume that bellaria stops in the pixy's house because she is major rebb's servant there is more in it than that bellaria came to see major rebb this very day and came also here to me since she knows that i have visited mavis bellaria is terrified out of her life because of some people who seek her life when she saw that coral hand which was lying by chance on the mantelpiece she rushed away accusing me of being in league with some society to kill her at least that was what i gathered from what she said but it was sheer raving i think so indeed said mrs berch quietly this coral hand is merely an ornament given by signor venosta whom you met to day to madge it means nothing gerald so think no more about it but when she departed gerald did think and it was little wonder that he did so chapter xi the other girl during the next three days gerald found ample time to reflect upon the strange circumstances which environed him anxious to see the major and place affairs on a proper basis he called thrice at his rooms on the first occasion he learned that rebb had not returned to london on the second it appeared that he had come back but was absent visiting mrs crosbie while on the final occasion haskins was told by the mild looking valet that his master had gone again to devonshire and would not return for at least a week he had left no message said the man from this circumstance gerald inferred that rebb was afraid of the interview it then struck him and very naturally that as the major during his hurried stay in town had called upon mrs crosbie the widow had broken her promise if this was the case rebb had been placed on his guard and so not only avoided haskins but had gone back to the pixy's house to make arrangements for thwarting the young man's curiosity gerald therefore paid a visit to ladysmith court only to learn that the widow and her mother had departed for bognor on a month's holiday it was thus apparent that in these two quarters gerald could do nothing for the moment and indeed the more haskins thought about the matters the more difficult did it appear to set them straight if he saw rebb and the major held to the story of his ward's madness as he assuredly would gerald felt that for some time at all events he could do nothing of course if his theory about the will proved to be correct and if he could be certain that rebb was shutting up mavis in order to enjoy an income which should rightfully be hers then he could take steps to have the matter inquired into to make any beginning at all it was necessary to see tod macandrew so gerald determined to look him up just as he did so the morning post brought a sunday supper invitation from mrs pelham odin this was what tod would have called a coincidence but gerald believing that nothing happened by chance saw in the incident a sign pointing to the path he should tread directed by the unseen powers who were he believed about to unravel the mystery he had not to see rebb or mrs crosbie immediately nor had he to proceed at once to denleigh his duty was to visit mrs pelham odin's flat and learn what he could about charity bird if she was related in any way to mavis durham and the marvelous likeness between the two girls hinted as much he might learn from the old actress sufficient of her adopted daughter's past to give him a clue to the intrigues of major rebb it will be seen that gerald had not proceeded to inquire into the mystery of the coral hand or bellaria's fear of the same he could have learned somewhat about the matter of the trinket by seeing signor venosta who according to mrs berch had given the amulet to the widow but gerald did not know where venosta lived and could not make inquiries from mrs crosbie without her wanting to know his reasons moreover he desired to solve the mystery of mavis and of her detention before searching into bellaria's past certainly he had a shrewd idea that mavis' detention and bellaria's dread and major rebb's behavior and mrs crosbie's possession of the coral hand were all of a piece but these were like the separate parts of a puzzle and he could not fit them together there was nothing for it but to see if he could find a clue into the labyrinth when visiting mrs pelham odin he therefore dressed himself with great care and proceeded in a hansom to bloomsbury where the old actress dwelt her abode was scarcely a flat in the accepted sense of the word but rather a collection of rooms on the first floor of a fine old georgian mansion in caroline street a retired butler and his wife who had been a cook owned the house and attended to the various people who dwelt therein mrs pelham odin was thus spared the trouble of domestic details for which as she said herself she had no head and was very comfortably placed at a moderate charge with the obstinacy of old age she called her abode my flat and no argument could persuade her that the name was wrongly applied haskins entered the large square room with a painted ceiling which was mrs pelham odin's drawing room adjoining was the dining room equally spacious while the two bedrooms occupied by the old lady and her adopted daughter were across the landing the room looked pretty and picturesque as mrs pelham odin had great taste and did not cram her apartments with furniture or indulge in a multiplicity of patterns on carpet or walls or on the upholstery of the chairs a great quantity of flowers adorned the room deftly arranged by charity and it was lighted with rose shaded lamps on tall wrought iron pedestals on entering the door from the staircase three narrow windows could be seen opposite opening on to a small balcony but as the night was a trifle cold these were closed and the yellow curtains were drawn the room looked comfortable and mrs pelham odin was the most comfortable person in it she fitted the apartment as a hermit crab fits its shell the actress with a great sense of the fitness of things had grown old gracefully that is she had not resorted to dye and paint to improve her waning looks she was a small woman and very stout but her dignity was tremendous in a black velvet gown trimmed with lace that might or might not have been priceless with her silvery hair worn in the regal style of marie antoinette with a somewhat massive set of features irradiated by a gracious smile mrs pelham odin received her guest as a queen might have done from a long experience in playing aristocratic old dames in comedy and imperious heroines in tragedy dignity had become a second nature to the clever old actress it is said that gibbon was so long in writing the decline and fall that he ended in believing himself to be the roman empire in a like manner mrs pelham odin believed herself to be the marchioness in caste or helen macgregor or volumnia perhaps a mixture of the three she certainly was tremendously dignified and no stage manager ever dare to take a liberty with her she still appeared on the boards when she found a part worthy of her grandiose style i am glad to see you mr haskins said mrs pelham odin apparently suppressing an inclination to use the royal we and proffered her hand to be shaken or kissed as the visitor preferred gerald having something to gain from a little timely flattery kissed the jeweled fingers he knew that this old world attention appealed to mrs pelham odin as nothing else did you are looking like yourself he said politely i can pay you no higher compliment mrs pelham odin laughed her celebrated silvery laugh which critics always mentioned and took the stage that is she walked the length of the drawing room ever a courtier mr haskins where did you living in this present generation of hurry learn such versailles manners from the queen of the english stage madam from me mrs pelham odin fell into her famous startled fawn attitude also much noticed by critics oh no no i am but a humble survivor of the past and you have survived to show us what grace and dignity once existed the old actress fluttered her fan with a gracious smile and bowed her head to the compliment neither grace nor dignity are necessary in this age of motor cars she said sighing however we must take things as they are and be cheerful you don't ask after charity i am too much taken up with you at present madam ah you irishmen with your blarney well charity is in the dining room with mr macandrew she is showing him some new photographs of herself so will not be here for a few minutes which is just as well why asked gerald taking the seat she indicated mrs pelham odin throned herself queenlike on a sofa what do you think of mr macandrew she asked abruptly he is the best fellow in the world replied haskins promptly for he guessed why she asked the question and was willing to act as tod's trumpeter also he is very clever and some day will be wealthy charity wants to marry him and he wants to marry charity my dear lady i knew that years ago mrs pelham odin nodded of course it is stale news all the same i asked you here to chat over the matter hitherto i have set my face against such a marriage as the match is not a good one for my girl gerald dissented if miss bird marries macandrew she is a lucky young lady to my mind he is of good family he is clever he has a good profession and he is an honest man certainly he has no money but that's just it interrupted the other he has come in lately for a legacy of two thousand pounds that is something but not much still charity is so bent upon this marriage that if you can really swear to all you say about mr macandrew i am willing to consent i certainly should do so come mrs pelham odin don't part two hearts in this cruel way let your daughter marry macandrew the actress sighed i think i shall have to she said after a pause circumstances and charity's will are too strong for me it shall be as you say and she held out her hand haskins kissed it again i am sure that you will have no cause to regret having taken my advice i hope not mr haskins and after all this may be one of those marriages which are said to be made in heaven but mr macandrew wants to marry charity at once and she has yet to fulfil one month's engagement at the belver theatre macandrew can wait for one month surely he must charity cannot break her engagement without paying forfeit and the managers will be sorry to lose her certainly she has only one dance in the moon fay but she is a great favorite with the public and when she retires from the stage she will be greatly missed i assure you mr haskins that charity is giving up a very brilliant career to become the wife of an obscure solicitor macandrew will not always be obscure he will rise high in his profession and will make plenty of money of course lady euphemia is against the marriage what of that macandrew is the chief person to be considered mrs pelham odin did not pay very strict attention to this speech her eyes were on the polished floor and she was thinking deeply i can guess why lady euphemia macandrew disapproves she said hesitatingly my girl is a dancer for one thing and she is also a waif haskins looked up suddenly mrs pelham odin was touching on the very point which he wished to discuss you told macandrew something about that he remarked eagerly yes because i wished mr macandrew to know exactly what he was doing and to tell you the truth mr haskins as i did not wish the marriage to take place i thought that the discovery of charity's birth might put him off since he is well born himself love laughs at rank said gerald i thought you knew nothing of miss bird's birth nor do i save that i bought her from a native woman in calcutta for a small sum it sounds quite like 'uncle tom's cabin' doesn't it and mrs pelham odin laughed again in her silvery manner didn't the woman tell you where she got the child no that is she explained that she had taken over the child from an ayah at simla charity was pretty and i was sorry to see a european child with a juggler and his wife so i took her with me and have brought her up as my own daughter although i did not give her my name do you ever hope to learn about her parents no that is impossible i fear it is quite fifteen or sixteen years since i took possession of her the native woman and the ayah may be dead quite a romance isn't it i can tell you something even more romantic said gerald if you will promise to hold your tongue how delightfully mysterious you are cried mrs pelham odin in her lively comedy manner i promise of course well haskins thereupon and without further preamble detailed the history of his love affair and commented strongly on the wonderful likeness which existed between the two girls mrs pelham odin interrupted him with little cries of astonishment but gave no opinion until he finished his recital what do you think of it asked haskins it is like a play like a melodrama but of course there are casual resemblances such as you describe this is more than a casual resemblance interrupted gerald quickly the two girls might be twins oh what a pity that charity is leaving the stage said mrs pelham odin her theatrical instinct uppermost a comedy with twin girls in it would draw all the town and that gives me an idea i can assist you if you can swear she laid her hand on his arm that this mavis durham is not crazy i can swear certainly would i wish to marry her if she were love may laugh at lunatic asylums as well as at rank said the actress merrily but if you are certain that the girl is sane why not let her take charity's place in the moon fay haskins started to his feet are you serious of course i am you want to run away with this girl if you do major rebb i know him and a nasty man he is will follow you and make himself unpleasant what you want to do is to conceal the girl somewhere until you can prove that her guardian is shutting her up illegally well then major rebb must know of the wonderful resemblance of charity to mavis if charity marries mr macandrew quietly she can go with him to switzerland for a month's honeymoon and even longer i can teach mavis the one dance which charity performs in the ballet at the belver theatre and she can take my girl's place but the theatre people will guess oh dear me no rejoined mrs pelham odin promptly i always go to the belver myself to look after charity she scarcely speaks to a soul my dear mr haskins i can take your mavis there and back without anyone being the wiser if the resemblance is as you say gerald caressed his chin it certainly is an excellent idea he murmured major rebb not knowing of miss bird's marriage would not suspect the substitution thank you mrs pelham odin i shall think over the matter i go down to devonshire next week or rather this week i know the actress nodded one always does get mixed up about sunday being the first day of the week well then go down and make what arrangements you like if you run away with the girl and i quite think you should if only to spite major rebb whom i detest you cannot conceal her better than in the way i suggest it is quite a variation of poe's 'purloined letter' the scheme is so daring that it must succeed but hush she made a dramatic pause and raised her finger here comes romeo and juliet not a word before haskins could reply charity entered from the dining room with tod at her heels and gerald could not help starting when he saw how wonderfully she resembled the girl shut up in the pixy's house she had the same figure the same coloring the same graceful way of walking only in the manner of speaking and in the personality was there a difference and that would not be noticed by a casual spectator charity was more worldly more material and as gerald thought less lovable but then he was prejudiced in favor of the young lady whom he wished to marry tod's opinion would have been quite the reverse how are you mr haskins said charity offering her hand calmly you have not been to see us for years and years all the same i have been hearing about you replied gerald glancing at tod who nodded gaily i have to offer my congratulations well said charity slowly and looking at mrs pelham odin i am not so sure of that my mother doesn't yes she does interposed the actress quickly and took the girl's hand in her own mr macandrew i bestow upon you a priceless treasure and joining the hands of the two lovers she sank back on the sofa with a tiny lace handkerchief to her eyes it was very neatly done and only needed limelight and applause to form an effective curtain oh cried tod clasping charity's hand convulsively do you mean to say that we can marry now that you have enough to keep the wolf from the door i do my dear mr macandrew or shall i say james since you are to be my adopted son in law not james call me tod that is the scottish for fox and you are not foxy never mind mother cried charity whose eyes were dancing with delight the name of tod suits him and toddy is the name of a scottish drink come now come now protested tod when i am so sober you ought to be drunk with happiness said haskins laughing perhaps the poor dear needs food said mrs pelham odin leading the way to the dining room let us see what the cook has done in the way of supper my marriage feast giggled tod taking his seat you'll be best man of course jerry we can talk of these things later said mrs pelham odin hurriedly in consequence of my age i think the marriage will have to be a very quiet one yes nodded charity i don't want lady euphemia to forbid the banns as if she could cried macandrew in the highest spirits it was a very merry supper and mrs pelham odin drank the health of the future bride and bridegroom in foaming champagne also she winked in rather an undignified way at gerald to intimate that she included himself and mavis in the toast then she related various stage experiences connected with her own marriage and eulogized the late mr pelham odin he is an angel now said the widow and wept until gerald made her laugh again chapter xii a wonderful discovery tod macandrew was the happiest of men when he and gerald left mrs pelham odin's flat on that night it was all that haskins could do to keep tod from executing a war dance on the street remember that you are a solicitor warned gerald surely you don't want to appear in the police court otherwise than in a professional capacity i am also a lover cried tod fervently and i care nothing for the opinion of other people legal magisterial or otherwise ass muttered his friend and shook the arm he was holding come out of your midsummer night dream and help me in what way asked tod more soberly i wish to marry mavis durham oh tod became more sober than ever haven't you forgotten her yet gerald stopped in surprise why in heaven's name should i forget her you unsympathetic idiot i love her and i love charity interpolated macandrew enthusiastically then show a trifle of it retorted haskins punning on the name by helping me as i have helped you if it had not been for me mr toddy your future mother in law would not have consented to this marriage tod shook his friend's hand vigorously you're one of the best anything i can do by the way what am i to do forget charity for ten minutes in the first place and get into this approaching hansom in the second i intend to drive you to my rooms what tod pulled out his watch to read the time by the light of the street lamp under which they were standing it's past twelve james ian robert roy macandrew are you or are you not my legal adviser of course i am and oh tod broke off hastily i knew that i had something to tell you about that will you know will then there is a will gasped gerald signaling to a hansom yes the will of captain julian durham who get in get in interrupted haskins testily as the cab drew up 'longside we have much to say to one another tod jumped into the cab and shortly gerald slipped in beside him after giving his address when the hansom was spinning along gerald turned on tod sharply why didn't you communicate with me about this will when you knew how anxious i was i only learned the truth yesterday said tod quickly and wrote a letter asking you to call you should have received it this morning well then i didn't it's that infernal office boy i'll sack him probably he has never posted it well then i searched for wills in the name of durham made about the time you mention there are plenty of people of that name and i had to read through a lot of documents finally i found that captain julian durham was your man how do you know because the property of captain julian durham is left to his daughter mavis gerald uttered so loud an ejaculation that the cabman looked down through the trap thinking that he was receiving an order no no cabby it's all serene drive on to frederick street when the trap was closed he addressed himself to macandrew then i was right quite right assented tod admiringly though how the deuce you knew i didn't know but i had an intuitive feeling tod groaned some more of your confounded occult stuff very good said gerald dryly i accept the rebuke but explain my intuition if you please what is your intuition exactly i believe said haskins seriously and choosing his words carefully that mavis has been shut up by rebb to keep her out of the way while he enjoys her income this time tod uttered an ejaculation i believe that there is something in your occult rubbish after all he said in a wondering manner for the situation is exactly as you say ah gerald was triumphant and would have uttered an exultant speech but that the cab stopped in frederick street here we are tod get out how much cabby two shillings there you are wait till i open the door macandrew there run upstairs i'll follow rattling on in this way haskins and his friend went up the dimly lighted stairs for the gas was not full on and soon found themselves in gerald's comfortable sitting room haskins lighted the lamp he detested electric and gas and passed along a box of cigars to his visitor tod was also accommodated with a glass of whisky and soda and a comfortable armchair gerald being similarly provided leaned forward eagerly now toddy tell me exactly what the will says tod's eyes strayed to an adjacent table why there's my letter after all that infernal boy did post it i daresay your man didn't bring it up you should row him jerry and oh bother tell me about the will i can read your letter later well then said macandrew deliberately julian durham made a will at brighton more than twenty years ago disposing of six thousand a year ha rebb's exact income yes only i think rebb has five or six hundred a year of his own in addition the income of durham was left to his infant daughter mavis and michael rebb was appointed her guardian and a pretty guardian he has been muttered gerald savagely you may well say that jerry the will says that rebb is to enjoy the whole income on condition that he educates and brings up the child in a proper way which he has not done since mavis can neither read nor write couldn't the will be upset by that tod we'll come to that later but i would point out that the will provides for rebb only until mavis marries when she marries the six thousand a year passes to her at once on her wedding day in fact only rebb is not forced to account for what he has used up to that date haskins jumped up and began to walk up and down as he was accustomed to do when much excited then i am to understand that if i marry mavis major rebb loses six thousand a year exactly he reverts to his original five or six hundred which apparently he possessed before getting his brother officer to make this preposterous will in his favor as it practically is haskins stopped his brother officer yes durham was in a goorkha regiment and so was rebb later i daresay rebb exchanged to the west indies i always heard that he came from that place yes jamaica said haskins mechanically thinking of geary so this is why rebb has shut up the girl and put about the rumor that she is crazy the plotting beast he's all that nodded the solicitor emphatically in that way he prevents mavis ever getting a husband and so while she remains unmarried he can enjoy his income or rather her income in a legal way in a legal way echoed gerald disgusted why the man ought to be hanged and quartered you can punish him more by depriving him of his income oh i'll do that so far as i am personally concerned i don't care two straws for the income oh come now human nature i don't go by human nature interrupted haskins sharply i go by my own feelings i would marry mavis without one penny since my five hundred a year and what i make by writing is enough to keep things going but rebb must be punished and i shall do all i can to deprive him of this six thousand a year there is no necessity to bother said tod soothingly the thing acts automatically as you might say when mavis becomes your wife the money is paid over or rather the income is transferred to her on the wedding day the sole chance that rebb has of keeping his money is to prevent the marriage oh he'll do his best to do that said gerald with a frown i'll tell you what tod that man won't stop short of murder oh you shouldn't yes i should mavis is under the impression that all girls are brought up in conventual seclusion and are not allowed to see young men rebb for obvious reasons told her so but she understands that she is to be taken into the world when she is one and twenty her twenty first birthday is only ten months distant nine months in fact when that time arrives she will want to come out if rebb lets her out she will probably be asked in marriage and then he would murder her finished macandrew not at all rebb is too clever a man to place his precious neck in a noose when her birthday came and she turned restive he would simply have called in a doctor to pronounce her insane and unfit for marriage no doctor would dare to say that mavis is quite sane much can be done with money said tod dryly and rebb has six thousand a year at his command besides even if he could find no doctor to swear to her insanity the mere rumor of such a thing would prevent any man from marrying her i am not so certain of that said gerald grimly as you said just now much can be done with money however rebb won't have a chance of working out his rascally plot whether he means murder or not i shall go to devonshire and interview him and how do you know that he is there questioned tod quickly the question recalled haskins to a sense of his folly in trusting the widow with his secret i have made a fool of myself macandrew he remarked soberly and resumed his seat it is my belief that mrs crosbie has put rebb on his guard and that rebb has gone down to denleigh to thwart my plans for carrying off mavis mrs crosbie jerry i warned you i know that and i wish i had taken your warning listen and gerald related his interview with the widow ending with an emphatic declaration that he did not believe she had kept her promise of secrecy macandrew nodded as he quite agreed with him as mrs crosbie is engaged to rebb she will not wish him to lose his income so do you think she knows of rebb's position of course she may not have known it before you confided in her but she certainly would demand an explanation from the major in spite of her promise when she heard that he was keeping a pretty girl shut up mrs crosbie is a woman and as a woman is jealous rebb would be forced to tell the truth that is how his income depends upon mavis being imprisoned when mrs crosbie knew that she certainly would do all she could to prevent you marrying the girl but madge has always been my friend protested haskins friendship goes when money is in question retorted tod i told you that i suspected the widow of being hard up if i am right she is marrying rebb for the money and both she and he will do all they can to keep that six thousand a year but added tod slowly i do not think there will be any murder needed the insanity rumor is enough to prevent a possible marriage not with me raged gerald jumping up once more quite so therefore rebb on his guard has gone to devonshire to work against you i'll follow by the first morning train take care haskins warned the solicitor rebb is dangerous a man who would act as he has done will not stick at a trifle if there is to be murder you will be the victim gerald held his head very high i am not so easily got rid of he remarked quietly however mrs crosbie and her mother are at bognor so they are out of the way now i don't like doing underhand things tod as you know but in this case it seems necessary that these two women should be watched to see if rebb goes down to see them at bognor macandrew nodded i can arrange that i'll send a confidential clerk down it is dirty work but when dealing with a rascal like rebb one cannot be too careful and you will take a revolver with you yes i may have to reckon with geary who is rebb's spy and bully and then there is bellaria who tod broke off haskins you have been in italy and know something of italian so i know a great deal corrected tod indignantly i am excellent at languages you know that all right old boy don't get your hair off what is the meaning of the word tna tna it means a den caverna tna antro all mean a den he paused reflectively and tod threw up his hand before gerald could answer where have i heard that word it seems familiar no doubt when people speak in italy i don't mean that i have heard the word used in a peculiar way haskins reflected with his eyes on macandrew do you know anything in connection with the word about a red coral hand grasping a a dagger cried tod rising quickly yes of course when i was in naples there was some talk of a society i thought so i thought so it is called the tna society the den society in english i believe that it is a collection of cut throats who terrorize people with the symbol of the coral hand the name comes from the idea of the society hiding in a den and emerging to do justice it is something like the sicilian mafia quite so haskins nodded i now understand bellaria's fear she ran out of this room as though she were crazy and indeed she was for the time being she apparently thought that i was an emissary of the tna appointed to kill her was bellaria in town cried tod astonished yes she found out about myself and mavis and came up to tell rebb i called to see rebb and we met she came back with me and we had a long talk she hinted about betraying a man called salviati with whom she was in love and talked about hiding from the vengeance of certain people when she saw the coral hand she ran out crying 'tna tna but how did you get the coral hand asked tod open mouthed haskins described how he had taken away mrs crosbie's cigarette case by accident and how he had found the hand in fact he told macandrew everything including the whole conversation with bellaria and the subsequent visit of mrs berch to recover the amulet and this signor venosta gave the coral hand to mrs crosbie ended gerald what do you think of it tod macandrew sat down gasping it's like a confounded penny dreadful he remarked ruffling his ruddy hair girls shut up incomes stolen and secret societies oh lord there is going to be trouble in what way don't ask me tod rose and began to put on his overcoat if i were you jerry i should chuck the whole business what leave mavis yes if you don't want to get into a row rebb may be connected with this tna society and no interrupted haskins decidedly on the contrary he is protecting bellaria from assassination by the tna and so is himself in danger of death but why should mrs crosbie possess this coral hand you had better ask signor venosta who gave it to her he is probably a count fosco of modern days but if you insist upon marrying this girl you will involve yourself in heaps of trouble i intend to go down to denleigh to morrow and face rebb said gerald determinedly mavis shall be my wife meanwhile you must have mrs crosbie watched gerald winced i don't like it but i must save the girl i'll do all i can but i tell you what jerry if you don't return to london in a week i'll set the police on your track very good it's a case of marriage or death haskins was gay but tod departed filled with forebodings chapter xiii the tables turned haskins departed for devonshire by the eleven fifty morning train from paddington with a great sense of exultation the necessity of immediate action appealed to his active brain and to his craving for romance that there was more than a spice of danger in the adventure to which he was committed added to his enjoyment notwithstanding his repudiation of tod's suggestion that murder might be the end of these things he took the precaution of carrying a revolver after all major rebb was being driven into a highly unpleasant corner and from what gerald knew of him he was not the kind of man to submit tamely to being beaten nor would he readily surrender six thousand a year he had enjoyed the luxuries of life too long to be content with the mere necessities and that was only human nature however haskins determined to beard the lion in his den which for the moment was geary's village inn gerald himself decided to remain at the prince's head silbury since the negro by rebb's orders might make himself highly disagreeable should the young man live under the sinister roof of the devon maid but haskins was not easily intimidated and even though the major and his underling joined forces to thwart him he felt quite equal to dealing with them collectively or separately right was on his side and gerald had an implicit belief that good was stronger than evil those who fought in the cause for which geary and rebb were fighting could not possibly triumph it was after four o'clock when haskins arrived in silbury and he repaired at once to the prince's head mrs jennings was glad to see him and gave him his old room he learned that rebb in his motor car had gone two days previously to denleigh and had not returned to the little town he was visiting an elderly relative at leegarth said the landlady and gerald smiled when he noticed how persistently the major kept up the fiction to account for his presence in the neighborhood while he was having afternoon tea he asked questions and learned to his surprise that bellaria was the elderly relative she is an italian said haskins on hearing this one of them nasty foreigners assented the plump hostess of course she is sir for i've seen her myself at times she come to silbury for marketing and she went to london the other day coming back in a broken up condition as you might say haskins smiled grimly he knew well what had broken bellaria up but she can't be any relative of major rebb he expostulated he is quite english mrs jennings irish begging your pardon sir but it's this way as the major told me himself when he stopped here for the night this miss bellaria's parents were italian and major rebb's were irish but his father died and her mother so her father married the major's mother which makes them a kind of sister and brother gerald shrugged his shoulders at this somewhat confused description and shook his head it may please rebb to call bellaria dondi his elderly relative he said quietly but in reality there is no relationship between them mrs jennings nodded in her turn and he ain't very kind to her she went on disapprovingly for she do look miserable when she comes out of that lunatic asylum as you might call it lunatic asylum haskins received a shock he had no idea that the rumor of mavis' insanity had spread so far as silbury but mrs jennings seemed to know all about it oh yes sir don't you know she remarked earnestly miss bellaria is set to watch that poor girl mavis durham who is quite mad who says that she is mad asked gerald heatedly everyone replied the landlady vaguely why the major himself told me that she was always wanting to kill people that is why she is shut up and watched by miss bellaria it would never do sir for a lunatic like that to come out why we might all be murdered in our beds it was on the tip of haskins' tongue to deny the insanity of mavis for which mrs jennings vouched so staunchly but to do so would have led to an admission of his secret visits to the pixy's house until he settled with rebb he did not wish these to be known therefore he contented himself with another question have you ever seen miss durham lord no sir nor has anyone else miss bellaria keeps her safely within the grounds of that tumbledown house and a good thing too say i does the house belong to major rebb no sir to that poor girl herself you see sir the durhams were a great family hereabouts for years but they all died out save one who went soldiering to india he was shot in the lungs some months after his marriage at simla to an english lady and came home to die he lingered a year and died at brighton and his wife oh she died in bombay when starting for england long before captain durham was shot that poor girl at the pixy's house was born when her mother died so major rebb who was a brother officer of captain durham took charge of her has miss durham any money i can't tell you that sir what i say is only what i have heard from time to time i believe that she has the old house of the durhams and enough money to keep her major rebb is a good kind gentleman to take such trouble over the poor thing many another gentleman would have shut her up in a lunatic asylum haskins smiled once more very significantly he quite believed that if rebb could have shut up mavis as a lunatic he would have done so long ago but in the first place it would be difficult to get two doctors to certify to her insanity and in the second if the case became known the use of the girl's money by rebb might be questioned the major had just made sufficient of the story public to save himself from awkward questions and gerald foresaw that to extricate mavis from her false position was a more difficult task than he had reckoned upon however notwithstanding that things looked thus black he held to his determination of having an explanation with major rebb and as the evening was pleasant he walked to denleigh at his leisure there was more chance of catching the major at this hour since it was probable that he would always return to the devon maid for dinner as he was starting mrs jennings came up to him at the door if you see major rebb sir she said in a low voice you might tell him that mr arnold has come back who is he asked gerald forgetting what mavis had said a small clever gentleman with a long beard who looked after that poor girl for a time he went away to some foreign port months ago but returned to this neighborhood during the last two or three days i haven't seen mr arnold myself ended mrs jennings but others have seen him and i want the major to know why asked haskins looking at her keenly mr arnold behaved very badly to major rebb explained the landlady and went away without giving notice major rebb wants to see him and ask why he left him in the lurch as you might say i'll tell him said haskins nodding where is this mr arnold now i can't say sir save that he is in the neighborhood haskins walked away pondering over what had been said he then remembered how mavis had called this dwarf arnold by the name of schaibar and said that he had gone to australia apparently he had acted as a kind of companion to mavis and possibly as a tutor although he had not been allowed by rebb to teach his pupil reading or writing it occurred to gerald that the scholar was friendly to mavis in that case he certainly would be hostile to her guardian as he could not fail to know from personal observation that the girl was perfectly sane and was illegally detained the young man felt very certain that rebb wished to see this mr arnold not to ask him questions as to the reason for his sudden departure some months back but to bribe him into silence regarding the truth i shall hunt up arnold thought gerald as he mounted the rising road to denleigh he may be able to help mavis and myself and heaven knows that we shall need all the help and friendship that we can obtain the evening was warm luminous and intensely still haskins did not hurry himself but sauntered through the lovely country enjoying its beauty in spite of his anxious state of mind in the depths of his heart he felt that everything would come right in the end and that he would some day be able to make mavis his dear wife they would then live happily ever afterwards just like a fairy tale still in fairy tales the lovers always have to undergo much woe and sorrow and danger before the end is reached and this fantasy of real life as gerald believed was to proceed much on the same lines dragons had to be overcome magicians thwarted enchanted castles had to be stormed but when these tasks laid upon the fated prince were accomplished he would awaken the princess to everyday life with a kiss and all the fairies would come to the nuptials the young man thought allegorically but there was a bitter truth enshrined in the symbols and fairy tales themselves are only fanciful pictures of life's mystery pain must be undergone before pleasure can be gained geary was absent when the traveler arrived at the devon maid and haskins was not sorry to hear this from mrs geary who received him the negro having learned from rebb and bellaria that the castle he had guarded was discovered would not be in the best of humors and would probably make himself disagreeable not that gerald had any fear of the man but he wished for an explanation with rebb before any open quarrel took place the major as a civilized being would certainly be more reasonable than the negro is major rebb in questioned gerald when mrs geary had told him of her husband's absence she did not say where he was as she apparently did not know and geary was not the man to permit questions yes sir he is having dinner in your old room i am sorry you can't have the room mr haskins but the major yes yes i understand said haskins impatiently take my card to major rebb and say that i have come down from london to see him mrs geary did this in her stolid way and shortly returned to usher haskins into the well remembered sitting room here he was received somewhat stiffly by the man he had come to see and the landlady retired closing the door carefully after her rebb looked thinner and more erect and more reserved than ever with a silent bow he pointed to a seat and waited to hear what gerald had to say considering the two men had already met frequently this reception was frigid but rebb apparently wished to make haskins as uncomfortable as possible so that he might get the better of him if such was his object he failed to attain it for gerald anticipating this demeanor was quite cheerful and very observant the major having finished his meal lighted a cigar but did not offer one to haskins this was a sign of war and gerald accepted it as such you are surprised to see me he remarked keeping his eyes on rebb's dark high bred face not exactly answered the other coolly my man told me that you wished to see me in london and of course i found your card when i returned i regret that i could not see you then but i had to come back here on business to see your elderly relative no doubt bellaria dondi precisely well why fence in this way rebb asked the young man you have heard from bellaria that i yes interrupted the major leaning forward and gripping the arms of his chair with an angry expression on his face bellaria has told me of your secret visits to the pixy's house i must say that you have behaved very badly haskins this is not the kind of thing i expected from you really gerald raised his eyebrows we have not been intimate that you should expect me to consider your feelings since my future wife was your mother's friend and is yours said rebb with dignity i was quite willing to admit you to a certain degree of intimacy now the case is altered because i love your ward no because you went by stealth to see her if you had come to me i could have explained her unhappy condition i am quite certain that you could retorted gerald looking straight at his enemy as he was convinced the major was but is there any need of an explanation everyone hereabouts declares that miss durham is insane and not responsible for her actions a flash of pleasure came and went in rebb's dark eyes for the moment and then he looked hypocritically sad poor girl it is only too true i don't agree with you there said haskins quietly indeed and on what grounds i have had several interviews with mavis and i am quite certain that she is as sane as you or i if so why should i shut her up ask your own conscience rebb struck his hand fiercely on the table you go too far haskins in saying that i am not forced to account for my actions to you you may not think so said gerald feeling that they were coming to close quarters but i do i love mavis and wish to marry her it is out of the question why she is as i declare insane if you married her she would probably murder you in your sleep i am willing to take the risk said haskins with a contemptuous smile he saw that rebb was trying to make the best of his position i am not willing that you should retorted the major ah but the decision lies with me mrs crosbie rebb looked furious what has mrs crosbie to do with this matter has she not told you told me what i have heard nothing from mrs crosbie gerald privately apologized to himself for having doubted the little woman but determined to have no further misunderstanding he spoke out i saw mrs crosbie when i was in london and asked her to help me to marry mavis not even for mrs crosbie's sake can i consent to that a marriage of that kind would be a sin how dare you tell my private affairs to my future wife and rebb again struck the table gently major gently i am not to be intimidated i asked mrs crosbie to help me as she is my mother's old friend and i have known her much longer than you have she refused to help me ah cried rebb gratified i knew that she loved me but she agreed to keep what i had told her a secret from you for at least a month on condition that i took no steps meanwhile to run away with mavis from what you say i understand that she has kept her promise and i have done her an injustice i fancied from your sudden departure to this place that she had told you mrs crosbie has told me nothing said rebb coldly i came down here because i heard that bellaria had been up to see me also i had a line from geary saying that something was wrong i came down at once and was informed that you had been spying out my private affairs don't call hard names major said gerald coolly i admit that i was wrong to speak to mrs crosbie seeing that she is engaged to you but i am putting that right by coming here for an explanation and i absolve mrs crosbie from her promise but i was not wrong in obeying the invitation of the sealed message any young man in my position would have done the same ah the cylinder cried rebb angrily bellaria told me of that as mavis confessed to her what she had done who would have thought that the girl would have communicated with the world in that way why should she not communicate with the world asked gerald sharply rebb saw that in his hurry he had made a mistake and tried to get out of it why because she is crazy and for that reason she has not been taught to read or write exactly the doctor said that if she were educated or if her brain was subjected to any strain her homicidal mania would be intensified out of sheer pity for the unfortunate girl i have had her kept in ignorance i see said haskins thinking that the excuse was extremely skilful then mr arnold taught her nothing rebb started the cigar fell from his fingers and he turned pale the mention of the name evidently worried him not a little what do you know of mr arnold he demanded only that he is or was mavis' tutor in some sort of odd way and that reminds me mrs jennings of the prince's head gave me a message for you major mr arnold she says has returned from australia and is in the neighborhood stale news haskins said rebb recovering his wits geary found out at least a week ago that arnold was traveling round the country in a kind of gipsy caravan selling books it was about arnold that geary wrote to me i came down to see into the matter as arnold is a rascal but i also learned on my arrival from bellaria that you had been taking an interest in my affairs and he sneered in the affairs of the woman i hope to make my wife said gerald imperturbably rebb rose stiffly mr haskins he said in a most ceremonious manner had you come to me in the first place and without acting in this underhand manner i should have told you that such a marriage is impossible i tell you so now and beg to end this interview gerald rose also as you please major rebb after all he paused at the door six thousand a year is worth fighting for rebb gasped again turned pale and fell back into his chair chapter xiv the unexpected happens do you still wish me to go inquired gerald politely and half opening the sitting room door no cried rebb sharply shut that door again and explain yourself haskins returned to his seat does what i say need explanation certainly you insinuate that my income has to do with mavis you place the matter in a nutshell major it has rebb rose again with the look of a man at bay you dare to i dare anything in the cause of mavis interrupted gerald imperiously don't make any mistake about my attitude major rebb if you act honestly i am here as your friend but if you declare war i am willing to accept your challenge if a look could have slain the bold speaker haskins would have dropped dead where he stood but he bore rebb's fierce gaze without flinching and waited for him to speak the major made a gigantic effort and gained control of himself sufficiently to open his mouth for a quiet question where did you learn this he demanded from the will of captain julian durham at somerset house indeed more spying sneered the other but his lip quivered haskins shrugged his shoulders and took scarcely any notice of the insult that is a weak speech to make he remarked rebb passed a handkerchief across his pale lips who told you about the will he asked quietly it was more an intuition than anything else said haskins anxious to shield mrs geary whose chance words had put him on the track i saw that mavis was sane and that you were shutting her up for some reason money was the reason that suggested itself and you searched in somerset house not personally macandrew did that as my lawyer great heavens stormed rebb growing darkly red is macandrew in this affair also will you tell me mr haskins how many people you have succeeded in interesting in my private business only tod and myself know about the matter so far i refer to the will of course but others may come to know of it unless ah said rebb quickly now we are coming to the gist of the matter mr haskins unless what unless you give mavis her proper position in the world and consent to your marriage with her i suppose haskins bowed you save me the trouble of an explanation there is another explanation to be made said rebb trying to appear calm and one that in justice to myself i must make the will pardon me interrupted gerald coolly but mrs jennings knows all about your ward's alleged insanity her true insanity cried rebb warmly everyone in denleigh and silbury and leegarth knows about the poor girl and that she is watched by bellaria dondi your useful elderly relative just so and does all the neighborhood know about julian durham's will anyone who goes to somerset house can learn what he wishes as you have done retorted the major i am not bound to make my private affairs public down here you apparently are trying to do your best to provide gossip for the neighborhood well yes i mean to get mavis out of the pixy's house rebb jumped up and banged on the table furiously i defy you yes i defy you he almost shouted and you shall not get her out of that house she is well treated and one moment i never said that she was not well treated said gerald swiftly but badly as you are behaving i presume your conscience does not allow you to ill treat mavis seeing that you are enjoying her fortune take care take care i may strike you by all means it will give me the chance to take you into court for assault and make the matter of the pixy's house public ah rebb looked scathingly at the bold speaker you are afraid oh no if you strike me i shall probably give you a good thrashing which to my mind you richly deserve in an ordinary case i would thrash you and let you go but my desire is to force you into taking up a public position of defence i am quite willing to do so said rebb violently you can employ macandrew or any lawyer you like the will is in my favor and i have carried out its provisions pardon me but that is just what you have not done mavis by the will was to be educated she can neither read nor write the doctor said produce your doctor who said that her brain could not understand or could not bear teaching it is no use major whatever you may say about mavis to suit your own ends you are well aware that she is perfectly sane and that you are keeping her shut up in the pixy's house to enjoy her money you dare you dare i dare now and i shall dare in open court retorted the young man i wonder i don't kill you muttered rebb in impotent fury in the first place you can't in the second if you did you would only be tried for murder instead of conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy damn you yes against the liberty of a subject rebb had proved himself to be a brave man in several south african engagements so it was not fear that prevented him from falling upon the man who thus defied him and meddled with his most private affairs but with all his fury and he could scarcely articulate for rage he was sufficiently master of himself to know that to strike haskins would only force him into open court rebb had no wish that the will of durham and his guardianship of mavis should be a topic of conversation with his friends or appear in print for the delectation of the public he therefore kept his hands down by his sides and subdued his wrath as best he could but the effort nearly choked him you have said all that you can say mr haskins he growled in a guttural voice filled with menace so you can go certainly rejoined gerald again and your attitude i stand by the will of my brother officer said rebb with suppressed fury i enjoy the durham property until mavis marries she is not fit to marry being insane therefore you will enjoy the durham property until the end of your life yes said rebb determinedly i do hold to that mavis has all she wants and is happy where she is because you have filled her mind with lying tales of english girls all being brought up in seclusion as she is being brought up but on mavis' twenty first birthday rebb when she hopes to come out into the world what then how will you restrain her will she be happy then i am not bound to tell you of my plans regarding my ward said the major stiffly on her twenty first birthday i shall know how to act good night said gerald abruptly and made for the door stop cried rebb imperatively what about your attitude haskins wheeled at the door i love mavis and i intend to make her my wife that is my attitude i see sneered the major you are after her money the insult was too contemptible to be noticed think what you like major only remember one thing if you harm mavis in any way or transfer her to another hiding place i shall hold you accountable in what way questioned the other contemptuously i shall find some relative of mavis and get him or her to contest the will that will bring everything out very probably but mavis has no relative julian durham was the last of his race and so since his wife was dead left his child for me to look after had he or she any relative i should not have been appointed guardian i stand by the will good night gerald hesitated and wondered whether he would say anything more but on second thoughts he decided to hold his peace and abruptly left the room after all there was no more to be arranged he knew the attitude which rebb had taken up and rebb knew his attitude it only remained to fight for possession of the girl as haskins walked back to silbury in the rapidly gathering darkness he admitted that rebb's position was a strong one mavis was perfectly happy and had all she wanted the loss of liberty did not trouble her since she had the spacious grounds of the pixy's house for a playground and moreover thought that all english girls were brought up in the same way had she known that this was a lie she might have fretted after liberty and then there would have been some ground to go upon but were she taken into court she could not deny but that her guardian had been kind and had given her all she required this reasoning was all in favor of rebb then again since rebb swore that mavis was insane he was quite justified in shutting her up so long as she was treated kindly certainly could she be proved to be sane his position would then be a very awkward one as it would force him to explain why he had used the girl's money all these years while keeping her in durance vile but as tod had said and gerald had echoed much could be done with money and if things came to be made public rebb might be able to bribe a couple of doctors to certify to mavis' insanity in that case she would be shut up in a public asylum and rebb after setting aside a certain sum for her maintenance would enjoy the durham income for the rest of his wicked life the plot was very cunningly arranged and in standing by the will rebb took up an almost unassailable position many another man would have been daunted by the difficulties thus presented by a survey of the position but gerald was in love and to a lover nothing is impossible that stands in the way of his gaining his mistress haskins did not know for the moment exactly how to act but in one way or another he determined to force rebb's strong hand by warning rebb he had certainly put him on his guard against any possible elopement but he also had forced him to behave in a more or less straightforward manner knowing that he was watched the major could not smuggle mavis into another hiding place during the conversation gerald had intended to mention bellaria's dread of the coral hand so that he might learn if it was really the tna society that she feared but the chances were that rebb would not have told him and moreover the introduction of a new subject might have complicated matters haskins therefore congratulated himself that he had kept silence also for the moment it was unnecessary to draw rebb's attention to the wonderful likeness between charity and mavis doubtless rebb was well aware of it and it was more than likely that rebb could explain it still bearing in mind mrs pelham odin's offer to pass off mavis as charity should it be necessary gerald resolved to hold his peace at one moment he was inclined to storm the pixy's house secretly and elope with mavis hiding her as above under the name of charity who would then be out of the way as mrs macandrew but rebb would know who had taken mavis away and standing by the will which gave him the guardianship of mavis until she was twenty one would make dire trouble gerald did not wish to be arrested as he could do little good for mavis if imprisoned it only remained then to return to london and to see tod in one way or another some start could be made towards extricating mavis from the clutches of her guardian and when the start was made the desired end would be reached sooner or later gerald therefore determined to leave silbury next morning and to begin his campaign forthwith assisted by tod he felt very reluctant to leave the neighborhood without seeing mavis but he was forced to bellaria would now be on her guard if he attempted to climb the wall and gerald was very certain that geary had been sent to watch the pixy's house by his precious master haskins had a revolver as opposed to the yellow handled knife about which mavis had talked so he did not fear the encounter but an open struggle would only damage the position of mavis and impede any plans made for her rescue knowing that rebb had the will and swore to the reported insanity of mavis to strengthen his attitude gerald was extremely anxious to move cautiously in sheer desperation major rebb might call in the assistance of the law much as haskins wished to force the man's hand he did not want to do so by placing himself in the wrong to take mavis from the guardianship of a man appointed by her father's will would be a disobedience to the law of which rebb would take full advantage as the night was warm gerald having plenty of time did not hurry himself there was no moon and the stars were covered with dun hued clouds very little light therefore came from above nevertheless the night was not entirely dark as a faint luminous radiance was everywhere spread and he could pick his way along the highroad very easily although following tod's advice he had his revolver in his hip pocket he never thought that it would be necessary to use it major rebb as a civilized being had refrained from actual violence much as he apparently desired to use it but then he would only have taken to his fists it was far otherwise with geary that semi civilized savage would undoubtedly have taken to his yellow handled knife in the usual way in which intuitions came to haskins the thought of this knife unexpectedly flashed into his mind when he topped the last rise of the hills already he could see the glimmer of the silbury lights and paused a moment to watch them shining like stars under the muggy canopy of the heavy sky but the knife thought remained and he turned his head uneasily from side to side scenting danger by his sixth sense the feeling passed and then came again stronger than ever when he began to walk on once more he glanced back and then swerved to one side just in time to avoid the rush of a big black form which hurled itself out of the shadows it was geary who dashed towards him missed wheeled and flung himself again on the young man haskins had walked to denleigh in his flannels as the evening was so close so he was a sufficiently easy mark in the semi darkness showing whitely like a negative against the gloom geary clutched him in his powerful arms before he could swerve again or draw his revolver and then gerald realized with a shock of surprise that save for a pair of dungaree trousers the man was naked not only that but the upper part of his body had been rubbed with oil and he slipped about like an eel geary made no remark nor did gerald speak but the two men the one big and burly the other lithe and wiry wrestled together for mastery haskins believed that geary wished to get him down and stab him but could not see if he held a knife he certainly did not in his huge hands but he might have had it strapped sailor fashion in the small of his back without a word the two men swung and swayed geary wriggling and pressing gerald downward with his great weight but haskins had lately taken lessons in jiu jutsu of which the negro was apparently ignorant so he suddenly gave way with an unexpected relaxing of all the muscles geary uttered a guttural ejaculation of anger and surprise as he felt the looseness of the young man's body and found a moment afterwards that his big arms were empty by making himself small so to speak gerald had slipped out of the negro's grip and darted back with lightning speed when geary swung round again to the assault he found himself facing a revolver nothing daunted his hand slipped round to the back of his dungaree trousers and a moment later gerald saw the steel glitter in the dim light as geary rushed forward with uplifted hand haskins did not wish to kill the man as he was a necessary witness to save mavis so he winged him the bullet struck the negro's right arm and the knife dropped as he howled viciously apparently dreading another shot he sprang aside and then backward and vanished for some minutes gerald heard the pad pad pad of his bare feet on the highway and became aware then for the first time that he had escaped a great danger picking up the knife he replaced his revolver in his hip pocket and walked swiftly towards silbury wondering if rebb had sent the man to kill him if so geary had failed and as there was no chance of another attempt being made on that night gerald did not trouble himself on the way to the town he swiftly resolved to say nothing of his adventure especially as any publicity might lead to revelations being made at the moment while mavis' fate swung in the balance but later gerald determined to bring geary to justice he had the evidence of the knife at the first street lamp he stopped and looked at the weapon it was a dangerous piece of steel a bowie knife but the handle was of black wood what then had become of the yellow handled knife which mavis feared so greatly gerald was too weary and ached too much with his late struggle to think over this problem he therefore postponed all consideration until next morning on reaching the prince's head he sat down to an excellent meal and held his peace about his adventures after dinner he drank some coffee and smoked a couple of pipes then he went to bed about ten o'clock or a trifle later shortly in spite of the late excitement he fell asleep when he awoke it was nine o'clock in the morning feeling somewhat bruised and stiff for geary's grasp was like that of an octopus he decided to remain in bed instead of taking the morning train to london the afternoon train would do he decided so he rang for his breakfast to be served intending to rise at midday the chambermaid took his orders for breakfast and seemed to be flustered but before he could make inquiries she ran out of the room later mrs jennings herself arrived with the breakfast tray and looked excited as she placed it on the bed oh mr haskins she cried with shining eyes such terrible news that mad girl at the pixy's house has murdered miss bellaria and has bolted it is impossible gasped haskins starting up in bed the milkman from leegarth has just brought the news sir chapter xv a tragedy mrs jennings' news was so startling that gerald could only fall back on his pillow and stare at her excited face pleased with the effect which she produced like all gossips she continued rapidly to explain breathlessly the milkman's master evans is his name went at seven this morning with the milk to the pixy's house miss bellaria always came to the gate and opened it to take the milk in he found the gate wide open and miss bellaria lying on the path within the grounds stabbed to the heart and as dead as a stone evans gave the alarm in the village and many people went into the grounds and up to examine the house they found no one there that poor lunatic was gone evans sent on his man to tell the police here and he came in for a drink i had the whole story out of him isn't it dreadful sir to think that we should have been talking of that crazy meg only yesterday and that she should commit so dreadful a crime stop said gerald sharply and somewhat recovering himself you cannot say if miss durham is guilty mrs jennings gaped not say she is guilty why sir if she isn't who can be it's well known that miss durham as you call her sir always wanted to kill people and that was why she was shut up not being able to get at another person she has murdered poor miss bellaria who watched her and then ran away to murder again i suppose oh how very dreadful it all is when i said yesterday that we might be murdered in our beds i little thought that we should be nonsense nonsense begging your pardon sir but it's gospel truth that i am speaking said the landlady bristling with a lunatic at large one never knows what may happen the police inspector and a very nice man he is has already sent to denleigh asking major rebb to go to leegarth everyone is talking about things with blood and slaughter in them and i ask your pardon sir for having come into your bedroom but i thought you would like to know oh dear me dear me mrs jennings wrung her plump hands and retreated towards the door in a flurried condition i'll bolt and bar every window and door at sunset no murders for me having babbled herself out of the room she banged the door and haskins sitting up in bed placed his hands on either side of his head to think matters over he found it difficult to believe the news and yet he might have expected to hear something of this sort of course he was absolutely certain that mavis was innocent but he could not understand why she had run away nor could he guess who had slain the unfortunate italian quite unable to eat his breakfast because of the intelligence he jumped out of bed and into the hip bath which was in the centre of the room the sooner he went downstairs and learned all that could be learned the better able would he be to see his way if mavis had been in danger from major rebb before she was now in greater danger than ever as he assuredly would use her assumed guilt to prevent her inheriting the money nothing will make anyone believe that mavis is other than guilty was the young man's soliloquy her crazy reputation is enough if she is caught they will shut her up in an asylum notwithstanding the denial she is sure to make then rebb will be able to keep the money according to the strict letter of the will and yet and yet he clenched his fist i believe that rebb himself is guilty of the crime he had really no reason to make such an accusation but the happening of the crime was so opportune for the major that it did not seem entirely impossible for him to have had a hand in it assuredly he might not have struck the blow himself but the unscrupulous geary could easily have been employed to remove bellaria not that rebb on the face of it would wish to lose so useful a servant but if it was necessary that mavis should be accused of murder to ensure her being placed in an asylum bellaria was the nearest and most natural victim but these arguments were futile as gerald reflected while dressing for he did not know exactly what had taken place it was necessary to learn when the crime had been committed where the body had been found the precise spot that is and if possible to discover the weapon which had been used if the yellow handled knife was picked up anywhere near the corpse the presumption would be that geary had killed the woman although mrs jennings had made no report of this but the thought recalled to haskins' mind the attack made upon him by the negro on the previous night a knife had been used then and he had it in the pocket of the suit he had worn on looking at it again he saw what had struck him before that the handle of this particular weapon was black and not yellow what then had become of the famous sacrificial knife of which mavis had spoken why should geary not have used this when striving to murder gerald that question could only be answered when the yellow handled knife was found haskins could not wear the flannels in which he had been attacked as they were smeared all over with oil from geary's body he therefore flung this suit into his portmanteau and as the day promised to be extremely hot dressed himself in white drill thus clothed although far from being in his right mind by reason of inward perturbation he descended to find the hotel seething with excitement everyone was talking of the leegarth tragedy as such an event had never before startled the somnolent town the bar was crowded with idlers and mr evans' messenger was being supplied with as much drink as he could swallow however he was yet sober enough to answer the few questions which haskins put to him no weapon had been found the police had gone to leegarth the guilt of miss durham was certain she had vanished and search was being made wires had been sent far and wide ordering her arrest policemen were scouring the countryside on bicycles sooner or later the murderess would be captured and everyone would be relieved so the man babbled on and having learned all that was possible gerald went to hire a bicycle in order to proceed to leegarth he did not feel the least hungry for obvious reasons but as he had a long and exhausting day before him he was wise enough to force himself to eat and drink thus fortified he rode up the steep silbury high street and into the surrounding country so rapid was his pace and so eager was he to learn the best or the worst at once that in a marvelously short time he found himself before the high wall which girdled the pixy's house and its park in this wall double gates of rough iron were set but the grounds could not be seen from the lane as boards had been placed across the bars to prevent anyone looking in this had been done as gerald learned from a chatty villager many years before when the crazy girl and her dead watcher had come to live there policemen guarded the gates and preserved order amongst the rapidly increasing crowd which augmented every minute the terrible news had traveled with lightning speed and from far and wide came all who were possessed of morbid curiosity the police were expected from exeter and in the meanwhile inspector morgan of silbury was within the grounds searching round major rebb had not yet arrived on learning this latter fact haskins at once demanded admission so that he might interview morgan when rebb came he knew well that it would not be possible to meddle with the case as the major would insist that he had nothing to do with it but in order to discover any evidence that might be suppressed by rebb should he or geary be guilty haskins made up his mind to examine as much into the matter on the spot as would be permitted to him after sending in his request he received a reply in a few minutes and this led to his being conducted by a young constable through the jealously guarded gates and into the presence of the inspector morgan was standing on the lawn drawing a plan of the grounds and several policemen were beating about the long grass searching for something have they found the knife asked gerald coming up swiftly morgan looked at him keenly he was a tall and burly man with a red face and white hair apparently easygoing and tolerant who would not be difficult to manage if treated diplomatically nevertheless he resented haskins' abrupt question with stiff official dignity may i ask who you are sir he demanded gerald pointed to the card which the inspector held my name is there mr inspector i came here because i am interested in the case on what grounds for what reason questioned morgan still stiffly haskins did not hesitate on the way hither he had resolved to be absolutely frank if frankness were necessary to deliver mavis from her dangerous position he would have to give some reason for championing her and having regard to the searching examinations of the law he deemed it best to tell the absolute truth if he did not rebb might possibly make some use of his knowledge of the secret visits to get him into trouble he therefore cast his bombshell boldly i am engaged to marry miss durham he stated slowly morgan in spite of official phlegm dropped his pocketbook in sheer amazement and two constables who overheard looked round with expressions of blank astonishment what do you mean sir stuttered the inspector growing redder than ever are you making a fool of me miss durham was mad she could not be engaged to anyone miss durham was perfectly sane as i am prepared to swear and to prove my belief in her sanity i am willing to make her my wife a murderess she is not a murderess whomsoever killed that unfortunate bellaria dondi the poor girl who was shut up here is at least innocent dear dear dear morgan scratched his head and looked bewildered i never came across anything so extraordinary in my life if miss durham was shut up here and everyone knows that she was strictly guarded on account of her mania how came you to see her in a rather peculiar way mr inspector but what i tell you can be substantiated by my friend and legal adviser mr ian roy macandrew and after thus guarding himself from the tale being received with disbelief gerald detailed the finding of the cylinder and his subsequent dealings with the matter morgan gaped and stared not knowing what to make of so extraordinary a story then this young lady was not crazy no said gerald positively i am certain she was in complete possession of her senses then why was she shut up you had better ask major rebb that said haskins dryly he will be here soon in proof of the truth of my story you can look for the canoe which is hidden in the undergrowth on the other side of the pool below the river wall morgan nodded with his pale blue eyes fixed on the speaker do you know anything of this murder he asked pointedly gerald laughed shortly are you going to accuse me he demanded certainly not mr haskins certainly not but seeing that your canoe is near the house and you confess to having paid secret visits i understand gerald cut him short people will talk let them i can prove an alibi with the help of mrs jennings and three or four of her servants i slept last night at the prince's head silbury and was in bed a few minutes after ten by the way can you tell me when this crime was committed the doctor who examined the poor woman's body states that she was stabbed so far as he can ascertain from the condition of the corpse somewhere about twelve o'clock say at midnight where morgan indicated a spot stained with blood it had soaked into the graveled path some little distance away yonder mr haskins i judge from this that miss bellaria as she is called hereabouts came to open the gate to someone the assassin no doubt and then she was stabbed to the heart before she could make an outcry the doctor declares that death must have taken place almost instantaneously humph said gerald swiftly i see then that you exonerate miss durham seeing that you say bellaria was summoned to the gate by the assassin yes and no mr haskins said the inspector stolidly according to what you say this young lady was sane that has yet to be proved it is quite likely that for once she may have gone out no no she had no wish to go out you seem to know a great deal about the young lady's intentions said inspector morgan a trifle dryly well then she may have followed miss bellaria into the garden and after stabbing her may have opened the gates and got away miss bellaria never came into the garden at night said gerald quickly she told me herself that she was afraid of something what was she afraid of asked morgan sharply i can't exactly tell you replied the young man who did not wish to say too much about the tna society lest mrs crosbie who owned the coral pin might be implicated but bellaria hinted that she was afraid and miss durham told me that her nurse would never venture out after dark why then should she have come to the gate morgan reflected and pulled his white moustache probably miss durham was seized with a mania for killing and chased her nurse through the house miss bellaria would then run into the garden to escape and so was struck down on the very threshold of yonder gate i daresay she was trying to get out and summon assistance from the village you make out a very pretty case against miss durham mr inspector morgan would have replied but at this moment one of the constables who had been hunting in the long grass on the left hand of the gate cried out triumphantly and held up a knife here it is sir he said in another moment morgan was holding in his hand a yellow handled knife of a very deadly description which had bloodstains on the blade i see said the officer gravely this is undoubtedly the weapon used it seems to me that the woman was stabbed and then the assassin miss durham for a thousand flung the knife aside into that long grass before running away very natural very natural she would not care to carry with her such evidence of her guilt guilt which has yet to be proved said gerald hotly an argument ensued in which haskins decidedly got the worst the inspector and indeed everyone else scouted the idea of mavis' innocence she had pursued bellaria to the gates and having killed her had got rid of the knife by flinging it into the long grass then she had fled not daring to face the consequences of her crime in which case cried gerald furiously she must be sane a madwoman would not be afraid to remain being ignorant of the heinousness of the offence morgan shook his head still unconvinced and indeed gerald saw that things looked very black indeed against the girl he loved it was on the tip of his tongue to denounce geary as the owner of the knife but he could not prove this without the evidence of mavis and moreover he thought it wiser to keep silent as to his suspicions until he consulted macandrew and could get legal advice the situation was too dangerous to be dealt with hurriedly later in the day major rebb arrived and heard from inspector morgan all about the crime he viewed the body of the poor woman and examined the knife which he either failed to recognize or if he did decided to keep silence as to its ownership he stated that he had seen his ward about four o'clock on the previous day and that she was then in an excited condition but not thinking she would venture to commit a crime he had gone back to the devon maid at denleigh and there had retired to rest at nine o'clock geary the landlord of the inn had also been with the major nearly all the evening and had likewise retired to bed early as while handling a pistol he had managed to shoot himself in the right arm the simple minded inspector heard all this with an air of belief and did not inquire as he should have done why major rebb should take such trouble to explain the movements of his landlord or why that landlord had managed to shoot himself so dexterously in the right arm and while speaking rebb frequently glanced at gerald who was present expecting contradiction no doubt when morgan had taken notes of the major's evidence that military gentleman beckoned to haskins and together they went into the room which the missing girl had used it was comfortably and even luxuriously furnished and gerald casting swift glances around never doubted but that the major either out of diplomacy or because he was conscience stricken had treated his prisoner with every consideration when the door was closed rebb looked searchingly at his unwelcome visitor well haskins he inquired and what do you mean to do now i shall let you know that later retorted gerald quickly you must be certain now at all events pursued the major calmly that mavis is insane no one but a madwoman would have stabbed bellaria how dare you say that when you know perfectly well that mavis is innocent indeed haskins then who is guilty i should like you to tell me that said gerald significantly rebb gave a short laugh are you going to accuse me he remarked much in the same manner as haskins himself had spoken earlier to morgan you know best don't be a fool haskins said rebb flushing and very roughly considering the circumstances of the case and what you on false premises are ready to do would i be such an idiot as to kill bellaria yes said gerald dryly you knew that i would move heaven and earth to prove mavis' sanity so that i could marry her therefore in order that her homicidal mania could be proved beyond all doubt you had bellaria killed and mavis taken away if she cannot prove her innocence and i can guess how difficult it will be for her to do so you will then have her put into an asylum and enjoy her money for the rest of your life it's a very pretty plot major rebb i agree with you there haskins it does credit to your imagination as a writer of fiction but i am glad to see that you do not accuse me of murdering bellaria myself no i do not you are too cunning to risk your own neck said gerald decidedly you remained in the inn to prove an alibi i believe that but you sent geary here to kill bellaria for the reasons that i have given you don't deny it rebb the yellow handled knife which belongs to geary is in morgan's possession does he know that it is geary's asked rebb anxiously no but i shall tell him so you can spare yourself the trouble i shall tell him myself the knife does belong to geary as both i and his wife and half a dozen other people can prove he gave it to bellaria because she asked for a weapon to defend herself probably mavis wrenched the knife from her at the gate and then a very ingenious explanation but i believe geary to be guilty he would stick at nothing as i know from the way in which he tried to kill me last night by your orders pardon me said rebb not at all taken aback geary attacked you because you were trying to injure me he overheard our conversation as he returned from this place sooner than he expected the foolish fellow who is devoted to me hoped to silence you by death when he came back i rebuked him severely and you can see that as geary's right arm is wounded by you haskins he could not have murdered bellaria i am not so sure of that said gerald dryly but felt all the same that the major was wriggling like an eel out of a very difficult position and your story of the way in which he wounded himself won't hold water if i tell the truth i wonder you did not while i was speaking said rebb exasperatingly calm why did you not because i well i have my reasons said gerald nonplussed by the man's boldness but if i tell the story geary will be convicted of a falsehood finished rebb nodding it will not harm my reputation as a truth teller in any way if that is what you mean i suggested the excuse of an accident to geary and if he is questioned on the authority of your wild statement of assault he will say that he told me the invention so as to keep dark his wrongful attack on you which i would never have countenanced ended rebb with great emphasis i shall say nothing at present as i have my reasons for keeping silent what do you mean to do about this murder what can i do i believe that mavis is guilty it's a lie a lie cried haskins vehemently no insisted rebb i really believe that she killed bellaria when she is captured as she will be sooner or later she will be tried for her life still as i can swear to her insanity she will be placed in a public asylum with sufficient allowed out of the estate for her keep and i you will enjoy the rest of the money rebb bowed with a gratified and malicious expression as mavis can never marry now i retain the income for the rest of my life and i said haskins raising his hand solemnly swear never to rest until her innocence is proved and she is my wife i defy you to do your worst snapped rebb contemptuously all the cards are in my hands might is on my side and right on mine and on mavis' let god decide rebb the major laughed insolently shrugged his shoulders and left the room convinced that haskins could not harm him he disbelieved in god chapter xvi the dwarf schaibar after that interview gerald saw that he would have to leave the major in possession of the field for the present as he had observed rebb held all the cards and haskins could only retire to consult with macandrew as to some way of winning the game in the teeth of such bad luck moreover gerald was now in possession of all facts connected with the crime and by lingering at the pixy's house he would become possessed of no more important facts also rebb wishing to get rid of his too observant enemy so worked on morgan's feelings that the inspector hinted retirement to the lover having learned that the inquest would take place in the inn of leegarth village next day haskins mounted his machine and returned to silbury but he felt that it was impossible to sit down and do nothing for he was very anxious regarding the future of mavis probably on discovering the dead body of bellaria she had fled panic stricken from that bloodstained mansion but distraught with terror and not knowing the country it was probable that she would soon be captured gerald would have gone in search of her forthwith but that he did not know in which direction to look for her and again if he did find her would be unable to smuggle her into safety while the countryside was all on the alert he half made up his mind to return to london and enlist the services of tod but could not quite decide to do so since his going to the metropolis meant his leaving the neighborhood in which the girl he loved was wandering mavis was a fugitive with so to speak a price on her head he could not go away heartlessly and leave her so innocent and unsophisticated in the lurch his hesitation was ended at five o'clock in the afternoon by a wire from exeter asking him to come there at once and meet the person who signed the telegram simon arnold by name in the coffee room of the monmouth hotel it flashed across gerald's mind at once that the former tutor of mavis had sent the telegram and probably wished to see him about the girl whom they both loved in their several ways but he wondered how arnold whom mavis playfully called schaibar had learned his address and then on examining the telegram again saw that it had been directed to the devon maid at denleigh wondering if geary had opened it he sent for the boy and found that mrs geary on receiving the wire at the door had told the lad that mr haskins was staying at silbury gerald was relieved at this as geary would undoubtedly have read the telegram in order to learn any possible plans haskins might have formed nevertheless on the face of it the wire could convey little information to the conspirators likely to be of use save that arnold whom rebb apparently dreaded was enlisting himself on the side of the lovers haskins found that there was a train from silbury to exeter at seven o'clock that same evening so after dinner he packed his portmanteau and went to the station guessing that rebb would probably make inquiries as to his whereabouts he left a message with mrs jennings stating that he had gone to london and hoped that the information would upset the major by making him think that steps were being taken to save mavis from his snares strong as was rebb's hand he yet had a difficult game to play the fact of durham's will would undoubtedly be made public should mavis be arrested and rebb certainly would not like his friends to think that he derived his income in the way he did but then rebb had daring enough to face anything especially when six thousand a year was at stake somewhere about nine o'clock gerald reached exeter and leaving his portmanteau in the cloak room proceeded to the monmouth hotel a small inn on the outskirts of the cathedral city the place was little known but haskins was fortunate enough to pick up a cabman who came from the neighborhood where it is situated in half an hour he found himself in the coffee room of the hotel and recognized arnold at once from the description given by mavis the ex tutor and present hawker of books was reading a latin author when gerald entered but flung it aside when the young man conducted by a waiter appeared on the threshold he was about to greet the newcomer but on seeing the waiter turned aside to look out of the window to make an excuse for entering gerald ordered a glass of whisky and soda which he truly needed so wrought up was he by the strain and stress of the situation the waiter disappeared and soon came back with the drink while he was absent gerald eyed arnold who still did not speak and sat down near the fireless grate but a glance passed between the two men which showed mutual recognition arnold was a remarkably small man quite worthy to be called a dwarf but he was not deformed in any way his body his hands and feet and his head were all perfectly proportioned and the most noticeable thing about him was his long gray beard which fell below his waist he had a noble forehead crowned with long loose gray hair and two vividly blue eyes penetrating and unblinking no one could have called the little man ugly but owing to his small stature and noble beard he looked uncanny gerald ever imaginative thought at once of the norwegian gnomes and kobolds although arnold was not so grotesquely ugly as those earth fairies of legend when the waiter finally left the coffee room and the two men had it all to themselves arnold moved swiftly forward and gripped gerald's hand before the young man was aware of his intention you are the lover of my dear girl he said in a singularly melodious voice i knew you at once from her description of you i can return the compliment said gerald responding to the warm clasp mavis told me what you were like and indeed i also have the description given in 'the arabian nights' to go upon schaibar said arnold with a smile yes she always called me that i am glad that you have obeyed my summons so speedily mr haskins as i am sure that you are a true friend to my unhappy pupil i am her lover replied gerald quietly and as her lover i am prepared to go any lengths to save her from that rascal meaning major rebb of course he is trying to ruin mavis in order to get her money i wonder how you found that out mr haskins it's a long story and and you can tell it to me and mavis mavis gerald stared what do you mean have you any idea where she is mr arnold of course answered the little man quietly it was for that reason that i wired to you mavis told me that you were stopping at denleigh as a matter of fact i am or rather i was stopping at the prince's head silbury explained gerald but your wire was sent on to me i heard from mrs jennings and from rebb also that you were in the neighborhood of leegarth and it was very lucky for mavis that i was said arnold nodding only by being on the spot was i enabled to save her from arrest you saved her how tell me all gently mr haskins do not talk so loud walls have ears and keyholes have eyes arnold glanced round the room and then drew near to the eager young man to speak in still lower tones last night i went to see if i could enter the pixy's house and try mavis but as the gate was shut and locked i could not get in i would have climbed the wall but that my age and rheumatism prevented my doing so however i thought that by going to the river wall i might obtain a foothold on the ivy i made the attempt and fell you see that i still limp arnold walked a pace or two and gerald saw that his leg dragged i lay insensible for some hours then i managed when i revived to drink some brandy which i had brought with me and so deemed that i could get back to my caravan which was on the other side of the village i had got round to the lane wherein the gates are to be found when i heard a scream of alarm was it bellaria being killed asked gerald quickly no i staggered as fast as i was able toward the gates and found them open bellaria stabbed to the heart lay within and over her bent mavis when she saw me she was terrified but i called out and she recognized my voice running forward she stammered out that bellaria had gone to meet some one and had been killed i at once saw the danger to which mavis was exposed having read the will of julian durham and so insisted that she should fly she was surprised that i desired her to do this as in her innocence she never deemed that she would be accused however i rapidly convinced her and she agreed leaning on her arm i led her round the village as i feared lest her scream should have attracted attention we reached my caravan in safety and i then put the horse in the shafts and drove to exeter through the night we reached this city this afternoon and i took her on board a barge which is owned by a man i can rely upon then i sent the wire to you we must save the poor child mr haskins she is safe now but at any time she may be discovered you will be suspected i don't think so mr haskins while she was in my caravan i had qualms that search might be made therein but now that mavis is safe on the barge with sammy lee looking after her there is little danger i have only to say that i know nothing of her whereabouts and who can convict me of falsehood but i want lee to take his barge down to exmouth and then we can place mavis on board some outward bound steamer she will then be safe until we can prove her innocence why do you believe that she will be accused asked gerald i am perfectly sure said arnold dryly that major rebb will take advantage of bellaria's death to fasten the guilt on mavis so that he may shut her up in an asylum and by thus preventing her marriage will be enabled to keep her six thousand a year gerald nodded that view does credit to your powers of penetration mr arnold rebb is moving precisely on those lines quite so i know major rebb but do you know that he there is no time to be lost said arnold in a peremptory tone as mavis will be in danger of arrest until she is safely bestowed out of england she refuses to leave this city until she sees you and that was why i wired come down at once to the exe and let us board the barge then we can decide what is to be done and you can ask what questions you choose haskins consented and after finishing his whisky and soda he went out with the little man into the darkness arnold leaned on haskins' arm as his leg was still painful from the fall of the previous night and guided him through many narrow and dingy streets down to the banks of the river a lumbering barge was lying near a littered wharf and as they approached this they were hailed by a rough voice which gerald rightly took to be that of sammy lee the two men stepped on board the low lying barge to find themselves welcomed by a gigantic devonian with a hairy face who paid the utmost deference to the dwarf as arnold led gerald down into the cabin of the barge leaving sammy lee to keep watch he whispered to haskins i can absolutely trust this man so you need have no fear last year i saved the life of his only child by means of the herbal medicine when the doctors had given her up so he will never betray our poor girl but if he hears that she is accused of murder it will be all over exeter to morrow questioned gerald he will decline to believe it as he sees what mavis is and even if he did believe he would never betray anyone whom i wished to shield this was very satisfactory and haskins wondered at the marvelous ways of providence which had snatched mavis from a dangerous position to place her in safety until such time as her innocence could be made manifest it seemed as though everything would come right in the end despite major rebb's boast of his might haskins recalled his last words to the man in which he left the matter for god to decide and god was deciding against rebb and his wicked machinations a rap at the cabin door brought mavis to open it she was still in her favorite white dress in which she had fled from her prison on the previous night but over this she wore a long black cloak with a hood now closely pulled over her head for obvious reasons when she saw gerald and the tender smile in his eyes she flung back the hood as though stifling and fell into his arms sobbing as if her heart would break and no wonder to learn all the cruelty of the outside world and to be a hunted fugitive accused of a terrible crime was an extraordinary change from the seclusion and romance of the pixy's house oh prince gerald was her cry as she wept on his breast how i have longed to see you and i also have wished to hold you thus he replied kissing her but we were kept apart by wicked men dearest now we are together please god we shall never part again amen to that murmured arnold who had sat down schaibar has told me everything said mavis still crying oh what a wicked world it is outside the pixy's house gerald there can be no wickedness where you are darling you will not find me like major rebb oh but gerald surely my guardian is kind has he proved himself kind to accuse you of murdering bellaria mavis drew back with a pale face and startled eyes there must be some mistake she faltered why should i kill bellaria oh rebb knows quite well that you did not but to suit his own ends he is willing that you should suffer is it for that horrid money schaibar told me about she asked tearfully yes rebb thinks that six thousand a year is worth losing his own soul for it is the world he gains and the price he pays but he shall not succeed my sweetheart you shall have your own way i swear gerald gerald i would much rather fly away with you to the end of the world and leave everything to my guardian i daresay dear and in the south seas no doubt we could find an eden whither that serpent would not come but your good name has to be considered mavis rebb has put it about that you are insane and that such insanity made you kill bellaria mavis sat down on the locker looking utterly miserable i know i know she cried rocking with the terror of her thoughts schaibar has told me what my guardian said to people outside to account for my being locked up in the pixy's house and to think that he should have said to me that all english girls were brought up as i was why did you not tell me before that my guardian was deceiving me she asked her former tutor my dear he said gently it is only lately that i have learned the truth about your father's will bellaria let drop a word or so and i began to ask questions rebb came to know of my curiosity and so gave me a sum of money and insisted that i should go to australia and hold no communication with you i took the money to save you and i had no compunction in doing so as the money belonged to you my dear to deceive rebb i pretended to go to australia but in reality i remained in england to search out your past bellaria had hinted that rebb enjoyed a large income for keeping you shut up in the pixy's house and that your father had been wealthy i searched for the copy of the will at somerset house and there learned how rebb was to enjoy the six thousand a year to which you were entitled until your marriage i then saw why he made out that you were insane and resolved to effect your escape i therefore bought a caravan to sell books thinking and my design was successful that i could get you out of the house and smuggle you away in my caravan i have done so as no one ever thought of searching for you in my company now you will go down to exmouth with sammy lee and i shall again go round the country if my caravan is searched by rebb and the officers of the law nothing will be found and you will be safe for how long for how long cried mavis clasping her hands until god sees fit to enable us to punish rebb and save you was the tutor's reply and everything will come right in the end i am sure the eyes of the girl wandered to gerald he sat down beside her and gathered her in his arms i am sure also he whispered see how wonderfully things have worked for your benefit as it is i was brought into your life by means of the cylinder to marry and cherish you in spite of rebb's cruel device of keeping you ignorant so that you should not be able to communicate with the outside world then arnold by god's mercy has been enabled to snatch you from the very jaws of your enemies these things point to joy coming out of sorrow go down my dear to exmouth with sammy lee i dare not come with you nor can schaibar as we will both be suspected by rebb and must prove as we can that we have nothing to do with your flight lee will arrange for you to be taken round by water to london and there i shall meet you to arrange for your safety would it not be better that she should go abroad asked arnold no i can arrange for mavis to be concealed in a way which rebb will not suspect if she goes abroad she may be extradited should rebb as he might discover her whereabouts but he will never look for my darling where i will place her so long as i am with you gerald i care nothing said mavis shivering and drawing closer to him but oh how can i go round to london by myself i who have never been beyond my prison walls sammy lee will see to that darling you must be brave and remember that i meet you at the end of your journey promise to be brave yes yes i promise said mavis flushing but it is all very terrible to think that this is the world this is rebb's world said haskins tenderly but not the world of joy and peace and love in which you will dwell when we are married married oh gerald yes he kissed her now flushed cheek but tell me mavis who killed that poor bellaria mavis shivered again although the cabin was warm i do not know she said faintly bellaria came back from london very terrified i can guess why murmured gerald thinking of the coral hand she said that she might be killed and made geary give her that yellow handled knife so that she might protect herself ah so rebb's story so far is true go on dear bellaria never went out at night as you know but a day or two ago she received a letter and said it would save her did you see the letter no she did not show it to me but last night i thought i heard a cry about midnight i went to bellaria's room and found her gone i was afraid and ran downstairs to find the door open and also the big gates then i saw her dead and cried out schaibar came and you know the rest interposed arnold addressing gerald i lighted a match and saw that bellaria was dead then took mavis away don't question her further she cannot bear it gerald nodded and soothed the girl who was much terrified but we must find that letter he remarked i am sure it has to do with the crime did you see anyone about mr arnold no i saw no one nor did i sobbed mavis hush dearest do not weep you are safe with me arnold who do you think killed bellaria dondi major rebb not geary major rebb repeated the tutor quietly to secure the income he has as you say sold his soul for six thousand a year chapter xvii as in a looking glass the next afternoon gerald was in london all the way up in the train he had reflected upon the extraordinary events which had transferred mavis from the keeping of major rebb to his own in spite of surrounding dangers and these were great he was not at all downcast mavis had been protected so far and he made sure that she would be protected to the end which in this case meant marriage with him the major would never believe that haskins had anything to do with the girl's flight though he certainly might suspect arnold but if arnold were traced to exeter where he intended to stay to avert suspicion nothing could be learned likely to incriminate him mavis had already gone down to exmouth in sammy lee's barge and that faithful fellow swore that he could procure her a passage to the thames in a coaster owned by a comrade in whom he could implicitly trust things were therefore right so far and gerald's spirits were high he had every reason to feel happy mavis was deeply in love with him and once major rebb was circumvented as it appeared he would be there would be no one else to interfere with the progress of his suit before the end of the year gerald hoped that he would be able to introduce his beautiful bride to his london friends and place her in a position warranted by her wealth it would not have been human if haskins had not remembered that mavis was an heiress but in justice to him it must be admitted that his love was for the girl and not for her money welcome as it was to a young man who liked the pleasant things of this life gerald would have been contented to take mavis without a sixpence nevertheless it was not disagreeable to find that she was bringing six thousand a year along with her also gerald was human enough to desire a certain amount of revenge on major rebb for his behavior rebb certainly should be punished for the infamous way in which he had treated the girl hitherto everything had gone as he desired but with the finding of the cylinder came the change in rebb's fortunes now he had a determined young man to deal with who would be less easy to manage than an unsophisticated girl haskins chuckled as he thought how angry rebb would be when mavis free from the slur on her sanity and from the wicked charge which he was striving to fasten on her came forth boldly to face the world then the luxurious major as mrs geary prophesied reduced to his five or six hundred a year would no longer be able to indulge in motor cars or in such like luxuries when haskins next evening went to bloomsbury to see mrs pelham odin he felt very satisfied mavis was on her way to london and would arrive at gravesend in two days her pursuers had been thrown off the track and a bombshell with regard to the will was being prepared by tod macandrew gerald had not seen him yet but he expected to meet him at the flat of the old actress and then could arrange for certain steps to be taken in the interests of mavis all things considered everything was going excellently and gerald entered into the presence of mrs pelham odin with a very cheerful air that astute lady remarked his beaming face she was as usual reclining on the sofa in an effective attitude waiting until ten o'clock which was the hour at which she usually went to the belver theatre to fetch back her adopted daughter she had been reading the evening paper but threw it aside with an air of relief when haskins was announced i am so glad to see you said mrs pelham odin there is positively nothing in the papers dear me mr haskins you have the air of a bridegroom nothing in the papers echoed gerald his bright face growing grave do you mean to say that the murder is not reported and he took up the globe to skim the columns murder cried mrs pelham odin in the low thrilling tone of lady macbeth to what dastardly deed do you refer the woman who watched mavis durham has been stabbed to the heart a couple of days ago alas for your comedy cried the actress it has changed into a tragedy what of the girl herself she is a fugitive the police are looking for her mrs pelham odin screamed melodramatically is she accused yes and color is lent to the accusation by the scandal of major rebb who as i told you spread the report that she was insane mrs pelham odin gave a second scream and flung up her hand hold she cried in her deep voice do i understand that this unfortunate young woman has given way to her mania and has murdered no one i tell you she is not insane snapped haskins tartly but the corpse account for the corpse i can't unless rebb himself murdered the woman so as to get mavis placed in an asylum and so be free to enjoy her money mrs pelham odin rose and walked to and fro with a nervous shudder less feigned than real although theatrical instinct made her accentuate it i don't love major rebb she said after a pause i think i told you that before all the same he would never never go so far as crime he has gone as far as that already retorted haskins stretching out his long legs and looking gloomily at the carpet what do you call keeping that girl's money from her and shutting her up but criminal still if he had reasons good reasons he had none either good or bad dear mrs pelham odin gerald rose and laid his hand on the old woman's arm hear what i have to say this is the time when you can show yourself my friend by protecting one who is dear to me the actress recoiled powerfully effected and very genuinely i cannot mix myself up in a crime she faltered you will not be doing so if you substitute mavis for charity as you suggested when i was last here oh mrs pelham odin clasped her pretty withered hands and stepped back a pace to be more dramatic think of the scandal there will be no scandal my name will be brought into disrepute and let me tell you mr haskins that my name both on and off the stage is above reproach i am quite sure of that else i certainly should not ask you to take charge of the woman i hope to make my wife you will marry her still of course of course said haskins impatiently i love her more than ever and even if i loved her less i am not the man to desert a woman when she needs help so sorely you are as i know very chivalrous and you are as i know the kindest hearted woman in the world a fool a fool i fear like all kind hearted women no were you a fool i should not ask you to carry out this plot as it is mavis is coming to london and i want you to get charity married at once and to place mavis at the belver theatre for the dance mrs pelham odin looked distinctly nervous carried away by her theatrical instincts and by admiration for gerald's chivalry to say nothing of the interest she felt in his love affair as a woman much less sentimental would have done she had proposed the plot without thinking that she would be taken seriously yet here was a young man whom she admired actually asking her to lend herself to a fantastical mode of concealment such as had never to her knowledge been seen off the stage her dramatic instinct impelled her to yield but her common sense warned her against mixing herself up in a murder committed by a lunatic dear boy she said genuinely distressed it really is impossible you proposed it mrs pelham odin muttered gerald sorely disappointed for if this actress did not help him how was he to conceal mavis from the persecutions of rebb i did not think that you would take me at my word she faltered and after all mr haskins major rebb might find out i don't think so i don't see how he could if he comes to the theatre he will see the girl he believes to be charity dancing but is this mavis durham really so like my girl they might be sisters they might be twins it would take you all your time to find the difference between them mrs pelham odin oh that is impossible she retorted sharply no when you see mavis i am not going to see mavis gerald rose he had thrown himself down when she so persistently refused in that case i must apologize for taking up your time and see in what other way i can save this innocent girl you are sure that she is innocent as sure as i am that you are a kind woman mrs pelham odin smiled that is very clever of you said she you appeal to my weakest side which is vanity come sit down again and tell me all about this dreadful murder will you assist me if i do at least i won't betray you rejoined the actress evasively and arranged herself gracefully on the sofa begin i hang upon your every word and she cast a glance at an imaginary audience to mark the effect of the speech thinking that she might yield for he had certainly aroused her curiosity gerald related all that had taken place mrs pelham odin quite lost her stage airs and graces so taken up was she with the narrative so you see that arnold believes in mavis' innocence as much as i do and you believe also mrs pelham odin i see it in your eyes the actress closed them my eyes tell what my tongue would hide she remarked in measured tones yes i admit that your story puts the matter in a new light i really think that i must assist this poor young creature who is being persecuted by a cruel world bless you for a good woman muttered gerald kissing her hand she pulled it away don't make a mistake i am playing to the gallery she said with an artificial laugh if mavis is proved guiltless and you marry her with her income it will be a great advertisement for me and perhaps added mrs pelham odin with emphasis it may bring back to the public in a worthy fashion the name of one who was their idol for many many brilliant and successful years on the other hand if this girl really is insane and guilty you will have acted in a way which no other woman would have done and your conscience will reward you i prefer the loaves and fishes said the actress smiling moreover i admit that i am curious to see this girl who as you say is so like charity mavis came from india yes according to major rebb who declares that her mother died in bombay when mavis was born charity according to the juggler's wife who was told by the ayah was born in simla mrs pelham odin frowned and then waved her hand there can be no relationship between the two girls i think that there will be when we learn the truth major rebb will not tell it oh yes he will when i prove mavis guiltless and force him to give up the money sooner than remain in ignorance i shall ask mavis to bribe him into confession mrs pelham odin thought for a few moments being as sharp as a needle to see the pounds shillings and pence side of things mr haskins she finally remarked this likeness may be a freak of nature we have heard of such things before quite so but so exact a likeness as this is can only come from the two girls being born of the same mother well you seem to be so certain that they are mr haskins that for the sake of argument we will grant it in that case and presuming that major rebb confesses such is the case charity certainly ought to have half the income i quite agree with you rejoined the young man unhesitatingly and i am quite sure that if we can prove the relationship mavis being guided by me will be quite ready to hand over three thousand a year to charity that would only be fair mrs pelham odin hopped off the sofa very much excited now you talk common sense you show me in which way my duty lies i am willing to see this girl and to help her against her enemies hum mrs pelham odin pressed her fan to her lips even three thousand a year for charity might be earned too dearly i can say no more than that i'll see her i am shrewd in reading characters and i can easily tell if mavis is insane or deceitful or bloodthirsty gerald laughed when he thought of his beautiful love mavis is none of the three you will be ashamed of your suspicions when you see her angel face i know that angel face said mrs pelham odin dryly it is a very useful mask in some cases to cloak wicked designs well i am going to the theatre soon mr macandrew is there and will come back with me and charity can i come to supper no said mrs pelham odin quickly you must leave the matter in my hands to explain i like the centre of the stage you know and all the limelight that i can obtain you will speak to tod and charity yes and will do my best to obtain their consent i'll let you know by post what they say provided added the actress with emphasis that you will not see mr macandrew in the meantime why not i want to ask him one thing at a time if this plot is to be carried through i must have the sole handling of it so i do not wish you and mr macandrew to discuss the matter if they are agreeable to marry and slip away quietly out of the kingdom leaving mavis to take charity's place at the belver theatre i shall let you know then when this girl arrives in london wire me when you will bring her she must stop here but the people of the house will see two charitys remonstrated gerald and as an account of the crime will be in the papers mavis may be given away by some of your servants mrs pelham odin nodded true she said with her sharp eyes on the carpet well then you must take mavis to your rooms worse and worse rebb would hear of it there is mr macandrew's office of course yes mrs pelham odin dropped her fan with an air of decision take mavis there closely veiled i shall bring charity also veiled should we settle to carry through this plot i can arrange for charity to board somewhere and mavis can come back here as charity and then oh it's all right i begin to see my way good night good night and thank you your kindness will not be unrewarded no she laughed three thousand a year is worth working for i don't believe that you think of that not solely of course i want to help you and to see you happy also i am very sorry for this poor girl and major rebb is a man i hate but the three thousand a year for charity also forms an element mixed motives you understand very mixed so once more good night gerald took his departure very much cheered at having brushed away another obstacle from the path which was to lead mavis to the altar he knew that mrs pelham odin was both a clever and an obstinate woman and although he did not credit her with money grubbing yet he felt convinced that she would not surrender charity's chance of getting three thousand a year if she could help it since she would indirectly participate in such good fortune also tod for the same reason would be anxious to assist though tod was not a miser either on the whole haskins was very satisfied and having done all that he could do he waited patiently for the arrival of the seamew at gravesend with mavis on board the boat was late as the weather did not prove propitious gerald went to gravesend and walked about the streets of that dull seaport in a frenzy of impatience finally he was undeservedly rewarded for to the hotel where he was stopping he had given sammy lee the address at exeter came a lean bright eyed captain with mavis in charge the girl was closely veiled and plainly dressed in some dark material it would not do for her to attract attention seeing that england was ringing with the murder of which she was accused and with her strange escape sammy lee's mate proved to be a very pleasant little man who confided to gerald that sammy had told him all and that he did not believe in the guilt of his passenger for one moment she's as pretty as a picture and as true as steel and as innocent as a dove said the poetical captain and if that rebb beast hurts her well then i'll have him shanghaied on board the seamew and do for him after which with a nod he departed the lovers had no time to talk at the hotel as gerald had wired at once to tod and they were expected in london but in the train haskins secured a first class carriage to themselves they had a long conversation and learned to know one another even better if that were possible and in spite of her danger mavis was happy in the company of her adored fairy prince as to gerald he could only worship her so gentle and innocent and lovely did she seem on arriving in london they drove with mavis again veiled to tod's chancery lane office and were shown into the inner room here were tod and mrs pelham odin and charity also veiled the two girls looked at one another and unveiled as by impulse then as in a looking glass cried mrs pelham odin wonderful marvelous here indeed is material for a new comedy of errors chapter xviii the first marriage mrs pelham odin might well exclaim gerald and tod were silent from sheer amazement even though the first might have expected to see one girl the double of the other in that box of an office and in the somewhat dim light that filtered through the dingy window mavis and charity appeared to be exactly alike miss bird was also plainly dressed in a dark frock so as not to attract attention from tod's clerks and this along with the thrown back veils completed the resemblance the two girls had similar eyes and hair and complexion and cast of face and even mrs pelham odin found it difficult to distinguish one from the other long as she had known her adopted daughter it is like a dream she declared girofla girofle in real life oh that i were in management again what a chance for a play a serious play which has to do with twins what we are engaged in is serious enough said gerald sitting down my dear mavis this is mrs pelham odin who is going to take charge of you until we can prove your innocence mavis shook hands with the old actress and you don't believe that i am guilty she asked in a whisper for answer mrs pelham odin embraced and kissed her my dear she said amiably truth looks out of your eyes out of my eyes i think said charity mr haskins this is really amazing i never thought to find my double it seems uncanny tod you will be marrying mavis instead of me no said tod slowly and looking from one girl to the other there is a difference meaning that mavis is more charming than i am thank you oh no broke in miss durham i am only an ignorant country girl but you are clever and polished and and quite perfect ended charity kissing mavis as mrs pelham odin had done and with the same kindness let us hope that i am in tod's eyes this is tod mavis he is to be my husband at last gasped macandrew sentimentally gerald displayed impatience had we not better get to business he observed these girls are so alike that i don't want them to be seen together lest trouble comes of it and trouble will come said mrs pelham odin who had not yet got over her amazement as charity says this line for line resemblance is uncanny i hope your veils are thick enough my dears if anyone saw you two together the wonderful resemblance would certainly be commented upon and might get to major rebb's ears charity looked long and earnestly at mavis we must be sisters can you remember ever having a sister mavis no nor did major rebb ever say that i had one he brought me as he said from bombay some time after my mother died and ever since i have been shut up in the pixy's house i was born at simla said charity thoughtfully at least the ayah who sold me to the juggler's wife declared that i was i don't remember anything about it of course mother oh don't ask me my dear i can explain nothing you know what i know and it is strange that both you and mavis should have been born in india that fact and the resemblance certainly points to some relationship between you they are sisters declared haskins firmly in no other way can the likeness be accounted for and yet there is a difference said tod for the second time it is in the tone of the voice and in the look of the eyes quite so said charity swiftly my voice has been trained for the stage and mavis' has not i have been brought up in the world and mavis out of it which fully accounts for the innocence looking out from her eyes and the worldly wickedness in mine my dear said mrs pelham odin displeased how you rattle on but i rather agree with you i must say if mavis had been brought up as you and you as mavis you would simply have changed places i hope that i make myself clear as clear as the murky darkness of this twin mystery can be made clear until major rebb confesses meanwhile and until we can force that man's hand we had better arrange what has to be done it was gerald who spoke mrs pelham odin patted mavis' hand which she was holding in her own very fondly i lose one daughter to find another she said cheerily mavis can come back with me to my flat and can wear some dresses which charity has left behind then i'll teach her to dance and in a couple of days she will be able to replace charity at the belver you are quite willing gerald asked miss bird anxiously of course i am she answered quickly i am quite on your side remember that mavis is accused of being a lunatic and a murderess i know my mother told me but i don't believe it for one moment i would as soon think myself capable of committing a crime i say the same said mrs pelham odin i told you mr haskins that i would wait until i saw mavis before deciding now that i have seen her i disbelieve all that major rebb says and moreover since the likeness is even stronger than you said between these two girls i can promise you that the plot will be carried out safely gerald hesitated will mavis dare to face the footlights mavis herself replied and the brave blood of her soldier father flamed in her cheeks as his courage shone in her eyes i shall dare anything for your sake gerald she declared without faltering and bellaria has taught me to dance poor bellaria she ended sadly it will be all right said mrs pelham odin who had been watching the girl critically it is a risk of course but as there is only one dance and the child has courage i do not think she will experience stage fright i can teach her the dance no interposed charity quickly let me do that mavis can come veiled to my lodgings which are now at kensington and i can show her all the steps and tricks and manner necessary i swear that when she is dressed as i was in the moon fay and dances as i shall teach her no one will be a bit the wiser and my engagement ends in a week or so and it will not be necessary for her to continue to appear mrs pelham odin nodded you must keep yourself quiet charity no one must see you at kensington i can trust my old dresser with whom i placed you there to night and to morrow night you can go to the theatre as usual on the third night mavis can appear and i shall see after charity meanwhile said tod eagerly in five days we can get married and i have bought a special license so that no banns need be put up then we can go abroad but tod said gerald somewhat dismayed although he might have expected this course of conduct i want you to help me i shall do so when i return in a month said tod quickly it is as well since mavis is to play the part of charity that my wife should be out of the kingdom i shall leave her abroad when i return and then we can try and put things straight they are crooked enough now do you agree to this gerald asked charity once more of course she answered promptly and i shall send tod back from switzerland before the end of our honeymoon the sooner these affairs are settled the better i wish you and mavis to be happy and also i want to know about my parentage i am tired of being charity bird you will soon be charity macandrew whispered tod tenderly oh yes but i wish to know if i am charity durham i am sure you are and my sister said mavis taking the other girl's hand and gerald and i have been talking if i get this six thousand a year you shall have half oh no cried charity half delighted and half doubtful oh yes even though you may not prove to be my sister gerald shrugged his shoulders there's no more to be said he remarked save that i am certain my surmise is correct well mrs pelham odin will you take mavis to your flat yes the old lady rose and with her own hands drew down mavis' veil we had better go at once seeing that we all now understand what is to be done charity that young lady had already arranged her veil tod is taking me back to kensington she said and will call for me to night at the theatre i shall say that you are indisposed mother quite so rejoined the actress but pray tell as few lies as possible and do behave yourself with mr macandrew we'll be as good as gold said tod piously by the way gerald one moment my clerk went to watch mrs crosbie and her mother at bognor well and what happened neither mrs berch nor mrs crosbie are there they have not been near the place now what does that mean she certainly said that she was going i suppose she changed her mind in a feminine way rejoined tod and the symposium broke up having arranged all necessary plans for the immediate future for the next day or two gerald was extremely anxious as may be guessed the daily papers were filled with accounts of the leegarth murder and with details respecting the search which was being made for mavis durham the inquest had taken place and the jury as was natural considering what major rebb declared brought in a verdict of wilful murder against the girl no one entertained a shadow of doubt as regarded her guilt and haskins was glad for once that mavis had not been taught to read since she could not worry herself over what the newspapers said rebb at the inquest had been severely reprehended for not having shut up his ward in a public asylum but nothing came out about the income belonging to her which he enjoyed it was the prevailing impression that rebb had taken charge of his brother officer's little girl out of sheer kindness of heart and many of the journals praised his philanthropy gerald could imagine rebb's grim smile on reading about the undeserved honors thrust upon him and the young man was also anxious about mavis' appearance at the belver theatre since she had been shut up all her life and might be terrified out of her wits when facing an audience if she did fail mrs pelham odin intended to announce that her daughter was ill and so gloss the matter over but neither the actress or the lover need have been afraid mavis knew what was expected of her knew what was at stake and heartened by her love for gerald as well as by her desire for safety she behaved like a heroine in a wonderfully short space of time she picked up the dance having been already taught how to use her hands and feet by the unfortunate bellaria moreover the girl was a born dancer and likewise suggested improvements which delighted both charity and her adopted mother indeed the latter lamented loudly that mavis was to marry gerald instead of appearing on the stage as out of such promising material she said that a wonderful actress could be made dancing was only one way in which mavis could express herself but with instruction and experience as mrs pelham odin averred she could attain to a high position on the english stage and we need new talent wailed mrs pelham odin half the actresses who are on the boards should be off them one result of mavis' improvements in the moon fay dance was that mrs pelham odin being an old friend of the belver manager induced him to give mavis a rehearsal of course he thought that the demure young lady who appeared was the charity bird he knew and that she merely wanted to alter the dance a trifle as the ballet was nearly at an end he scarcely deemed it necessary to grant mrs pelham odin's request but in the end she got her own way and mavis was fortunate enough to have a trial trip this assisted her greatly as it enabled her to face a small audience before beholding the greater one the manager was delighted with the improvements and hinted to mrs pelham odin as he had hinted before that he was anxious to re engage miss charity bird for the new ballet no said mrs pelham odin privately lamenting the necessity of declining exceptionally good terms in a couple of weeks or so when the run of the moon fay is over my daughter and myself are going to southend for a rest miss bird is not going to marry that macandrew fellow i hope remarked the manager who had heard rumors she will be a loss to the stage nothing has been arranged as yet replied the actress evasively and the matter dropped when the night came for mavis' appearance charity did a rash thing in which she induced tod to support her although both mrs pelham odin and gerald would have been seriously annoyed had they known this was nothing less than to make tod take her closely veiled to the gallery of the belver theatre to see her double dance tod remonstrated but being very much in love yielded in the long run and just before the curtain rose on the moon fay charity and the lawyer found themselves very comfortably seated among the gods the theatre was crowded as usual as the ballet was a successful one and charity pointed out gerald and mrs pelham odin in a small box near the stage i do hope mavis is not afraid whispered charity who was a trifle nervous herself no answered tod in the same low tones i am quite certain that she will pull through all right that girl has the heart of a lion and indeed macandrew's prophecy proved to be a correct one when the curtain drew up on the forest scene in which charity had figured for so many nights as a moon fay everything went excellently the wandering lover who was searching for his peasant love chased the moonbeams as usual these were electric lights and when they gathered into one radiance of white and he fell on his knees invoking the fairy of the moon to assist him in his search mavis arrayed in filmy vaporous robes of snow stepped calmly on to the stage she had altered the dress a little as she thought charity's robes were a trifle scanty the wardrobe mistress and the manager had remonstrated on the change and could not understand why miss charity bird had altered her mind about the dress when the ballet was nearing its end but they never suspected the truth as mavis a born actress had mimicked charity's speech and gesture in private life so she appeared in a kind of greek dress worn long and sparkling with silver her hair was crowned with a diadem of crystals and with her pure face uplifted in the glory of the light she looked indeed like a spirit the audience as did the stage hands and the manager thought still that they saw charity bird but all the same they felt in a puzzled way that there was something different in the girl what would they have said had they known that the moon fay was being sought for far and wide as a lunatic and a murderess but no one dreamed of such a thing and gerald would not have winced even had rebb himself been present but the major was not there as he had more important matters to attend to and moreover there was no need that he should come seeing that he was ignorant of the dancer's identity in the dark scenic forest and amidst the soft radiance of the electric lights mavis danced as she had been instructed by charity so as to swing in time to the music but also she introduced something of the mystic element she had displayed when gerald had beheld her swaying in the grounds of the pixy's house she floated across the wide stage like a veritable moonbeam beckoned to the lover bent over him like a fair white angel and finally melted into a mist this was contrived by gauze screens a clever device which had been much commented upon by the press when the moon fay vanished there was a burst of applause charity always had been applauded for her dance but never had the audience been so hearty in showing their appreciation as on this night but charity was not at all jealous for the attention bestowed upon her double i must have looked splendid if i was like that she whispered to tod of course you were like that replied macandrew isn't she your double dear only he added loyally and what is more he really believed what he said you were ever so much better mrs pelham odin hurried behind the scenes as soon as mavis' dance was at an end and hurried the girl away the moment she completed her change of dress as this was the old actress' usual way of behaving with charity her action caused no comment beyond the fact that several people behind the scenes remarked that miss bird had been in unusually good form on this particular night no one troubled about the matter and indeed why should they seeing how they had beheld the ballet for more than a hundred nights and also the dance of charity bird gerald was delighted and there was a very merry little supper at mrs pelham odin's flat that night mavis again and again asked her lover if she had done well and if he was pleased with her gerald could only reply with kisses until mrs pelham odin merrily declared that she could not remain in the room if they were so affectionate and then child she added we must turn this young man out for to morrow i have to be at mr macandrew's wedding cannot i come asked mavis eagerly bless me child no your presence would bring about the very complication we are desirous of avoiding things are going right so far so do not put them wrong so the next day mavis remained in the flat quite accepted by the servants of the house as miss charity bird while the real lady who bore that name went with macandrew and gerald and mrs pelham odin to a quiet country church in essex where tod had elected to get married gerald was the best man and mrs pelham odin gave the bride away in her best theatrical style none of tod's relatives were present for obvious reasons but as he led his bride down the aisle after the ceremony he grinned to think of lady euphemia's wrath did she know what had taken place i hope that i have done right sighed mrs pelham odin when looking after the train that bore tod and his bride away i think i have chapter xix signor venosta gerald did nothing until the conclusion of the presumed charity bird's engagement at the belver theatre there was no need to do so for the moment as the scheme to hide her had proved entirely successful and no one guessed where to look for the much wanted mavis mrs pelham odin took her to the theatre waited for her there and escorted her back again so that mavis spoke very little to the people behind the scenes gerald often came to supper and spent much of his time at the bloomsbury flat he was supposed to be writing a new book but in reality he indulged himself with a holiday to make love to the girl he had so strangely rescued but when the belver theatre closed for a time mrs pelham odin feeling the want of a change took mavis to southend and there occupied pleasant apartments looking out on to the sea mavis did not like to be parted from her lover as he could not see her so frequently but mrs pelham odin pointed out that haskins would have to begin his search for the true murderer of bellaria so that things could be put right also as mavis was being taught to read and write by the old actress it was just as well that gerald should not come too often to distract the scholar's attention from her lessons so mrs pelham odin stopped with mavis at the lively seaside town happy in the company of the girl and happy also to receive glowing letters from mrs tod macandrew in which she expatiated on her heavenly honeymoon haskins found his time hang rather heavily on his hands when mavis and her new guardian left london he wished to wait for tod before beginning operations but it would be quite a fortnight until macandrew returned and until then there was nothing to do gerald tried to write a few chapters of his new book in vain the thought of mavis and of her perilous position filled his head so he was obliged to throw aside his literary work until matters were made straight for the girl having come to this conclusion he resolved not to wait for tod's arrival but to work at the case himself the difficulty was how to begin arnold had stated plainly that he believed rebb to be the guilty person but of this gerald could not be sure he was convinced that if bellaria's life had stood between rebb and the six thousand a year she would have been murdered long ago moreover the story of how geary's knife came to be used sounded very plausible and if rebb were guilty haskins believed that he would not have told the police about the weapon as he had done when the inquest was held then again arnold did not know the true reason of bellaria's fear and why she had buried herself in that secluded devonshire village it struck gerald that the tna society had traced bellaria dondi to leegarth and there she had been slain as she expected mrs berch knew of bellaria's dread of the coral hand as gerald had told her about it when she called to claim it again she might have informed venosta who had bestowed the amulet on mrs crosbie he was undoubtedly an emissary of the tna society and probably was the real criminal arguing in this way haskins resolved to call on mrs crosbie and question her mother as to whether she had betrayed bellaria to the burly italian also he was anxious to learn why signor venosta had given the coral hand to the widow as it was incredible to think that she belonged to such a cut throat organization but there must be some reason why mrs crosbie should hold the trinket which had so sinister a significance and this gerald made up his mind to see into finally and as a third reason for his visit he desired to know when rebb and mrs crosbie would marry if tod were right about the widow's impecuniosity and gerald believed that he was she would not become the major's wife unless he was certain of his income and while mavis remained undiscovered rebb could by no means be certain gerald would have asked arnold to come to london but he thought it best that he should not be seen in the company of schaibar as the major might suspect that something was wrong it was of course impossible that rebb could ever trace mavis but it was just as well to be on the safe side so arnold remained in exeter touring the surrounding country as far as silbury denleigh and leegarth keeping a keen eye on geary and communicating to gerald by registered letters all the gossip dealing with the case which he could gather it seemed from the little man's epistles that the excitement had died down after bellaria was buried and a belief existed that mavis while flying from justice had fallen into some river and had been drowned whether the negro or rebb shared this comfortable belief haskins could not discover he thought not else the major might have been still more afraid of losing his illegal income in spite of his denial that mavis had any relatives either on the father's or mother's side it was possible that the gallant officer lied and if relatives existed they would certainly claim the money if mavis was supposed to be dead a few days therefore after mavis had departed with mrs pelham odin to southend gerald paid a visit to ladysmith mansions mrs crosbie was within looking much the same as usual and she received him in quite a friendly manner he fancied that the disagreeable topic of their last conversation had vanished from her memory but her first words after greetings proved that this was not the case i am glad to see you my dear gerald she said languidly pointing to a seat but i hope you are not going to tell me any more horrors i was not aware that i had ever told you any he answered rather annoyed by her tone oh yes all that story of the lunatic whom you wanted me to look after it was just as well that i did not seeing how mad she is she is not mad insisted the young man i told you that before and i tell you again madge how often have i said that you are not to call me by my christian name you silly boy said mrs crosbie irritably there is no one here gerald looked at the curtains dividing one room from the other i suppose mrs berch is not again lying down with a headache no she is out shopping and will be in soon and you needn't look so cross neither mother nor i told major rebb about your weird love affair mother overheard as she said but held her tongue madge don't i tell you major rebb may come in at any moment and i am also expecting signor venosta to afternoon tea what would either of them say if they heard you address me so familiarly gerald shrugged his shoulders and did not argue the point as you please mrs crosbie i was merely taking the privilege of our age long acquaintanceship why not friendship she inquired closing her eyes friendship then when are you to be married i can't say michael that is major rebb you know has not settled anything yet he's very much upset poor man over this crazy girl i don't believe that the girl is crazy said gerald decisively so you said before major rebb told me of his interview with you at that denleigh inn and how absurd you were now i suppose you will admit that you have had a lucky escape i admit nothing of the sort said haskins bluntly then added in a diplomatic manner did i know where that poor girl was i would look her up and marry her to morrow i don't think that lunatic marriages are legal yawned mrs crosbie in spite of what you say the girl must be guilty the jury brought in a verdict of wilful murder and she should be hanged as it is owing to her insanity i presume she will be shut up in an asylum then the major will be pleased i expect said gerald grimly no he will not he is very sorry about the affair it has brought his name before the public in a most unpleasant manner luckily everyone knows how well he behaved in looking after the girl he got nothing for doing it haskins started and wondered if it would be wise to reveal the real terms which existed between mavis and her guardian if mrs crosbie did not know how rebb earned his income if it could be called earning he was certainly marrying her under false pretenses for the moment gerald was inclined to blurt out the truth but remembering how mrs crosbie had taken his last confidence he resolved to hold his tongue about the money question and to let the widow and her admirer adjust their own private affairs meanwhile the widow had gone to the tea table which had just been set and was talking while she poured out the tea i hope that you have got over your infatuation for that girl gerald you will never see her again i expect she is dead fell into a pit or a river or something when she ran away after committing murder poor thing it is a lucky business for her that she is dead mrs crosbie said gerald ceremoniously taking a cup of tea you will insist that miss durham killed her nurse i believe from the bottom of my heart that she is innocent oh of course you would being in love said mrs crosbie with a shrug but if she is innocent who is guilty major rebb no i do not accuse him how good of you my dear gerald but added the young man with emphasis you may have an idea as to who killed bellaria dondi a piece of bread and butter fell from mrs crosbie's hand and she turned round with an amazed look i in heaven's name how should i know didn't your mother tell you what i said about bellaria and that coral hand which i found in your cigarette case yes the woman was afraid when she saw it do you know why she was afraid no i certainly do not could signor venosta tell you mrs crosbie rose and came forward with a glittering light in her eyes not pleasant to look at what do you mean signor venosta gave you the amulet mrs berch told me as much if he did what then signor venosta is an old friend of mine so long as major rebb does not object i fail to see why you oh i have no objections to offer interrupted gerald hurriedly but bellaria was afraid of that coral hand which symbolized now then mrs crosbie what did it symbolize i don't know she faltered and her eyes dropped after a pause she looked up i'll tell you all i know she added passing her lace handkerchief across her lips but keep what i say to yourself go on i shall say nothing to the world without your permission mrs crosbie reflected i was in difficulties over money when we last met she said rapidly there was an italian moneylender a jew in the city who held a bill of mine and treated me badly i did not know what to do when i told signor venosta in despair since he was always a good friend of mine he asked me the name of the jew and all particulars what is the name of the jew asked gerald quickly that has nothing to do with the story there is no need for you to know this moneylender was an italian jew and came from naples when signor venosta heard my tale he detached that coral hand from his watch chain on the very day you found us together and gave it to me saying that if i showed it to the jew everything would go well i put it for safety in my cigarette case which you carried off so small an object could easily be lost as you may guess when i found that my case was missing i sent mother at once to you thinking and rightly that you had taken it she brought it back well go on did you show it to the jew yes he was desperately afraid and agreed to whatever terms i chose to make so you may guess i insisted on having favorable ones that is all gerald why was the jew afraid i know no more than i know why bellaria was afraid did this italian jew from naples say anything no he turned a dirty yellow and nearly went on his knees i told him that if he did not give me my way that he would get into trouble and that i had brought the sign to show him he yielded and after our making terms he seemed glad to get rid of me but you know i know nothing she interrupted tartly and returned to the tea table haskins wondering if she was playing a part since she knew so much it seemed to him that she must know more he tried the effect of a surprise ah the jew was probably afraid of the tna this time mrs crosbie dropped the teapot which clattered on the tray with a great noise the tna society she stammered very pale the tna society said a new and foreign sounding voice at the same time and signor venosta was shown into the room as the teapot fell 'mrs crosbie recovered herself with an effort oh signor how are you to day last time mr haskins you know mr haskins found you with me now you find him with me how strange she was talking for the sake of talking as gerald noted for her face was livid and her bosom rose and fell stormily the burly italian who looked perfectly self controlled and composed eyed haskins who bore his gaze without flinching neither man took notice of mrs crosbie's chatter and she sank again into her seat before the tea table won't you sit down also you two she tittered nervously you mentioned the tna society said venosta turning on the little woman and to this young man pardon me i mentioned it first to mrs crosbie said haskins coolly what do you know of the tna society very little beyond the fact that it consists of a body of men who emerge on occasions from the den to dispense that justice which cannot be obtained by law the headquarters of the society is in naples and the symbol is a coral hand grasping a dagger signor venosta might have been hewn out of marble for all the surprise he showed at this speech but he was staggered since gerald caught the expression of his eyes may i ask how you know all this sir gerald shrugged i see no reason to conceal the fact that by chance i carried away mrs crosbie's cigarette case during my last visit the amulet fell out when i opened the case in my rooms for a cigarette quite so' assented venosta blandly but you thought no doubt that it was merely a trinket yes such as an old friend you for instance signor venosta might give to mrs crosbie ah the italian turned swiftly on the widow you have told him no no she said vehemently only that you gave me the trinket and that i made that jew moneylender do what i wanted by showing it to him i did not tell anything else because i know nothing else save that the coral hand has to do with some society called the tna how do you know that much even my mother told me mr haskins told her and how do you know demanded venosta turning toward gerald because bellaria dondi the italian started came to my rooms just before mrs berch appeared to reclaim the cigarette case bellaria was afraid when she saw the amulet and staggered out of the room crying out 'tna tna' i asked a friend what the word meant and he told me it meant a den told me also that he had heard of the society by that name in naples i guessed then from what bellaria said and from her terror that the tna society wished to kill her venosta nodded and smiled amiably you are a clever young gentleman to piece things together so cleverly well i have heard the name of bellaria dondi in connection with this murder asked gerald or long ago when she was a singer and in love with enrico salviati signor venosta's brow grew dark and he frowned fiercely bellaria told you much he said striving to appear calm much assented gerald easily and not at all daunted by black looks but she did not tell me who had struck the blow or who had given the information which led to the striking of the blow she could not she is dead poor soul venosta eyed him coldly then and in spite of the verdict which accuses an english young lady of murder you believe the tna society murdered bellaria dondi did justice on her let us say remarked gerald quietly that is the euphonious way in which you italians put such things and you believe that i obtained the news of bellaria's whereabouts from his eye wandered to mrs crosbie she sprang to her feet indignantly it is not true i told you nothing of what my mother said nothing of what she heard from gerald say that i did not tell you how could i when i knew nothing had i known of this society and your connection with it i should not have made use of that coral hand to terrify the jew i do not say that i am connected with the tna society madam you gave me the trinket which was given to me by a member of the society for use in emergencies madam i gave it to you to aid you out of friendship that is all he waved his large white hand there is no more to be said pardon me said gerald quickly there is this much to be said how did you come to know of bellaria's hiding place if mrs crosbie madam here told me nothing interrupted the italian silencing the little widow with a gesture bellaria dondi was a traitress who deserved to be killed nevertheless she hid herself so successfully that the tna society never knew where she was until the papers said that she had been found dead in devonshire did not an emissary of the tna society kill her asked gerald confounded no said venosta gravely heaven punished bellaria not the tna she is dead stabbed but i do not know who struck the blow he looked at mrs crosbie and at gerald coldly bowed slightly and left the room chapter xx a dark mystery almost as soon as the italian went out mrs berch entered since gerald had seen her last she had greatly aged and looked more worn and thin than ever in her dark gown glancing from the young man to her daughter she went to the latter and took her hand what is the matter madge she asked in her stern cold voice why has signor venosta left and why are you shivering gerald she turned to haskins what have you been saying to my daughter nothing he answered calmly but signor venosta has been saying a great deal to both of us it is about that coral hand mother cried mrs crosbie feverishly and clinging to mrs berch signor venosta says that it is the symbol of a society which murders and for that reason the moneylender was afraid i wish i had refused venosta's assistance she ended why did you talk of these horrors asked mrs berch reproachfully you know gerald that madge cannot bear such things i am trying to learn who killed bellaria mrs berch and it struck me since she was afraid of the coral hand that you told madge what i told you and that this being repeated to venosta he might have stabbed the woman by order of the tna society i don't know anything about the tna society neither do i neither do i muttered mrs crosbie and there is no reason why signor venosta who is our friend should kill major rebb's servant went on mrs berch steadily everyone knows that she was stabbed by that crazy girl i don't agree with you replied gerald coldly and prepared to leave however it is useless arguing i can only apologize to mrs crosbie for having brought up so disagreeable a subject good day no said the widow rising and recovering her color and nerve don't go yet gerald i know that you did not mean any harm and after all as signor venosta has nothing to do with the death it matters very little had i known when i saw the moneylender what i know now i should never have taken that coral hand but i have given it back to signor venosta and he will not mention the subject again sit down and have another cup of tea do urged mrs berch the light coming into her cold eyes i think you owe it to madge to remove the impression of this horror the whole thing is too fantastical with its symbols and secret societies and murders in lonely houses we live in the twentieth century and these things belong to fiction the last does not replied haskins dryly bellaria was certainly murdered at the pixy's house and by that crazy girl insisted mrs berch i hope she will be caught and shut up in an asylum it is not safe to let such a creature go at large haskins defended mavis no longer as he was afraid that the two women both keen eyed and clever might guess his secret knowledge of the girl's whereabouts let us change the subject he said taking a fresh cup of tea from mrs crosbie's hand i hope you enjoyed yourselves at bognor oh very much indeed said the widow brightly and we were quite sorry to return to london but we are going abroad soon to switzerland gerald winced switzerland was a wide place yet if mrs berch and her daughter went there it was not impossible but what they might come across the honeymooning path of mr and mrs macandrew in that event major rebb would certainly learn that charity was married and therefore guess that mavis was with mrs pelham odin however he showed no signs of his fears but privately resolved to write to tod when are you going mrs crosbie i can't say exactly she answered carelessly it all depends on major rebb he is coming with mother and myself but has some business to arrange before he can leave london what have you been doing with yourself lately gerald we as you know have been at bognor writing as usual and haskins plunged into an account of his new book for the sake of talking on a safe subject yet even as he spoke his brain was wondering why the widow lied about bognor according to tod's clerk the two ladies had not been near that watering place but mrs crosbie spoke as having just returned from that very town probably since both were hard up mrs crosbie in talking of the moneylender had confessed as much they had been ruralizing in some quiet and cheap part of the country for the next twenty minutes the conversation was of a light and somewhat frivolous order and in so congenial an atmosphere the widow expanded like a flower even mrs berch grew more human and less like a stone image it was quite like old days when gerald's mother had sat knitting and listening with a smile on her well remembered face mrs crosbie evidently recalled the past for when gerald finally took his departure she accompanied him to the door what a pleasant quarter of an hour we have had she said pressing his hand we always get on well together gerald and mother is so fond of you i wish you had not quarreled with michael with major rebb that is for when i am married i want you still to be my friend i am only too willing to continue so but rebb doesn't like me how can you expect him to said mrs crosbie petulantly when you accuse him of shutting up that girl unjustly i do hope you have got over your infatuation for her it would never do for you to marry a madwoman no said gerald shirking a useless argument it would never do good day madge i shall see you again soon and he went down the stairs with backward glances to see mrs crosbie shaking a playful finger at him for calling her as usual by her christian name when in the street gerald suddenly remembered that it would have been as well to get signor venosta's address from the widow as he wanted to gain further information concerning the tna society but on second thoughts he saw little use in again questioning venosta the italian had plainly denied the murder and would tell him nothing more about the society which was a secret one haskins quite believed what venosta said with regard to the crime if bellaria judged a traitress by the tna had been deliberately stabbed it was improbable that venosta as the mouthpiece of the cut throat organization would deny that such justice had been executed such societies were rather proud than otherwise of their vengeance and did not mind the truth being known since publicity on this score terrified other members who might wish to break their oaths the tna society therefore was guiltless of bellaria's death and the assassin would have to be sought for in another quarter but where can i look gerald asked himself and it was not until he reached frederick street that he decided what to do the decision he came to was to journey at once to denleigh and interview the negro probably geary knew the truth and might be bribed or terrified into telling what he knew to depend upon this semi civilized creature was grasping at a straw but to whom else could he go for information rebb fighting with his back to the wall would not tell but geary knowing his master's secrets might be persuaded or kicked or bought over into speech when gerald arrived in his rooms he was met with a surprise in the shape of tod macandrew looking sunburnt healthy and marvelously happy good heavens what are you doing here asked haskins amazed looking for you retorted tod and shook hands charity is so anxious to see mavis cleared and you married to her that she made me come back and where is mrs macandrew at amsterdam what is she doing there waiting for me she would not stop in switzerland as it was too far away so she came to amsterdam i can run over and see her there whenever i like until this infernal business of the murder is cleared up and i can bring her back to england i am glad she is in holland remarked gerald and told tod how mrs crosbie and her mother intended to go to switzerland and of his dread lest they might meet charity tod nodded it is just as well he answered however charity is all right and snug so i am at your disposal mavis and mrs pelham odin are at southend yes where rebb is not likely to look for them as for myself i am going to devonshire to morrow to see geary and arnold arnold yes i should like to interview him and see if he has picked up any further information as to geary do you suspect him yes and no according to rebb geary gave the knife to bellaria and certainly i shot geary in the right arm so on the night of the murder he was in no condition to kill the woman geary i believe is guiltless but he knows rebb's secrets and i wish to force him into telling them hum said tod nursing his chin do you believe that rebb i don't know what to believe of rebb interrupted gerald quickly as i told you mr arnold thinks that rebb stabbed bellaria he may have done so or he may not at all events i am going down to find out then haskins related what he had learned about the coral hand and how venosta had disclaimed the murder which he would not have done tod had the society executed vengeance on bellaria but by confessing he would run his neck into a noose no he would simply deny having told me and his guilt would be difficult to prove since both mrs crosbie and mrs berch say that they did not tell him about bellaria's terror of the amulet moreover he would clear out of england back to his own country and could laugh at the english law no tod i feel certain that venosta and his accursed society are innocent and you believe that geary is innocent also you leave only rebb to be accused however i'll come down with you and scour the country after a conversation with this arnold we can then learn what strangers were in the neighborhood of leegarth on the night of the murder what then no stranger had any reason to murder bellaria well i don't know the crime may be the work of a tramp i daresay there were rumors of jewels and money and all the rest of it a tramp might no said gerald very decidedly mavis declares that bellaria received a letter which excited her i should not be surprised to learn that the letter asked her to come to the gate at midnight so that she might meet with her death ah then you think this letter was written by the assassin if so rebb is guiltless he would not commit himself to making an appointment in writing when he could have met bellaria easily without doing so where is this letter i don't know mavis says that bellaria had it on her person but it could not have been found else it would have been produced at the inquest i know from reading the papers that it was not hum said tod again well let us go down to devonshire and then we can look into things it is very good of you to cut short your honeymoon to help me said gerald patting macandrew on the back it is very good of me indeed assented tod readily and i wouldn't have done it for another living soul come now take me out to dinner at the troc and amuse me with the best play in london haskins laughed and did all that was desired as it was just as well to keep tod from fretting after the wife he had left at amsterdam but macandrew did not do things by half having come over to help his friend he did not keep reminding him of the sacrifice he had made tod ate an excellent dinner and laughed at a musical comedy and went to sleep in gerald's extra bedroom after a smoke and a glass of whisky slightly diluted with water macandrew as became a native of scotland liked his drink strong next morning the two friends went down to the west of england in very good spirits at exeter tod alighted to see arnold having obtained the monmouth hotel address from gerald and the other amateur detective proceeded to silbury where as usual he put up at the prince's head mrs jennings was pleased to see him but could tell him very little about the murder likely to throw any light on its darkness it seemed to gerald that she took very little interest in the matter that crazy girl can't be found she told her guest so i expect poor soul she has been drowned that is the general opinion sir as that is the case and miss bellaria is buried in leegarth graveyard there is no more to be said what of the pixy's house major rebb has shut it up in a way that is for that mad girl's rooms were beautifully furnished i saw them myself added mrs jennings breathlessly when i went over after the inquest to leegarth but major rebb has been living in those rooms with his man geary no sir geary is still the landlord of the devon maid he was fiddling with a pistol and hurt himself but he is all right now major rebb brought his own man from town who cooks and looks after the place i expect the major likes better to live in the pixy's house than in the hotel at denleigh i would not live in that wicked house myself ended mrs jennings with a shudder i should be afraid of miss bellaria's ghost is major rebb there now asked gerald quickly he comes again to morrow or the next day i believe answered the landlady who knew all the gossip of the neighborhood and they say that he intends to repair the house against his marriage with a london lady haskins nodded and took his way over the hills to denleigh it was apparent that rebb really believed mavis to be drowned according to common report and since no one was likely to question his right to the income or the house he intended to reap as a married man the fruit of his villainy it seemed strange to gerald that mavis should not have any relative who would dispute the will but he knew how often old families dwindle down to a single person in this case he believed that there were two twigs still sprouting from the durham family tree in the persons of the twin girls on crossing the bridge in denleigh valley haskins saw geary lounging at his door looking big and black and sullen and dangerous however a white man was not to be intimidated by a barbarous animal like this so gerald walked up to him coolly and wished him good day geary grew green under his black skin and glared like a wild beast his hands working convulsively at his back in the passage could be seen the scared face of mrs geary she evidently dreaded what haskins' errand might be since she must have known of her husband's footpad attack what might you be doing here sah asked geary rolling his eyes taking a stroll geary simply taking a stroll how is your arm the negro glared and took a step forward his hand slipping round to the back haskins moved aside and gripped the revolver which he had taken the precaution to bring with him mr geary's knife was too dangerous a weapon to be met with mere fists i am quite ready said the white man coolly you bring out that knife and i shoot dat would be murder sah whimpered geary reading danger in haskins' steady eye but he withdrew his hand from his back all the same you nearly murdered me afore sah i winged you as a murderous dog said gerald sharply and you quite deserve to be shot are you not afraid lest i should bring you into court for attacking me you would get a long term of imprisonment adonis we don't allow these sort of things in england you do what you like sah major rebb him look after me i don't think major rebb will interfere said gerald carelessly geary showed his white teeth significantly dat massa ob mine will see dat all is safe wid me sah until he die ah that means you can force him to protect you i say noting sah strange for you were always garrulous where is your amiable smile mr geary and your polite manners i always knew you to be a murderous hound but you might have spared poor bellaria geary flung up his hands and looked greener than ever i did not hab noting to do wid dat woman sah oh i think so stand where you are and keep your hands in front of you cried haskins sharply or i'll send a bullet through you the negro's eyes rolled and he looked round for assistance but the population of denleigh were indoors partaking of the evening meal and beyond a few children playing far down the stream no one was in sight i no kill dat bellaria he repeated doggedly but did not venture to grip his knife he had experienced the shooting of his opponent before you liar you came back here and after having had your arm bound up you went to the pixy's house this chance shot of haskins' hit the mark no sah no sah gasped the big man but his knees knocked together you did cried haskins following up his advantage and major rebb went also it's one big lie sah no no doan' shoot sah and with a scream he backed into the house to shut the door but could not because mrs geary large and massive blocked the way see here geary said haskins lowering the pistol he had raised i intend to have you arrested for that assault unless you tell me the truth about this crime you are guilty no sah no sah moaned the man again mr haskins said the woman brushing aside her husband and coming out my husband has been a bad one to me but he is innocent major rebb went to the pixy's house on hole dat tongue you beast yelled geary furiously chapter xxi major rebb at bay but mrs geary would not be silenced her meekness seemed to have disappeared and she faced the negro as bold as any amazon i shall not hold my tongue adonis she said drawing a deep breath the time has gone by when you could bully me i have suffered enough at your hands and a fool i was to marry a black savage such as you are you how long she would have gone on in that manner it is impossible to say for the pent up anger of years appeared to break forth however gerald saw that people were coming out of their houses and sauntering in the direction of the inn unwilling that too much should be made public for obvious reasons he pushed his way past mrs geary and into the house commanding the two to follow him they did so the woman willingly enough but the negro hung back with a snarl and evidently tried his old tricks on his wife there was a scream as haskins entered the old sitting room which he had occupied with tod and then the sounds of slapping and scuffling and swearing gerald flung himself into an armchair and looked towards the open door it was filled the next moment by geary being thrust forward by his wife who had cuffed and thrashed him into a dazed silence she literally flung him into the room and following herself closed and locked the door standing before this wrathful and gigantic she pointed a menacing finger at the black man i was a fool to marry such a black savage as you are she went on from where she had left off you have been a beast and a tyrant and have driven me to drink the drink is in me now and that is what makes me so bold wait till the drink is out of you breathed geary trying to assert himself and flashed an angry look in her direction formerly that look had cowed the woman but now she simply snapped her fingers in his astonished face it won't do adonis it won't do the worm has turned at last you have made me desperate i'll have no more of these murders and beatings and swearings i am a baptist myself and you have nearly ruined my soul but now you black dog it is my turn to morrow i go back to my mother at barnstaple with my children i can get work to do and earn money to keep them and myself as for you stay here with your ill gotten money for doing major rebb's dirty work i could ruin you but i shall not do that still the truth must be told to this gentleman what is that asked gerald sitting up and expectant of what was coming he saw the truth in mrs geary's fiery eyes the truth is that major rebb murdered bellaria it isn't de troofth muttered geary clenching his huge fists his wife taunted him ah you'd like to strike me you animal she said in a loud voice but do do i dare you never again oh never again i can die but once and if you use your knife i'll use my teeth and my hands and my feet to fight you better death than more of this dog life with you her breast rose and fell stormily and gerald looked at her as amazed as was her husband never before had the meek ogress behaved in this fashion although on several occasions she had tried to assert herself but having turned she left no room for doubt as to what she meant looking at the transformed woman who had been goaded into revolt haskins thought of balzac's remark which was now excellently illustrated there is nothing more horrible than the rebellion of a sheep wait only wait it was geary who spoke but he spoke without conviction since he felt rather than saw that his rule was at an end it is ever thus with tyrants they browbeat those who are willing to serve them for many years and the milder the servant the greater burden does the master impose mrs geary had labored like a horse doing more than was required of her still the negro had not been pleased and therefore had beaten and kicked his beast of burden never dreaming of any revolt but the measure was filled to the brim the last straw had stiffened the camel's back rather than broken it and mrs geary had risen to assert the right of a human being adonis blustered and threatened but he knew that never again would his wife submit to his domination with your domestic affairs i have no need to meddle said gerald raising his hand to stop mrs geary's speech and her husband's growling i think you are right to leave that brute and if you need money i shall supply you with all you wish thank you sir said mrs geary dropping a curtsey and glared at her husband the drink was dying out of her but she still fought as she was supported by haskins' presence you hear that adonis i'll go to law sah growled geary you make my wife fight you shall have more law than you bargain for said gerald coldly i can promise you that go on mrs geary tell your story she placed her big arms akimbo and spoke steadily when geary went after you on that night sir i knew he was up to some deviltry since he almost stripped himself and used all the oil in the cruet stand to rub over himself i spoke to the major that is i went in to speak to him here and ask what geary was up to but the major was gone gone echoed gerald then he went immediately after i left not exactly sir it was quite an hour after adonis followed you that i came in here then adonis came back wounded and i bound up his arm he asked if his old master was in and when he heard that the major had gone out he followed followed where i followed to the pixy's house said adonis hoarsely you may as well know dat what i know sah i hab noting to do wid de murder i went ober de hills for de major and i found him coming back at what time was that after midnight cried mrs geary it was two o'clock before the major and adonis returned and bellaria was murdered according to the medical evidence about midnight murmured haskins so you went to the pixy's house no sah i no go dere i meet de major coming back he say dat he had gone to see if you sah had been visitin' de house after you went from here den i tole him dat i tried to kill you for i hear that you wished to make trouble for de major de major berry angry wid me and we come home den in the morning we hear ob de murder didn't the major tell you that he had found bellaria stabbed no sah him say noting i ask noting dat's all if major rebb was in the pixy's house at midnight he either stabbed bellaria himself or he knows who stabbed her said gerald deliberately and rose is this all you have to tell me dat all growled the man sullenly but de major did not kill bellaria asked for my big knife 'cause she was feared did you know what she feared no sah de major he know but he no tell me there was nothing to be done but to wait and see rebb so as to question him on this unexpected information which mrs geary had forced her cowed husband to give haskins slipped a sovereign into the woman's hand and walked to the door if you follow me again to knife me adonis he remarked remember i have a revolver the negro pointed to his useless right arm i can do noting he said and his eyes flashed as he added i should like to mrs geary pushed past her husband no you can do nothing with that arm it has beaten me often enough geary she pointed a finger at him now i leave your house with my children this very moment i leave i shall never see you again you have nowhere to go you fool gal i can tramp with the children to leegarth and there a friend of mine can put me up for the night i have this sovereign the young gentleman has given me and to morrow i take the train back to my mother i think you are wise mrs geary called back gerald and began his return journey to silbury leaving the negro and his wife to settle their private affairs as they best could but he felt certain that mrs geary meant what she said and would leave the devon maid at once she feared now that she was more sober and gerald was gone lest she should again succumb to the tyranny of the negro the next morning gerald received a letter from tod saying that he was going with arnold to belldown a village on the hither side of leegarth and some ten miles distant haskins wondered why his friend and the tutor should go to such a secluded place probably tod had found some evidence which took him there for examination of the same but his letter was most unsatisfactory as he gave no hint of what arnold had explained gerald felt somewhat in the dark however it was useless to conjecture when macandrew had done what he wanted to do at belldown whatever that might be he would come to silbury with mr arnold and explain himself meanwhile gerald possessed his soul in patience and wished that rebb would come down to the pixy's house when he descended to breakfast and mrs jennings entered with her budget of gossip he learned that major rebb had driven through silbury early that morning on his way to leegarth he came down by the night train i hear sir said mrs jennings haskins was very well satisfied as this arrival provided him with work for the day apparently rebb had seen mrs crosbie on the previous day and had learned what took place from the widow or her mother and it was possible that he had come to the frederick street chambers to ask haskins what he meant by meddling with the case there he would learn that the marplot as he regarded haskins had gone on to devonshire and so had come down post haste by the next train he could catch all this argued a guilty conscience and gerald took his way to leegarth later in the morning to have it out with his enemy it occurred to him that rebb was guilty after all the day was not so hot as the previous one had been so haskins walked to leegarth he could have obtained a horse or a bicycle as on the two former occasions but preferred to use his legs the country was very beautiful and the air most exhilarating so he enjoyed the journey and arrived at leegarth without unduly hurrying himself when he came in sight of the pixy's house he felt in his hip pocket to make sure that his revolver was safe rebb was a desperate man and might make an attack after the fashion of geary therefore it was as well to be on the safe side thus ready for any emergency he rang the bell at the big gates which were again closed and bolted in less time than he expected the gates were thrown open by the mild faced valet of rebb whom haskins had last seen in london my master is expecting you sir said the valet stepping back to permit the visitor to enter in fact sir he came down here immediately after you for an interview i have been watching at the gates all the morning how did major rebb know that i was in devonshire asked gerald and received the expected reply that rebb had inquired at his frederick street rooms while following the valet up the narrow path which wound between saplings and jungly grasses gerald looked hard at him wondering if this man like geary knew of rebb's affairs but the mild face of the valet betrayed nothing he looked like a sheep and probably was one major rebb did not care for over clever servants probably he had learned a lesson when pensioning off geary who knew far too much the old place looked very beautiful in the warm golden light and gerald caught a glimpse of the lawn whereon mavis had danced he sighed to think of what had happened since that wonderful night a gulf had opened between the girl and the world which could only be bridged by an open confession by rebb as to the truth of the murder but haskins had very little time to cogitate for the valet led him swiftly through the archway and into the house he preceded the visitor up a shallow staircase and along a spacious passage on the first floor on knocking at a door and being bidden to enter he introduced gerald into a large room with no less than five windows looking out on to the tangled avenue and rough lawns and riotous shrubberies this was mavis' apartment as gerald had been told when he came to see inspector morgan and it was luxuriously furnished so as to be a pleasant prison for the unfortunate girl bad as rebb was he had done his best to make mavis' voluntary captivity endurable that is it could be called voluntary since the major had told her that all english girls were brought up in seclusion and she had acquiesced how are you haskins said the major when his man had shut the door and they were alone together in the splendid room i have been expecting you so i have been given to understand by your valet replied gerald coolly and sat down to take out his pipe you don't object to my smoking i presume rebb smiled grimly no he rejoined deliberately you may need soothing before our conversation ends dear me that sounds threatening are you going to murder me or drop me into an oubliette if so i advise you to think twice about it the police at silbury know that i am here i told a young constable in the high street where i was going i don't see why you should do that said rebb sharply i do rejoined the young man calmly you are a dangerous man rebb and you are being driven into a corner however if you think to silence me by violence you will only get yourself into difficulties you are afraid taunted the major sneeringly oh not at all retorted haskins although his fair face flushed a trifle there is no question of that the mere fact that i come here alone is enough to prove that i do not fear you he lighted his pipe carefully and looked along the stem at his host fire away rebb sat down in a comfortable chair with his back to the window probably so that haskins should not read his face too easily he was neatly dressed in a maroon colored smoking suit and looked as spic and span as though he had just stepped out of a band box but then rebb being something of a lady killer had always been attentive to his personal appearance he suited the room very well as he looked high bred and bland and dangerously amiable what do you wish me to say he asked quietly that is for you to judge answered haskins lazily but very attentive to rebb's slightest movement you say that you expected me well i presume that means you have something to say you have called to see me without an invitation retorted rebb so that shows you have a few questions to ask me you are right i have but you are not hospitable rebb i am dry after that long walk from silbury what about beer are you not afraid of my poisoning you asked the major rising and going to a sideboard not at all you would like to so as to silence me for ever had i come here without anyone knowing my whereabouts you would doubtless try to get rid of me in some way or another but the game in this case is not worth the candle the pixy's house has a bad reputation for one murder major and i don't think you would care to have another committed either by yourself or your tool geary i did not set geary on to you snapped rebb discomposed by this cool chatter and returning to the central table with a tray so i understand geary told me so last night you have seen him oh yes and his wife also she rather gave you away major and i may tell you that she has left her husband having had enough of his brutality the children i believe are with her i don't know what you mean about that woman having given me away said the major trying to control himself there is nothing in my life but what will bear inspection even by the law even by the law will you have hock or claret hock please and some seltzer i congratulate you on your courageous conscience major few people even the best of us can stand having their secret lives looked into rebb passed along a glass foaming with the drink and shrugged his shoulders as he took up the claret jug did you come here to preach platitudes he asked cynically gerald took a long drink and set down his glass with a laugh no i came to ask you where mavis durham is hiding how should i know she may be dead for all i can tell and indeed added rebb to himself i believe she is dead else she would have been discovered long ago have you any idea of her whereabouts if i had would i ask you fenced gerald coolly i stopped on the night of that poor girl's flight at the prince's head as you will find if you ask mrs jennings i have asked her already and i know that ah then you did suspect me of having a hand in the murder i fancied that you might since you loved mavis and wanted to get her away from here i hope you are satisfied with your work with my work what do you mean haskins sat up simply this that nothing has gone right since you found that infernal cylinder and pryed into my private affairs rebb glared if it was the old days of dueling haskins i should call you out i quite believe it but as dueling days are past you will have to silence me in another way why should i silence you because rebb i know too much after i left you on that night at the devon maid you came here and i did not interrupted rebb fiercely you came here mrs geary says so and i believe from my soul that you killed bellaria and put the blame on mavis to secure her money rebb started to his feet you infernal liar and he flung his glass at the young man chapter xxii a confession the glass skimmed past haskins' head and smashed against the wainscoting by this time both men were on their feet rebb glaring and furious but gerald perfectly calm a few drops of the claret had sprinkled his face and he wiped these off quietly there is nothing to be gained by your losing your temper rebb he remarked don't tell me what to do or what not to do raged the major striding towards the door which he locked you are in my power here haskins sat down again with a contemptuous laugh so much so that if you opened that door to let me out i should refuse to go don't be a fool rebb one would think you were a melodramatic actor do you think that i am afraid of you or of a dozen like you sit down and let us talk quietly over the matter rebb walked forward and flung himself into a chair gnawing his moustache somewhat taken aback by haskins' aplomb usually when he asserted his undeniably strong will his opponents sat down and obeyed but the major recognized readily enough that he had a determined man to deal with and moreover knew that he could not get the better of him by treachery since the silbury police were aware of haskins' whereabouts the pixy's house already had an unpleasant reputation and rebb did not wish an inexplicable disappearance to take place there he would willingly have got rid of this man who so persistently crossed his path but the risk was too great and as man to man gerald was more than able to hold his own rebb was no fool and for the moment he mentally confessed himself beaten i ask your pardon for losing my temper he said wiping his forehead but no man can sit quietly and hear himself accused of woman murder defend yourself then said gerald relighting his pipe which had gone out during the episode there is no need for me to make a defence snarled the other i think there is geary may hold his tongue since he appears to be devoted to you but his wife having left her husband will certainly speak out what can she say asked rebb taking another glass of claret that you went to this place on the night and about the time of the murder you went away some time after i left and did not return until two in the morning major rebb sat moodily looking at the tips of his slippers he saw well that gerald was right and if the young man as he probably would supported mrs geary in making trouble very unpleasant questions might be asked why the devil do you interfere in my business he asked between his teeth because i love mavis durham she is dead you can't be sure of that then you know cried the major starting to his feet now how should i know anything when you have exonerated me from complicity in her flight argued gerald dexterously skirting the subject if i had run away with mavis she would be my wife by this time and would have passed her honeymoon in prison growled rebb quite convinced by gerald's quiet tone i think not i should have fought for my wife and i intend to search for her and fight for her still you'll never find her if she were alive she would have been captured long ago ah it would please you no doubt to see her hanged no on my soul no cried the major beginning to walk to and fro i only want to see her happy she was happy here he added as gerald laughed unpleasantly she was happy until you came and disturbed her poor brain her very clever brain contradicted the young man acidly pshaw major am i a fool that you should talk to me in this way whatever you may state to the outside world for the sake of your illegal income you know perfectly well that mavis is perfectly sane she is not would she have killed bellaria if sane oh you are trying to keep up that fiction also it is not fiction insisted rebb obviously in earnest i will admit that the girl's brain was stronger than i chose to tell anyone outside this room all the same i believe that weary of being shut up she tried to escape on that night bellaria came to stop her and mavis then must have stabbed her remember bellaria had geary's knife do you really believe this asked gerald quite puzzled i swear that i do come haskins let us talk plainly since there is no one to hear us don't you believe it yourself no i do not you if anyone killed bellaria why should i because you knew that i would take the girl away and marry her to put her presumed insanity beyond all doubt you murdered bellaria and placed the crime on the poor girl's shoulders in this way should she be found you secure her income for life since she cannot marry that would have been a clever thing for me to do said rebb in a quiet way but i had not the brains to conceive such a plot much less the cleverness to carry it out i might in a fit of rage kill a man capable of defending himself i certainly should never raise my hand to stab a defenceless woman whatever provocation i might have you were here about the time of the murder said haskins and he wrinkled his brow in perplexity rebb spoke very earnestly i was since mrs geary has let the cat out the bag i may as well confess and you will see how groundless your suspicions are it was long after ten o'clock when i left the devon maid and i took a lantern with me why did you go at all to search for your confounded canoe geary told me about it and so did bellaria who learned where it was hidden from mavis yes i told mavis well well i wanted to find it and break it up so that you should no longer get across the pool and climb the wall i walked over the hills and lost my way for a time it was close upon twelve o'clock when i got to the pool i searched for the canoe and could not find it i heard a shriek inside the grounds of this house and you went to see what it was not at the moment i knew that bellaria being always terrified for reasons you need not know pardon me i know all about the tna society rebb looked astonished but made no comment being too occupied in exonerating himself then you know that she suffered greatly from nerves and was afraid of being discovered and killed often she shrieked at night as mavis told me and at times when here late i heard her myself i therefore merely thought that bellaria was in one of her mad fits and went on searching about one o'clock i climbed the bank and crossing the stream by the bridge to leegarth i went to the gate of the pixy's house wondering if you had dared to come there after seeing me i found the gates opened and bellaria dead as i was stooping over the body geary came running from the house he said that he had followed me to tell about your shooting him in the arm and on finding bellaria's body he had gone to look for mavis she had vanished i searched the house also and could not find her i therefore came back to denleigh with geary making him promise to say nothing of our midnight visit why asked gerald straightly why echoed the major looking surprised when you were meddling with my affairs had you known of that visit at the time you would have denounced me to the police and i should have had great difficulty in clearing myself i held my peace and i tell you that i really believed as i believe now that mavis had stabbed bellaria so as to get her liberty why did you not believe that some emissary of the tna society had found out bellaria's hiding place and had killed her you mean venosta said rebb hurriedly well i own that after the first shock of surprise i did suspect venosta as mrs crosbie had shown me the coral hand and had told me the use she put it to did she know about the society asked gerald she declared that she was ignorant of its existence so she was but i knew about the society at naples fifteen or sixteen years ago when i rescued bellaria from its clutches no i don't believe venosta killed bellaria although he would have done so i am sure had he known where she was hiding but he did not and who could have told him not mrs crosbie although you mentioned bellaria's name and whereabouts confound you as mrs crosbie knew nothing of the tna society well haskins you must see now that i am innocent it looks like it i admit but everything fitted in so well with your plans that i naturally thought you guilty then you see that i am not snapped rebb much ruffled if i were would i confess my midnight journey to you seeing that mrs geary is about to make it public i think you would have had to in the long run retorted gerald sharply she mustn't do that muttered rebb still walking and becoming much agitated for he was beginning to realize his danger she will now that her husband can no longer terrorize her you are in a very awkward position my advice to you if you are really as innocent as you pretend to be is to search out mavis and hand over her income after all by the will you need not account for what you have spent up to date and you have had a long run for your money you say that because you want the income yourself i could do with it and when i marry mavis i shall certainly insist upon justice being done to her i would take her without a penny as you well know but i am not such a fool as to refuse six thousand a year along with a pretty clever wife well then find mavis and we shall see cried rebb quite out of temper and throwing himself into a chair for you to accuse her when she is found no thank you first i want to prove her innocence you will find that difficult not with your help major rebb grew violent damn you i say that i believe the girl may be innocent and surely i have exonerated myself i may think so but the public the public need never know anything about it see here haskins you love this girl and you seem to think that she is still alive good i make a bargain with you give me three thousand of this six thousand a year belonging to the durham estate and you can marry mavis quietly and take her to america or the colonies no one will think to find the notorious mavis durham in mrs gerald haskins thus everything will be settled and i can marry mrs crosbie as i greatly want to with a quiet heart what say you i refuse your offer said gerald calmly mavis shall have her character cleared and shall have nothing or all of her income rebb rose and snapped his fingers do your worst he said trying to suppress his anger find mavis and marry her but be prepared for me to have her condemned for bellaria's murder and shut up in an asylum i hope to prove her innocence said haskins quietly even if you do snarled rebb becoming reckless when he found himself so beset you may lose the money that is impossible it belongs to mavis to the real mavis gerald rose guessing that rebb referred to the other twin what do you mean by that rebb mavis has a sister yes you may look but charity bird is the real mavis or at least i can prove it to be so there is a likeness between the girls i admit said gerald pretending ignorance but it is ridiculous to say that they are sisters they are twin sisters sit down and i'll tell you all about it but that you can make so much mischief i should not say a word but when you know the truth for your own sake you may hold your tongue and give me half the income without a word haskins resumed his seat marveling at thus having been able to force rebb's hand without revealing his suspicions the major hastily swallowed another glass of claret and began to speak in a hurry i was in a goorkha regiment in india some twenty five years ago gerald interrupted i thought you were in a west indian regiment later later said rebb testily don't interrupt i exchanged to jamaica a few years later but in india i had a brother officer who was my greatest friend his name was julian durham and he had six thousand a year against my six hundred he was not very strong and always said that as he had no relatives he would make me his heir then he married a silly flirting girl with whom he quarreled and my hopes were thus dashed to the ground did you aid the quarrel asked gerald delicately yes replied rebb shamelessly the wife stood in the way of my getting a fortune from julian and i tried to part husband and wife i succeeded for more than a year after the marriage mrs durham went to bombay with the intention of living apart from her husband what a scoundrel you are rebb said haskins astonished at the cold blooded way in which the man recounted his villainy the major laughed harshly i only tell this to you and you don't matter he retorted outside if you say anything i shall deny all and who will believe you haskins however to continue we were stationed in the far north of india and i escorted mrs durham to bombay where she intended to embark for england at bombay she was taken ill and died giving birth to twins i didn't want a couple of girls on my hands as i knew that julian could not live long so i paid the nurse to take one of the children the eldest mind you to simla and to get rid of it somehow she sold it i believe to a juggler's wife and afterwards mrs pelham odin then on tour bought the child in calcutta to bring up that child is charity bird can you prove this yes be quite certain of that the ayah and the juggler's wife are still alive well then that disposed of one twin i brought the other back to the north of india to her father and she was christened mavis julian was very ill so made a will in my favor and in favor of his child i was to be her guardian and to enjoy the money until she married then i was to hand it over without accounting for what i had spent in this way julian hoped to satisfy me for his old promise to make me his heir and of course i agreed and you said nothing of the other twin no why should i one brat on my hands was enough afterwards julian came home to brighton and died it was at brighton that he made his will as you know i came back from india with mavis and to cut off all association with those who knew her and durham i exchanged into a west india regiment and took her to jamaica i sold out fifteen or sixteen years ago and brought the child here after a tour in italy it was in naples that i found bellaria she was a singer and had betrayed some man belonging to the tna society i don't know the exact story but she was in danger of death so i took her by stealth to devonshire and made her nurse to mavis and geary he was my servant in jamaica in devonshire at barnstaple he met with his wife and as i wanted someone to watch the pixy's house i established him at the devon maid making him a present of the freehold gerald rose and you paid for it out of mavis' money of course i did only you mistake the money doesn't belong to mavis until she is married she will be married to me the moment that i can find her said gerald grimly stalking to the door wait a bit called out rebb if you marry her without promising me the three thousand a year i shall prove the identity of charity and she will get the lot when she marries tod macandrew he's in love with her you know you will get left you cannot take the money from mavis her name is mentioned in the will said gerald coolly and tried the door which was locked i say open this confound you major rebb flung the key across the room and haskins fitted it into the lock before he could open the door rebb continued don't be a fool in your own interests haskins i shall swear that charity is mavis and your beloved will lose all you can scarcely do that in the face of the story you will have to tell mrs pelham odin and the juggler's wife and the ayah can prove that charity is the missing twin and i daresay mavis' baptismal certificate can be found her name in the will makes her the heiress then i'll tell about charity and prove her identity cried rebb starting furiously to his feet and she will at least get half i don't care if she does retorted gerald flinging open the door but you had better give the money to me and then i'll be silent as to charity being durham's daughter no major i don't care for your crooked ways i'll find mavis and marry her probably she will be quite willing to halve the income with her twin three thousand a year will be enough for her and for me good day major find some other man who is willing to become such a blackguard as you are rebb caught the decanter and slung it across the room it only crashed against the closed door and when rebb ran forward to pursue the man who flouted him he found the door locked on the outside chapter xxiii tod's discovery on returning to the silbury hotel gerald sat down to think over the important conversation with rebb to all appearances the master was as innocent as the man nevertheless according to the major geary had been to the pixy's house on the fatal night in spite of his denial on the face of it the negro had no reason to kill bellaria and rebb had sworn that the murder was neither committed nor prompted by him if this were so it appeared strange that rebb should have found geary not only in the grounds of the pixy's house but in the mansion itself when he arrived seeing that geary was thus first in the field it was not improbable that he had caught a glimpse of the assassin whether he had and had told his master it was of course impossible to say but haskins determined to have another interview with the landlord of the devon maid and force him to disclose the whole truth which he assuredly had not told in his wife's presence one important thing gerald had learned from rebb and that was the truth of his surmise regarding charity she was as he had always supposed the twin sister of mavis and haskins congratulated himself on guessing this before rebb had spoken out still it was just as well that rage had made the major thus candid and the matter was put beyond all doubt haskins was pleased also by the discovery as guided by him mavis would be quite willing to divide the income and then lady euphemia would not be angry at tod's runaway marriage so far everything was right but the mystery of the crime had still to be solved until it was mavis must continue not only to be an outcast and a fugitive from justice but must remain unable to claim her rights as julian durham's heiress apparently geary and rebb and signor venosta as an emissary of the tna society were all innocent if so who was the guilty person gerald wondered if the letter to which mavis had referred could be found as he firmly believed that it would afford a clue to the identity of the criminal in his own mind he constructed the manner in which the crime had been committed bellaria had received this mysterious letter which for some reason overcame her fears sufficiently to make her venture out at night to meet the writer of the letter she had opened the gates and then had been stabbed by her own knife geary's weapon which had been wrested from her in a hand to hand struggle the wonder was that the struggle had not attracted attention as it was rebb swore that he had heard only one scream and that might have been uttered by mavis when she found the dead body of the nurse bellaria therefore was in all probability slain unawares however it was useless to build up theories which were all moonshine so gerald resolved to wait until tod and arnold arrived according to macandrew's letter they would come to silbury early the next day so gerald had a good many hours to himself he had half a mind to see inspector morgan and learn all details concerning the inquest as some possible evidence might have been obtained likely to throw light on the darkness but haskins refrained from doing so as he did not wish to arouse morgan's suspicions and reopen the case for mavis' sake the quieter he moved in the matter the better it would be gerald wondered after hearing rebb's acknowledgment of charity's birth if he had any idea of the scheme by which the girls had been made to change places but after reflection he decided that it was impossible as mrs pelham odin had managed very cleverly also rebb was unaware that the twin he had got rid of was now mrs macandrew and since that young lady was at amsterdam there would be no chance of her being met by mrs berch and her daughter when in switzerland bearing in mind what mrs crosbie had told him of her projected tour abroad gerald was greatly surprised when he met the widow and her mother driving up the silbury high street from the railway station she saw him at once as he stood thunderstruck on the pavement and beckoned for him to come to the side of the landau you are surprised to see us here she said with a gay smile this is not switzerland is it you said nothing about coming down here yesterday he answered no because neither i nor my mother had any intention of coming it was this way gerald michael major rebb you know came in almost as soon as you had left and we told him all that had taken place why did you do that asked haskins imperatively don't bully gerald said mrs crosbie tartly i told michael because i have no secrets from michael and he was very angry that you should have spoken to me as you did i was perfectly polite permit me to remind you madge don't call me by my christian name she said as usual well then michael went away to have an explanation with you and later telegraphed to me that you had gone to devonshire and that he intended to follow at once he also asked us to come down that we might see the pixy's house as we intend to repair it when we marry do you indeed muttered haskins ironically of course said mrs crosbie with an airy flutter of her laces and i may tell you gerald that i came down the more willingly since i do not want you and michael to quarrel that is why we are here to see the house and to prevent a quarrel said gerald coolly i am greatly obliged to you for the trouble you have taken mrs crosbie but i have already seen the major mrs berch who had hitherto kept silence looked up sharply have you had a quarrel she demanded eagerly yes and no rebb was slightly difficult to deal with but we now understand one another mrs crosbie asked what about about various things answered haskins carelessly he was determined not to answer her questions as he had a vague idea that she was not so honestly his friend as she pretended to be and you parted amiably i hope said mrs berch haskins laughed as he remembered the parting and how he had locked rebb in the room i think that the major would gladly see me tarred and feathered he said lightly there cried mrs crosbie with a childish pout i knew you had quarreled and i did so wish you to be friends i want you to come to the pixy's house when i marry michael and see the improvements i have already arranged what to do have you been down here before then asked gerald astonished yes over two years ago michael asked me down when we were first engaged i saw that poor bellaria but not mavis why did you not see mavis because michael said her mental state was so sad that she might be dangerous she was shut up on the day i went over the house and as i was only there for an hour she knew nothing of my visit i and mother were stopping in the neighborhood it was when i was learning to drive a motor gerald i would have taken that poor girl out for drives as i got to know the country so thoroughly but it was too dangerous where did you stop asked gerald still lingering although mrs berch seemed inclined to cut short her daughter's chatter at a village miles away called belldown why do you start a mosquito stung me answered haskins readily but his real reason for starting was that belldown happened to be the place where mr arnold and tod were now stationed there are heaps of mosquitoes here mrs crosbie you will be stung ah well we are only here for a couple of days at the pixy's house that is i merely want to look round and now that the poor mad girl has gone i can explore at my leisure good day i wish i could ask you to come over but michael might object so stupid of you to quarrel with my future husband when we are such friends she gave the signal to the driver of the landau to move on and both she and her mother bestowed friendly smiles on the young man as he took off his hat gerald watched the carriage climb up the long street and vanish over the crest of the hill then he walked back again to the hotel wondering why mrs crosbie was so anxious to retain his friendship when she became mrs rebb he knew that madge was a flighty woman although much cleverer than she pretended to be and was sure that she had some reason for all this friendliness and chatter however he had more important things to think about than mrs crosbie's airs and graces and spent a wakeful night building up theories and knocking them down again by dawn he had arrived at the conclusion that geary was the criminal i expect thought haskins while taking his bath that geary found his hold over rebb was getting lax so he deliberately killed bellaria knowing that the major had gone to the pixy's house in the hope of getting blackmail by threatening to throw the blame of the murder on his master and by the murder he secured to rebb an income out of which large sums could be paid yes i really believe that geary will prove to be the guilty person but how am i to fix the crime on him this was a hard question to answer and gerald waited for the arrival of tod to put it to him since two heads are better than one the solicitor arrived at midday along with arnold having come from belldown so they explained by railway tod looked anxious and not so healthy as he had done in london but haskins put this down to the man's unavoidable fretting after his bride arnold had not changed in the least and appeared to be as tiny and gnome like as ever first and foremost the two men being hungry had dinner and then gerald conducted them both to the hotel drawing room a gorgeous apartment which had been placed at his disposal by mrs jennings for an extra pound on the bill having the apartment to themselves the three men saw that the door was closed and then sat down to talk gerald immediately asked the question which had been trembling on his tongue from the moment he set eyes on his friend in the first place tod he said impatiently what took you and arnold to belldown that is a long story said tod leisurely then tell it as shortly as you can one moment let us do things in order first let me know your doings here jerry but began haskins with irritation tod cut him short see here jerry said he firmly i am supposed to be your solicitor and it is my place to conduct the business i want things done in order first your story and then mine both will be extremely interesting i have no doubt gerald stared why should you think that i have anything to tell well observed macandrew jocularly a little bird mrs jennings by name whispered to me that two london ladies had come down on a visit to major rebb who is camping so to speak at the pixy's house yes mrs crosbie and her mother what of that i shall tell you when i have heard what you have to say about them arnold uttered a grunt and raked his long beard with lean fingers haskins looked from one to the other quite mystified has what you have to say anything to do with those ladies a great deal to do with them jerry a light broke in on haskins' clouded brain mrs crosbie said that she had stopped at belldown that is where you have been hum said tod glancing at arnold i didn't think she would have admitted so much tod gerald caught his friend's arm don't worry me with your hints and looks has mrs crosbie anything to do with this crime i can't say rejoined the solicitor stolidly and i shan't speak until you tell me how you got along with rebb haskins threw himself back in his chair and made the best of a scotsman's obstinacy i have something very important indeed to tell you he said seriously you know the likeness between the girls macandrew nodded i told mr arnold here all about it and about your idea of the two beings twins my idea has proved to be correct they are twins tod jumped up scattering his papers and with his red hair almost standing on end do you mean to say that rebb yes sit down toddy and listen said gerald vigorously and when his legal adviser became quiet he related the whole of the conversation with rebb well i'm blessed muttered tod rubbing his head when the narrative was ended what a wonderful thing there is something in your intuitions after all jerry i don't think it needed much intuition to guess at a possible relationship seeing how marvelously alike mavis is to charity the wonderful part consists in my getting rebb to give himself away ah said arnold significantly the military gentleman is beginning to see that the wheel of fortune is turning the wrong way with him and quite right too said tod meditatively what a scoundrel the man is to be sure well jerry important as what you have told us is i am more interested in the movements of mrs crosbie and her mother when you tell me about them i can explain what mr arnold and myself have discovered at belldown there is little to tell about them rebb came down after me and they came down after rebb he asked his future bride here to have a second look at her future home oh so she had been here before yes so she says some time ago this is her second visit her third more like muttered arnold in his beard we can't be sure of that said tod rapidly for heaven's sake tell me what you mean cried haskins jumping up in his turn my nerves are wearing thin with all this suspense well then began macandrew shuffling with his papers it's this way mr arnold here was going about the country in his caravan selling books and reached belldown on the same day that mavis fled mavis fled at night well well cried macandrew testily you know what i mean arnold was at belldown on the day of the night when mavis fled and the murder was committed is that plain enough yes go on toddy don't be a silly ass i am your solicitor just now and not your pal said tod with great dignity well then while wandering about belldown arnold saw two ladies in a motor car one was driving and one was being driven and they were mrs berch and her daughter whom we jerry supposed to be at bognor i never knew that mrs crosbie could drive a motor oh yes i taught her a trifle myself and she is quite an expert at the business she mentioned to day when i stood by her carriage how she had motored over every inch of the country but what was she doing down hereabouts when when she was supposed to be at bognor that is what i want to ask her and i am glad that she is on the spot gerald thought for a few moments how did you recognize these ladies mr arnold major rebb once showed me a colored photograph of the lady to whom he was engaged and i recognized mrs crosbie when she passed in her motor a severe looking old lady in black was with her and mr macandrew tells me that she is mrs berch the mother i may tell you that the two ladies wore motor goggles and veils then how did you recognize them asked gerald again mrs crosbie's veil was up as they passed and she pulled it down when she saw that i was looking earnestly at her the motor was going very slowly at the moment because a hay wain was in front blocking the road i see well what happened the motor went to the inn at belldown it was about six o'clock and the two ladies had dinner they were at the inn when i left belldown in my caravan on the way to leegarth where i hoped to rescue mavis yes yes yes cried tod impatient at the slow way in which arnold was speaking and late that night about ten o'clock he passed the motor on the road between belldown and leegarth it had broken down and mrs crosbie was tinkering with the machine i shouldn't think she could mend a broken motor tod oh i don't expect anything very serious was the matter probably her driving she drives furiously as a woman always does had put the gear out of order however arnold passed them and camped some distance outside leegarth so that the villagers who knew his face would not recognize him then some time after eleven he saw the motor coming along also skirting the village the two women were in it and he thought that they had lost their way and then again he fancied that mrs crosbie was going to the devon maid to see rebb at all events the motor passed out of sight in the darkness i may tell you that its lamps were not lighted so mrs crosbie ran the risk of police interference rather foolish i think seeing she did not want to be seen well well said gerald after a pause and what does all this mean arnold went on tod cautiously did not attach much importance to this motor car business but when he told me i fancied that mrs crosbie had to do with the murder i don't see how i do she didn't want to be recognized she had no lamps so that she could slip along easily and as we learned at belldown she did not return through the village if she did not come down to murder bellaria why was she in this neighborhood and why did she lie to you about bognor it's a mare's nest you have found tod mrs crosbie has no motive to murder bellaria and she certainly hasn't the nerve i'll ask her myself said tod rising come on over to leegarth chapter xxiv the second marriage in his anxiety to prove his theory tod would then and there have taken his friend and arnold over to the pixy's house but gerald more cool headed than the impetuous scotsman pointed out that he had not sufficient grounds upon which to accuse the widow if you ask her to explain her movements on that night she will only refuse to gratify your curiosity said haskins positively the police could make her speak the police could not arrest her without a warrant and there is not to my mind sufficient evidence to obtain a warrant and certainly the police cannot ask questions about anyone's private affairs until some reason can be given to show why such questions should be asked those ladies said that they were at bognor when they really intended to come to devonshire observed arnold who seemed to side entirely with macandrew it is a woman's privilege to change her mind mr arnold and i ask you what possible motive could mrs crosbie have had to journey all the way to devonshire to commit an unnecessary murder unnecessary snorted tod displeased seeing that the murder is ascribed to mavis who may thus be shut up to provide rebb with an income i cannot see that it is unnecessary ah but mrs crosbie did not know that the major's income depended upon the seclusion of mavis said haskins rapidly i did not tell her as there was no reason why i should and i am quite certain that rebb himself would not explain if mrs crosbie had known that his income was so uncertain she would have refused to marry him perhaps she will do so now said arnold hopefully no she has come down to see about the repairs to the pixy's house answered gerald and rebb loves her too well to let her go i believe tod that geary is the man who committed the murder it sounds plausible enough grumbled macandrew and a case could easily be built up against him but the presence of mrs crosbie on the spot has to be explained gerald rose and walked up and down the room thinking i tell you what tod he said abruptly i am getting tired of poking about in the dark i believe as you do and arnold does that mavis is entirely innocent hitherto we have kept her in hiding so as to prove her innocence since she may be arrested if she is discovered well then i think it would be best to let her be arrested both arnold and macandrew jumped up wrathfully what they exclaimed and tod continued what is the use of charity's sacrifice if you intend to hand over mavis to the law tod said gerald seriously as things stand now we are not able to force either geary or mrs crosbie or rebb to speak if mavis is put on her trial they can be called as witnesses and then the truth may come out also mavis can be examined by two doctors i shall insist upon that when her sanity will certainly he proved beyond all doubt if she is proved to be sane then rebb will find himself in queer street and will be hard put to it to prove his innocence we could have done all this in the first case said arnold irritably no replied haskins sharply for then we did not have the evidence to hand that we have now rebb geary and mrs crosbie are all implicated and we may also be able to place venosta in the witness box but the proof that mavis is responsible for her acts and has been shut up in the pixy's house while rebb enjoyed her income will gain the sympathy of everyone and will go far to show her innocence i shall support her throughout the case she is rebb's ward and is under twenty one said tod crossly so the major may not allow you to support her i propose to take her out of the major's keeping by making her my wife forthwith said gerald coolly but if you do sir cried arnold much upset mavis will be arrested indeed i doubt if you will find any clergyman who will marry her to you seeing that she is said to be a lunatic that's all right rejoined haskins easily i have arranged that in my own mind there is an old college chum of my late father's who can see both sides of the question and i can trust him utterly to day i am going to london to repeat your experience and get a special license toddy our marriages are expensive matters old boy aren't they tod grunted and kicked the carpet when you are married what do you intend to do i shall bring my wife down here within three days and we shall all go over to the pixy's house mrs crosbie will not have left by that time as from the quantity of luggage she brought i fancy she intends to remain for a week or so then we can confront her and rebb and if possible tod i wish you to bring geary on the scene thus all the actors in this tragedy of real life as mrs pelham odin would call it will be together and we can bring about the fall of the curtain with mrs gerald haskins in gaol said arnold gloomily mavis will be arrested on rebb's information at once that is highly probable but whether mavis appears early or late she will have to stand her trial seeing that she is accused also she will have to be examined as to her sanity but in both these ordeals i intend to be beside her as her husband there was a pause well it's a forlorn hope said macandrew hesitating and risky still he looked questioningly at arnold the little man nodded sadly things are so bad that they can scarcely be worse he remarked and certainly as mr haskins thinks a public trial would force the witnesses we want into court once in the box and closely examined the truth might come to light i think mr haskins should do as he says but it is a risk life is all risks said gerald cheerfully well i am going to pack up and clear off to london and you toddy i shall keep my eye on geary and if possible i shall see mrs crosbie or her mother gerald nodded and matters thus being arranged he went up to london that same afternoon en route for southend there to make mavis his wife tod and arnold left behind remained at the prince's hotel and wandered about the country even as far as leegarth they heard that the london ladies were still with the major but did not catch a glimpse of them and even tod audacious as he was shrank from going to the pixy's house and openly accusing the lively widow tod took occasion to pay a special visit to the devon maid and found the hotel in charge of a rough man and his slatternly wife it appeared that since mrs geary's disappearance her husband had taken heavily to drink and refused to attend to his business his uncivilized instincts had got the better of him and he was running wild in the neighborhood mrs geary now with her mother in barnstaple refused to return to him or to surrender her children and adonis talked loudly of forcing her stubborn will by law but as yet he had not done anything perhaps because he was in danger of the law himself tod learned as much from inspector morgan whom he met in the silbury high street on the third day after gerald's departure in search of a wife in the course of an idle conversation about this that and the other thing for macandrew during his holiday at the devon maid had learned to know morgan intimately the name of the negro was mentioned and the inspector uttered a grunt he's a black scoundrel that he remarked why asked tod pricking up his ears i always understood that geary was a meritorious inhabitant of denleigh he certainly conducted the devon maid well as i stopped there myself you know that morgan nodded things have changed since you and mr haskins were there sir he said slowly it was mrs geary who kept the inn respectable and a miserable life she had with that sooty blackguard but she got fed up with his brutality and went back to her mother in barnstaple since then the inn has gone from bad to worse and geary is drinking i heard something of this observed tod why don't you pull him up i am going to said morgan grimly i have my eye on him he is nearly always drunk and frightens children and insults women and threatens men sooner or later he will be locked up and the strength the man has why do you know mr macandrew that he knocked down the river wall of the pixy's house that portion overhanging the pool i wanted to run him in for that but major rebb will not prosecute for some reason he has a sneaking regard for his old servant i suppose said tod smiling but this wall morgan how the dickens could one man knock it down oh the wall has been in a shaky condition for years and years said the inspector it was only held together by the ivy the bricks and mortar were rotten but even then a good strong push would have sent it over and geary gave it that push he was climbing over i believe as he wanted mad with drink to get into the pixy's house and because of the ladies major rebb had ordered the gates to be closed and locked however he found that the wall leaned a trifle towards the cliff and managed to knock it down the man has an immense strength naturally and when drink is added to that morgan shrugged his big shoulders i have known drunken men do some wonderful things in the way of superhuman strength he finished i think geary must have been superhuman to have pushed that wall over rotten as it was if you remember mr haskins climbed it i remember and a good thing it was that it didn't fall and drop him into the pool below however it's down now and on that side the grounds of the pixy's house lie open to the world by the way how is mr haskins has he got over the death of that crazy girl tod laughed i don't think myself that she was crazy morgan or that she killed that wretched italian woman nor do i believe that she is dead and he looked straightly at the officer's red face have you any reason to think she is alive sir her body has not been found rejoined tod evasively what of that plenty of bodies are not found but the girl was never outside the pixy's house before that time she fled after the murder not knowing the lie of the country it is more than probable that she tumbled into some river or water hole and was drowned if alive she certainly would have been caught by now we have had constables all over the place for weeks even now well no the men have been withdrawn as so long a time has elapsed since the commission of the crime we'll hear no more of the matter never prophesy until you know mr inspector i do know said morgan positively i don't go about with my eyes shut mr macandrew and after saluting he stalked in a military way down the street leaving tod to pursue his shopping which tod had come out to do macandrew rather chuckled at the positive way in which this official dogberry who could see no further than his nose asserted that the pixy's house murder had been relegated to the past on the fourth day of gerald's absence tod received a letter from his friend in the character of a bridegroom everything had gone well as the clergyman on hearing the whole story told in haskins' persuasive manner had joined mavis and his friend's son in holy matrimony now rebb had lost his income as the conditions of the will had been fulfilled and in spite of all his precautions mavis had come into her own tod would have been less than human had he not reflected with great glee that the income being safe from rebb's clutches his wife as the twin sister of mavis would benefit to the extent of three thousand a year and lady euphemia called me a fool chuckled tod complacently what will she say when she knows that i have married an heiress and will be able to get back a part of the family estate in his letter gerald informed macandrew with great pride that mavis had learned how to sign her name and had produced a singularly fine specimen of calligraphy the rest of my darling's education wrote the young man will be completed by me after all these troubles are over and we can spend a proper honeymoon education as a means of passing a honeymoon did not commend itself to tod and he made a grimace then he sat down and wrote a letter to amsterdam telling charity to come over and repair to mrs pelham odin's london flat where he would join her later he also gave her a full account of all that had taken place and detailed the story of the major as to her birth mentioning also the income which mavis intended to hand over as soon as the mystery of the crime was solved when tod posted this letter he took his way to denleigh to see if he could find geary and arrange for him to appear at the pixy's house it was necessary as gerald had explained that all the actors in this drama should come together for the clearing up all perplexities but geary was not easy to be found afraid of the official warning uttered by morgan he had taken to the hills and although tod roamed all over the place he could not find the man he returned to the prince's head quite fatigued and found a telegram from gerald stating that he and his bride would be in silbury by the midday train next day macandrew communicated the joyful news to arnold who had come back from a round of bookselling for the gnome did not neglect his business even in these anxious days and the two had a merry little dinner on that same night prepared by mrs jennings' own hands and the landlady's cooking when she desired was something to be wondered at tod insisted on a bottle of champagne being sent for and the tutor and the lawyer drank long life and happiness to the bride and bridegroom with all honors although said tod setting down his glass we are not yet out of the wood an hour after dinner and while arnold was detailing his early connection with mavis mrs jennings came in much flustered oh sir she said here's that horrid black landlord of the devon maid he asks to see you sir i wouldn't if i were you he's always drunk and may be dangerous never mind i am not afraid show him up said tod valiantly mrs jennings shook her head but did as she was bidden and in a few minutes mr adonis geary looking a wreck of his former stalwart self came into the room however he was perfectly sober and very much depressed wanderings on the hills did not agree with him and he looked as one of his ancestors might have looked when cuban bloodhounds were hunting flesh and blood in the days of slavery you wish to see me sah said geary after a casual glance at arnold yes mr geary replied tod settling himself in his chair the fact is that things are coming to a climax and i want you to come to the pixy's house to morrow afternoon say at two o'clock to state what you know of bellaria's murder i doan't know noting sah said the negro doggedly mr haskins believes that you know everything retorted tod sharply and unless you want to get into trouble it will be best for you to speak out i doan't know noting said geary again and rolled his eyes ferociously at the mention of gerald's name and dere's noting can hurt me i hab sold de hotel and nex' week i go to jamaica as a pensioner of major rebb's i suppose dat's my business sah dis place no place for me when my wife go away wid my chill'n bellaria dead dat mad gal dead an' you are wrong in thinking that miss durham is dead mr geary said tod exploding his bombshell according to gerald's written instruction she is very much alive geary staggered and turned his usual green she alive yes and married to mr gerald haskins you can tell the major that if you like mr geary and tell him also that we are all coming over to morrow to demand the six thousand a year which major rebb has held for so long i fear that your jamaican pension is not very safe geary stood dumfounded clutching his breast his dull brain could scarcely grasp the significance of this speech but he did grasp the fact that rebb was losing the money and that he mr adonis geary would not benefit i tell de major he faltered wheeling by all means said tod easily i sent for you to be my messenger come geary as rebb loses the money you had better come on our side and tell us who murdered bellaria the negro turned at the door and drew himself up no sah he declared with something of majesty i eat de major's bread and i no betray de major after which speech he went out abruptly does that mean rebb is guilty tod asked arnold i always said that he was rejoined the ex tutor dryly and later the two retired to their several couches to ponder over the new problem the bride and bridegroom duly arrived the next day tod was slightly uneasy since geary had probably told the major and that gentleman would undoubtedly for his own safety take steps to have mrs haskins arrested however geary had probably not delivered the message that mavis was alive for no officer of the law appeared to break the joy of the meeting mavis looked slightly pale but her courage was high and she evidently determined to go bravely through the ordeal united to her adored prince gerald she was ready to face anyone and anything by his side after greetings and explanations and a hurried meal the whole party drove over to leegarth in a landau for the momentous meeting as the carriage passed through the village mavis kept her veil down so she was not recognized the gates of the pixy's house marvelous to relate were open and the carriage drove up to the house major rebb with two ladies was on the terrace mavis alighted and raised her veil great heavens cried rebb pale with terror mavis durham mrs gerald haskins she replied proudly and i come for my money chapter xxv geary's accusation it would be hard to say who was the palest and most terror stricken of the trio who stood on the terrace mrs crosbie clung to her stern mother with dilated eyes shaking like a reed but mrs berch although stern and unmoved outwardly at least was also pallid as for rebb he leaned against the balustrade of the terrace scarcely able to speak before him stood tod and arnold gerald haskins and the girl whom he had treated so cruelly the girl whom he had believed until now was at the bottom of some rural stream the hour of retribution had come and in a flash the guilty man saw everything he possessed reft from him saw also the structure of crime and falsehood he had reared crumble into dust his worst enemy would have pitied the major in that hour of agony you he faltered staring at mavis as though she were indeed the ghost he almost believed her to be you ah murmured macandrew complacently so geary did not deliver my message to you after all geary the major stood erect braced for the coming struggle and his face hardened did geary know this and he pointed to mavis i told him the truth last night and he never told me he never warned me rebb clenched his fists oh the scoundrel i might have but there it is too late too late what do you mean by too late said mrs berch imperiously and throwing a protecting arm round her daughter fight for madge if you will not for yourself but rebb paid no attention to her geary geary he muttered looking round with bloodshot eyes he was in the courtyard an hour ago and he did not tell me curse him he may be geary geary he raised his voice to an angry cry and ran swiftly along the terrace through the arch and into the quadrangle gerald took the hand of his wife and followed quickly with tod and the ex tutor behind they did not wish to lose sight of rebb for one moment mrs berch and her daughter looked at one another and madge hung back trembling but the mother suddenly seized the widow's wrist and dragged her a miserable figure pale faced and shaking in her gay attire into the quadrangle we must see what michael will do whispered mrs berch passing her tongue over her dry lips he may win the day yet no no moaned mrs crosbie he is lost at the far end of the quadrangle gerald and mavis saw the token of geary's drunken handiwork a considerable portion of the ivy clothed wall had fallen outward and lay in ruins on the lip of the cliff three or four trees had been dashed into the pool below and there was a clear view across the ruddle to the green forest beyond the mystery of the enchanted castle was at an end and no longer a palace of the sleeping beauty it lay open to the world as morgan had said and now in its romantic quadrangle there were sterner doings than the moonlight wooings of lovers who had for the moment recalled the golden age when the gods came down to men geary geary shouted rebb rushing towards the fallen wall and mounting its ruins there was no response and gerald fancied that rebb had merely made an excuse so as to get near the river and throw himself in but guilty or innocent the major was sufficiently brave to face the sins he had committed and came down again slowly to the group near the battered sundial he was still livid but more self controlled i shall deal with geary later he said thickly in the meanwhile i can deal with you we are quite ready said gerald tranquilly who are we questioned rebb scathingly myself and my wife she is not your wife a marriage with a madwoman is not legal mavis shuddered and clung to gerald's arm it was the first time that she had been called mad to her face oh guardian she wailed how can you say that of me when i was so fond of you you had every reason to be fond of me said rebb harshly and his eyes gleamed as he thought the girl was weakening i gave you a happy home in this delightful place because your brain was not strong enough to bear the troubles of this world mavis withdrew her hand from gerald's arm and looked scornfully at the liar whom she now saw in his true colors you kept me here that you might enjoy the money which my father left to me she declared in haughty tones you betrayed the trust your dead friend placed in you i was a weak girl and an ignorant one to believe in your lies but now she added stepping forward a pace now major rebb and her use of the name showed the attitude she intended to adopt i call upon you to give me back my money and leave this place which belongs to me no madwoman can possess money said mrs crosbie shrilly she saw the major's income was about to be lost and that it would be useless to marry him michael call the police and have her removed one moment said gerald quietly you go too fast mrs crosbie but i am glad to see you at last as you really are i thought you were my friend i now see that you are my enemy my wife is perfectly sane and as her husband i shall see that her sanity is proved call the police call the police cried mrs crosbie furiously and she broke from her mother's grip how dare you stand there and insult me gerald i was your friend and i will be your friend still if you will shut up that girl and apologize tod laughed at the weakness of this speech if you cannot find anything better to say mrs crosbie you had better hold your tongue he said caustically even if mrs haskins is shut up the money still belongs to her husband major rebb has lost that for ever it is the money you are after madam yes it is yes it is said mrs crosbie utterly reckless and defying the efforts of her mother to keep her silent if you knew the miserable years of poverty i have had you would not wonder at my wishing for the money my marriage with michael will save me from shame and misery and and she choked with mingled terror and rage and mrs berch pulled her back roughly are you a fool to talk like this she muttered hold your tongue you silly child she shook her angrily wait until michael settles this affair major rebb she turned inquiringly to her proposed son in law i shall settle this affair very speedily said rebb walking across the lawn towards the archway my man shall go for the police or better still that coachman who drove you from silbury mavis shall go back to bring inspector morgan i am very sorry that you have thrust yourself into danger but i should not be doing my duty by society if i did not have you imprisoned as a lunatic asked mavis scornfully she had quite lost her old dread of the major by this time as a murderess he retorted prove that said haskins stepping in rebb's path out of my way growled rebb looking dangerous you have brought a serious accusation against my wife persisted the young man and i intend to make you prove it on what grounds do you say that my wife is crazy she has been all her life said the major forced to answer for he saw very plainly that haskins would knock him down if he attempted to pass the archway not that the major feared a fight but his situation was so desperate that he wished to adjust things as quietly as possible his threat to call the police was bluff as gerald knew and because gerald did know rebb was furious prove that she has been mad all her life said haskins coolly mavis has been with mrs pelham odin since she left here and that very clever old woman cannot see that my wife is mad nor can macandrew nor arnold nor anyone else i can i can cried mrs crosbie with a bright red spot burning on either cheek and looked very angry ah you are a prejudiced witness seeing that you wish to marry major rebb for the income he is now losing that he has lost interposed tod in a dry legal tone the conditions of julian durham's will have been fulfilled and mrs haskins now takes possession of her property how can you prove that my wife is mad asked gerald again and taking no notice of the interruption have you had her examined by two doctors according to law no replied rebb grudgingly then how dare you shut her up in this house i shall bring an action against you on behalf of my wife for false imprisonment you had better think twice before you do that said the major in icy tones for i shall retort with an accusation of murder you say that my wife murdered bellaria i do said rebb doggedly i swear to it i dare say but you have yet to prove your accusation i am quite willing to allow mavis to be arrested gerald stepped aside go and fetch the police rebb they will be here soon here rebb started and turned a shade paler i left instructions at the police station before coming here that inspector morgan was to come with two men when they arrive you can give mavis in charge and then we can submit your accusation of insanity to a couple of doctors and your charge of murder to a jury then cried mrs crosbie viciously michael will get back his money i think not replied gerald coldly i take charge of that by this time the courage was oozing out of rebb who had not expected the young man to take up such an attitude cannot we arrange this matter quietly he asked trying to appear composed no said the other quietly the offer you made me in yonder room does not suit me an offer said mrs berch in her deep voice i offered to let haskins marry mavis and take her to america if he or rather she surrendered half the income i refuse as gerald refused said mavis proudly i prefer to stand my trial i am not going to pass the rest of my life under a cloud for your sake major rebb your sister your twin sister shall get the money cried rebb at his wits' end how to deal with the situation ah you never knew that i knew when gerald told me said mrs haskins composedly and i more than suspected it before indeed charity allowed me to pass as herself so as to save me from you i shall repay that with three thousand a year my husband and i have arranged that you passed as charity cried rebb amazed yes i danced at the belver theatre and it's a lie you couldn't what became of charity if you did that charity was with me said tod stepping forward with you yes as my wife major rebb jumped and staggered against the sundial so both the sisters are married he muttered they are said tod and they have agreed to share the income you have held all these years i am afraid that the game is up major rebb said nothing the game was indeed up and he did not know which way to turn or how to get the better of his pitiless opponents mrs berch left her daughter for the moment and touched his arm why did you not tell me that there was another girl she asked hoarsely and savagely there was no need and the major shook her off there was every need you told me you told madge that your income depended upon mavis durham mavis haskins if you please interpolated that young lady mrs berch paid no attention on mavis durham not marrying you said that if in some way her insanity could be proved and she could be stopped from marriage that your income would be safe for that reason my daughter wished to marry you she loved me said rebb unsteadily and looked at mrs crosbie i loved you as well as any other man she said coolly and shrugging her shoulders but i would have married anyone to escape from debt and duns and hideous poverty as you are now poor of course i cannot marry you come mother there is nothing more to be got here let us go back to our misery rebb said nothing but turned very white the woman for whom he had sold his soul was ready to cast him aside like an old glove mrs crosbie with a vicious glance at mavis and a look of indifference at the man she had professed to love took her mother's arm mrs berch was quite ready to go and indeed seemed to be in a hurry to depart but the path of the two was blocked by the tiny figure of arnold who had hitherto held his peace so you did know that the major's income depended upon mavis being prevented even by the murder of bellaria from marrying what is that to you let me pass cried mrs crosbie haughtily we arnold waved his hand to include gerald and tod we thought that you were ignorant and so could not guess what was your motive for murdering that unfortunate woman murder mrs crosbie went a dead white and became as rigid as a corpse rebb started and came forward you must be mistaken he said in shaking tones to arnold he is a foul liar said mrs berch grasping her daughter to keep her from falling let us pass sir no said arnold still holding his ground and speaking loudly while the others kept silence when inspector morgan comes you shall be arrested i shall give you in charge for this murder of which mrs haskins is wrongfully accused mrs crosbie shrieked looking a pitiable spectacle of fear and shame as she clung to her mother but that stern lady although white and also terrified controlled her feelings with iron nerve on what grounds do you accuse my daughter she demanded i saw you and her in a motor car at belldown i saw you on the way here you were at the gates of the pixy's house shortly before twelve o'clock waiting for bellaria whom you lured to the gate by means of a letter i was at bognor i was at bognor cried mrs crosbie shaking with fear no interposed tod my clerk went to watch you at bognor neither you nor mrs berch went there at all you were down here come mrs crosbie you may as well confess we can prove all about the motor car and your presence here madge madge cried rebb who looked horrified is this true but mrs crosbie only clung sobbing to her mother being terrified almost to death at the same moment that rebb spoke inspector morgan with a couple of policemen entered the quadrangle and advanced towards the group you wanted me here mr haskins he asked inquiringly i got your message and here i am with my men what is it in the first place said gerald quietly allow me to present to you my wife then when morgan saluted in a puzzled way he continued once known as mavis durham what morgan grew red and his eyes almost started out of his head do you mean to say that this lady is mavis durham mavis haskins now said the girl with a perfectly calm smile and i surrender myself to you willingly i arrest you in the king's name for murder gabbled morgan trying to recover his official dignity anything you say now will be used in evidence against you and he signed to his subordinates likewise startled out of their wits to take charge of the girl arnold sprang forward as a young constable placed his hand on mavis' arm stop he cried mrs haskins is innocent here is the guilty woman and he pointed to mrs crosbie no no you can't prove that you dare not you i can prove it cried arnold bluffing mrs crosbie was at the gate of the pixy's house at the time bellaria dondi was murdered a dozen witnesses can swear that she was in the neighborhood is this true morgan asked the little widow whose gaiety was all gone and who suddenly looked twice her age it is not true it is not true she cried mother and i were at belldown we went on to see major rebb at denleigh hush you fool muttered mrs berch shaking her you never came near me there cried rebb and then became aware that on the impulse of the moment he had ruined the widow in a paroxysm of shame and terror for the man did love the miserable woman he added mrs crosbie is innocent i swear she is i know who is guilty you everyone cried out inspector morgan loudest of all the scene was beyond his comprehension and he was on the verge of an apoplectic fit the whole scene was melodramatic and unreal and on the stage or when written in a book would have been described so by critics who is guilty demanded morgan fiercely geary adonis geary said rebb the knife was his and i found him in the grounds when i arrived there was a savage shout before he could finish and geary sprang from behind the ruined river wall he had been concealed there and had heard everything but he did not appear until his adored master accused him of the crime then terror and rage made him leap forward half mad and half drunk you say one big lie sah he shouted with rolling eyes and a thick voice i lubbed you once but now you would kill me with a lie i tell who did kill dat poor bellaria who killed her asked gerald for morgan was too bewildered to ask geary looked slowly round and pointed to mrs berch oh mother mother cried mrs crosbie i would have saved you if i could chapter xxvi the gods are just there was an absolute silence for a few moments what with one accusation and another inspector morgan's brain was reeling gerald could only stare in blank amazement at the negro who declared so positively that mrs berch was guilty of a cowardly murder as for the accused woman she put aside her weeping daughter gently and faced the police boldly tod and rebb and arnold were silent out of sheer astonishment haskins had thought geary guilty arnold had believed rebb to be the doer of the deed tod deemed that mrs crosbie had struck the blow but not one of the three ever fancied that mrs berch was the mysterious assassin of the unfortunate italian ask this man said mrs berch harshly to morgan and pointing towards geary ask him on what grounds he makes such an accusation my daughter and i certainly were at belldown and drove on past leegarth intending to call on major rebb at the devon maid but our car broke down and we were obliged to stop in a cottage for the night i can prove an alibi if you can said morgan finding his tongue why should your daughter say that she would have saved you if she could my daughter is mad with terror said mrs berch stonily madge knows that i am wholly innocent and she looked at mrs crosbie yes yes yes whispered the widow faintly we stopped the night in a cottage we are innocent my mother can prove an alibi dat one big lie cried geary with scorn you would like de major to say dat i killed bellaria oh yis and i wud be hanged sah he turned reproachfully towards his master who had been willing to sacrifice him for another after his years of faithful service you very wicked massa i lub you i do all bad tings for you but i no die dis woman he pointed to the perfectly calm mrs berch who was much the most composed of the group she come here an' kill bellaria she write a letter sayin' dat if bellaria come to de gate late she wud be safe from dos who would kill her and bellaria she comes wid my big knife to save herself den dis woman he pointed again at mrs berch she stab and stab and stab it is all utterly false denied the accused woman coldly do you believe this of your mother's friend gerald no said the young man generously there must be some mistake i cannot believe that mrs berch would be so wicked her known character contradicts this man's accusation i believed that geary murdered bellaria himself at major rebb's instigation that's a lie said rebb in an agitated voice dat one big lie repeated geary in his own vernacular and fumbled in his breast pocket see massa he went towards morgan dis de letter dat i find in bellaria's dress and mrs crosbie made a bound and a grab but morgan whisked the letter out of geary's hand and held it above her head one of the policemen caught the widow to hold her back and she burst into tears is this your writing madam morgan asked mrs berch holding the letter before her no said mrs berch in an unshaken voice mr haskins knows my writing well gerald look at the letter the young man took the epistle it was evidently disguised handwriting clumsy and illiterate he could not reasonably say that mrs berch had penned the few lines which asked bellaria to come to the gates of the pixy's house at midnight on a certain date to meet a well wisher so the letter was signed who could save her from the tna society the script was quite unlike mrs berch's sloping italian hand which was that of the mid victorian epoch no he said and very gladly i don't think that mrs berch wrote this letter ah the woman drew a long breath but displayed no triumph of course mr inspector the charge is absolutely absurd this mad girl whom mr haskins has married murdered the miserable creature ah said gerald slipping his arm round mavis who shivered and hid her face you return evil for good mrs berch morgan took the letter and placed it in his pocket i don't know what to think he muttered you may be innocent and geary he glanced at the savage face of the negro who shouted wrathfully i no kill dat woman he cried stamping like a wild bull in a rage she write de letter i come to dis house to find de major and i find bellaria dead she just dying did she speak mavis asked the question no she no speak she die at once i look in de dress and i find dat letter and dis geary opened his huge black palm and on it lay the coral hand with the dagger dat on de ground near de dress he ended do you recognize this asked morgan turning to gerald while mrs crosbie uttered a wail of fear and mrs berch became even paler than she had been gerald had defended mrs berch before and she had returned his kindness by accusing mavis he determined to leave her to her fate since she was so ungrateful especially as he readily recognized the coral hand so you did not give it back to venosta after all he said to the terrified mrs crosbie mr inspector this amulet belongs to he was about to say the name when mrs berch after a glance of despair around interrupted it belongs to me she said harshly not to my daughter mrs crosbie received it from signor venosta but she gave it to me to return to him after she made use of it to control the jew moneylender i did not return it to signor venosta i she stopped it was found near the corpse of bellaria by this man said morgan gravely so if it belonged to you it hers it hers shouted geary how do you know asked rebb sharply i see dis woman in dat engine he meant the motor car on de hill when i leave bellaria dead i run out to see where anyone was dat kill bellaria and i see dat woman wid dis odder in dat engine but you came running from the house cried rebb you could not let be said mrs berch evidently recognizing that denial was useless no doubt he did see me but i am guilty and mrs crosbie is perfectly innocent then you killed the woman cried gerald appalled yes but not intentionally listen from you we learned something about this girl and then my daughter and i were here on one occasion and knew something beforehand about the matter we forced major rebb to explain as the girl was supposed to be pretty she cast a disdainful glance at mavis and my daughter was a trifle jealous when you gerald came asking madge to take charge of this girl i took alarm as i thought that something serious was the matter you did said rebb bitterly and you forced me to tell you the truth of how my income depended upon mavis never getting married but i did not expect you to kill bellaria so as to save the income i did not do so for that purpose said mrs berch steadily madge and i were in despair as only her marriage with you could save us from terrible trouble when gerald explained about bellaria's fear of the coral hand i learned its purport from signor venosta then i thought that i could use it to bend bellaria to my will what was your will asked tod who looked awestruck to insist that bellaria should take mavis to italy and keep her there so as to prevent her marrying then i knew that major rebb's income would be safe and that madge could marry and take us both out of the horrible misery we endured trying to keep up appearances on nothing on nothing cried haskins suddenly beyond a hundred a year madge and i were penniless said mrs berch coolly but you lived in style said rebb who seemed to be thunderstruck by these sordid revelations oh we are only a couple of adventuresses said mrs berch ironically we deceived everyone even gerald's mother who was as kind and good a woman as ever breathed don't muttered the young man softly i am only praising the dead said mrs berch stolidly i say no evil of her well then we were in desperate straits else i never would have hit on the desperate scheme of getting bellaria to kidnap mavis which was what it amounted to i told madge nothing save that i wanted to see major rebb we informed gerald that we were going to bognor and we really were going but by my plan we came to devonshire and madge got one of her friends to lend her a motor she drives excellently and as we were at belldown before she knows the country i pretended that major rebb was at the pixy's house and had arranged to see me at midnight this i told my daughter and you believed so ridiculous a story said morgan fixing an official eye on the shrinking woman but she only moaned leave her alone i am to blame said mrs berch sharply and the murder of bellaria was pure accident pure accident muttered arnold ironically mrs berch turned on him with a wintry smile yes sir the car broke down that was really an accident while madge was seeing what was the matter i said that i would walk on and inquire if major rebb was at the house and could take us in for the night i came to the gates and waited for a time bellaria came at length she opened the gates in fear and trembling and was armed with a large yellow handled knife dat my knife muttered the negro and rolled his eyes i explained who i was and told her about the marriage i said that i could put venosta as representing the society on her track unless she took mavis to italy and kept her single i promised her a pension but the foolish creature mrs berch shrugged her shoulders would listen to nothing she refused to go to italy saying that she would be killed there i showed her the coral hand and she tried to snatch it from me we struggled and she lost her head saying that i had come to kill her once she wounded me in the arm here mrs berch rolled up her sleeve and showed a newly healed scar of considerable dimensions so i tried to take the knife from her then then said morgan speaking for the others who were all tongue tied and staring at the terrible recital mrs berch put a slim hand to her head i don't know exactly what took place she said wearily and indifferently but somehow i got the knife and in the struggle in the darkness i stabbed her to the heart when she fell i was terrified at what i had done and flung the knife into the long grass the coral hand had long since fallen to the ground then i ran away back to the car i found madge had repaired the damage which was slight she saw blood on my dress i told a lie and we got into the car to fly on the hill yonder she pointed over the ruined wall towards denleigh the car went wrong again then it was that we saw a man come running up it was geary but madge started the car and we managed to get away i was not sure if he recognized us you you said geary with a grin in de lamp i saw you when i come to town wid my massa but i say noting till my massa want to hang me i come back and look for dis gal in de house i had fled by that time with arnold said mavis faintly is that all asked morgan formally turning to mrs berch what else would you have she asked did your daughter know of she knew nothing i only knew that my mother had accidentally killed bellaria cried mrs crosbie foolishly i made her tell me because of the blood you idiot said the mother between her teeth then said morgan officially i must arrest you both but i am innocent shrieked mrs crosbie you are an accomplice after the fact said morgan come he laid a heavy hand on mrs crosbie's shoulder she started away with a terrible cry rebb flung himself forward to save her morgan grappled with him and mrs berch tried to snatch her daughter out of the way the others were too startled to move mrs crosbie who was mad with fear tore herself from the grasp of mrs berch and ran towards the ruined wall in the vain hope of escaping save me help me i won't go to prison i am innocent innocent in deadly terror she scrambled over the fallen wall geary ran forward to stop her from escaping while morgan still fought with the major and the two policemen were trying to help their superior on seeing the negro run after mrs crosbie the mother silent and savage moved swiftly across the grass in pursuit she did not run but she glided so rapidly that in a moment as it seemed she was over the ruins of the wall and on the verge of the cliff along with madge the negro she pushed aside as the others came running up she cried out madge let us die together and before mrs crosbie knew what was in her mother's mind she had leaped into the deep pool holding her dearly loved daughter for whom she had sinned so deeply there was a loud splash the agonized scream of mrs crosbie and then silence six months later a happy young couple were in the drawing room of a handsome house in kensington with them was mrs pelham odin looking more stately and graceful than ever she had established herself on the sofa in her regulation attitude and mavis was seated in a low chair beside her gerald stood with his back to the fire smoking and looked extremely happy his happiness was reflected in the face of his young wife and mrs pelham odin presided over the joint enjoyment like a fairy godmother you are both looking splendid she said in her deep clear voice and i am glad to see you both after your sojourn abroad but do you think it was kind to leave england without seeing me mavis caught the two hands of the old actress no it was not kind i said that it was not kind but gerald gerald said that it was necessary said that young man coolly dear mrs pelham odin look at the circumstances there was the inquest on the bodies of those two poor women who drowned themselves in the peace pool in mother carey's peace pool i thought that mrs berch dragged her daughter to death so she did admitted gerald quickly mrs crosbie would have been arrested as an accomplice after the fact and in any case would have sunk into poverty without her mother to help her mrs berch of course thought she would be hanged although seeing how she swore that the crime was accidental extenuating circumstances might have been found i suppose mrs berch who was frantically fond of her daughter thought it best they should go together madge certainly would have lived poor soul in spite of all her misery as she loved life but mrs berch pulled her down and they are buried in leegarth cemetery beside bellaria said mavis with a shiver how strange the punishment of providence my dear said mrs pelham odin rebukingly the murderess was laid beside her victim a wicked woman no said gerald throwing up his hand don't call her that but she murdered i believe that the crime really was committed accidentally and as she and poor madge have paid for their sins let us leave them to god mrs pelham odin who are we to judge and as was revealed at the inquest those two women had suffered much misery and trouble i wonder how they managed to deceive the tradesmen for so long said the old actress musingly i am sure my tradesmen always make me pay every month but look at the thousands they owed and it would all have been paid had mrs crosbie married the major i daresay with mavis' six thousand a year i have only three thousand said mrs haskins charity has the rest mrs pelham odin kissed the girl's forehead you behaved in a noble way my dear i hear that lady euphemia has quite taken to charity now that she knows her father was a devonshire durham and tod has got back his ruined castle to play the laird he says however that he is coming back from scotland to work again at the law and quite right he is said gerald sitting down i don't believe in any man being lazy lady euphemia wants tod to play the laird on his wife's money but tod has too much respect to live on his wife i know you have said mavis looking at him fondly you don't know how difficult it is to make him take money she added turning to the actress he will live on his own income and works like a nigger not like geary if he is the nigger in question my dear mavis this house is yours and i you're going to say that you are a boarder stop and mavis laid a pretty hand over his mouth gerald kissed it you are both extremely silly said mrs pelham odin share and share alike money and love and sentiments and everything right said haskins playfully mavis darling give me back that kiss i came here said mrs pelham odin in her most dignified way to welcome you back from the continent so i must be attended to and you did leave england after the trial without seeing me gerald rose and became serious i did so to save my wife from an attack of brain fever he said gravely think of what that trial meant to a girl who had never faced such a throng of people oh gerald there was the belver theatre i am sure the people in the court were a better audience said mrs pelham odin using her fan and after all the trial was a mere form you were proved to be quite sane by those two nice doctors and perfectly innocent when the evidence was given as to mrs berch's verbal confession i read all about it in the papers you were made quite a heroine mavis and as i like heroines i expected you to come and tell me all about it instead of which added the actress returning to her grievance you went quietly to the continent to switzerland said haskins slipping his arm around mavis' waist there we passed a happy time and mavis recovered from the shock of all these dreadful things we never talk of them now i am very sorry to said mrs pelham odin obstinately but i must know what has become of everyone major rebb i understand is in south america yes he could not face the court and so he bolted no one went after him as of course he knew nothing about the murder and mavis did not prosecute him for his behavior to her geary that terrible uncle tom's cabin person he ran away also i expect he is with rebb now i must say rebb did not treat him well trying to fix the guilt on him perhaps he's given rebb the go by on that account and is now in jamaica with another wife where is his english one in barnstaple with her coffee colored children mavis allows her a small income i am so sorry for her said mrs haskins apologetically i am sorry for anyone who is unhappily married well you and charity have married good men but poor men said gerald smiling mrs pelham odin shook her fan at him i could mention the continent again she said smiling but as it was necessary that mavis should have peace and quiet after all her trials poor dear i forgive the apparent rudeness what are you going to do now we are going to repair the pixy's house and live there mrs pelham odin gave a little scream then don't ask me to come and see you two murders for mrs berch murdered her daughter as well as that poor italian woman and three corpses ugh why the house will be haunted not at all said gerald tartly we can live there with a clear conscience and the evil influence of the place will depart when good people dwell there meaning yourself my dear boy how modest i was rather thinking of mavis with her pure mind and there there mrs pelham odin got rather restive as she didn't like to hear any woman but herself complimented you are a six months' old husband i shall be a lover all my life and gerald kissed his wife my fairy prince and mavis kissed gerald mrs pelham odin cast her eyes up to the ceiling quite like romeo and juliet without the limelight she said in a fatigued tone well you must come to me before going to devonshire charity macandrew and her husband are coming i want to give a dinner party and introduce you two girls to all sorts of delightful people at a reception to follow everyone is delighted with the romantic story i daresay they are said gerald crossly the papers have made far too much of the matter i daresay they wouldn't have done so had it not happened to be the dull season said mrs pelham odin consolingly of course there have been romantic accounts and portraits of the girls and all that but i have not seen what the newspapers call the sealed message do you mean the phonograph record which mavis sent me yes only she didn't send it to you she sent it to anyone who happened to fish it up tod did that but the message was sent to me nothing happens by chance mrs pelham odin so oh dear me here comes your occult stuff tod told me all about it i don't like such deep subjects the message we have it said mavis rising and going to a side table on which stood a jekle co phonograph gerald and i often turn on the machine to hear the message which brought us together while she fitted the tube on to the machine mrs pelham odin yawned it was very clever of you to use a phonograph since you couldn't read or write i hope you are less ignorant now i am getting on very quickly gerald teaches me every day you conjugate the verb to love i suppose what's that gerald raised his finger the message which mavis sent me sent anyone muttered mrs pelham odin obstinately but she listened this to the wide world babbled the machine in the sweetest and most melodious of voices this to the fairy prince who will come and waken me from dreams come dear prince to the pixy's house and watch that the jealous ogress who guards me does not see you i cannot read i cannot write but i talk my message to you dear prince to the stream i commit the message on this first day of april in this year five may the river bear the message to you dear prince come to me come to me come to me and waken your princess to life with a kiss the machine stopped for gerald laid a hand on it that he said solemnly is the sealed message as i thought said mrs pelham odin in her lively tones it might have been sent to the man in the moon instead said mavis kissing her husband to the dearest fairy prince on earth which has none outside pantomimes ended mrs pelham odin determined to have the last word she managed to do so for the husband and wife were kissing one another the end
